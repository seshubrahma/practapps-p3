That is what Preet Bharara, the   and highly charismatic US attorney for the Southern District of New York, claims that President Trump did to him, and Bharara is plenty angry about it. The US attorney for the Southern District of New York occupies one of the most powerful seats of prosecutorial power in the United States, second only to that occupied by his nominal boss, the attorney general of the United States, Jeff Sessions.   Even presidents and attorney generals tread lightly when dealing with the powerful Southern District prosecutor given its storied history as an institution of impeccable integrity. It is staffed by some of the nationâ€™s most talented lawyers who have resigned from lucrative jobs at prestigious law firms to  perform the public service of prosecuting the rich, powerful and politically connected in the media center of the United States and the world.
