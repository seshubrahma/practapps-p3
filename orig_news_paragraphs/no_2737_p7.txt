(FX) The direct heir to "Breaking Bad" may be "Better Call Saul," but this 1980s spy drama also has a claim to that legacy. It uses a story of double lives (  Soviet spies) to create a sense of impending doom, with the added twist that its married protagonists are acting out of idealism, however misguided, not greed or bitterness. Itâ€™s a   view of a Cold War chess match that has deep sympathy for the pawns.
