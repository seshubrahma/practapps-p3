Emails released by Wikileaks show the Democratic National Committee (DNC) colluding to ensure that Clinton gained an advantage in the primaries over insurgent Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ). The scandal forced the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who will gavel the convention in and out but otherwise be "quarantined" in Philadelphia, and who will leave her post at the end of proceedings, to be replaced by former CNN commentator and Clinton administration veteran Donna Brazile. The slogan "Love Trumps Hate" is one of the Clinton campaignâ€™s messages, and adorns some decorations at the convention. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
