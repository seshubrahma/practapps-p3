Lewandowski did not appear to know that the axe was about to drop: The firing was so sudden that he was on a call with Republican National Committee staffers Monday morning, just hours before his firing, according to one GOP source. Sources close to the campaign view Lewandowski’s ouster as a major reset for Trump’s campaign    as well as an explicit acknowledgment that things were not going well.   Those closest to Trump worried that Lewandowski presented multiple problems for Trump. For one, they feared that Lewandowski was a hindrance to enlisting experienced, veteran strategists to join the campaign.
