I’m not going to have time to go play golf," Trump said during a 2016 event in Virginia.   For the most part, aides have declined to confirm that Trump was playing golf on weekends in Florida, instead repeatedly telling reporters that the President "may" hit a few balls at his course but that they didn’t know for sure. On multiple occasions, though, Trump’s games have been made public. CNN has seen Trump golfing    driving up the 12th hole on his championship course at Trump International Golf Course    multiple times during the former reality star’s first two months in office.
