Duterte has insulted the US Ambassador to Manila Philip Goldberg, calling him a "gay son of a bitch," and has directed vulgar language at President Barack Obama and said that he can "go to hell.

Even as it stands at the moment, serious questions need to be asked of the reliability of the Philippines both as an alliance partner and as a partner in the promotion of the values of democracy and good governance that the US seeks to defend in the region.
