" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the White House doesn’t have an official response to the FBI’s announcement, saying the case is still active and in the hands of the Department of Justice. Earnest added: "I am confident that the President and Secretary Clinton are not discussing the FBI investigation that is completed" on Air Force One. Neither Obama nor Clinton addressed Comey’s remarks during their campaign event in Charlotte, North Carolina, though Obama praised Clinton’s work at the State Department.
