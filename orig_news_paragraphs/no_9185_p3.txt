Trump will hold rallies at the Phoenix Convention Center and in Fountain Park in Fountain Hills on Saturday morning, and will hold another rally in Tuscon on Saturday afternoon.   Arpaio lives in Fountain Hills. The rallies will be picketed by   opponents of immigration reform. Sorry @realDonaldTrump
