Donald Trump’s immigration plan remains the same as it’s always been: tear apart families and deport 16 million people from the United States," said campaign chair John Podesta. Jose Fuentes, a Trump supporter and the former attorney general of Puerto Rico, was at the roundtable with Trump on Saturday, and said he did not walk away with the interpretation that Trump was open to legalization for some undocumented immigrants.   He said it was Trump who brought up the issue of those who are in the US illegally and asked the group to share their ideas on how to deal with them. Fuentes said that Trump used the language of wanting to handle the issue in a "fair," "humane," and "legal" way, but Fuentes said he didn’t automatically take that to mean that Trump was going allow some to stay or have legal status.
