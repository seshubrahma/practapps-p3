The number of electors each state has is equal to its number of representatives and senators in Congress   —   538 in total, with those extra three electors coming from the District of Columbia. Electors will meet in their states, typically at the capitol, where they will cast two votes: one for president and one for vice president. They will then prepare what is called a "certificate of vote" with the results, which is then mailed or delivered via courier to the National Archives, where it becomes part of the nation’s official records, and to Congress.
