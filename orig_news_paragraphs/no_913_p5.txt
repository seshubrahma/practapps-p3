It is akin to Mr. Trumpâ€™s appropriation of "fake news," a term that originally described rumor mills but one that he has used against any outlet that reports real news unfavorable to his administration. Much as his use of "fake news" miscasts reporting as lying, "deep state" presents apolitical civil servants as partisan agents. And it mischaracterizes those officials, who seek to defend their place within the system, by presenting them as acting against that system. Both phrases have become tools that Mr. Trump or his allies use to deflect perceived criticism by attacking the legitimacy of the critic.
