Trump on the other hand has raised doubts about the bedrock pacts of the international system such as NATO and US alliances in Asia, is yet to define his "America First" creed and has spooked Eastern European allies with his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump’s temperament and a campaign in which opponents said he was unfit to control the nuclear codes also alarmed foreign policy elites and governments abroad    so the thought of someone as sober and   as Romney beside Trump in the Situation Room would calm some nerves. The former governor would sail through Senate confirmation, thanks to his reputation as a devoted and devout family man with no personal skeletons. No one can know what is in Romney’s mind.
