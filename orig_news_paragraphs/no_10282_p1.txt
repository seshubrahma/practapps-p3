In this survey, Trump has the backing of 45 percent of Republicans nationwide. Three weeks ago, Trump’s support was 41 percent, a change that is within the poll’s margin of error. Cruz’s support, however, has apparently fallen from 38 percent in late March to just 27 percent today. Support for John Kasich, meanwhile, has surged 8 points, rising from 17 to 25 percent support.
