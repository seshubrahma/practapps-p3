The Illinois statute, for its part, defines a hate crime as a criminal act against someone "by reason of the actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, or national origin of another individual or group of individuals, regardless of the existence of any other motivating factor or factors. " If the victim was singled out for his disability, that should be reason enough in Illinois. In fact, people with disabilities are often victims of violent crime.
