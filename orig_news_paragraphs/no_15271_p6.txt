While talks will continue, senators who wanted to leave town for the weekend will have to stay in Washington Friday and possibly vote on this   bill sometime before the midnight deadline. In the meantime, negotiators in both parties are close to an agreement on a much larger,   spending package that would wrap several funding measures for different agencies into one giant bill. The goal is to pass the omnibus bill during the   extension, but differences remain and leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are still haggling over the final points    with input from bipartisan leadership and the White House.   Ryan said Thursday he was "confident" the government would keep running, but placed any threat of a shutdown on Democrats.
