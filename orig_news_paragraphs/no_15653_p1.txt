The entire exchange took less than 10 seconds, but for a Catholic, a blessing of beads by the Pope is a pinnacle of holy ceremony. That Trump even had rosary beads was news    practicing Catholics often use the beads for prayers, moving fingers along each bead to keep track of how many times each is said, and repeated. Although Trump was raised in Slovenia, a country whose religious population is predominantly Catholic, she married Donald Trump, a Presbyterian, in 2005 at     Episcopal church in Palm Beach, Florida, and has celebrated Easter services there as recently as this year. Her    son, Barron, who was baptized at the same church, will attend St. Andrewâ€™s Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland, in the fall.
