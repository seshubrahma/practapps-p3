A bear of a man with a jowly, careworn face and   hair, Keane exudes the supreme   you would expect of a retired   general. He speaks with a trace of a New York accent that gives his pronouncements a    urgency. He is also a   member of the   complex, sitting on the board of General Dynamics and serving as a strategic adviser to Academi, the   contractor once known as Blackwater. And he is the chairman of an aptly named think tank, the Institute for the Study of War.
