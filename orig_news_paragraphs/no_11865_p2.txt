It currently includes such entries as the Nazi swastika, the burning cross, "1488" the Blood Drop Cross, the Confederate flag, the iron cross, Ku Klux Klan robes, a noose, the   South African flag, SS lightning bolts, and Stormfront’s logo. It is unknown as to why Pepe the Frog, a cartoon frog meme whose minimal links to "white supremacism" have been proven to be the result of two notorious trolls, is listed among the other symbols on the site, but it is likely to do with the debunked recent reports from both the mainstream media and the Clinton Campaign that claim Pepe to be a new symbol for white supremacy. Hillary Clinton, George Stephanopoulos, Katy Tur, and even Louise Mensch’s Heat Street have all branded the cartoon frog as a symbol for white supremacy, seemingly basing their claims on a Daily Beast article that interviewed two notorious trolls, Jared Taylor Swift (who has "PARODY ACCOUNT" in his Twitter bio) and Paul Town. During the interview, Swift and Town attempted to link the meme with white supremacy, with Swift boasting that he had managed to trick the media afterwards.
