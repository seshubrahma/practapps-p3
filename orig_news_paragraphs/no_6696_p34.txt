Comey was put in an impossible spot, but it’s again not his fault he had to investigate this stuff or had to inform Congress of it. If Hillary Clinton never set up an illicit email server in the basement of her upstate New York home —  and instead followed State Department guidelines —   and Weiner never exchanged lewd messages with underage women, maybe Comey would not have been in this spot just a few days before the election. Despite never actually proving in any way, shape, or form that Hillary Clinton ever won the election, Mohajer then goes on to claim that the court system must now intervene to take away the presidency from legitimate   Donald J. Trump —  who will be inaugurated later this week.
