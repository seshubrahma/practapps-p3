Washington (CNN) The Clinton Presidential Library released photos Friday featuring former President Bill Clinton interacting jovially with Donald Trump, a reminder of how close the Clinton and Trump families were before they ran against each other for the presidency. One photo shows Clinton and Trump with their arms around two women: Melania Knauss, now Trumpâ€™s wife, and a fourth woman, identified by Politico as Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kylie Bax, wearing a   with the Playboy bunny emblazoned across it. The photographs from 2000 were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act filed by Politico.
