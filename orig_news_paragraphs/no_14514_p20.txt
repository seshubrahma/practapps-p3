Trying to keep security council stable, The official said the White House is concerned that the council    an organization that is already in an uneasy position after Flynn’s early exit    would be further destabilized if the top staffers in the organization were asked to resign in order to make room for the next national security adviser’s staff. " They don’t want to see big changes at the NSC and therefore that is going to be a condition for anybody taking the job," the official said. But military officers especially, one White House aide said, bring with them a host of people, so encouraging staff stay could run counter to what the next National Security Adviser would want.
