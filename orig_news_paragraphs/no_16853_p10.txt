The administration, however, disputes that there was any delay in naming Russia, saying the announcement was made public as soon as the proper evidence to make an official attribution of responsibility was gathered.

Another senior administration official said that the major focus of making the announcement at this time was an effort to reassure the public that government is on top of the situation, that officials know who carried out the hacking and that the US political system can withstand the attacks.
