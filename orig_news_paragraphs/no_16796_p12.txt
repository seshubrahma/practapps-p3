Trump on Saturday night leaned into the issue as he made his latest play to earn the votes of Sanders’ supporters. Speaking at a rally in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Trump accused Clinton of "demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters" and argued that Clinton was calling Sanders supporters "ignorant." Trump argued that Clinton delivered her comments in a "really sarcastic tone because she’s a sarcastic woman." "To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie Sanders supporters are hopeless and ignorant " he said.
