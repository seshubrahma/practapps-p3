In my experience, police officers are not out to intentionally kill people of color. An officer’s decision to use deadly force is based on a number of factors. For most officers, the decision to use deadly force depends on the officer’s training, experience and ability to cope in highly volatile and stressful situations.   While there are certainly racist police officers (like there are some racist people)
