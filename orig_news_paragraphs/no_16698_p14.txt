Wednesday’s protests began peacefully, the chief said, but about 8 p. m. demonstrators began jumping on cars and damaging property at EpiCentre, an entertainment hub uptown. Police were forced to deploy tear gas, he said, and as the night went on, protesters shut down Interstate 277 and the city ’s light rail was halted just before midnight, due to the demonstrations, Putney said.   The violence and vandalism carried on until roughly 3 a. m. he said.
