Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Chair of the Democratic National Committee has been dropped from the party’s lineup of convention speakers following WikiLeaks’ release of explosive DNC emails showing members of the organization actively working against the Bernie Sanders campaign. [A Democratic insider told CNN that Schultz has been dropped from the lineup to "keep the peace" within the party, amid calls from Sanders’ campaign manager for someone at the DNC to be "held accountable" for the   collusion seen in the leaked emails.   That collusion included the leak of a Sanders campaign document to the Wall Street Journal as well as active attempts to harm Sanders’ image with Southern Baptist Democrats by drawing attention to his atheism. The DNC, and Wasserman Schultz in particular, came under heavy criticism from Sanders during the primaries, during which he accused them of showing favouritism to Hillary Clinton.
