Washington (CNN) Sarah Palin reiterated her support for Paul Ryanâ€™s primary challenger Friday night immediately after her political ally, Donald Trump, endorsed the House speaker. Trump on Friday evening said in Wisconsin that he would back Ryan in his Republican primary against Paul Nehlen, a   challenger. That announcement was a reversal from earlier in the week, when the presidential nominee declined to endorse the speaker.
