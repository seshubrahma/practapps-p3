Rafael Cruz, at the Pastor Larry Huch’s New Beginnings   in Bedford Texas, outside Dallas, on Aug. 26, 2012, in a Dominionist sermon proclaimed his son, Ted Cruz, to be the "anointed one," a Dominionist Messiah who would bring God’s law to reign. Billy Hallowell at The Blaze, an online website owned by one of Beck’s companies, took exception to the "DAD SPEAKING IN TONGUES" headline, pointing out, correctly, that the video to which the headline linked did not show Cruz’s father Rafael actually "speaking in tongues" as it is commonly understood: [S]ome believe that Cruz is seen in the video "speaking in tongues" (also known as glossolalia)  —   a religious gift that purportedly permits certain Christians to speak and interpret a special language that comes directly from God   …     While it is clear that Rafael Cruz is moving his lips and likely quietly praying during Pearson’s invocation, it is not definitively clear that he is speaking in tongues, as some have alleged.
