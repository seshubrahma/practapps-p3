Sunday at CNN’s Democratic presidential town hall, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she can beat Republican presidential   Donald Trump on forging policy with her experience as secretary of state.   Clinton said, "Let me give you a little bit where we are right now votes on Tuesday, I am the only candidate who has gotten more votes than Trump. I have 600, 000 more votes than Donald Trump, and   —   and I am building a   inclusive campaign that I think is the best way to defeat him by convincing people that this really is the highest stakes election that they have ever been involve dd in.
