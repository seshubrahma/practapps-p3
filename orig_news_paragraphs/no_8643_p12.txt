Thanks to the Clinton Foundation, 9 million more people in our world have access to   drugs because they negotiated contracts that made them affordable. And there is absolutely no connection between anything that I did as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation.   So, people can say that, but Iâ€™m proud of our philanthropic work, our   philanthropic work, the work of the Clinton Foundation.
