Democrats expressed outrage that support of Israel, which enjoys broad bipartisan participation, was in some way undermined because Israel’s head of government accepted the Speaker of the House ’s invitation to address America’s elected representatives. Even more hypocritical was Democrats’ silence when Obama tried to prevent Netanyahu’s reelection after complaining about alleged Israeli interference in our election. You can say a lot of things about Donald Trump, but you cannot say that he has not forcefully declared his support for Israel.
