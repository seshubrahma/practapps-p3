Emanuel Khoshaba Youkhana, leader of the Assyrian Patriotic Party and commander of the Assyrian Christian militia Dwekh Nawsha (" ") told Breitbart News: Choosing to stand by the Assyrian people is choosing to support people who share the   values that have played such an important role in shaping American history and making America the great nation it is today. As an Assyrian Christian and as one of the leaders of the Assyrian people, I am reaching out to   Trump to ask for his support in helping the Assyrian people to achieve their aspirations to reside in their historical homeland. In doing so, I wish to assure   Trump that a strong and viable Assyrian Christian community in the Middle East will be a stalwart friend and steadfast ally of the United States.
