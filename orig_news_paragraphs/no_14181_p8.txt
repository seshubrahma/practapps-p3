Abe and Trump also discussed the significance of Defense Secretary James Mattis’ upcoming visit to Asia, according to the White House.    Later Saturday, Trump was to speak with French President François Hollande and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.   Trump’s calls with Abe and Turnbull come days after he signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the   Partnership, or TPP, a massive trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration that Congress had not yet ratified. Both Abe and Turnbull supported TPP.
