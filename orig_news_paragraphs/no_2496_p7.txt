" It’s a safe assumption that Pruitt could be the most hostile E. P. A. administrator toward clean air and safe drinking water in history," he added. Mr. Pruitt, 48, is a hero to conservative activists, one of a group of Republican attorneys general who formed an alliance with some of the nation’s top energy producers to push back against the Obama regulatory agenda.
