At 6 a. m. Eastern time, before the first rays of sunlight kiss the Rockies or a single Election Day vote is cast, it expects to project who is winning the swing state of Colorado based on absentee ballots and an early vote count kept by the Colorado secretary of state. Mr. Smukler of VoteCastr experimented with this style of reporting during the Philadelphia mayorâ€™s race in 2003, a rematch between Mayor John F. Street and Sam Katz, projecting results live throughout the day on the radio. The projections held true all day. VoteCastr is basing its turnout models on key counties in the swing states, sampling from areas that favor Hillary Clinton, swing areas and areas that support Donald J. Trump.
