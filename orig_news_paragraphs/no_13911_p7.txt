Warren said she was not raising questions about Carson’s integrity but rather about Trump’s decision not to place his assets in a blind trust or fully divest from his businesses, instead putting his sons and a top executive in charge of the Trump Organization while he is President. Carson also drew on the connection between housing and health during his confirmation hearing, arguing in his opening statement that his background as a medical professional prepares him for the top HUD post, noting that "good health has a lot to do with a good environment" and that substandard living conditions can result in health problems, including learning disabilities in children. He also looked to quell concerns about his qualifications with a letter from four past HUD secretaries, including a Democrat who served in President Bill Clinton’s administration, urging his confirmation. Omarosa Manigault, a former "Apprentice" contestant who oversaw much of Trump’s diversity efforts during his campaign and will become White House staff, also sat behind Carson in the second row for part of the hearing.
