Companies like Twitter have really scaled up their actions to stop ISIL from exploiting and abusing their platforms. The numbers I’ve seen recently is over the last year, year and a half some 360, 000 terrorist accounts, have been disrupted and taken down. That’s 1, 000 accounts per day. And places like Google are putting in place very kind of new and innovative ideas to redirect those who are searching for ISIL content to other content.
