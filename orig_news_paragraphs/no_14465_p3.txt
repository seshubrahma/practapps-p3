US allies in Europe are looking for indications from the Trump administration that the US will take a stand when it comes to countering Russian aggression in parts of Eastern Europe, particularly in Ukraine, where violence has flared in recent weeks between government forces and   separatist groups. A senior administration official told reporters that Tillerson will push Russia to honor its 2015 commitment to use its influence over those groups to stem the fighting. He is also expected to back continued multilateral sanctions on Russia related to their annexation of Crimea. European diplomats are watching the new US officials all the more closely after Trumpâ€™s disparagement of NATO and questions about the utility of sanctions.
