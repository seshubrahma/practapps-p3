As Breitbart News reported previously, Michigan is the state with second highest number of resettled Syrian refugees in FY 2016 to date, and the highest per capita rate. If the Obama administration and the Michigan resettlement agencies have their way, the number of refugees resettled in Oakland County. Michigan will skyrocket to 1, 242 in FY 2017, up from the 920 planned for FY 2016. That resettlement has come at an economic and public health cost to Oakland County taxpayers.
