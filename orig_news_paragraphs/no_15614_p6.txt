States would receive Medicaid as a block grant rather than   entitlement. Even if more citizens needed funds, the amount of federal funds they received would be capped.   The Medicaid cuts come on top of many other proposed reductions that target Americans with the fewest resources. The budget is expected to cut food stamps (a program that over 40 million people received in 2016) and other   programs.
