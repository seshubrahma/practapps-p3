Typically, the president releases an annual determination of the number of refugees to be allowed into the country in the month preceding the start of a new fiscal year, which begins on October 1. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, that number is determined at the sole discretion of the president. Subsequent to the president â€™s determination of that number, Congress has traditionally funded the refugee resettlement program at the level set by the president for the coming fiscal year.
