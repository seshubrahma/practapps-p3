Ajit Pai, a Republican whom Mr. Trump recently named as the F. C. C. chairman, has also made clear that he intends to push to roll back or abandon several other major rules, including the landmark net neutrality regulation intended to ensure equal access to content on the internet, as well as efforts to keep prison phone rates down and a proposal to break open the cable box market. The efforts have been praised by telecommunications giants, like Comcast, but condemned by consumer advocates. The administration started its campaign against regulation on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, with a memo from Reince Priebus, Mr. Trumpâ€™s chief of staff, instructing agencies to halt work on new regulations and to delay putting completed regulations into effect. So far, the effective dates of at least 75 rules have been delayed as a result of this order, based on an analysis of the Federal Register.
