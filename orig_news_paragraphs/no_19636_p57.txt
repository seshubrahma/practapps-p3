’ ’Lewis : I thought about this back when   "Moneyball" was published. Billy Beane, he didn’’t ask for my   opinion, but I told him, you’’ve got this army of scouts, and   they’’re not doing what they should be doing. They’’re eyeballing   the players and judging if they can be   players based   on small sample sizes, the games they happen to attend.
