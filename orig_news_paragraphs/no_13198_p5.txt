Mitt Romney has actively fought Donald Trump, starting with staging a widely publicized comeback speech specifically to attack Donald Trump. If only he had opposed Barack Obama with the same vigor! The 2012 GOP nominee has also actively encouraged   to campaign against Trump, mocked Trumpâ€™s family, and held a "NeverTrump gathering," to name a few things. The last two Republican presidents have been conspicuously absent from the national dialogue during this election cycle, with the exception of the prominent rumor that George H. W. Bush will be voting for Hillary Clinton.
