Reimportation means bringing back   drugs that were sold overseas at a price lower than that in America, thereby lowering the price in the US.

S. —  a   market —  from countries where they’re less expensive.   Bills including the provision have been defeated several times in Congress. In other words, reimportation is an old fight.
