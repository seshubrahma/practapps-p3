Trump sent the right message when he accepted a congratulatory call from Taiwan ’s President Tsai    Friday, despite the uproar from Red China and America’s   commentariat.

Dana Rohrabacher, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chairs its Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats subcommittee.
