The administration may have decided that the chances of success at the Supreme Court are poor. For the last year, the court has had just eight members, and a    tie would leave the appeals court ruling in place. It would take five votes to overturn the ruling, and it appears unlikely that any of the court’s four more liberal justices would support the administration’s position. The Justice Department asked the trial judge, Judge James L. Robart, of the Federal District Court in Seattle, to "postpone any further proceedings" in his court while the appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, considers whether to rehear the case.
