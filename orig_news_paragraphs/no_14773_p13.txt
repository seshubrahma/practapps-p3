Publicly available internet records show that address, which was registered to the Trump Organization, points to an IP address that lives on an otherwise dull machine operated by a company in the tiny rural town of Lititz, Pennsylvania.    From May 4 until September 23, the Russian bank looked up the address to this Trump corporate server 2, 820 times    more lookups than the Trump server received from any other source.     As noted, Alfa Bank alone represents 80% of the lookups, according to these leaked internet records.    Far back in second place, with 714 such lookups, was a company called Spectrum Health.
