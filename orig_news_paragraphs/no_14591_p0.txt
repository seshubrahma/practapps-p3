 (CNN) Former Kentucky Gov. Steven Beshear will make the case for Obamacare during the Democratic response to President Donald Trumpâ€™s first joint address to Congress on Tuesday. Beshear is expected to address the need for Trump to create more jobs and improve education, but much of his speech will challenge the Republican push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.   "American families desperately need our president to put his full attention on creating opportunity and   jobs and preserving their right to affordable health care and a quality education," Beshear said in a statement with the House and Senate Democratic leadership.
