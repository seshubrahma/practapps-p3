Trump and his close White House circle wanted Flynn to fall on his sword, taking the blame for inappropriate and possibly illegal telephone conversations he held with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition period. In those calls, Flynn reportedly reassured Moscow that sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama over Russiaâ€™s hacking of the US election would be lifted by the incoming administration.   When news of the phone calls became public, and as recently as a week ago Wednesday, Flynn vehemently denied he had discussed sanctions    and the denials were repeated by press secretary Sean Spicer and by Vice President Mike Pence. We now know that version of events was false.
