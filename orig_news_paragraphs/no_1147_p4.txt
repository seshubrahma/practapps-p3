" Before the state applies its power in force to lead to my death, give me an opportunity to show that you got the wrong person," said Mr. Robinson, a senior counsel in the Washington office of Lewis Baach. The case revolves around the suspicion that the menâ€™s association with members of Al Qaeda and other militant groups in the course of their reporting has led to their classification as terrorists. Mr. Abdul Kareem said he believed that he was on the list because he had nearly been killed in airstrikes five times in the last year, at least one of them from a drone, according to court papers.
