" Francis’ scheduled visit to Egypt has been billed as the latest step in a   effort to forge stronger ties between the Roman Catholic Church and Muslim leaders. Relations became strained in 2011 when Francis’s predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, denounced what he called "a strategy of violence that has Christians as a target" after a bombing at a church in Alexandria killed at least 23 people. Francis has sought to rebuild ties with Muslim clerics since becoming pope in 2013.
