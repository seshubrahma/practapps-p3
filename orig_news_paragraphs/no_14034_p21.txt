The   crowd waved US and confederate flags in the air and shouted: "Itâ€™s all over lefty scum" and "drain the swamp," witness to the protest Eliza Berlage told CNN.   Some Trump enthusiast also carried placards saying "Aussies for Trump," Berlage said.    The police refrained the   protesters from going into the area with the   protesters.   Scuffles ensued as police tried to physically restrain some of the rally goers, Berlage said.
