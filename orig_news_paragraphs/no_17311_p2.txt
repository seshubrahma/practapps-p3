Saturdayâ€™s contest comes after no one candidate captured a majority of the votes in November, a requirement of state law to avoid a runoff. The field originally had two dozen candidates including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.   The top two vote finishers were Kennedy, the state treasurer, with 25% of the vote and Campbell, who had 17. 5% of the vote. Trump stumped for Kennedy,   Donald Trump held a rally Friday in Baton Rouge, asking his supporters to back Kennedy in the election and calling him "a tax cutter" and "true fighter."
