The push to remove Ryan as Speaker is "picking up some steam," said Congressman Mark Meadows —  who also voted for Ryan last year after leading the charge to remove Ryan’s predecessor, John Boehner, as Speaker. Meadows explained that a lot of conservatives now "question the loyalty of the Speaker" in light of Ryan’s treatment of Trump.
