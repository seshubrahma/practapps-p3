In their suit, they said that destroying the records would threaten national security and that the data should be preserved and made accessible under New York Stateâ€™s freedom of information law. Lawyers for the city argued that the state law did not cover the release of such private data. The city said on Dec. 7 that it would stop keeping personal data after new applications were approved starting next year. Justice Minardo denied a separate request to stop the destruction of the new documents being collected, at least until there could be a full hearing.
