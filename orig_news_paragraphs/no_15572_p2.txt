I frequently write about my objection to political violence and censorship in America, and we have plenty of examples of both.   We have our own leader with a tendency toward authoritarian responses to criticism.    We have our own   individuals who want to shut down debate.    It is worrisome when an American professor allegedly violates the Constitution by calling for "muscle" to get rid of journalists.
