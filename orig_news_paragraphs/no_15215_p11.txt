It is a reflection of how the conference is divided that we still don’t have clarity and certainty on our work, and we will go back Tuesday and begin to have those frank discussions," a Republican member said.    On health care, Tuesday Group leader Tom MacArthur of New Jersey and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows of North Carolina held extensive discussions over the   recess and agreed to a potential breakthrough, but there is little evidence that their compromise has widespread   from members of either of their groups or the broader GOP conference. The talks between Meadows and MacArthur have continued to focus on three areas identified before the congressional recess: essential health benefits, which requires insurers to provide 10 services, including maternity, substance abuse and prescription drugs, in all plans community rating, which bans insurers from charging more to people based on health history or gender and guaranteed issue, which mandates insurers cover everyone regardless of their medical status, according to sources. Lawmakers are looking at allowing states to obtain waivers to opt out of some of these protections, but requiring states to attest that the waiver’s goal is to reduce the cost of health care or increase the number of insured.
