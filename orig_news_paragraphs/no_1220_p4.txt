Muslims represent just 3 percent of Canada’s population, and while Islam is one of the   religions in the country, Muslims will still account for less than 6 percent of the population in 2050, according to the Pew Research Center. Nonetheless, Mr. Beaudry and his peers say they believe there is a real threat that Islamists are bending Canada’s tolerant culture to their will. The group’s main concern is political Islam pushed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the   movement that grew out of Egypt after the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I. "Political Islam is slowly invading our institutions," Mr. Beaudry declared, claiming that his group had documentary proof, though he was not prepared to show it.
