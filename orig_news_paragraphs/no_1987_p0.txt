CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  —    Top strategists from the campaigns of Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton, interrupting each other and sometimes raising their voices, engaged in an angry debate on Thursday about how Mr. Trump pulled off his upset victory. Emotions were still raw at the campaign   held at Harvard’s Institute of Politics, particularly over the influence of Stephen K. Bannon, who left Breitbart News   —   which he has called a "platform" for the white nationalist    —   to help run Mr. Trump’s campaign.
