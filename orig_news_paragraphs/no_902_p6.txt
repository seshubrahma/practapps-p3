Mr. Trump has been angered by a series of reports based on leaked information from a sprawling bureaucracy, as well as from his own West Wing. Several officials said the firings had been planned before Friday. But the calls from the acting deputy attorney general arose a day after Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator who is a strong supporter of President Trump, said on his evening show that Mr. Trump needed to "purge" Obama holdovers from the federal government. Mr. Hannity portrayed them as "saboteurs" from the  "deep state" who were leaking secrets to hurt Mr. Trump.
