Tuesday on MSNBC, former Clinton administration ambassador to the United Nations and former Gov. Bill Richardson ( ) said in response to   Donald Trump’s statement on Monday’s Berlin Terror attack, "[T]o frame this attack as a clash of civilizations, Christians against Muslims, it helps ISIS recruit. It helps inflame the situation. "  Trumps statement read in part, "ISIS and other Islamic terrorists continuously slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all   partners.
