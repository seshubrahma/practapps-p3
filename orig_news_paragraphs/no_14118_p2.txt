Trump said that he and the Mexican president had mutually agreed to scrap their planned get together, and he repeated his position that the US wonâ€™t fund the wall. " Unless Mexico will treat the US fairly, with respect, such a meeting is fruitless, and I want to go a different route," Trump told House and Senate GOP lawmakers.
