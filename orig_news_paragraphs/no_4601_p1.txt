[The church, believed to be the place of Jesusâ€™s crucifixion, burial and resurrection, is one of the holiest sites in Christianity. Trump met outside the church with leaders of local Christian denominations before going inside for a private tour closed to the news media.   Afterwards, Trump went to the nearby Western Wall where he became the first sitting U. S. president to visit the Jewish holy site. The Western Wall is part of an ancient retaining wall erected around the Jewish Temple.
