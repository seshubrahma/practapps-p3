The super PAC has begun purchasing advertising time in Pennsylvania to begin later this week, according to a media buying source. After spending $13 million on television, the PAC has not been airing advertisements for almost three weeks, per advertising records. The group did not respond to a request for comment on their advertising plans. It has purchased nearly $100, 000 in four Pennsylvania markets so far: Pittsburgh, Wilkes   Harrisburg and Erie.
