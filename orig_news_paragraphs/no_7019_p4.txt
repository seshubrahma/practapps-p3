On almost every Sunday since the "Black Spring" of 2003, Soler and her compatriots  —   the wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of Cuban political prisoners   —   have been arrested for carrying images of their wrongfully imprisoned loved ones to church and attempting to sit in on Catholic Mass in Havana. They have been beaten, dragged by their ankles, pulled by their hair, jeered, tarred, and forcibly abandoned hours away from their homes with no way of getting back on a regular basis under the Raúl Castro regime.
