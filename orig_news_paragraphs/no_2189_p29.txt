Many of the regions where Mr. Obama lost ground in white areas outside the South  —   like the   areas of North Dakota or Appalachia, Mormon Utah, culturally Southern stretches of Southern Illinois, or Mr. Kerry and Mr. Romney’s home state of Massachusetts   —   were exceptions that proved the rule.

Mr. Ghitza found similar figures as The Upshot’s estimates using different data sets and different models.
