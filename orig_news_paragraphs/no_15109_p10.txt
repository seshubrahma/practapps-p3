For Spicer, this is the second major   in as many days. On Monday, when asked whether the Trump administration’s decision to launch strikes against the Syrian airfield where the chemical attacks are believed to have originated was the new policy of the United States, Spicer responded by saying: "If you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this President. " Assad, of course, has been dropping barrel bombs onto civilians for some time now    raising questions about whether Spicer’s statement was an error or an actual change in policy.
