The Mormon Tabernacle Choir  —    dubbed "America’s Choir" by President Ronald Reagan at his inauguration in 1981   —   has performed at the inaugurations of numerous presidents throughout history, including those for Lyndon B. Johnson, Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush. But since the announcement that it would perform at Trump’s inauguration, the choir has been the subject of a petition seeking to persuade the group to cancel its performance that has since gathered thousands of signatures.
