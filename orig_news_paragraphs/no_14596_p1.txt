Trump complained about the pace of confirmations Friday in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. He told the crowd the administration was "setting records" for Senate delays and that he didnâ€™t like seeing "all those empty seats" at his Cabinet meetings. The figures below show Trump indeed has had the least successful run of Senate confirmations since George H. W. Bush back in 1989.   Only 14 Trump appointees have been confirmed as of February 21, while President Barack Obama had twice as many   appointments confirmed by that date.
