Many tech leaders were left "dazed and confused" after top Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel won a standing ovation at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last Thursday when he introduced himself as both "proud to be gay" and "proud to be Republican. " [  As Breitbart News has reported, the Obama Administration has shown lots of love to Silicon Valley’s corporate elite by allowing tech companies to offshore the majority of their employment, deflect  a huge chunk of their 40 percent U. S. corporate tax rate to Ireland’s infamous 12. 5 percent tax rate, and still do spectacular business with the federal bureaucracy. One investigation documented that offshore tax havens had saved tech corporations $89 billion in U. S. tax liability. That also explains why Silicon Valley industries lead American business interests in contining to park $2. 1 trillion in profits offshore to avoid any U. S. taxation.
