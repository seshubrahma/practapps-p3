org petition has garnered more than four million signatures urging Electoral College "electors" in some states to ignore the will of the voters and back Mrs. Clinton, reminding them that they could do so without any legal penalty. The electors will cast their ballots on Dec. 19. On Twitter, the hashtags #auditthevote and #audittheelection have become rallying cries for supporters of Mrs. Clinton who are directing people to flood the Justice Department with telephone calls about voting irregularities. The push is also taking place on Facebook, where calls are growing for a full investigation into Russiaâ€™s role in the election.
