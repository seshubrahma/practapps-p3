Felix Walworth, a member of New   band Told Slant, posted a photo of what he says is the SXSW performer contract that warns that international artists who perform unofficial concerts during the week of the festival could be handed over to U. S. government immigration officials and deported. SXSW will "notify the appropriate U. S. immigration authorities" of artists who "adversely affect the viability of their official SXSW showcase," the contract states: After looking through this contract sent to me by sxsw I have decided to cancel Told Slant’s performance at the festival pic. twitter.    —   Told Slant (@Felixixix666)
