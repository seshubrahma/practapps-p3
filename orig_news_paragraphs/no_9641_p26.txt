Barry Goldwater’s early support for privatizing Social Security in the 1964 presidential campaign is widely credited with having destroyed whatever slim hopes he may have had of winning that race.   And one of Ronald Reagan’s worst political missteps was a   effort to cap the benefits of Social Security. Despite this dismal record, some GOPers have chosen to keep trying: In 2005, President George W. Bush, freshly   proposed the partial privatization of Social Security. Bush’s plan was heavily hedged and safeguarded, and yet even so, the thought of messing with Social Security was anathema to most Americans, and so the bill never even came to a vote in either the   House or Senate.
