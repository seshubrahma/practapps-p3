—   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 5:27 P. M. ET: A Hillary Clinton senior adviser is on MSNBC right now and is refusing to denounce the tactics of the DNC. The Clinton campaign says the DNC should conduct an "internal review" of itself and even Chuck Todd questions whether the DNC should be allowed to —  as the Clinton campaign wants to —  conduct its own internal review of itself. Todd says "there’s crowds of" people in the streets in Philadelphia who are "angry" and the Clinton adviser, Joel Benenson, is having a hard time explaining whether Bernie Sanders supporters will come in line.
