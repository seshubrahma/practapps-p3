Politico reported from a fundraiser Saturday in Aventura, Florida: The constellation of political groups in Democratic strategist David Brock’s network are aiming to raise roughly $40 million in 2017, the Clinton    ally told roughly 120 donors gathered here on Saturday.   …    Brock’s groups include Media Matters, a liberal news media watchdog ShareBlue, a liberal news site American Bridge, the party’s primary opposition research organization and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) which carries out legal actions. CREW will be a particular locus of activity this year, according to donors briefed on the plans. Meanwhile, a campaign to impeach Trump officially kicked off as soon as the billionaire was sworn in last Friday.   The movement’s centralized hub is the ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.
