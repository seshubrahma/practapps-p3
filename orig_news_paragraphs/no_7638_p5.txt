Over the phone, she read me some passages from Mrs. Obama’s speech as examples. I wrote them down and alter included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech. I did not check Mrs. Obama’s speeches. This was my mistake, and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama.
