Beck and Krikorian said the statement will allow Senators to grill Puzder on his plans to help Americans workers and raise their productivity. For a start, Krikorian said. Puzder should promise to tighten the process in which companies justify their requests to import temporary foreign workers, such as     visa workers. Companies should be forced to explain why they can’t find Americans who could be trained to do the work, and why they can’t get the job done by buying   technology built by Americans workers, he said.
