The president did not issue such an order. Many government employees said they were inspired by the actions of Sally Q. Yates, a top   official in the Justice Department who was fired as  acting attorney general after she refused to order the department’s lawyers to defend the legality of Mr. Trump’s travel ban. More than 1, 000 State Department diplomats registered their opposition to the ban by signing a dissent letter asserting that the new policy would "run counter to core American values" and would not make the country safer. At the Defense Department, where uniformed men and women work with civilians, several    employees expressed outrage that Mr. Trump would announce the travel ban at the Pentagon, a building filled with people from different faiths and countries.
