 (CNN) US Energy Secretary Rick Perry weighed in Wednesday on the student body election of his alma mater, questioning whether Texas AM’s first openly gay student body president legitimately earned the title. In an   for the Houston Chronicle, the former Texas governor said he was "deeply concerned" by the school’s decision to disqualify the winner of the popular vote and declare junior Bobby Brooks president.   At best, the school "made a mockery of due process" in the name of diversity, he said.
