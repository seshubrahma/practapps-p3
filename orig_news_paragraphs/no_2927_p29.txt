Bring to a simmer and cook gently until heated through, about five minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 3⁄4   ML of the sour cream and the vinegar. Ladle the soup into individual bowls and garnish with melted butter, the remaining 1⁄4   ML sour cream, the parsley, dill, chives, and plenty of pepper. Leftover soup will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.
