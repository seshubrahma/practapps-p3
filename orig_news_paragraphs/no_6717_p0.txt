Former Breitbart News Executive Chairman and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon says that he warned former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes that star anchor Megyn Kelly is "the devil" and that she would "turn" on him. [In July 2016, Kelly was reportedly instrumental in Ailes’ ouster from the cable news network after she accused him of sexual harassment.   Bannon’s quite   quote comes in an interview with Politico’s Eliana Johnson, who tells the story of Breitbart News and FNC’s "falling out" over coverage of the 2016 Republican primary. From Politico: Months before Donald Trump blew up American politics with his surprise win in November, he did the same thing to the conservative media.
