Trump last campaigned in Maine in   where more than twenty parked cars were vandalised outside his rally. Maine and Nebraska are the only two states that do not allocate presidential electors on a    statewide basis. Maine splits its votes by congressional district: the winner of the first district wins three electoral votes and the winner of the second wins one electoral vote.   The data is further good news for the Trump campaign, who today woke up to the news that Trump had a lead on Clinton for the first time in an ABC   Post tracking poll, which has generally shown significant leads for Hillary Clinton.
