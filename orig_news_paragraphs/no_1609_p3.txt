The climb, which was watched by millions of viewers on television and online, as well as hundreds of people from the streets below, was the latest   chapter for Trump Tower, since Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign there last summer. On Wednesday, Pierre Griffith, an assistant district attorney, said that Mr. Rogata told investigators he had wanted to give Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, "secret information" that "has to do with when he’s president, how he’s going to govern. " Prosecutors said Mr. Rogata told investigators that he had hoped to make it to the top of the   building but also knew he would quite likely be arrested.
