For example, the 1960 Democratic platform, the one that helped elect John F. Kennedy, was emphatic:   The new Democratic Administration will develop a comprehensive national water resource policy.   In cooperation with state and local governments, and interested private groups, the Democratic Administration will develop a balanced,   plan for each major river basin. Indeed, in those days, the Democrats attacked the outgoing Eisenhower administration for its alleged cheapness when it came to funding new projects: We will erase the Republican slogan of "no new starts" and will begin again to build   dams, hydroelectric facilities,   works, navigation facilities, and reclamation projects to meet mounting and urgent needs.
