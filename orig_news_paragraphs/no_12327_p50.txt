What Sen. Rubio did not mention is that the U. S. has admitted 59 million immigrants since 1965, and that one quarter of today’s population is either   or a child of a   parent. Sen. Rubio also did not mention that every three years, the U. S. voluntarily admits a new population of immigrants the size of Los Angeles. For instance, over the next ten years, the U. S. will issue more green cards to foreign nationals than the population of the three early 2016 primary states —   Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina —   combined. Rubio’s 2013 Gang of Eight bill would have tripled green card issuances, and his 2015 Immigration Innovation Act would have allowed an unlimited number of foreign students to get American green cards.
