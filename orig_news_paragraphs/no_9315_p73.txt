Cruz said they would build a border wall after Trump first made the promise. He says Sheriff Joe Arpaio has endorsed him, which means he is the strongest on the border. Trump says after he, in Rush Limbaughâ€™s words, took so much "incoming" for standing against illegal immigration, then people came over to his side. He says he talked about borders and trade and "it morphed into something much different" after the   Bernardino attacks.
