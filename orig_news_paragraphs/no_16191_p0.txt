Washington (CNN) Donald Trump is casting Hillary Clinton as an enemy of the LGBT community and women, using her family foundation’s acceptance of contributions from Middle Eastern countries with widely reported human rights abuses to hit his 2016 presidential rival on the campaign trail.    In the wake of the Orlando massacre of 49 people, Trump cited Clinton Foundation’s acceptance of up to $25 million in contributions from Saudi Arabia’s government as a sign she is not dedicated to the cause of LGBT Americans. Other Middle Eastern donors to the foundation include Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
