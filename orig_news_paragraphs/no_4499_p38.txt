Maldives: The Republic of Maldives is absolutely repressive. Sunni Islam is the state religion, the constitution is "based on the principles of Islam," sharia law is superior to civil law, and the public practice of any other religion is forbidden. Even proselytizing Muslims to change to other denominations of Islam is forbidden.
