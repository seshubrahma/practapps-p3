Gill has an interesting take on the suggested alliance between Cruz and Trump delegates. " At this point it is probably premature for the Trump and Cruz to partner as a ticket, since both still have a path to secure the nomination. Although as a Cruz delegate I wouldnâ€™t mind it if they did it in alphabetical order," Gill notes with a laugh.
