As a practice, Barry University does not engage in business relationships where senior leadership of a company takes a public position, or the company’s guiding principles are, antithetical to the university ’s core commitments of Inclusive Community   Social Justice. This practice, which has been in place for some time, is not political, as we do not take positions relative to candidates. We seek only to ensure fulfillment of our values through our institutional business related ventures and expenditures.
