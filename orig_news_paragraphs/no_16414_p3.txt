Priorities decided earlier this month to go dark in certain markets in Virginia and Colorado, but said at the time that they would go back on the air on August 16. With polls going Clintonâ€™s way, the group decided against doing that, and added Pennsylvania to their list of states they will go dark in. This decision, one Priorities adviser said, does not mean the group will be dark in the states through Election Day. According to the adviser, the plan is still to start airing ads in Colorado, Virginia and Pennsylvania starting on September 20.
