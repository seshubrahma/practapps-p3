Rubio’s tough questioning Wednesday of Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, and unresolved doubts about the former ExxonMobil chief’s nomination, present him with a set of provocative political choices. The senator was expected to meet Tillerson on Thursday after expressing reservations over the potential top US diplomat’s answers on Russia, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia    particularly on human rights    during Wednesday’s confirmation hearing. " We’re still working through it, so you know, we’ll have a decision here soon," Rubio told CNN on Thursday.
