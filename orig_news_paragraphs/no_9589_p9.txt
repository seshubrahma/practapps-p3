I’m sure there would be more protesters here today but they are all trying to finish their term paper: "Why all white men are literally Hitler". They all independently arrived at the same title, it’s amazing! I’m very happy that we were all able to come here today, you know that at one point it was questionable if the Dangerous Faggot tour would make it to Mankato, right? Your school, Minnesota State University, tried to join a growing wave of universities trying to force cancellations of my tour stops by burdening student groups with high security fees.
