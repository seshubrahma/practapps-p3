While some provisions in the new order have been relaxed, Mr. Trump and immigration   in the administration are expected to assert that the new version is no less strict because it retains a temporary ban on refugees. The senior administration official said Iraq had been removed from the travel ban after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had discussions with the Iraqi government about its vetting processes. The Iraqi officials insisted that their vetting system was thorough enough on its own. Some American officials had expressed concern that the restrictions would have affected Iraqis who had worked with the American military as interpreters or in other roles and sought to come to the United States.
