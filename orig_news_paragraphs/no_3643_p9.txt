Just this week, the Associated Press reported on how the Saudis are engaged in a $1. 3    campaign to manipulate the public, deceive our military veterans, and fool Congress into weakening JASTA.   That news story has been carried throughout the world, and was picked up in the U. S. by outlets as varied as Breitbart, Fox News, Bloomberg, ABC News, and even the Daily Beast. We are sure you especially share our outrage that the Saudi agents are lying to our nationâ€™s veteran community. Would you please tell the Saudi Kingdom that this deceitful campaign must stop?
