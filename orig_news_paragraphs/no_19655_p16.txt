Kushner was born into the   business as the youngest   son of Charles Kushner, a New Jersey   baron who fell   from grace in dramatic fashion. When the elder Kushner was   sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison for crimes including tax   evasion and witness tampering, Jared, at 24, was suddenly handed   the reins to the business. ’ "    Over the course of a decade, the younger Kushner became the     landlord in the East Village, making splashy   purchases that included Brooklyn’s Watchtower, the Puck Building,   and the $1. 8 billion purchase of 666 Fifth Ave.
