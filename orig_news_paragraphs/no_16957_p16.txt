He said his wife had a similar problem on the same machine. Merle King, the executive director for Georgiaâ€™s Center for Election Systems at Kennesaw State University, told CNN the machine will be evaluated after the election. King said a calibration error may be at fault. If improperly calibrated, the screen could be off   to   an inch, and other factors    including whether voters have long fingernails, were wearing jewelry, had long sleeves or were leaning on the machine    could be responsible as well.
