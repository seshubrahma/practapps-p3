Whatever objections one might raise to a Trump nomination, it is folly to dismiss    his critique of, Americaâ€™s dismal place in the current imbalanced global trading system, and argue instead that the status quo is fine, including   trade deficits. Throwing   crumbs to disaffected   white workers will not increase economic growth, foster competitive   capabilities, and pay down the national debt. A new approach to our      trade policy is needed, with or without Donald Trump.
