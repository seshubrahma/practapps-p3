The Senate panel will hold its first public hearing on Russian meddling into the US election on Thursday, forgoing higher profile witnesses like FBI Director James Comey for the moment, instead going with cybersecurity experts.   Warner sought to reassure that Senate investigators had not been waylaid by the chaos from the other side of the Captiol. " Itâ€™s important for us at least, and I think for all of us here to remember to not lose sight about what this investigation is about: an outside, foreign adversary effectively sought to hijack our most critical democratic process, the election of a president," Warner said.
