Sunday on ABC’s "This Week," while commenting on the controversy over the phone call between   Donald Trump and Taiwan President Tsai   Vice   Mike Pence said it was "a little mystifying" President Barack Obama Cuban dictator Raul Castro and be "hailed as a hero," while   Donald Trump receives criticism for taking call from the president of Taiwan.   Pence said, "We’ll deal with policy after January the 20. This was a courtesy call and plus I have to tell you, George, it’s a little mystifying to me that President Obama can reach out to a murdering dictator in Cuba in the last year and be hailed as a hero for doing it and   Donald Trump takes a courtesy call from a democratically elected leader in Taiwan and it’s become something of a controversy. I think the American people appreciate the fact that our   is taking calls from and reaching out to the world and preparing on day one to lead America on the world stage.
