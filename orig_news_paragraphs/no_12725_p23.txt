Perhaps Ryan needs to realize that free trade is wonderful except when only one side of the equation is free. Many millions of Americans arenâ€™t participating in the workforce and if Paul Ryan has his way, many more will join them in the welfare lines. I like Rand too. She remains a fearsome foil to the     politics of the left.
