A narrow Trump win could mean falling short of the 1, 237 threshold, but still putting Trump in position to make a bid for the nomination by entering into a unity agreement with either Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich. A Cruz win would most likely mean defeat for Trumpâ€™s overall presidential ambitions. Though Trump would almost certainly still hold a delegate lead, his loss would signal rejection by the party as its nominee. Cruz might hope to win the nomination in a floor fight at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
