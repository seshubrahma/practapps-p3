Trump won with 289 electoral votes compared to 218 for Clinton, according to CNN projections.   Latest election results, Trumpâ€™s supporters embraced his plainspoken style, assault on political correctness and vow to crush what he portrayed in the final days of his campaign as a corrupt, globalized elite    epitomized by the Clintons    that he claimed conspired to keep   Americans down. His winning coalition of largely white,   voters suggests a populace desperate for change and disillusioned with an entire generation of political leaders and the economic and political system itself. Now, Trump faces the task of uniting a nation traumatized by the ugliest campaign in modern history and ripped apart by political divides exacerbated by his own explosive rhetoric    often along the most tender national fault lines such as race and gender.
