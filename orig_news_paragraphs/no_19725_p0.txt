Updated 6:01 p. m. EST, The Army has issued a new regulation: Effective immediately,   commanders will be able to grant accommodations to servicemen and women who wear beards, turbans, or hijabs for religious reasons —  the three most common requests for waivers to current guidelines on grooming and dress, according to a letter from the Secretary of the Army, Eric Fanning. The new guidelines also revise hairstyle standards for female soldiers: They can now wear dreadlocks, cornrows, or twists, provided they’re relatively small, uniform, neat, and tied off inconspicuously, and they don’t have to request an accommodation to do so.
