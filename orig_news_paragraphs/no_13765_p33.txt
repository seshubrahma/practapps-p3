I gave him an update on what I know. They told me that they had a team of about 20 lawyers currently working to get everyone freed and that they were planning to provide bond for everybody. They said that they had found out most people were being charged with obstructing a roadway and that the bond should be about $250. I asked the other inmates for their attention for a moment, then explained to them who the National Lawyers Guild was and what was going on.
