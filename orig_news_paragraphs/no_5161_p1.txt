[On the eighth year of Savageâ€™s ban from Britain, World Net Daily has launched a petition calling on President Trump to demand Britain remove Michael Savage from its travel ban list. The petition reads in part:   Therefore, we hereby add our names to this petition calling on President Donald J. Trump and his State Department to demand of the British government that it remove Michael Savage from its travel ban. It is outrageous that a Western nation would ban a popular American commentator with millions of listeners and several New York Times bestselling books to "balance" its list, apparently fearing it would be accused of being biased against Muslims.
