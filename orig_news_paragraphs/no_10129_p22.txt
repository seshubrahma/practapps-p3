The Watertown Daily Times offered little on Trump’s Saturday visit, other than to note some protesters had been removed from the event. In 2009, the majority of the 21st Congressional District was part of the 23rd Congressional District, the scene of the first battle between a Tea Party insurgent, Douglas Hoffman, and an establishment Republican, Dede Scozzafava, both of whom competed in the special election to replace incumbent Rep. John McHugh, a Republican, who had resigned his seat to become President Obama’s Secretary of the Army. In that race, the Watertown Daily Times endorsed Scozzafava. Hoffman was denied the GOP nomination in an   coup for Scozzafava, but running on the Conservative Party line and benefitting from outside help from groups like FreedomWorks hurt Scozzafava in the polls so badly she ultimately withdrew from the race.
