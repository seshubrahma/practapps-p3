The West York Council President Shawn Mauck told CNN on Thursday that Waskoâ€™s "actions have been absolutely deplorable," and said he does not have the power to remove Wasko from his position but "the community itself and colleagues have reached out to him and asked for his resignation. " Mauck has not been able to get in touch with Wasko. Mauck said the council plans to address this issue Monday through a censure vote to "censure him and formally distance our government from those actions," and he said he has no doubts that the vote will be unanimous.
