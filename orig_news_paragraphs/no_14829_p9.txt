We know most of the solutions, we need to figure out how to stage them, how to put them together in a package, how to silence the voices at either end of the political spectrum that are the reasons we haven’t been successful in the past and solve the problem," Tillis said at a Bipartisan Policy Center event earlier this month.   Tillis suggested putting together pairs of compromises that satisfy both sides to gain momentum. He said he’d start with border security    a key issue to conservatives    and pair that with legislation codifying protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, covered under the Obama administration DACA program. From there, he said, deals could be made on visa reform and   as well as enforcement against employers who abuse illegal immigration.
