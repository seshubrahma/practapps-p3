There is a tendency for very technologically focused solutions to the challenges in the Pacific without any real input from the Pacific Islanders themselves," he added. Simon Donner, a geography professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who studies the effects of climate change in the Pacific Islands, said that the French Polynesia project looked intriguing and that he had no reason to doubt that its backers were well intentioned. But he said the project reflected a cruel reality: The developed world is both responsible for climate change and better able to cope with it. The French Polynesia project would effectively be a "cruise ship," Professor Donner said.
