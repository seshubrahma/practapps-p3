While the US sent Matt Pottinger, special assistant to the President, no cabinet or elected officials were in attendance.   In a communique announcing a new trade deal with China Thursday, the US said it "recognizes the importance of China’s One Belt and One Road initiative," but Washington is largely uninvolved in OBOR or connected projects like the   Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Speaking to CNN Saturday, AIIB President Jin Liqun was positive that the US could still play a role in China’s projects, saying that "regardless of the membership of the US . .. we can work together."
