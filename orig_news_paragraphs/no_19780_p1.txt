Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, on his   record during the first day of Senate confirmation hearings. Retired General John Kelly, Trump’s choice to head the Department of Homeland Security, said he has "high confidence" in the U. S. intelligence community ’s conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election. Republicans postponed Senate confirmation hearings for Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary, Representative Mike Pompeo, the nominee for CIA director, and Andrew Puzder, the nominee for labor secretary.
