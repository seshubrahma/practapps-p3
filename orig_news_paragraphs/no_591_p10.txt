At three    meetings over the weekend, Mr. Sensenbrenner sat at the front of the room to take questions from people who submitted slips of paper listing their name and address. When he called on people, he read their names and where they live   â€”   a practice that makes people "less likely to make fools of themselves," he said in the interview. At the meetings, he faced crowds that were adversarial but generally civil, and he fielded questions on a range of issues.
