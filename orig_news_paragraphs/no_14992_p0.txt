 (CNN) Florida’s growing manatee population is a "dramatic turnaround" from the 1970s, the federal government said as it officially removed the aquatic creatures from the endangered list. The West Indian manatee will now be considered threatened    a marker of progress in the species’ recovery. Environmental and animal groups decried Thursday’s announcement from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, saying it is premature and comes without a firm   recovery plan.
