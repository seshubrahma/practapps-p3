" I don’t think this dramatically changes anything in the mayoral race," said Bruce N. Gyory, a Democratic political consultant. The biggest challenge coming out of this election in relation to the mayor is not the politics, said Mr. Gyory, but the double blow of Mr. Trump  —   who this year called Mr. de Blasio the "worst mayor" in city history  —   and Republican opposition in Albany.
