Do y’all remember that one time we had to do our onstage     introductions, but this one guy treated us like cattle and made     us do it again because we didn’t look him in the eyes? Do you     also remember when he then proceeded to have us lined up so he     could get a closer look at his property?   …      Oh I forgot to     mention that guy will be in the running to become the next     President of the United States.
