Covering 490, 000 square miles, it’s three times the size of California, and bigger than all the   national parks combined. For two years, it was the world’s largest marine reserve, until Obama smashed his own record in August 2016. Working off another Bush legacy, he quadrupled the size of Hawaii’s Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument to 583, 000 square miles —  twice the size of Texas. The area houses over 7, 000 marine species including many found nowhere else in the world.
