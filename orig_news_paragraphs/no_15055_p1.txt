Gabbard’s remarks came after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, "We have a very high level of confidence that the attacks were carried out by aircraft under the direction of the Bashar   regime," and President Donald Trump said: "There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons. "  CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Gabbard if she didn’t believe the President, the secretary of state and Pentagon officials, all of whom came to the same conclusion: that Assad’s regime was responsible. Gabbard mentioned the previous invasion of Iraq, and the intelligence that suggested Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false.
