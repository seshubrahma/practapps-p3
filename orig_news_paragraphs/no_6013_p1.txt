[The trip will be Sisi’s first U. S. state visit since being elected president in 2014 as former U. S. President Barack Obama had never extended an invitation.   Sisi was elected a year after leading the military’s ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood’s President Mohamed Mursi after mass protests. Trump invited Sisi in January but the date of the visit had not been announced.
