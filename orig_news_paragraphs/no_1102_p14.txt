It was the latest development in a week in which bipartisan cooperation quickly collapsed. Last week, without consulting Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nunes bumped a planned public hearing with James R. Clapper Jr. the former director of national intelligence John O. Brennan, the former C. I. A. director and Ms. Yates, who was fired after she instructed Justice Department officials to not carry out Mr. Trumpâ€™s first proposed travel ban. Tensions had escalated on Monday after the confirmation that Mr. Nunes had traveled to the White House grounds last week to view what he described as classified intelligence documents. A day after that, he announced to the news media, and then to Mr. Trump, that he had seen information indicating that members of the Trump transition team may have been caught up in legal surveillance.
