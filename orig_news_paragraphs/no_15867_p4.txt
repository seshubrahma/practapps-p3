Trump has not been briefed on the full strategy, but has been receiving "periodic updates," the official said. Trump’s top Cabinet officials on national security matters, the National Security Council and the US ambassadors in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India have all been involved in formulating the administration’s policy review, the official said. The US faces a slew of complex problems in Afghanistan that go beyond the United States’ military campaign against the Taliban and   which dates back to 2001. Now, the US is also facing an increasingly aggressive insurgency from ISIS Khorasan, the terror group’s Afghanistan affiliate, and is also becoming increasingly wary of Iran’s deepening influence in the country.
