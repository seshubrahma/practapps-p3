The release of the top pages of Trumpâ€™s 2005 tax return is a useful start, but is a drop in the disclosure bucket of what Trump owes the American people," Edward Kleinbard, the Johnson Professor of Law and Business at USC Gould School of Law and a former chief of staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation, told CNNMoney. Kleinbard said that the disclosures gave no indication about any business links between Trump and Russia. " Only complete returns can resolve the questions swirling around his alleged financial obligations and sources of income, such as Russian oligarchs or other sovereign countries," Kleinbard said.
