In January, the Obama administration changed the rules governing how the National Security Agency may share raw surveillance it intercepts abroad, where the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does not apply and the agency may vacuum up private communications in bulk. Previously, only analysts at the agency were permitted to search through the raw trove of this information, applying "minimization" rules to information about Americans before sharing anything more widely in the government. Now, analysts from the other 16 intelligence agencies  —   including the F. B. I.  —   can sift through certain streams of raw intercepts themselves, applying "minimization" rules afterward. Some conservative commentators, like Fox News’s Sean Hannity, have floated the theory that news media leaks about contacts between people affiliated with Mr. Trump and Russians may be attributable to this change, asking why Mr. Obama opened the door to many more officials across the government having access to raw National Security Agency intercepts.
