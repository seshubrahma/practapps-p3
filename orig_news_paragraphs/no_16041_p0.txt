Washington (CNN) A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Trump by just two points, 42% to 40% a much closer race than other recent surveys have shown.   With   candidates included, Clinton leads 39% to 37% with Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson at 8% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4%.   This Quinnipiac poll is quite different from other recent surveys on the presidential race, showing a much tighter contest than others.
