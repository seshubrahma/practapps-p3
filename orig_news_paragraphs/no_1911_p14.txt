The setting was Mr. Trump’s marble and gold, Louis   residence on the 58th floor, with sweeping views of New York and Central Park. Mr. Trump, with General Flynn at his side, sat next to Mr. Abe under an enormous crystal chandelier as Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka looked on. The formality of the setting contrasted with the freewheeling style that Mr. Trump adopts in his cluttered corner office on the 26th floor, where aides, his children and his longtime assistant, Rhona Graff, move busily in and out as he holds court behind his desk. Mr. Trump, who does not use a computer or read online, does keep an eye on the television, particularly the   news about himself.
