Speaking at a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Kelly insisted that the order put in place last Friday by Trump is not the Muslim ban that the president promised on the campaign trail. Instead, he labeled it a "temporary pause" that will allow the Trump administration time to review its immigration vetting procedures. " This analysis is long overdue and strongly supported by the department’s career intelligence officials," Kelly said of the procedural review that the government will pursue while Trump’s executive order is in effect.
