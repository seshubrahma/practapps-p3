 (CNN)"La La Land" didn’t sweep Sunday’s 89th Academy Awards as expected, but it did take home the major awards    at least for a minute.   Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty presented "La La Land" as the winner of the best picture award, and the celebration began on stage but was quickly ended when one of the "La La Land" winners pointed out that in fact "Moonlight" had won the award.   Beatty said a moment later that he had opened the envelope and read a card which said "Emma Stone and La La Land. "
