It is hard to believe that 5, 000 American troops would be a threat to Russia â€™s security, inasmuch as Russia has something like 330, 000 troops along its western border. Furthermore, Russia has   Iskander cruise missiles in Kaliningrad that can be made nuclear. The US deployment is being described as a "tripwire" force, designed to prevent Russia from getting away with an easy invasion of some other country, as they did with Georgia and Ukraine.
