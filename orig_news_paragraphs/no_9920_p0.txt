Monday, former NFL star Jim Brown appeared on ESPN’s "SportsCenter," and the Cleveland legend was asked to explain his previous comments where he said that things will eventually work out for the better now that Donald Trump has been elected as President Barack Obama’s successor.   Brown, who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, said Trump will either "shake things up the right way" or "shake things up the wrong way," which would lead to a resistance. He added that he is "pulling for" Trump, and he knows the   will "be for all the people. "
