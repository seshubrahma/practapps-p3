Having said that, I see far more evidence of Trump support here in the "liberal" and "educated" Northeast than perhaps for any other candidate in my lifetime. And I tend to think the "white working class" story line is more media mythology. Trump has tapped into a vein of anger. He expresses himself much like our grandfathers did, before the   imposed by political correctness took over.
