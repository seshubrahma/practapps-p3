Mr. McAuliffe’s Republican predecessor, Gov. Bob McDonnell, moved to soften the lifetime ban in 2013, ordering that any nonviolent felon who had completed a sentence and paid all fines or restitution be automatically considered for   restoration. But Mr. McAuliffe caused a sensation in April when he went well beyond that, signing a sweeping executive order reinstating rights for nearly everyone who had completed prison sentences and met the terms of any supervised release: 206, 000   in all. Those whose crimes were nonviolent  —   about eight in 10   —   were immediately given the right to cast a ballot violent   were barred from voting until three years after successfully completing supervised release.
