Similarly in January of 2015, Flake joined Rubio in   an extreme immigration expansion bill â€”  known as the   Act. The bill would have allowed for a virtually unlimited expansion of Muslim immigration and of college graduates into the United States. Critics of the 2015 bill argued that its massive expansion of the controversial   program would hurt American workers and would allow employers to replace them with   foreign workers. However, this might not be much of a concern for Sen. Flake.
