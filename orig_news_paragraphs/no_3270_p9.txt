Under existing law, the Department of Justice (DOJ) can already move quickly to not only cut off future law enforcement grants to the city —   it can recoup past grants for any period of time the municipality was not 100 percent compliant with federal immigration law, according to U.

C. § 1373, a law that passed in 1996 to require local and state jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration officials or risk losing federal funding, Breitbart Texas previously reported.
