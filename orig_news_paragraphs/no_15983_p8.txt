That latter divide is about the same as the split between Obama and Clinton backers in   2008, when 43% said that if Clinton were still running, they’d prefer her as the party’s nominee. Stein and Johnson hold particular appeal among those Democrats and Republicans who would rather see their party nominate someone other than the presumptive nominee, with Johnson holding 16% among those Republicans and   who would prefer to nominate someone other than Trump, and Stein at 18% among those Democrats and   who favor Sanders. Republican voters who would rather see someone other than Trump at the helm of the GOP express more concern about a potential Trump presidency than do Democrats who wanted to see Sanders nominated. Among Republican voters who would prefer someone else to be the GOP nominee, nearly half, 47% say they would be afraid if Trump were elected.
