Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton leads in a   contest with 42 percent of the vote, compared to Donald J. Trump with 37 percent, Libertarian Gary Johnson with 9 percent, and 3 percent for Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein, according to a   national poll conducted Aug. 9 with 2, 832 likely voters. ["This is a   race, but the question is if Johnson and Stein can hold their voters through the general," said Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the   firm that executed the poll. The poll carries a 1. 8 percent margin of error with the 95 percent confidence level. The total may not round to 100 percent because of rounding.
