The event is part of a local Catholic tradition where community presents the struggle between good and evil. The tradition calls for community members to set fire to an effigy of Judas Iscariot who, according to Catholic beliefs, is the apostle that turned Jesus in to the Pharisees.   For several years residents in various Mexican communities have opted to use Mexican politicians or other controversial figures instead of Judas. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, Mexican news outlets and some politicians like former President Vicente Fox have vilified Trump over his public call to have Mexico pay for a wall between the two nations as well as his strong stance on illegal immigration.
