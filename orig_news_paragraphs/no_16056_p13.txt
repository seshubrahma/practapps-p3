The image    which drew a rebuke from the national leader of the   League and others    is identical to the one posted on Trump’s Twitter account, except it does not include the graphic of a Fox News poll. Just as in Trump’s original tweet, the graphic features a pile of $100 dollar bills and the words "most corrupt candidate ever" on top of a   star, which evokes the Jewish Star of David. Before deleting the original tweet, Trump tweeted the same graphic with a tweak: a circle instead of the star. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski dismissed the controversy in an interview with CNN’s Brianna Keilar on "State of the Union" Sunday.
