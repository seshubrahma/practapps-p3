Tuesday on MSNBC, Rep. Luis Gutiérrez ( ) said he was confident Americans will fight back against President Donald Trump’s agenda because he explained, "I’m really not that used to, and I’ve been in Congress 24 years, the number of white women coming up to talk to me. "   Gutiérrez said, "He at this point enters into the presidency with an approval rating that we have not seen in recent history for a president beginning, and he hasn’t had an auspicious start with his, you know, alternate realities and alternate facts that he gives us. Everything in Trump’s world is something that he manufactures to fit his scheme of the world. And his scheme of the world is not one that’s fitting with the reality.
