Here is a brief guide to the accusations each woman has made against Bill and Hillary Clinton. Ms. Jones is a former Arkansas state employee who sued Mr. Clinton for sexual harassment in 1994. She claimed that he exposed himself to her and propositioned her in a hotel room in 1991 when he was governor. Ms. Jones’s lawsuit led to Mr. Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 because it was during a deposition in that case that he first denied having had sexual relations with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
