Biden described his afternoon meeting with Obama and law enforcement leaders as candid, with at least two organizations telling the administration that they were not doing enough to support police officers. He said the White House should reexamine how extensively cops are trained    especially on   conflict    and additional equipment they can receive from the military. " There’s nothing inconsistent with supporting the police and acknowledging the problems that exist in terms of dealing with the communities that, in fact, are feeling put upon," Biden said, summarizing Obama’s message.
