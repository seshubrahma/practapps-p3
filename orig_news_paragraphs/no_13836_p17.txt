But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year    and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees    that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.   The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.   According to the bank of Mexico, Mexico received $24. 8 billion in remittance payments in 2015.
