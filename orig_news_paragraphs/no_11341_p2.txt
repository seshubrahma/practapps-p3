Of the 10, 801 refugees accepted in fiscal 2016 [as of September 1] from the   country, 56 are Christians, or .5 percent. A total of 10, 722 were Muslims, and 17 were Yazidis. The numbers are disproportionate to the Christian population in Syria, estimated last year by the U. S. government to make up roughly 10 percent of the population. Since the outbreak of civil war in 2011, it is estimated that between 500, 000 and 1 million Christians have fled the country, while many have been targeted and slaughtered by the Islamic State.
