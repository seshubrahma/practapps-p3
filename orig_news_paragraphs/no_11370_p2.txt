Everyone else is in single digits. If the early exit polls stand up, Trumpâ€™s win in a state with 75% evangelicals is nothing short of remarkable, a sign after his blowout victory in New Hampshire, that he can win anywhere. Rubio is also a story here, earning a big comeback after a disastrous debate and an even more disastrous 5th place showing in New Hampshire. A second or third place showing in South Carolina, and the almost certain elimination of   laners Jeb Bush and John Kasich, gives Rubio a future.
