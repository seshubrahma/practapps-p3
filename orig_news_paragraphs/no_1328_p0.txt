HOLLYWOOD, Fla.  —    The Republican National Committee is scaling back its financial commitments to some of the most hotly contested states because of flagging   the most concrete evidence yet of how the party’s divisive and protracted presidential race is threatening the party’s entire ticket in November. Committee officials outlined detailed plans in written "playbooks" distributed this year in the most competitive states about how they intended to assist Republican campaigns up and down the ballot with money and manpower. By July 1, Florida was to have 256 field organizers and Ohio another 176, for example, according to a state party chairman in possession of the strategy books who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.
