One of the big holdups has been the cases of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.   Pyongyang has admitted and apologized for the incidents, but it’s yet to provide an explanation that was acceptable to the Japanese    who say that diplomatic relations can’t be normalized until the abduction issue is resolved. North Korea ’s hostility toward Japan stems from its close relations to South Korea    which Japan calls its "most important neighbor"    and the United States.
