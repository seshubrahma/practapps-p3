The United States has 16 Aegis BMD ships assigned to Pacific Fleet complemented by Japan’s four deployed Aegis   KONGO Class Destroyers. Since 2002, Aegis BMD has a stellar test record  —   34 hits (3 with Japanese KONGOs) and only 6 misses. Aegis is well suited to shoot a   or Musudan out of the sky. American taxpayers have provided more than $180 billion to the MDA since 1985, including more than $16 billion for Aegis.
