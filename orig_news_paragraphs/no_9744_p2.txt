And the Bushes and   Republicans appear at the center of every turn in it. Almost instantly, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush —  a bitter Trump rival who has broken his pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee for president —  denounced Trump, as did failed 2012 Republican nominee and fellow   activist Mitt Romney. As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.   —   Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 7, 2016,
