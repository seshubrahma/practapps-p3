TEL AVIV  —    A leading Arabic newspaper this week published a damning column by a Saudi journalist claiming that Palestinians have missed too many opportunities for peace with Israelis and have always blamed others for their problems, even long before settlements existed, and further added that it was time for Hamas to end its violence against Israel as well as their futile dream of a "Palestine from the river to the sea. " [Writing in the         daily while President Donald Trump was on his state visit to Saudi Arabia, Mash’al   a columnist from the Gulf kingdom, asserted that from the 1940s until the present day, "Palestinian leaders, while in power, excelled in two things: rhetoric and missing opportunities. "   He criticized the Palestinians for their blanket refusal to accept the 1947 UN partition plan, which would have given them 49% of mandatory Palestine, far more than what is commonly discussed today in the   solution.
