Above the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor in August of 2015, you can see the fields of steel containers used to store radioactive water after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. But other pictures show things like environmental endeavors (massive wind and solar farms) land art (Robert Smithsonâ€™s gyring "Spiral Jetty" on the Great Salt Lake in Utah and an Argentine forest in the shape of a guitar) and the dazzling geometries of human habitation (  cities in Italy and the Netherlands, a    artificial island in Dubai). Perhaps most compellingly for many Americans right now, the project shows swing states like Florida, Nevada and North Carolina as pleasing, placid abstractions, neither red nor blue. A residential development in Delray Beach, Fla. looks like a Mondrian painting.
