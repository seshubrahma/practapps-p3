[Though Trump’s interior enforcement of U. S. immigration laws has resulted in far fewer illegal crossings at the border, agents say that low numbers will not be sustained because the Trump Administration has not actually made substantial changes within border security as a whole.   Border Patrol Agent Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) spoke with Breitbart Texas on Trump’s quiet continuation of Obama’s catch and release. He stated, "Obama’s catch and release is definitely continuing and our government is releasing illegal aliens into U. S. communities. The steps taken for such releases have slightly changed and the numbers are not as high, but it is still occurring.
