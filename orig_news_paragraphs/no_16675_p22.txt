In the   Poll, 71% of white   voters said they always vote in presidential elections, and 79% rated the chances that they would vote a 10 out of 10. But both figures were smaller than among whites who do have college degrees, about 9 in 10 in that group said they always vote and would be very likely to this time around. But a   poll in early September found almost no difference between whites with degrees and those without in terms of enthusiasm about voting this year.    percent of white college graduates were extremely or very enthusiastic, as were 43% of white   registered voters.
