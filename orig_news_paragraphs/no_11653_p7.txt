I have never seen a Republican presidential nominee even get involved in the Democrat convention. My experience is that the playbook in the professional, insider world of politics is that when one party is having its convention, the other party goes silent. They don’t run any ads, they don’t do any press conferences, they don’t do any appearances   —   or very few.
