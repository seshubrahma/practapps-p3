Mr. Obama, in one of his first acts as president, issued an executive order banning many of the harshest interrogation techniques and prohibiting the C. I. A. from running secret prisons. Mr. Trump would need to rescind that executive order as a first step. That would allow the C. I. A. to once again open secret prisons overseas. The interrogation tactics, though, would still be limited.
