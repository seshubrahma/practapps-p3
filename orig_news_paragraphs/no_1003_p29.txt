Three lawyers and two legal assistants help drivers contest parking tickets, summonses from the taxi commission and other violations  —   more than 3, 000 of them so far   —   and accompany them to hearings. Fritz Foreste, 66, was sent to the center by his garage after he received a parking ticket. With the center’s help, the ticket was dismissed after he explained that he had left his yellow cab at a taxi relief stand for 15 minutes to take a bathroom break.
