The apparent document, dated a month ago, contains shocking details about an alleged Russian cyberattack on a supplier of US voting software, as well as malicious emails sent to voting officials in an attempt to hack their computers.

Winner was charged under the Espionage Act for the leak, and faces up to 10 years in prison.   Depending whom you ask, Winner is either a criminal or a whistleblower.
