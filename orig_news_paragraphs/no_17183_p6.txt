We can’t afford to see the kind of "Enemies List" that President Nixon’s advisers maintained of opponents, which included journalists like Daniel Schorr of CBS and columnist Mary McGrory. Journalists should not encounter hostile crowds who are egged on by a politician blasting the "rigged media," as occurred in the campaign.   The editors, producers and owners of the organizations’ reporters should not feel that presidents could possibly make policy decisions that affect them as retribution for a story.    Given what we know about Trump, it will be absolutely essential for every institution which has the responsibility of oversight to fulfill its mission of being a safeguard against presidential abuse.
