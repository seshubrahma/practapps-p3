The 2016 election has already showcased a whole lot of nasty   but Monday night has the potential to descend into the worst mudfight yet. Even before the debate had begun, the two campaigns were in full trolling mode. The Clinton campaign offered Mark Cuban    the TV celebrity billionaire who recently endorsed the Democratic nominee    a front row seat at Hofstra. Cuban has been relentless in attacking    in July, he said Trump "went off the reservation and went bats    crazy"    and he has also called out Trump for not releasing his tax returns.
