â€”    Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton reportedly fainted on the way to her van after she abruptly left the   memorial ceremony at Ground Zero of the attack on the 15th anniversary, having to be helped into her vehicle by a protective detail. Clinton, who was here and only about 20 feet away from Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, was listening along with Trump to the reading of the names lost in the terror attacks on this tragic day 15 years ago. Trump appeared at the ceremony around 8:20 a. m. receiving applause when he arrived, while Clinton arrived shortly before the first bell rang at 8:46 a. m. which is a citywide moment of silence in observance of time the first plane struck the North Tower.
