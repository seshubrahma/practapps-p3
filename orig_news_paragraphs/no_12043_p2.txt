Tanden, who served in the White House during both the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations and is president of the   progressive   Center for American Progress, made the comments during an interview for Politico’s "Off Message’" podcast. The Clinton confidante came out and said that the "Russians are openly funding the   groups, from [Britain’s] UKIP to [French political leader] Marine Le Pen" saying that "there is widespread knowledge among the   parties that that is a rising development".   Mr. Farage said of Hillary and her "acolytes": "They have chosen me as a political football in this election campaign" referencing Clinton’s recent rant where she singled out and accused the UKIP MEP of being in bed with Russian president Vladimir Putin.
