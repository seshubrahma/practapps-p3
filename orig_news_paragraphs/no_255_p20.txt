Like Trump, Windrip sells himself as the champion of "Forgotten Men," determined to bring dignity and prosperity back to America’s white working class. Windrip loves big, passionate rallies and rails against the "lies" of the mainstream press. His supporters embrace this message, lashing out against the "highbrow intellectuality" of editors and professors and policy elites. With Windrip’s encouragement, they also take out their frustrations on blacks and Jews.
