However, according to the Huffington Post, one joke in particular has Sony executives nervous. Metro reports that in a scene in the latter half of the film, Trump contracts AIDS after accidentally swallowing the blood of Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe (played in the film by a double) who contracts the virus earlier in the film. The Telegraph reports that the scene was originally written to have the Queen of England contract the virus, but it was deemed to be too offensive and switched out for Trump in the final cut. The UK paper reports that the scene in which Trump contracts AIDS drew "loud cheering" at the filmâ€™s premiere, and the Huffington Post adds that it drew standing ovations at screenings across Europe.
