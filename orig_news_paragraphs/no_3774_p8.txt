What we find in our data is a network of     sites that revive what Richard Hofstadter called "the paranoid style in American politics," combining decontextualized truths, repeated falsehoods, and leaps of logic to create a fundamentally misleading view of the world. " Fake news," which implies made of whole cloth by politically disinterested parties out to make a buck of Facebook advertising dollars, rather than propaganda and disinformation, is not an adequate term. By repetition, variation, and circulation through many associated sites, the network of sites make their claims familiar to readers, and this fluency with the core narrative gives credence to the incredible.
