President Trump, who pressed President Xi Jinping of China on trade and other issues this week when they met at    in Palm Beach, Fla. has vowed to end what he calls China’s unfair business practices. Much of his oratory has involved   smokestack industries like steel  —   industries in which the jobs were already disappearing even before the rise of China. But economists and business groups warn that China’s industrial ambitions have entered a new,   phase. With its deep government pockets, growing technical sophistication and a comprehensive plan to free itself from dependence on foreign companies, China aims to become dominant in industries of the future like renewable energy, big data and   cars.
