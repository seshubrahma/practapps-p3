Many of those splits have narrowed in favor of Trump, according to the L. A. Times poll. For example, Clinton’s lead among women is only seven points, according to the poll, while Trump has an   lead among men. Also, the poll shows Clinton with support from only 51 percent of Hispanics, and Trump with 30 percent support. That leaves 19 percent uncommitted, which suggests that Trump’s Hispanic   support may be significantly higher than 30 percent.
