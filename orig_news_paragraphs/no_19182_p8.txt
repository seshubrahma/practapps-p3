" They’re eminently fixable   problems in terms of strengthening the marketplace, improving the   subsidies so more folks can get it, making sure everybody has   Medicaid who was qualified under the original legislation, doing   more on the cost containment. But you hit a point where if   Congress just is not willing to make any constructive   modifications and it’s all political football, then you’re   getting a suboptimal solution.
