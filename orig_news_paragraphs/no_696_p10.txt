While the Studio Museum will tackle activism through a creative lens, a discussion on Tuesday at the National Black Theater will ask panelists to look inward to ponder the emotional expressions of resistance. The aim of "Black Joy as an Expression of Resistance and Liberation" is to shine a light on the importance of cultivating and seeking out diverse narratives of black lives and opposing stereotypical depictions that pop up across the media. The panelists  —   including the actress Zoë Kravitz, Larry   of ARTNOIR and the Afropunk founder, Matthew Morgan   —   will also discuss the importance of caring for oneself as well as those in your circle of friends and family.
