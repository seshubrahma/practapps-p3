Macron’s long walk, Later Sunday night, Macron addressed thousands of supporters outside the Louvre in Paris where he also attempted to reach out to those who had voted for Le Pen. After taking a long walk towards the stage to Ludwig van Beethoven’s "Ode to Joy," the anthem of the European Union, Macron spoke of the need for unity. He chided his supporters for booing at the mention of Le Pen’s name and instead urged the country to come together.
