Mr. Inslee, who backed a lawsuit against the president’s executive order banning refugee admissions and travel from seven   countries, said Democrats intended to send a stern message to Mr. Trump during a conference of governors in the nation’s capital. " My belief is, we have to resist every way and everywhere, every time we can," when Mr. Trump offends core American values, Mr. Inslee said. By undermining Mr. Trump across the board, he said, Democrats hope to split Republicans away from a president of their own party.
