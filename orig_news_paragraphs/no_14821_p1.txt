" It’s such a privilege for all of us to be able to be used as a vessel to tell this sacred story,"   said, "and in paying homage to our ancestors, I think we’ve all gained so much inspiration and hope and just being able to reach back and hold on to these revolutionaries, these real heroes who changed our nation." "Underground" chronicles the story of a group of slaves and their grueling   escape from a Georgia plantation in the 1850s.
