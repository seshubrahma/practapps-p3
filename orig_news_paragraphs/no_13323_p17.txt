Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald has similarly documented that the reason there is a greater police presence in black neighborhoods is because there are higher crime rates in those neighborhoods: "In 2013, there were 6, 261 black homicide victims in the U. S. —  almost all killed by black civilians —  resulting in a death risk in inner cities that is ten times higher for blacks than for whites. " Mac Donald writes: The police, by contrast, according to published reports, kill roughly 200 blacks a year, most of them armed and dangerous, out of about 40 million   contacts a year.
