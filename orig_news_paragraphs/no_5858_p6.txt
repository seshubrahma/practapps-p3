Google Ventures later sued Uber, claiming the theft of its autonomous driving   detection system by a company run by an   engineer that Uber acquired. The complaint states that through the acquisition, Uber allegedly obtained 9. 7 GB of Google data and 14, 000 documents illegally downloaded to a laptop that was then wiped to hide the crime. Uber was hammered in   when former site reliability engineer Susan Fowler wrote a blog post claiming Uber reeked of blatant sexual harassment and that the human resources department allowed "high performing" male superiors to solicit sex from female employees. Fowler claimed that if the females didnâ€™t give their superiors what they wanted, the males could give females bad job reviews.
