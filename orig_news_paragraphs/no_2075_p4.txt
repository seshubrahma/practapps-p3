Conservative attorneys general in states including Texas, Virginia and Florida have sued the Obama administration dozens of times, systematically battering Mr. Obama’s signature health care, environmental and immigration policies in the courts. One of them, Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, who used his office to bayonet Mr. Obama’s   regulations, was just chosen by Mr. Trump to become the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Schneiderman  —   who established himself early as a nuisance to Mr. Trump when he sued him over Trump University, negotiating a $25 million settlement   —   pounced on the Pruitt selection, calling him "an agent of the oil and gas industry" and promising to push an E. P. A. under Mr. Pruitt to uphold environmental laws.
