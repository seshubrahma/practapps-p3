The document was authored by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump. Last month, Steele conceded in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified. The Steele document, which Page refers to as the "Dodgy Dossier," makes the unsubstantiated claim that Page met with Russian officials as an envoy for the Trump campaign to discuss policy issues and topics related to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Page has steadfastly denied meeting any of the officials mentioned in Steeleâ€™s dossier and he says he never served as an envoy for the Trump campaign.
