Before the elections, Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas called Tim Kaine a "cafeteria Catholic" and questioned why he claimed to be "personally  " while affirming his support of Roe v. Wade and consistently voting to keep    legal. Similarly, Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila told Catholics that life issues —  and especially opposition to abortion —  had to take absolute precedence in deciding whom to vote for in November’s elections. " Catholics in good conscience cannot support candidates who will advance abortion," he wrote in the diocesan newspaper, The Denver Catholic.
