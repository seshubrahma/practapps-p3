Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Neil today, Mrs. James laid out what she thought of as the direction for UKIP, as she attempted to set out her ambition to make it the main opposition in UK politics.   Speaking this morning, Mrs. James said: "My vision  …     is global, is positive, is outward looking, is enterprise building, and is going to make this country great again". Mrs. James told the BBC interviewer that her political idols were Vladimir Putin, Margaret Thatcher, and Winston Churchill. Mr. Neil challenged the new leader, remarking that now Britain had voted for Brexit UKIP was a party without purpose.
