Washington (CNN)   Donald Trump took to Twitter Tuesday evening to deride the US intelligence agencies due to brief him on alleged Russian hacking of American political groups. It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief and again put him at odds with the agencies’ unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an " ’intelligence’ briefing on   ’Russian hacking’ " that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time "to build a case.
