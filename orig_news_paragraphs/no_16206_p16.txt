That was enough Wednesday for Steve Stepanek,   of the Trump campaign in New Hampshire, to call on delegates to boycott Kasich’s speech to the New Hampshire delegation. " Gov. Kasich has refused to endorse Donald Trump, he refused to welcome us as Republican delegates to his great state of Ohio. He’s refused to participate in the Republican National Convention, which I think is totally inappropriate," Stepanek told CNN.
