In his testimony earlier this month before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight,   Director James B. Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agency â€™s ties to Steele or the dossier, including whether the document was used in the Russia probe. The partially discredited dossier contains wild and unproven claims that the Russians had information on Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed. Steele was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump.
