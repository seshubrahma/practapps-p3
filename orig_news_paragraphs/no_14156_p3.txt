Phillipsâ€™ remarks were apparently noticed by Trump, who tweeted minutes later that he was looking forward to reviewing the results of the investigation.   Phillips, a former Texas Health and Human Services Commission deputy commissioner, is the founder of a   described big data healthcare software company focused on eligibility, enrollment and data verification, according to his website. He is also the founder of VoteStand,   as "the first mobile   fraud app," which appears to rely on users to submit evidence of suspected voter fraud.    Phillips rose to national prominence the Sunday after election day, before any states had certified their results, when he alleged  in a tweet that he had uncovered mass voter fraud, research which was debunked as "false" by Politifact.
