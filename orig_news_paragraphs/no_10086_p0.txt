Feminist Camille Paglia rakes her Democratic Party over the coals for using abortion as an "ideological tool" to raise campaign cash and drive votes. [At Salon, Paglia offers a brief history of "the abortion wars," inspired, in part, by what she calls "the abortion tar pit" fallen into by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton this past week:   Trump blundered his way through a manic inquisition about abortion by MSNBC’s resident woodpecker, Chris Matthews, while Hillary committed an unforced error on NBC’s "Meet the Press," where she referred to the fetus as an "unborn person," scandalizing the vast   lobby, who treat all attempts to "humanize" the fetus as a diabolical threat to reproductive rights. Paglia is a known critic of Clinton’s candidacy.
