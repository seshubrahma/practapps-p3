Citing investigative reporting by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) and advance reporting by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group, Rep. Louie Gohmert is calling for a congressional investigation into the connection between Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chairman, John Podesta, and Russia. [Podesta sat on the board of the   energy company alongside Russian officials who received $35 million from a   Russian government fund, Breitbart News reported last August, as revealed in a   GAI report titled "From Russia with Money: Hillary Clinton, the Russian Reset, and Cronyism. "   Now Gohmert, the Texas Republican firebrand who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, says Podesta’s role in the   firm "certainly needs to be reviewed to see if there really is something nefarious going on with these activities.
