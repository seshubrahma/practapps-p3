The US takes no position on the territorial dispute in the South China Sea but its warships have conducted "freedom of navigation" operations near the reclaimed islands, eliciting warnings from Beijing.   US Adm. Harry Harris, commander of US Pacific Command, said Wednesday that the US stood ready to confront Beijing over the contested waters.   " Iâ€™ve also been loud and clear that we will not allow the shared domains to be closed down unilaterally   no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South China Sea," he said in a speech in Sydney.
