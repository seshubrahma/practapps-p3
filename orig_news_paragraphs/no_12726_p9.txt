The editors make no mention of the fact that American citizens wash dishes in every city in every state all across this country. Nor do the editors mention that dishwasher and busboy positions have traditionally been an entrance for young Americans to make their way into the workforce.

Yet not only do the editors attack the GOP frontrunner and his policies but they also attack his supporters.
