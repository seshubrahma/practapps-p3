Moreover, even if the plan is upheld, some experts have concluded that Mr. Obama is likely to leave office without establishing policies sufficient to ensure the country will meet the pledge he offered in Paris: to reduce American emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent in 2025, compared with their level in 2005. The Rhodium Group, an economic consulting firm, has calculated that Mr. Obamaâ€™s plans may reduce emissions by only 23 percent or so. The White House contends that it is still on track to meet those targets, and Brian Deese, the White House climate change advisor, said he and his staff are now preparing models and plans to lay the groundwork for the next president to strengthen the current policies. The signing ceremony on Friday is only an intermediate step.
