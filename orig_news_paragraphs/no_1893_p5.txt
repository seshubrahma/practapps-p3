Transition officials have rejected claims that Mr. Kushner was involved in a payback effort and pointed to Mr. Christie’s troubles after two aides were convicted in the George Washington Bridge traffic scandal in New Jersey. They also suggested that the preliminary transition work had been subpar. Mr. Trump’s desire to add Mr. Kushner to his administration gives weight to speculation that he intends to run the White House the way he runs his businesses, relying heavily on his children and delegating essential duties to them. And it adds another element of unpredictability to an unconventional handover of power, although there were signs on Thursday that Mr. Trump’s transition operation was edging toward normalcy after its chaotic first week.
