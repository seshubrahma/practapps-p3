Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued his own call for a congressional investigation of the Russian hacking in a press conference Monday, in a notable break with Trump. He expressed "the highest confidence in the intelligence community, and especially in the Central Intelligence Agency" and said "it defies belief that somehow Republicans in the Senate are reluctant to either review Russian tactics or ignore them. " Asked about McConnell’s support for a deeper investigation into Russia’s role in the election, Trump spokesman Jason Miller called the ongoing focus on the role of Russian hacking the election "an attempt to try to delegitimize   Trump’s win.
