A Breitbart News source, who asked to be identified only as M. P. for fear of retaliation, spoke to the Christians and Yazidi in different parts of Iraq last month as the U. S.  local forces fought to push ISIS out of Mosul, the capital of northern Iraq’s Nineveh province. Retaking Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is expected to break the jihadist organization’s hold over its territory in the country and break its   caliphate up. The fight for Mosul, believed to be the ISIS’ last major stronghold, has been raging since  . Despite the toll the   genocide took on their community, not all Christians expressed reservations about their current predicament and future.
