Trump has been very critical of Rubio’s   positions on immigration, his work on trade, and Rubio’s horrendous attendance record when it comes to votes and national security briefings in the U. S. Senate. But he hasn’t gone as aggressively after Rubio as he has gone after, say, Bush. Rubio is the last remaining   candidate who’s got a clear shot at the nomination. Bush and Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie all could bounce back, but each of them is struggling and Rubio is the only   in the   of polling along with Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Dr. Ben Carson.
