Clinton also lost the   state of Wisconsin, where she had "had been blown out by Bernie Sanders in the Wisconsin primary" and failed to campaign for months after her partyâ€™s national convention: Turnout in Milwaukee, the key vote center for Democrats in Wisconsin, was off by sixty thousand or so votes from 2012, and nearly three dozen counties in the state saw the partisan margin from that year flip by 20 percentage points or more in 2016. Trump won 52 percent to 41 percent in Brown County, home of Green Bay, site of the visit that Hillary and Obama canceled after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando.
