The evidence for a whiter,   and older electorate comes from two main sources. The first  —   and    —   source of alternative data is the Current Population Survey, known as the C. P. S. Conducted by the Census Bureau, it is the same monthly survey that yields the unemployment report. After elections, it includes a question about whether people voted. A second source is the   voter file: a compilation of local records on every American who has registered to vote, including address, age and whether the person voted in a given election.
