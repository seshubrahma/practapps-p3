Construction is expected to start this year and to take at least five years. Isabella is an example of how dam spillways designed more than a   ago are now often inadequate, said Blake P. Tullis, a professor of civil engineering at Utah State University who has worked on the design of the new spillway. Climate change is part of the problem, he said, but other factors, like land use changes  —   more parking lots, for example, mean more runoff into rivers   —   and better weather data have also played a role.
