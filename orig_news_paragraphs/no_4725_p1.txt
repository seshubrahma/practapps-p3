The Labor Department, as Breitbart News has written, writes the workplace rules and regulations for most Americans. Under President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration, the Department of Labor effectively became the Department of Organized Labor. The Obama labor department was openly hostile to advocates of small government. In 2011  U. S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis insulted members of the Tea Party, referring to the activists as "teabaggers," as Breitbart News reported.
