 (CNN)"La La Land" swept Sunday’s 74th Golden Globe Awards and set a record. The musical film    starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling    won all seven of the awards for which it received nominations including best motion picture   musical or comedy, best director, best screenplay, best score and acting awards for its stars. Host Jimmy Fallon kicked off the broadcast with a taped sketch that riffed off "La La Land"    foreshadowing the winning theme of the night. Fallon’s monologue included some political humor    noting the Globes is "one of the few places left that still honors the popular vote"   and a small snafu.
