Republican leaders of the state legislature could not be reached for comment. Mr. Cooper, North Carolina’s attorney general, declared victory early Wednesday morning, when tallies from the state’s 2, 704 precincts showed him leading by just less than 5, 000 votes. For now, the only thing certain about the outcome is that lawyers from both sides will be closely monitoring the county boards as they determine which of the more than 50, 000 provisional ballots should be deemed legitimate. Mr. McCrory’s campaign announced on Wednesday that it was establishing a   fund in preparation for an "ongoing legal battle" over the vote tally.
