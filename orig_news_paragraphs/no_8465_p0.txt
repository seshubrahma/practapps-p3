GOP presidential candidates former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who are participating in the earlier GOP debate on Thursday, say they want to attend GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s event on Thursday night for veterans rather than the primetime GOP debate hosted by Fox News. [Huckabee was asked if he would attend, and the former Baptist minister admitted, "We’ve put in a call to [Trump’s] people and said that I’d be delighted to come. "  Huckabee, who hasn’t heard back, said, "If they say that they would be happy to have me, I’ll be there. "
