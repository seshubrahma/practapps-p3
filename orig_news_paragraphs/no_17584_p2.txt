To me, the conversation was itself a case study of the   Bridgewater discussion style, which includes lively debate and   open disagreement. ’ ’ Dalio has kept a low profile for most of his career at the   helm of Bridgewater, which he founded in the kitchen of his   apartment in Queens 40 years ago. He explained that until   recently he wanted to be "radically transparent within   Bridgewater and radically opaque to those outside it, but as   the media are now trying to pry open Bridgewater," he wants to   clarify what’’s going on. He also believes that the systems and   culture he has developed at Bridgewater, once fully understood,   would be useful well beyond the firm.
