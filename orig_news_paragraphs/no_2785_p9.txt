This year, a ranch in Texas went on the market for $700 million and a home in Dallas listed for $100 million. Both sold, but the actual sale prices have not been disclosed. The last time a sudden pop in $100   listings occurred was in 2007 and 2008, just before the housing crash. In 2008, at least four homes in the world listed for nine figures.
