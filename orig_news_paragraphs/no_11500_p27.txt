As one political operative previously told Breitbart, Warren’s views represent a brand of "George Clooney populism," in which one expresses views and sentiments that will be widely cheered by celebrities, entertainers, and media institutions that dominate the commercial culture. By contrast, in his   2014 Masters of Universe speech, Sessions called out billionaires and immigration expansionists Mark Zuckerberg, Carlos Slim, and Rupert Murdoch. Similarly, following Microsoft’s announcement that it was firing 18, 000 workers, Sessions took to the Senate floor to expose the "super billionaires"  —   such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Sheldon Adelson, for continuing to push for more   and cheap labor while laying off American workers. Many have suspected that as recompense for his willingness to take on his own party, GOP leadership pushed Sessions out of his Budget Committee Chairmanship in favor of Republican leadership ally, Mike Enzi.
