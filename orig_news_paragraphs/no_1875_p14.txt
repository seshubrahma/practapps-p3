Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who channels the populist outrage over Wall Street excess, even called on President Obama to designate a new S. E. C. leader because the agency had not required companies to disclose political contributions. In her first public remarks on the subject, Ms. White said in an interview that the criticism "really does come with the territory. " "I think I’m a very constructive recipient of constructive criticism," she said, adding: "It’s not like you like people to beat on your head, whoever they are, however baseless it is. "
