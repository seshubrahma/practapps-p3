A joke I’ve told 1, 000 people in the months since leaving Davos is that the conventional wisdom of Davos is always wrong," said the former IMF chief who is scheduled to attend Davos again this year along with some 3, 000 other members of the political, business, media, and academic elite. " No matter how improbable, the event most likely to happen is the opposite of whatever the Davos consensus is," he added. Davos also failed to predict the rise of populism in Europe, Italy’s rejection of constitutional change that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Mattheo Renzi, or the UK voting to leave the European Union (EU) which Forbes described as the "populist revolt against Davos Man".
