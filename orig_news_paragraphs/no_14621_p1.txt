And one of the worst comedic beat downs Trump ever took on national TV was in 2011, the last time Trump attended the White House Correspondents’ Dinner (WHCD) where he was comically crushed by comedian Seth Meyers (not to mention President Obama, who also got in a few good jabs). That’s why it shouldn’t surprise anyone that Trump announced on Saturday night via Twitter, two months ahead of time, that he wouldn’t be showing up at this year ’s WHCD: "I will not be attending the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening.
