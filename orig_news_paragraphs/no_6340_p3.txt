López fled Iraq in 2015 after being pressured to issue birth certificates and passports to   nationals with ties to Hezbollah. CNN caught up with López, whose story had not changed in two years. López claimed the Venezuelan embassy charged foreigners up to $15, 000 per passport, and emphasized that these were not counterfeit documents, but legal Venezuelan documents improperly produced for   nationals.
