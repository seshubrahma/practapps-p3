This is not the only time a member of the Obama administration reportedly influenced a decision by Comey. According to an extensive report in the New York Times, Attorney General Lynch, an Obama appointee, convinced Comey to use the word "matter" instead of "investigation" when the FBI director publicly addressed the criminal investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server. This despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal investigation. Comey reportedly caved in and called the investigation a "matter" even though, according to the Times, Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Clinton in the email probe.
