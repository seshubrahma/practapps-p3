Impeachment vote in Brazil. Legislators in the lower house of Congress voted on Sunday night to approve the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the nationâ€™s first female president. The Senate will vote by a simple majority, most likely next month, on whether to hold a trial on charges that she illegally used money from   banks to cover budget gaps during the worst economic crisis in decades. Many of those accusing her are themselves suspected of fraud and graft.
