Obama finally decided to take action, but against the   Islamic State or ISIS. On the matter of Assad’s fate, Washington stepped back meekly, allowing Russia and Hezbollah, Iran’s Lebanese ally, to jump in to save the Syrian dictator who has spilled oceans of blood. Vladimir Putin, ever more autocratic at home and aggressive abroad, moved into the vacuum. Now Russia sits side by side with the United States at failing talks in Geneva to discuss Syria’s future, and Assad confidently vows he will retake every inch of territory.
