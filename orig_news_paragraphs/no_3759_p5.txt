President Trump "is taking the next step in carrying out his campaign promise by appointing highly qualified and principled judges to the lower federal courts," Severino said. " The nominees have stellar qualifications and a record of courageous commitment to the rule of law that will make them excellent additions to the federal bench," she added. Ken Blackwell, a member of the American Civil Rights Union policy board who is also a former domestic policy advisor to Trump’s presidential transition team and former U. S. ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, gave his reaction, speaking exclusively with Breitbart News about the president’s selections.
