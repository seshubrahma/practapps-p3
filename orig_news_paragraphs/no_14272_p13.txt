On January 20, the night of Trump’s inauguration, a man was shot during protests outside Yiannopoulos’s event at the University of Washington in Seattle. According to the Seattle Times, Yiannopoulos briefly left the stage to confirm the shooting before returning to say, "If we don’t continue, they have won."   In his campus talks, Yiannopoulos spares few targets. He’s gone after Black Lives Matter activists and has argued rape culture on campuses doesn’t exist.
