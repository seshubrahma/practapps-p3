It was this week in 1941 that a group of miners halted traffic along Route 99 in Siskiyou County and handed out proclamations to motorists declaring the formation of Jefferson, a new state named after the author of the Declaration of Independence. With Yreka as its capital, Jefferson would include parts of both Oregon and California where resentments had simmered over the supposed neglect of politicians in the capitals of Salem and Sacramento. The journalist Lawrence E. Davies described the scene in the Nov. 28 edition of The New York Times: The agitators complained that the region was deprived of proper roads needed to transport their copper ore and timber. They vowed to barricade the highway every Thursday until their demands were met.
