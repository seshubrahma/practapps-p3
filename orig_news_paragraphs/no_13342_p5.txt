Since even before her husband, former President Bill Clinton, first took office in 1993, the Clintons have been working toward the effort that is now called Common Core  —   a set of nationalized standards developed by three organizations in Washington D. C.: the National Governors Association (NGA) the Council for Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and education company Achieve Inc. All three organizations were privately funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and none of these groups are accountable to parents, teachers, students, or taxpayers. During her first campaign event last year, Hillary Clinton praised Common Core, referring to it as "the most important   enterprise," and questioned how the nationalized reform could become so unpopular: And a lot of states  …    do not understand the value of a core in the sense, a Common Core, yes, of course, you can figure out the best way in your community to try to reach   —   but your question is a larger one.
