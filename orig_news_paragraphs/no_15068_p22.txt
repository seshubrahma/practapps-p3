A US military official told CNN the Pentagon was examining specifically whether a Russian warplane had bombed a hospital in Khan Sheikhoun five hours after the initial chemical attack, with the aim of destroying evidence. Russia flatly denies the allegations. Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the US strike as an "act of aggression" and said it violated international law. Tillerson said he was disappointed in the Russian response.
