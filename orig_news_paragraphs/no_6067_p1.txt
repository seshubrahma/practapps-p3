["We are a command at war, and will remain so for the foreseeable future," Army Gen. Tony Thomas, commander of U. S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) said at the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities hearing.   Thomas said about 8, 000 special operations forces are currently deployed in more than 80 countries. They are also on the forefront of the advising mission in Iraq and Syria and conducting a counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan. Thomas also said last month was difficult for SOCOM, when three special operators were killed in Afghanistan.
