Two days after Madonna shared her wish to blow up the White House, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D. .) has not come out with a statement condemning the outrageous desire that the pop singer expressed in her address to Saturday’s Women’s March on Washington’s National Mall. ["Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House," Madonna said to the cheers of tens of thousands of feminists and other opponents of President Donald J. Trump.   Breitbart News sought comment from Warren with an office visit, in addition to emails and a phone message.
