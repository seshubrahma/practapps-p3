Interestingly, as Gateway Pundit has pointed out, the number of Muslim soldiers who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan is the same number of those who have been killed by Muslim soldiers in America   —    Nidal Hasan and Hasan K. Akbar collectively killed 14 American soldiers on U. S. soil. This means that, if you include attacks on military recruiting bases, the number of American soldiers killed on U. S. soil by Muslims is greater than the number of Muslim soldiers killed on foreign soil wearing America’s uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan.
