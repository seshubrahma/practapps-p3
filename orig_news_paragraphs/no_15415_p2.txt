" Marlon is kind of famous because he is the first bunny to ever ride on Air Force Two. And we love Marlon. He’s named Marlon Bundo because he’s named after a famous movie star, Marlon Brando, and because my daughter got him when she was making a movie in college, and she needed a bunny to be the star.
