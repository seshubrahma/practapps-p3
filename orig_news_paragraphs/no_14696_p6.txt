However, about a mile up the winding, wooded road through the park, thereâ€™s an entrance to "CAMP #3," and signs reading "RESTRICTED AREA: DO NOT ENTER," with several other signs restricting parking and cameras. The area is enclosed with high   fences and watch houses.   Presidential visits to the camp were once an active part of Thurmont life.   Mayor John Kinnaird, a Thurmont resident since 1960, recalls a childhood attending church with President Lyndon Johnson and watching presidential motorcades roll through the downtown.
