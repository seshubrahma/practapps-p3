Camarotaâ€™s analysis is based on recent data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Census Bureau. According to the most recent DHS available data, nearly 150, 000 immigrants from the Muslim world permanently resettled in the U. S. in 2014. He explained: Absent the kind of change in policy that Donald Trump is talking about, it seems likely under the existing system that 600, 000 new immigrants from the Muslim world settle in the United States in the next four years. On top of that, Secretary Clinton has indicated that she would like to take in 65, 000 refugees from Syria next year.
