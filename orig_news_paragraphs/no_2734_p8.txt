The Sept. 8 meeting, and its confirmation in November, went largely unnoticed outside Taiwan until Friday, when Mr. Trump, the   received a congratulatory phone call from the island’s president, Tsai  . The call is believed to have been the first conversation between a Taiwanese leader and a United States president or   in close to four decades, and it threatens to upend the delicate United   relationship because Beijing views any communication with Taiwan’s leaders as an affront to its claim of sovereignty over the island. And even if it emerges that Ms. Chen was largely freelancing, and not acting on behalf of the Trump Organization, the perception of a possible business conflict in Taiwan further complicates the   relationship. Potential conflicts of interest for Mr. Trump as president have been documented around the world, including in Scotland, India, Brazil, the Philippines, Argentina and Turkey.
