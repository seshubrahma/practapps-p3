And even as he becomes the 12th candidate to throw his hat into a ring that will become even more crowded before the first televised debate in August, Trump could find himself grinning on Fox News along with the rest of the top 10 candidates who made the cut. Fox is limiting participation in the first debate to the top 10 GOP contenders based on national polling, and Trump is just on the edge based on the latest polls. He tied for 10th place with 3% in the latest   poll earlier this month and earned 4% in both the most recent Fox News and Washington   News polls    coming in 10th and tied for ninth, respectively. That puts Trump right in line with    like Santorum, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York Gov. George Pataki    and above hopefuls like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.
