Mr. Johnson called Mr. Fardon "a great partner" to the Police Department and said he agreed with Mr. Fardon’s call for more prosecutions on federal gun laws. He also addressed Mr. Fardon’s claim that police officers had become hamstrung and too passive on patrol. " Listen, there are things within C. P. D. that we did need to fundamentally change, and we’re changing them," Mr. Johnson said, adding that officers were focusing on arresting gun offenders and other serious criminals.
