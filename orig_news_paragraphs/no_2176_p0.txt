LOUISVILLE, Ky.  —    Donald J. Trump accused Hillary Clinton on Friday of wanting to let violent criminals out of prison and "disarm"   citizens in unsafe neighborhoods, and warned that women, in particular, would be at greater risk if she were elected president. Accepting the endorsement of the National Rifle Association at its annual convention here, Mr. Trump  —   who has not always been the staunchest opponent of stricter gun controls   —   said the November election would be a referendum on the Second Amendment.
