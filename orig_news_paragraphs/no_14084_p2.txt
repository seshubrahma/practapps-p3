At a press briefing Monday, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said he had discussed the issue with Flynn on Sunday. Spicer said there had been two calls between Flynn and the Russian ambassador and that they covered only four subjects: Setting up a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin exchanging holiday greetings offering condolences for lives lost in a Russian plane crash and a Syria conference on ISIS. In a statement Sunday night, a spokesman for Trump had said the White House has "absolutely no knowledge of any investigation or even a basis for such an investigation. "
