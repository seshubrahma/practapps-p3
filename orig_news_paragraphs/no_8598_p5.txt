#ImWithHer,  —   Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 11, 2016,   Concerns about the candidate’s health received renewed attention Sunday after Clinton left a September 11 memorial event in New York City early, and, in a video later posted online, stumbled and appeared to require help from aides while getting into her motorcade van. Clinton’s campaign issued a statement saying that the candidate had felt "overheated," before Clinton’s doctor, Dr. Lisa Bardack, said in a statement later Sunday that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. Earlier this month, FBI documents concerning the investigation into Clinton’s private email server released by the agency revealed that the former Secretary of State told investigators she could not recall every State Department briefing she received about handling sensitive material due to a concussion she had sustained in 2012.
