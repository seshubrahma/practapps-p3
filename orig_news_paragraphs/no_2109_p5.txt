"D. H. S. ceased use of Nseers more than five years ago, after it was determined the program was redundant, inefficient and provided no increase in security," Neema Hakim, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement. The program is "not only obsolete" and "outdated," but diverts personnel and resources from other areas that are seen as more effective, the statement said. Some experts say there is no need for a registry. Officials in the agency have long believed that the program has outlived its usefulness.
