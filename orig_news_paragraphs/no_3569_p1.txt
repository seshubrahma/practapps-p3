Economists expected nonfarm payrolls to grow by 190, 000, compared with 227, 000 in January. Unofficially, however, expectations have been rising this week following a blowout jobs figure from ADP on Wednesday. Wage pressure remains muted. Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents and 2. 8 percent on an annualized basis.
