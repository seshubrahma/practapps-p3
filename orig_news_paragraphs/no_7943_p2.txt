I don’t think it’s right or Left, you have to use more ‘insurgency’ if you will, if you had sort of an insurgent chart. And you’d have to say you have a really interesting argument, is Trump, who is a real total outsider more the insurgent, but he’s not as conservative ideologically or is Cruz, who is a militantly Conservative outsider the more insurgent outsider?" said Gingrich.   " You’d probably have to say Jeb Bush is probably the least insurgent and maybe Chris Christie is the second least insurgent," he added.
