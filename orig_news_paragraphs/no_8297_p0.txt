Tuesday on CNN’s "New Day," presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump surrogate and attorney Michael Cohen had a   battle with host Chris Cuomo over Trump’s attacks on former President Bill Clinton and his Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential   for their past treatment of women.   Defending Trump, Cohen said,"What he is doing is he is exposing, not just Bill Clinton for what he was and what he had done, but it’ the same as it relates to Hillary. She attacked Mr. Trump as being a sexist, misogynist, and that is inaccurate Donald Trump is not any of those things.
