One tenant was told that he had not paid his rent on time. (He presented a canceled check in court to prove that he had.) Others who had done construction on their apartments, with the approval of prior landlords, were told that they had 10 days to restore them to their original conditions. Suzanne Blackmer, a   actress and one of the original Rockettes, was ordered to vacate her   unit, for which she paid $203.
