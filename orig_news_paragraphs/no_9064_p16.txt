Trump has been leading, or the two were tied, in every   race poll since a Quinnipiac poll conducted partially in August and partially in September was released. RealClearPolitics has Trump’s polling average at a 1. 8 percent advantage over Clinton in North Carolina, but his most recent poll —  from Fox News —  put him at a   lead there. If Trump locks down North Carolina ’s 15 electoral votes on top of everything aforementioned, that puts him at 248 total and in striking distance of the presidency.
