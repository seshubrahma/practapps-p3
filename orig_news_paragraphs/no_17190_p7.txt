After Romney said he didn’t expect Trump to win the GOP nomination and called some of the real estate mogul’s past comments "childish in some respects," Trump tweeted: ". @MittRomney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible "choke" loss to Obama!"   A few months later, Romney unloaded on Trump, calling him a "phony, a fraud" and asking Republicans to unite against him.   Trump fired back, saying that he could have forced Romney to his knees in 2012 when Romney sought his endorsement.
