Structure, In terms of structure, the language of the Natural Born Clause parallels two other constitutional provisions, one requiring that candidates for U. S. House must be (1) at least 25 years old, (2) a U. S. citizen for seven years, and (3) a resident of the state that elects them at the time of their election. Similarly, U. S. senators must be (1) at least 30 years old, (2) a U. S. citizen for nine years, and (3) a resident of the state that elects them at the time of their election. Structurally, these three provisions are identical. They specify (1) how old you must be, (2) how long you must be an American citizen, and (3) how long you have been a resident of the United States.
