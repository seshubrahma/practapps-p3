If Republicans can maintain 50 votes in support of DeVos, then Vice President Mike Pence would become the tiebreaking vote to confirm her. In order to help make this happen, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided to move up the vote on DeVos ahead of the planned vote on Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general. Should Sessions leave the Senate before the DeVos vote, there would only be 49 Republicans committed to voting for her. Questions emerged Tuesday after reports that DeVos appeared to have lifted key sections of her written answers from other authors, spurring the lead Democrat opposing her to say she was reviewing the potential plagiarism.
