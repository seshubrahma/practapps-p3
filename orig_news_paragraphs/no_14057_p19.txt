The CIA, currently being led by Park, is lacking a permanent chief as the Senate has delayed Pompeoâ€™s confirmation vote until Monday, with Democrats citing concerns about his positions on surveillance and other issues. Pompeo, who was at the CIA with Trump, has encountered some controversy after he submitted responses to a Senate questionnaire where he said he would consider bringing back waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation measures under certain circumstances. Republicans have slammed the delay, with Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas issuing a statement, saying, "The Democrats are obstructing the nomination of Mike Pompeo as CIA director for no good reason."
