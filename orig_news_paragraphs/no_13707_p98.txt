He says they are operating in a hostile environment because of all of the reports that leading GOP presidential candidates hate Muslims. Rubio says nobody on stage has worn a uniform and everyone who has died for the country loves America after talking about Muslims soldiers who have died. Trump says Rubio can be "politically correct" and we "have a serious, serious problem of hate" and he wants to solve problem.
