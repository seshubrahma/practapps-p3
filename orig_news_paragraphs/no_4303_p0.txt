["His clearance was last reissued by the Obama administration in 2016 with full knowledge of his activities that occurred in 2015," Spicer said.   News broke on Thursday that the Defense Intelligence Agencyâ€™s inspector general is investigating into whether Flynn was improperly paid by Russia Today, a government entity, for a speech he gave in Russia in 2015 before he joined the administration.
