The same is true for Nevada. We have also moved Utah to a true battleground due to   candidate Evan McMullin surging in several polls there and the clear struggle Trump has had to rally what is usually the most reliably Republican state to his side. And for all the talk of Clintonâ€™s team trying to expand the map into places like Georgia, Missouri and Indiana, the one   state that does seem to have shifted full force into the   battleground category is Arizona. It will likely not be too long before we see Clinton campaign in the state following on the heels of high profile surrogates such as her daughter, Chelsea, Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders.
