Another point that has appeared in virtually no media roundups of Trump’s first 100 days, Priebus said, is the president’s first address to a joint session of Congress. That speech earned him universal praise, and one of the most powerful moments in modern presidential history —   his exchange with Carryn Owens, the widow of fallen U. S. Navy SEAL Ryan Owens —  rocked the world that night. Priebus continued: I think what you saw that night was everything that President Trump believed in —  whether it be from the 1980s, the 1990s, where we are today, the feeling that he has about this country, how much better we should be and how much stronger we should be and how much more respected we should be —  was captured that night," Priebus told Breitbart News about the president’s speech that evening.
