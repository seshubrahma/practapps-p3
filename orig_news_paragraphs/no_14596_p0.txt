Washington (CNN) Nearly 2, 000 appointed positions in the administration of President Donald Trump remain vacant, leaving many agencies with large staffing gaps waiting to be filled, according to data reviewed by CNN. Meanwhile, Trump is noticeably behind the last three presidents when it comes to securing the confirmation of his Cabinet and other top appointments that require Senate approval.   Trump complained about the pace of confirmations Friday in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington.
