A surprising confrontation erupted on Saturday between   Donald J. Trump and the cast and creators of the Broadway hit "Hamilton," setting off furious debate over American principles like free speech, respect and the ability to challenge authority in the Trump era.    Trump demanded an apology from the cast for making a rare, politically charged appeal from the stage on Friday night to Vice   Mike Pence, who was in the audience, urging him and Mr. Trump to "uphold our American values" and "work on behalf of all of us. " Mr. Trumpâ€™s response significantly escalated an unusual protest inside a theater into a furor on social media and cable news.
