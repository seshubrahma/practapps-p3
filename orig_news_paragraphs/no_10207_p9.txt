Trump mentions a few things in a speech, and the MSM, the   GOP and the Democrats explode it into nonsense. I can see the Democrats and biased media doing it, but when folks who are supposed to be on the same team fail to block for the quarterback, it looks like someone got to them and they are purposely throwing the game. It is they who are the ones creating their own   prophecy.
