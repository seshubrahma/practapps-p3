The judgment of the Ninth Circuit upholding the temporary restraining order (TRO) against President Donald Trump’s recent executive order restricting travel from seven   countries would have allowed one of the   hijackers to sue the government to come to, or stay in, the United States. [Under the court’s novel theory of legal standing, "injuries" to public universities that result from foreign students and teachers not being able to enter the country give the states standing to sue.   Moreover, the court held that foreigners with visas have due process rights under the Fifth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution, even though the precedent it cited applied to people already in the United States. Those due process rights could also be asserted by states on behalf of people in the U. S. illegally or "who have a relationship with a U. S. resident or   …     institution," the court held in its ruling.
