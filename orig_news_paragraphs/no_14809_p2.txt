While the cuts would impact UN programs the most, the White House also wants to reduce US dues to other international organizations and ask other member states to pick up the slack. For example, the US pays 21% of the operating budget of the Organization for Economic   and Development, which promotes democracy and good governance, particularly in Europe. Japan pays the   dues at about 12%. The White House wants to drop US dues to Japanâ€™s level.
