When I see an avowed white supremacist thanking Mr. Trump saying in those things, ‘We get your hints, we understand what you’re saying. ’ This says to me that there’s a lot going on in this campaign that we had better be conscious about because this country is too great a country for us to allow it to be pulled under with this strong current of what may be racial tensions. So I would say to Mr. Trump, let’s have adult discussions about this very serious problem and not make it about any one of ourselves.
