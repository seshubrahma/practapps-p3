EXPLICIT LANGUAGE WARNING]   Sunday on CNNâ€™s "Fareed Zakaria GPS," host Fareed Zakaria defended calling Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is a "bullshit artist," earlier in the week. Zakaria explained, "Earlier this week I was asked on CNN to make sense of one more case in which Donald Trump said demonstratively false and then explained it away with a casuistic tweet and an indignant interview. I replied that there was a pattern here and a term for a person who did this kind of thing, a bullshit artist.
