They said he had driven from Virginia and checked into an   hotel on the Bowery in Lower Manhattan the night before the climb. The police said they received a 911 call about the climb shortly after it began around 3:30 p. m. When they came upon Mr. Rogata, he was already five stories up, using   suction cups and what appeared to be a harness to aid his ascent. On Thursday, Mr. Rogata was still at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was taken for an evaluation after he was detained, the police said.
