During the first six days of October, the Department of State, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, and the VOLAGs have far exceeded their current budget authority to bring in refugees. Operating at the 85, 000 annualized level, which equals 233 refugees per day, they would have so far brought in only 1, 398 refugees, 1, 660 fewer than the 3, 062 who have arrived. Operating at the 110, 000 annualized level, which equals 301 refugees per day, they would have so far brought in only 1, 806 refugees, 1, 256 fewer than the 3, 062 who have arrived. *
