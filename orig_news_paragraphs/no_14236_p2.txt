The same source said the executive order on travel restrictions, written largely by Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller, was moved too quickly without "reading in" people who could have helped execute it more cleanly. The source said it wasnâ€™t nefarious, but rather "irrational exuberance" and a desire to be "too ambitious" too fast. Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, two other senior advisers, still have considerable power and influence with Trump. Administration officials say no role has been diminished or expanded but rather existing roles clarified.
