This is an emergency storage facility for seeds    more than 500 million of them from all around the world.   It would allow people to recreate food supplies in case there’s some sort of global catastrophe.   The vault’s carved into a side of a mountain Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago about halfway between Norway and the North Pole.    The company that manages the vault says water has gotten in, that it breached the entrance to the vault and sit about 50 feet into part of an access tunnel.
