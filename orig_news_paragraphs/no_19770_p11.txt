He is the voice for numerous people who despise the current "elites" and the systemically incompetent government they constructed. He is, if anything, a reintroduction of democracy into a system that was previously Liberal  . I urge Hugh Hewitt, Brian Kennedy, Charles Kessler, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and others in the conservative movement to read this next part carefully: I voted for Trump because I think his illiberal tendencies are actually a feature rather than a bug. When he undermines rule of law, I see not a danger, but someone who is undermining a system that has become a game for elites with access to armies of lawyers.
