Doesn’t make sense. Mohajer’s fourth point is basic Democratic Party and Clinton campaign talking points about FBI director James Comey revealing the reopening of the criminal probe into Clinton’s illicit   email server set up in violation of State Department guidelines. He claims it was a violation of protocol for Comey to inform Congress he had reopened the investigation, which Comey did a few days before the election upon discovering new information from a computer connected to Clinton aide Huma Abedin discovered after Abedin’s husband, disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner, ( ) came under investigation for communicating sexually explicit messages with a minor. Comey was put in an impossible spot, but it’s again not his fault he had to investigate this stuff or had to inform Congress of it.
