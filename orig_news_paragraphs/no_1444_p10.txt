Dwight Schar, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Mr. Trump’s grim predicament came as little surprise. Mr. Trump never courted party donors during the primary season and accused them of seeking to buy influence in government, boasting that as a wealthy man he would be immune to their entreaties. " I think Mr. Trump has got all the money, so he doesn’t need any financing," said Mr. Schar, who said he was undecided about whether to back Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton.
