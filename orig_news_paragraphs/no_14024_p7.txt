Leon has been involved in logistical planning of the event but not the choice of speakers.   About 300 people attended the private event, including Trump’s family and Vice   Mike Pence and his family. Trump’s inauguration organizers chose Jeffress to preach, said León. On Fox News on Thursday night, Jeffress said his sermon centers on Nehemiah, a   figure from the Hebrew Bible, who helped rebuild Jerusalem in the 5th century BC, in part by mounting a defensive wall around the city.
