When Gingrich introduced Trump at his rally this week in Ohio, people chanted "Newt!" for vice president, drawing a reaction from Trump. When Gingrich started running long in his opening remarks, people to the right of the stage yelled "Trump!" " Your governor, who’s a good friend of mine, but it’s about time he got on the Trump bandwagon," Gingrich said to applause.
