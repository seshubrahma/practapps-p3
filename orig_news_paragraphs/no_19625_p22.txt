It is certainly possible, even likely, that Tillerson     understands the threat climate change poses. His company was     one of the first to do extensive research on climate change, as     another . Of course, rather than share this     research with the public, Exxon continued to deny climate     change publicly for decades, because it was more profitable for     them to do so. Again, it seems that Tillerson and Exxon     continuously favor pragmatism and profitability over morality.
