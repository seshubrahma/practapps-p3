The increase would be to accelerate training missions for Afghan forces and well as to fight the Taliban.    The Afghan Ministry of Defense told CNN that it would support an increase in American troops. Trump has already given authority to set official troop levels in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria to Secretary of Defense James Mattis.   National security adviser H. R. McMaster and Mattis favor the troop increase being discussed at the Pentagon and increasing the United Statesâ€™ financial investment in Afghanistan, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
