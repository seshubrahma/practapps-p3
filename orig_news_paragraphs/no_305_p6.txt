It was not the first time that Mr. Trump appeared to mix partisan politics and C. I. A business. He accused the C. I. A. â€™s previous leadership of playing politics after American intelligence agencies said they believed that Russia tried to help him win the election. Then, on Saturday, he gave a speech at C. I. A. headquarters that was filled with campaign trail rhetoric. The speech was widely criticized by former C. I. A. officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations.
