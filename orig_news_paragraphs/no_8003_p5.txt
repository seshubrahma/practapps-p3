The EU has imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea and destabilizing role elsewhere in Ukraine. Some of those measures, including asset freezes on individuals and organizations, come up for renewal in January. EU leaders are due to discuss them at a summit in Brussels on Dec.   but any signal from Trump about a softening of U. S. relations with Russia is likely to embolden   countries like Germany, Italy and others to push for an end the sanctions regime, diplomats said.
