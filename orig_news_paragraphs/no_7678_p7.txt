Mari was not terrified of that man, she still wants to ask him her question. We had to get through the crowd twice to get his attention since he walked out the opposite way he came in (which had her a bit overwhelmed) then with people yelling at him, and add the secret service to the mix, well think how you would feel? Their whole interaction was ten seconds tops. Yes she did ask to be there and meet him and was all smiles before hand
