Mr. Zuckerberg also stressed the idea of using Facebook to create this "social infrastructure"  —   essentially a digital means of connecting people around shared interests  —   mirroring social groups in the physical world like churches, governments and unions. That may encourage connections among people that transcend national and international barriers, he said. While Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned several concrete steps that Facebook has taken toward some of these goals, he gave few other specifics. He did not address how his vision might conflict with those of political leaders around the world, nor did he mention how emphasizing global connections benefited Facebook’s finances.
