Mike Rogers  repeatedly said they would not discuss their private conversations with President Donald Trump. Coats and Rogers said they did not feel the public setting of the Senate intelligence committee â€™s hearing was an appropriate venue to discuss their conversations with Trump, which have reportedly included talk of the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
