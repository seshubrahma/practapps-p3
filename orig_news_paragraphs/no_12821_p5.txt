Mr. Bannon has no experience with political campaigns, but he represents the type of   fighter that the candidate had in Corey Lewandowski, his combative former campaign manager, who was fired on June 20. Mr. Bannon has been a supporter of Mr. Trumpâ€™s pugilistic instincts, which the candidate has made clear in interviews he is uncertain about suppressing. He is also deeply mistrustful of the political establishment, and his website has often been critical of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.
