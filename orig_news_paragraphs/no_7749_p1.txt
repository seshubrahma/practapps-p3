Rubio implicitly demeaned Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council President Chris Crane by declaring that Crane’s desired changes to the Gang of Eight bill pertained to "labor union stuff" rather than the substantive concerns Crane had about how the bill would negatively impact the safety of the American people. Crane is an ICE officer of 13 years. He is a former U. S. Marine, a lifetime member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and of the American Legion. Jeff Sessions has described Crane as "an American hero" for blowing the whistle on immigration corruption.
