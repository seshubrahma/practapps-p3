Die Welt is reporting that the driver of the truck is "said to have come to Germany as a refugee," although the article does not elaborate on where that information comes from.   UPDATE 18:15 EST  â€”    The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Berlin attack, according to an analysis of several online jihadist networks by the   Iraqi Popular Mobilization Force. However, some other analysts say the Iraqi group is premature with that declaration, and a formal claim of responsibility should be awaited from tradition ISIS communications outlets.
