Last July, the month that WikiLeaks began releasing the hacked emails, Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump, visited Moscow for a speaking engagement. Mr. Page has declined to say whom he met there, but he has said they were mostly scholars. Michael T. Flynn, a Trump campaign adviser who went on to be his national security adviser, was paid more than $65, 000 by companies linked to Russia in 2015, including an American branch of a cybersecurity firm believed to have connections to Russiaâ€™s intelligence services, according to congressional investigators. Mr. Flynn was forced to resign after misrepresenting his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
