Ryan, who endorsed Trump in June, said those comments met the "textbook" definition of racism. The audience included Mark Hughes, a man who was pictured legally carrying a rifle on the night of the  attacks that killed five police officers in Dallas last week. Police initially misidentified him as a suspect and his picture was posted on Twitter. House Republicans seek Clinton Foundation investigations, Hughes, a Democrat, asked Ryan a question about improving health care for returning veterans who may have   stress disorder and asked him what he would do to ensure guns did not get into the hands of people with mental disorders.
