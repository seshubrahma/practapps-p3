Last week, Mr. Trump abruptly dismissed Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, setting off a fierce backlash from Democrats against Mr. Sessions ’s nomination to fill her job permanently.

Democrats seized on her firing to say that Mr. Sessions is too close to the president to be independent or stand up to him.
