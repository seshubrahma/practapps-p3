The most famous of Mithridatesâ€™s potions was later named mithridatium. Taken daily as an electuary (a pill made of a paste, using honey as a binding agent) mithridatium combined beneficial pharmaka, or drugs and medicines, with poisons. As Galen put it, "Mithridates mixed all these together and made one drug, hoping to have a defence [sic] against all ills. " According to Pliny: "By his unaided efforts he thought out the plan of drinking poison daily, after first taking remedies, in order that sheer custom might render it harmless.
