—   Daniel Lippman (@dlippman) February 12, 2017,   Trump looks in good form, swinging his gold Honma Beres   driver on the range in Palm Beach. Abe gifted the new club to the president after he won the election in 2016. Hopefully, the new driver will give America’s 45th president a few more yards off the tee and help him keep his golf ball on the fairway.
