President Trumpâ€™s order was broader though.   He argued that a temporary ban on refugees from these countries would help keep terrorists from entering America.   But the ban was blocked by a lower court and last Thursday, a federal appeals court upheld that decision.   That means the order would stay blocked and that people from the affected countries could continue to enter America.
