One of the issues is ballot access. Each state has its own set of rules and deadlines for getting on the ballot, which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence have already done. Getting their names off and the names of the new presidential and   candidates on would be a logistical and legal headache. Some states, including important battleground ones like Iowa, start voting later next month.
