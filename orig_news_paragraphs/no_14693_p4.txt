For decades, the release has been accompanied by an   press briefing from senior officials within the department, as well as introductory remarks by the secretary of state. When the secretaries haven’t been present, as happened twice under President George W. Bush, their absence has coincided with trips abroad. Tillerson, for his part, was in Washington Friday for a meeting with his Indian counterpart at the State Department. In a conference call with reporters Friday morning, a senior administration official who did not want to be named publicly refuted the suggestion by critics that Tillerson’s absence reflects a change in the United States’ commitment to promoting human rights.
