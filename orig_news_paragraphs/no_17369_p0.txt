Orlando, Florida (CNN)   Donald Trump said Friday his supporters were "violent" during the 2016 campaign.   Trump made the admission Friday night during a rally here on the Florida leg of his "Thank You" tour. During the campaign, he repeatedly downplayed violent outbursts his supporters displayed at times toward protesters and insisted that paid activists were instead responsible for inciting violence at his rallies.
