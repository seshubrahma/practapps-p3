Clinton has narrowed Trump’s edge on handling the marquee issues of the economy and terrorism while increasing her edge on foreign policy, immigration and improving life for racial and ethnic minorities.   Trump tops Clinton by four points as better able to handle trade with other countries, a topic that was one of few high points for Trump in the debate, while Clinton has the upper hand, narrowly, on several other issues raised in Monday’s debate, including taxes (48% Clinton to 46% Trump) the criminal justice system (48% Clinton to 45% Trump) ISIS (48% Clinton to 44% Trump). The debate appears to have worsened voters impressions of Trump personally, 59% of likely voters now see him unfavorably, up from 54% in early September, while Clinton’s favorability rating has held fairly steady, standing at 43% favorable to 54% unfavorable.
