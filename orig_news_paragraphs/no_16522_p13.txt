And there should be a healthy tension between the branches.     I would expect such with a Republican Congress and a Trump administration.   Unlike the manner in which congressional Democrats have circled the wagons to defend President Obama’s unconstitutional overreach and Clinton’s email debacle, Benghazi lies and failed tenure at the State Department, I fully expect to see a Republican Congress hold a President Trump accountable.    We have already seen, for example, members of our party disagree with Trump when he expresses opinions that are inconsistent with their own.
