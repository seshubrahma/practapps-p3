A day earlier, AARP  —    the association of   and older Americans that is another crucial supporter of the Affordable Care Act  —   declared its opposition to the bill and even started running an ad against it. In a letter to Congress, the group said the bill would increase health costs for people ages 50 to 64, could lead to cuts in Medicaid coverage of   care and would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger ones. The hardening resistance complicated the case for the Republicans as they moved their bill forward on Wednesday.
