" President Trump has been clear in affirming the critical mission of DHS in protecting the nation and directed our Department to focus on removing illegal aliens who have violated our immigration laws, with a specific focus on those who pose a threat to public safety, have been charged with criminal offenses, have committed immigration violations or have been deported and   the country illegally," Kelly said.   While the Obama administration did conduct similar enforcement, advocates have raised anecdotal concerns that last weekâ€™s actions went after a much wider group of immigrants than the Obama administration had prioritized. While the previous administration had clear guidance that targeted mainly serious and violent criminals, in his first week President Donald Trump signed an executive order that vastly expanded the priorities to include virtually any undocumented immigrant in the US, including if they were only suspected of a crime or safety threat.
