As Danny points out, when a tragedy just happens, it’s easy to undo it. You start from the event, and the first thing that you can undo moving backwards in time and change the result, you change: So the FBI director’s email, or the ground ball that goes through the first baseman’s legs in the bottom of the ninth inning, or the   kicker missing at the end of the game. This is all the same stuff. But then what happens is, the consequences of Trump pile up.
