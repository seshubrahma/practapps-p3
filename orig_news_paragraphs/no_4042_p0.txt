Celebrated evangelical Rev. Franklin Graham says that it was the "hand of God," rather than Russian hackers, that determined the outcome of Novemberâ€™s presidential election. ["I think maybe God has allowed Donald Trump to win this election to protect this nation for the next few years by giving maybe an opportunity to have some good judges," he said.   The son of renowned Baptist minister Billy Graham, the Rev. Franklin Graham has been invited by   Trump to be one of six clergy to offer the invocation, benediction, and several readings at his   ceremony on January 20. In an interview with Religion News Service Thursday, Graham said that beyond mere human factors, the mysterious hand of divine providence was at work in the elections.
