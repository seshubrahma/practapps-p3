RELATED: Cryptic Clinton emails may refer to Iranian scientist, But the appearance of veiled references to the Amiri case in Clinton’s emails has fueled another round of recriminations over her private email account. One message, written by Richard Morningstar, acting special envoy of the US secretary of state for Eurasian energy at the time, was sent to Clinton on July 5, 2010, just days after the videos purportedly of Amiri were posted online and less than two weeks before he left the US. The email appears to reference Amiri’s hesitation at continuing on as a defector and his wish to leave the US.
