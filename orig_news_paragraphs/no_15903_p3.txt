It did not help matters that, on a recent surprise visit to the New York City Housing Authority, Patton disappointed local officials by declining to actually enter a housing authority apartment. That echoes a similar decision by her boss, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, to avoid visiting city projects that rely on HUD funds.   None of this bodes well for public housing in New York, which could lose as much as $216 million in   federal housing money if Congress approves cuts proposed in the Trump administrationâ€™s 2018 budget.    A more pressing concern for Patton will be the multiple    questions raised by her appointment.
