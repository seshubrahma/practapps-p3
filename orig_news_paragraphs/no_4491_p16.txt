Dara Lind (@DLind) January 25, 2017,   Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez complained about Trump’s policies, even though he played a critical role in Trump’s election by pushing the Senate’s "Gang of Eight"   bill in 2013. That bill split the GOP and pushed GOP base voters to support any   immigration reformer in the 2016 campaign.
