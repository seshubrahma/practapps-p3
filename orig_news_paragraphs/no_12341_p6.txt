Khan attacks Trump for not reading the Constitution. Despite his reverence for the U. S. Constitution, Mr. Khan  has not questioned the constitutionality of the Iraq War  â€”   which Hillary supported and his son died in. By using Mr. Khan as surrogate, Hillary Clinton has attempted to hide behind her own abysmal record as both Secretary of State and a U. S. Senator.   Not only has Hillary Clinton not made the sacrifices that Mr. Khan has talked about, but she has actually profited from her public service.
