Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who is in a tough   race, signaled that she would "support" Mr. Trump but not "endorse" him, as a spokeswoman put it, a rhetorical contortion that other Republicans repeated privately. Representative Ra√∫l R. Labrador of Idaho, a staunch conservative, said he would support Mr. Trump but derided him for "not knowing much about the Constitution or politics. " Former Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida, who retains a strong network of donors, said he would raise money for Mr. Trump but was unsure about his proposals, like temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States.
