Antonio Alarcón, a 20   living in Queens, New York with illegal immigrant family members, told the New Yorker his illegal family members are concerned about a perceived rounding of people up and mass deporting them. " People have been crying a lot, saying, ‘We’re going to get deported’," Alarcón said. Luba Cortés, a community organizer in Queens, said she has similar worries about illegal immigrant family members, with the same mainstream   perception of rigid deportation forces coming into private individuals’ homes and rounding illegals up.
