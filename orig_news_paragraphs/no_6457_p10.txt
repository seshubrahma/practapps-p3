In other words, one of the "favorite" comments these progressive organizers heard all week was a man wishing that President Trump was dead and "goes to heaven very soon. " The original Facebook posting has since been removed and reposted with slightly different wording, where instead of the original description of that exchange with the man who wished President Trump was dead as the progressive organizer and post authorâ€™s "favorite" of the week, it was altered to say the exchange with that man was the "most notable oddity" of the week. Breitbart News has screenshots of the original, however, and is providing both the original post and the revised one here.
