Graham, at the same time, expressed concerns the Senate and House Intelligence Committees would now be more limited in their role looking into matters subject to the special counsel. " The ability of Congress to call people who may be witnesses in an investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller, is going to severely restrict what we can do," Graham told reporters Thursday. Graham did not elaborate on how or why Mueller’s appointment would limit Congress’s involvement in the investigation.
