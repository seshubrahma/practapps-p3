It was a ridiculous request that I refused. I also said no initially when the campaign said I could interview Secretary Clinton but only on the condition that we do it off the record. Reporters speak off the record to politicians all the time, but this was an unusual provision and felt slightly weird: a major candidate for presidentâ€™s agreeing to speak to a reporter on the condition that readers not be privy? It would be one thing if the campaign had also agreed to an    discussion, but it had not.
