Obama said his former secretary of state is a better qualified candidate than even he or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had been when they sought office. " I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman    not me, not Bill, nobody    more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America," Obama said to a roaring crowd    and a   Bill Clinton    at the Democratic National Convention. Even as a pessimistic attitude pervades the presidential campaign, Obama attempted to harness the optimism that propelled him into office eight years ago.
