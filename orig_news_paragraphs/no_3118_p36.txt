that is, the capitalism in which capitalists think about the fate of their country, not just their bank account.   As Hawkins put it: It was this enlightened capitalism that gave the   —  through wide asset ownership —    strong middle class and an aspirant and affluent working class which provided the moral and economic foundations for the West to defeat Nazism in 1945 and support Ronald Reagan in   to and defeating the Soviet Union during the Cold War.   And now this has been corrupted and in turn weakened the West itself and Bannon believes the West now faces losing everything it has gained across more than 2000 years. [emphasis added] Hawkins ended his essay with these hopeful words: With Bannon, Trump and "Trumpism" the US and the West has an opportunity for economic, moral and political renewal —  a new enlightenment.
