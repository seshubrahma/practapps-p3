These may seem like obvious things, but we wouldnâ€™t be where we are if the elites were doing them. To listen means not to patronize Trump supporters and Brexit voters and Sanders fans, and not to rationalize away their pain, pride, hope or anger. To offer a better way means doing more than ringing alarms about resurgent fascism or condemning people for being drawn to destructive demagogues. It means, quite simply, offering citizens a better way: a plan for a more responsive government, a fair economy, and a society where inclusion benefits everyone.
