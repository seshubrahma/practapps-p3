Podesta was sitting on the board of directors of Joule Unlimited while   of State Hillary Clinton and the State Department were in the middle of the Russian reset   —   which at its heart included involvement in a Russian government technology initiative called the Skolkovo Foundation. The GAI report revealed that in 2014, the FBI issued "an extraordinary warning" to various technology companies connected with Skolkovo, cautioning that Putin could use the   technology project to advance its military technological capabilities. Also troubling about Podesta’s position on the board of Joule Unlimited, alongside Russian officials that received $35 million from a   Russian government fund, is that he failed to fully disclose that information and include it in his federal financial disclosures before he became President Obama’s senior adviser.
