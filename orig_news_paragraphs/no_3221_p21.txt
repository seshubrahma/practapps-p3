That is how every President for more than a century limited migrants based on ideology or statehood. That is why we were much more successful than Europe in limiting the   violence (that led Europe into World War I) and in limiting communist internal sabotage (that led much of eastern Europe into communist totalitarianism). Every federal court followed that process in limiting immigration from   nations after  . This Hawaii courtâ€™s decision directly conflicts with those Circuits but, per usual, it never even mentions any of those authorities.
