The meeting with mayors was to serve as an opportunity to explain these efforts to city leaders, beginning with the already announced plan to withhold law enforcement grants. In his statement, Sessions explained: We are pleased that the mayors who met with us today assured us they want to be in compliance with the law.   The vast majority of state and local jurisdictions are in compliance and want to work with federal law enforcement to keep their communities safe.   Of course, compliance with 8 U. S. C. 1373 is the minimum the American people should expect.
