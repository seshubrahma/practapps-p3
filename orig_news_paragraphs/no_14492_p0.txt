Seattle (CNN) Lawyers for a Mexican immigrant facing deportation proceedings despite having been allowed to remain in the country under an   program are disputing key aspects of the case against him    including by denying he ever confessed to being a gang member.   Daniel Ramirez Medina, a    man who authorities say came to the United States with his parents illegally when he was 7, was arrested last week in Washington state during a raid that initially targeted his father. Ramirez had twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, his lawyers said.
