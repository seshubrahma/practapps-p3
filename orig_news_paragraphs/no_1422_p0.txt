Donald J. Trump tried out several lines of attack against Hillary Clinton, at one point calling her "unfit to be president," as he delivered an otherwise noticeably restrained speech to an audience of evangelical activists here Friday. Appearing before the Faith and Freedom Coalitionâ€™s Road to Majority conference, Mr. Trump promised to "uphold the sanctity and dignity of life" and to "restore respect for people of faith. " But he also used the opportunity to press his case against Mrs. Clinton, portraying her as arrogant, attacking her economic policies and willingness to admit Syrian refugees into the country and questioning her judgment as secretary of state.
