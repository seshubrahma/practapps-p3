The government lets all Americans reduce taxable income by a fixed amount. This standard deduction is $9, 300 in 2016. People who spend more on certain things, like mortgage interest or hospital bills  —   or, in Mr. Trump’s plan, child care bills  —   can itemize those expenses and claim a larger deduction. But only 30 percent of American households itemized deductions in 2013, the most recent year for which I. R. S. data is available.
