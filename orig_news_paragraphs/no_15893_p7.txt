These movements, however, involved significantly higher numbers of troops.   At the height of operations in Iraq, there were more than 170, 000 Americans on the ground.   Likewise, by 2010, after President Obama ordered the surge of an additional 30, 000 troops to Afghanistan, more than 100, 000 Americans were fighting there.    One could argue, then, that Trumpâ€™s decision "normalizes" what should be the management of lower troop numbers for a mission that is not, and will not, become   war again.
