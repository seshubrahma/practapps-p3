The lyrics for Harvey’s version, on which Morello is featured, of "Old Man Trump" were originally written by Guthrie, and recently discovered by professor of American literature and culture at the University of Central Lancashire in Britain Will Kaufman. According to Kaufman, Guthrie had signed a   lease in an apartment in Brooklyn run by Fred C. Trump, Donald Trump’s father. It was then and there that Guthrie wrote the "Old Man Trump" song lyrics.
