A special commission established by President Truman made the same conclusions. In 1950, the Commission on Migratory Labor was   to study the effects of illegal and legal immigration on American farmworker wages. One area of mention in the panelâ€™s final report was numerous amnesties of illegal alien farmworkers pushed through by the federal government in response to pressure from Big Agribusiness in the 1940s. Immigration agents at the time testified that the amnesties had been a major "pull force" for further illegal entries.
