Jeff Sessions warned that sanctuary jurisdictions could lose their portion of $4. 1 billion in grants from the Department of Justice if they fail to comply with federal immigration law. He said that more than 200 jurisdictions had refused to honor ICE detainer requests in just one week. " The charges and convictions against these aliens include: drug trafficking, hit and run, rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder," said Sessions.
