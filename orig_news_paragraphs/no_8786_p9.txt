Part of the left’s argument was that the amendment only protected the "right" of the people to have guns when they were serving in a militia, since the Second Amendment begins, "A well regulated militia. " The Supreme Court noted that the Militia Act of 1792 —  passed by Congress a single year after the Second Amendment’s ratification in 1791 —  broadly invoked the "militia" as referring to the general body of   adult citizens, not to any organized military force, and therefore that the original meaning of "militia" actually supported the view that the right to bear arms belongs to all private adult citizens who are   and peaceable. The Court has always held that laws passed by the First Congress (1789 —  1790) many of whose members were also part of the Constitutional Convention, and signed by President George Washington, who was also the president of the Constitutional Convention, are strong and weighty evidence about the original meaning of any similar provision in the Constitution.
