 (CNN) Late last week, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions,   Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, returned the Senate Judiciary Committee’s standard questionnaire    but certain information was notably missing from his 33 pages of responses. This week, Sessions has been quietly adding materials to his committee file amid concerns from top Democrats and civil rights groups that his current submission is incomplete. Originally, under the section of the questionnaire specifically calling for all nominations and public offices held, including any "unsuccessful nominations for appointed office," Sessions detailed his record as a federal prosecutor and senator of Alabama, but failed to list his failed bid for a federal judgeship in 1986.
