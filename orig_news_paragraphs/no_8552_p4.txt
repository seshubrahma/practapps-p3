One year to the day later, Dilbreen was asleep in a tent with thousands of other displaced Yazidis, when a gas heater malfunctioned and fire broke out. With mom outside baking bread for her sonâ€™s birthday, she was unable to protect him from the burning plastic ceiling that melted and fell on the child. Dilbreen was lucky to be alive, but had to endure the pain and disfiguration caused by severe burns to his face. Dilbreen is reportedly receiving the care he needs in the United States, where is expected to be reunited with his parents and baby brother Trump, courtesy of the nonprofit Yazidi American Women Organization.
