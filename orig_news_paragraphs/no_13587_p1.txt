Zootopia, which earned a sterling A CinemaScore, hauled in an estimated $50 million over the weekend to bring its worldwide cume to more than $430 million. The family film dropped off just 33% from its opening weekend in the U. S. and scored a record $109 million from China, according to the Hollywood Reporter. 10 Cloverfield Lane, a blood relative of the 2008 monster movie Cloverfield, took in an impressive $25. 2 million playing at 3, 391 theaters. The J. J.   thriller followed its predecessor in revealing very few details of its plot during its marketing campaign, and audiences responded by heading to theaters to check it out.
