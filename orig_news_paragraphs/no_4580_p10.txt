First, the publication of Michael Anton’s "The Flight 93 Election"  —   in which Anton, under an alias, lays out the perfect case for why a   figure can only arise as a Phoenix from the ashes of a corrupt,   Republic  —   and the tragic murder of Kate Steinle, the beautiful 32   woman cut down in the prime of her life by an illegal alien set loose on the streets of San Francisco by liberals’ sanctuary policy. Lucas was very open about the way he and other liberals were taken by complete surprise by Trump’s election   —    something that many conservatives in California understood intuitively was a foregone conclusion once Trump made it clear he would stand and fight like Reagan did, instead of cutting and running  like the Mitt Romney wing of the party.
