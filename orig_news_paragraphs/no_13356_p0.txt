Four University of Kansas cheerleaders have been suspended over an image posted to a social media account possibly linking   Donald Trump to the Ku Klux Klan, reports say. [The row started when a photo was posted to Snapchat featuring three white, male members of the Kansas cheer team standing    in a photo with their "K" shirts on and the words "Kkk go Trump" superimposed underneath them. The "K" on the studentsâ€™ shirts stands for Kansas. The photo was reportedly taken at a party held on November 20, according to KUSports.
