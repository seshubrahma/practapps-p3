Sandford told police that he drove to Las Vegas from California "to kill Trump," according to the complaint, after hearing a few days earlier in the news that he was expected there.   He was in the country illegally, his visa having expired. He had been living out of his car in California for a month, according to CNN affiliate KSNV.   On June 17, he practiced shooting a gun for the first time at a gun range in Las Vegas.
