Also on Friday, the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, said in a statement that his resignation had been requested and in Brooklyn, Robert L. Capers, said he had been "instructed to resign. " Mr. Bharara had not issued a statement as of Friday evening, when his office was uncertain whether the resignation request applied to him. The announcement that he had been told to resign along with 45 other United States attorneys around the country comes little more than three months after he met with Donald J. Trump, then   at Trump Tower, and announced afterward that Mr. Trump had asked him to stay on as the United States attorney.
