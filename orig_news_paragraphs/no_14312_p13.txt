Plus, this kind of determination is not supposed to be a decision on the merits. It’s actually the opposite: It’s a temporary fix    until the court can have another hearing, to decide whether to apply another temporary fix (preliminary injunction) until eventually the court can someday have the hearing that actually decides the case on the merits. When you look at it in context, the judge had a good reason not to get too deep into the merits of the case in this TRO.
