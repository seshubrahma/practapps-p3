So I am delighted that the new Administration has made a trade agreement between our countries one of its earliest priorities. A new trade deal between Britain and America must work for both sides and serve both of our national interests. It must help to grow our respective economies and to provide the     jobs of the future for working people across America and across the UK. And it must work for those who have too often felt left behind by the forces of globalisation.
