It was the previous director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, who delivered the news to Mr. Flynn that he was being removed from his post. Throughout the transition, Mr. Flynn was reportedly hesitant to place many people around the National Security Council table who had outranked him in the military. Nonetheless, there are two in the cabinet: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who retired as a   general, and the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, a retired   Marine Corps general who served for 45 years, ending his military career as the commander of United States Southern Command. Both men remain principals on the council.
