A crowd of Donald Trump supporters appeared outside Trump Tower in New York City Saturday afternoon. [The   demonstration in New York compliments another incident Saturday in Wisconsin, where House Speaker Paul Ryan was shouted down onstage by Trump supporters at his "Fall Fest" event with Scott Walker.   The     crowd of supporters attracted media attention as luminaries like Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie and campaign operatives Don Trump Jr. and Kellyanne Conway filed inside the building. Giuliani reportedly shook his head no when asked by a reporter if Trump should drop out of the race.
