On Thursday night, the State Department said it was finally in contact with Mr. Trump’s emissaries. But until now, they had not requested any briefings, nor had the  ’s calls  —   including with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other adversaries of the United States   —   been routed through the State Department, as is customary, according to a department official. Mr. Trump’s aides did not respond to questions about whether the   had used his own interpreter in the meeting with Mr. Abe and calls with other leaders, or whether he had relied on interpreters provided by them.
