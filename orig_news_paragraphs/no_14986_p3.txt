" Cruz didn’t respond directly to O’Rourke’s argument that the senator has been too focused on national politics, but said in a written statement to CNN that he "will continue to work every day to earn and keep the trust of Texans across our great state. I’m confident that Texans want a senator who will lead the fight for freedom    defending the Constitution, getting government off our backs, and allowing small businesses to create jobs and opportunity."   The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee was more direct about O’Rourke, saying he’s out of step with the state.
