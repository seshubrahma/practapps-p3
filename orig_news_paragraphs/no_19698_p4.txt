The uptick in officer fatalities took place amid calls for greater police accountability in response to lethal shootings of black men and women by police. Activism against police brutality has become a rallying cry of the Black Lives Matter   movement, which rose to prominence following the death of   old Michael Brown at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. 955 individuals have been fatally shot by police officers this year, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. Heightened police scrutiny has led some officers to suggest they feel more likely to face attack.
