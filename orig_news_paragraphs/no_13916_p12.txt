Questions on women, gays in combat, Later, Mattis was peppered with questions about women and gays in the military from several lawmakers.   Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat who has been outspoken on the issue of women in the military and military sexual assault, engaged in a lengthy    with Mattis about his position on women and gays in combat    asking him if he would roll back gains on that front. Mattis repeatedly dodged direct questions about whether he opposes women serving in combat positions or gays in the military, despite Gillibrand reading back his past comments to him. In one case, she quoted a passage in Mattisâ€™ book, "Warriors and Citizens," in which he decried the military being subject to societal pressure on causes like women in combat.
