Trump will also split up the Homeland Security Council and National Security Council, which President Barack Obama merged after taking office in 2009. The decision will officially elevate the homeland security adviser post to the same stature as the President’s national security adviser, a role retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will fill. Flynn will focus on international security issues while Bossert will primarily oversee domestic security threats, the Trump transition said in a statement. Like Flynn’s position, Bossert’s does not require congressional approval.
