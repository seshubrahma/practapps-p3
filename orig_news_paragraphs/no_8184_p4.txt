The Massachusetts hate crime hoax is one of many that has occurred since Trumpâ€™s victory against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In Louisiana, a Muslim student claimed she was attacked by Trump supporters and had her hijab pulled off her head, only for police to discover that she fabricated the story, as Breitbart Texas reported. The student is now facing misdemeanor charges. In Ohio, a Bowling Green State University student faces similar charges after repeatedly misleading police investigators about a claimed   attack she suffered at the hands of Trump supporters.
