Now, depending on whom you ask, that last part of the pipeline    a hotly contested portion under the Missouri River thatâ€™s been the focus of the massive protests    could be on the road to completion.   Acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer "has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with the easement needed to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline," Sen. John Hoeven said in a statement. Hoeven said he spoke with Speer on Tuesday.   Rep. Kevin Cramer, also a North Dakota Republican, said he received word that the Army Corps will grant final approval and that congressional notification of the decision was "imminent."
