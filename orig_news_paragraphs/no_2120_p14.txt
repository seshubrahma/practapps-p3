The government has shown similar reluctance to probe too deeply into Russiaâ€™s links to Mr. Gyorkos, the   in Bony. Those connections were revealed in October by Index, a   opposition news media outlet, and were then confirmed and expanded upon by security officials who briefed the parliamentary security committee, members of the committee said. Mr. Gyorkos, the committee was told, had such close relations with Russians acting under diplomatic cover at the embassy in Budapest that they traveled to his remote village as many as five times a year to join his supporters for games of airsoft, a form of mock combat that involves the firing of plastic pellets with replica guns.
