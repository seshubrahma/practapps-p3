Washington (CNN)   Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate campaign adviser David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer with hardline views on Israel, to serve as US ambassador to the country. In a statement issued by Trump’s transition team, Friedman said he looked forward to moving the US embassy to "Israel’s eternal capital, Jerusalem."  That would fulfill a promise made by Trump on the campaign trail to relocate the diplomatic mission from Tel Aviv, upending decades of US policy. Friedman has long held conservative positions on Israel.
