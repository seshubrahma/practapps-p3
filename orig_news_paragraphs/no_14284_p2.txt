But already, the nation was in the midst of a second straight weekend of widespread uncertainty over the controversial ban, this time with the administration on defense.   A State Department official told CNN the department has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the Presidentâ€™s executive order last week    so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled.   The department transmitted a cable to all posts Saturday instructing them to resume the visa process as they had before the executive order, two senior State Department officials said. The officials told CNN those whose visas were physically canceled would have to go to an embassy or consulate to have them reinstated.
