Let me also ask you something else we he heard from the Trump campaign just over the last two days. Yesterday I talked to a former admiral, rear admiral who is supporting Donald Trump as one of his advisers, who suggested   —   who sort of turned the subject from should Donald Trump apologize to the rules of engagement for troops in Iraq, implying somehow that the rules of engagement were so restrictive that they played a role in your son’s killing, something else that another Trump spokesman, Katrina Pierson also said today on CNN. We have the sound bite from her today.
