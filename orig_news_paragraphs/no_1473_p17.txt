And on a more personal level, Mr. Christie has been routinely taunted by Democrats and more than a few fellow Republicans for his perceived obsequiousness around Mr. Trump. A gregarious politician who routinely refers to other officeholders by their first names, Mr. Christie was pilloried in late February for referring to his friend as "Mr. Trump" in announcing his support. Soon after, Mr. Trump was caught on a microphone in Arkansas curtly telling Mr. Christie that he should go home after having finished his remarks. On the night of the March 1 primaries, Mr. Christie became the subject of internet memes featuring his seemingly vacant expression as he stood at Mr. Trumpâ€™s shoulder during his victory speech.
