Former Secretary of Labor under Barack Obama and newly elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee Tom Perez told people at a rally in New Jersey on Friday that Donald Trump didn’t win the 2016 presidential election. [  "January 20th was undeniably an important day in this country," Perez said at a New Jersey Working Families Alliance rally. " But January 21st was far more important," Perez said, referring to the Women’s March and other   protests that took place on that day.
