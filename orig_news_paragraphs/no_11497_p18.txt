And here we can immediately stipulate that there’s a critical, perhaps even binary, distinction to be drawn —  between those who have earned their benefits through work, and those who have not.

For these folks, having spent decades in the workforce, the values of delayed gratification and thrift are likely ingrained in them, and this shapes their outlook in later life —  whichever party they might identify with. Meanwhile, in the "unearned" category are those who, for lack of a better word, get their money for free —  their benefits, however desperately they might be needed, are unearned.
