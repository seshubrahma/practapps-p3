tensions rise, Haley on Friday warned that the United States was prepared to take further action in Syria, but the Trump administration has refused to be drawn on what those next steps would be.   Tensions between Russia and the US have increased sharply since Trump ordered the missile strikes, and  Russia has sent a frigate armed with cruise missiles to a port in western Syria in an apparent show of force in response to the US action. Russia is Syriaâ€™s most powerful ally and has propped up the Assad regime with air power. The US has said the Pentagon is looking for any evidence the Russian government knew about or was complicit in the chemical attack.
