Glenn Beck reacted to the news of Stephen K. Bannon joining Donald Trump’s presidential campaign by suggesting the former Breitbart News executive threatens the lives of his enemies and former associates.   Beck suggested Wednesday that Bannon might use "the Dark Web" for illegal activities, up to and including hiring assassins. This is not the first time Beck lashed out at Bannon. Last February, after Beck’s endorsed candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) lost the Nevada primary to Trump, he launched into an angry rant on his radio show calling Trump supporters "Brownshirts" and comparing Bannon, a former Surface Warfare Officer in the U. S. Navy, to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.
