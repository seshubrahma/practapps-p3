Surprisingly, a lot of them actually voted for Mr. Trump. According to an exit poll of 2, 000 Muslim voters conducted by the Council on   Relations, or CAIR, 13 percent backed Mr. Trump, while 74 percent supported Mrs. Clinton. That is nearly twice as much support as Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, received from Muslim voters four years ago.
