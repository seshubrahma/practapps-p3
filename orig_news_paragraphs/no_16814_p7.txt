Officials have said the Russian and Syrian attacks have been indiscriminate and killed civilians.   US officials point to the fact that over 90% of weapons dropped by the US and its allies are "smart bombs" that are either laser or GPS guided munitions. The Russians on the other hand use less sophisticated gravity bombs that are considered much less precise. The US and   organizations have also accused the Syrian regime of using "barrel bombs," an even cruder weapon.
