Providing security for the American People also means restoring Americaâ€™s standing in the world. From the very start of my Presidency, I have worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe. This week, I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House. Now, I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China at the Southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples.
