" We’re having to negotiate numbers every single year, even though we need more than we’re going to get," former HP CEO Carly Fiorina told POLITICO at the RNC last week. Moreover, during her failed Senate campaign against Sen. Barbara Boxer, Fiorina criticized Sen. Boxer for not bringing in more foreign workers to fill U. S. jobs. The Los Angeles Times reports that Fiorina also criticized Boxer for not addressing "the importance of Latino culture in California".
