On Monday’s "The Herd" on Fox Sports 1, host Colin Cowherd likened the "mess" that is the NFL’s American Football Conference playoff teams to the GOP presidential candidates.   According to Cowherd, presidential candidates Jeb Bush, Dr. Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump can all be compared to AFC playoff teams Kansas Chiefs, Denver Broncos, Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Texans, Cincinnati Bengals and the New England Patriots. He explained that the AFC favorites, whose quarterback happens to be close with Trump, are Donald Trump because they have "issues," but are "polarizing" and "pretty teflon. " "
