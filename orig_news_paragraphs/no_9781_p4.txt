I am upset that the political platforms being sold by both parties have slowly dismantled America. Please hug me. I am upset that we have an immigration policy that has been put in place not for Americaâ€™s interests but that of globalists. I am upset because of the fraud, waste, corruption, and cronyism in our government.
