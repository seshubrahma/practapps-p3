The Sunday strikes, which targeted Egypt’s persecuted and vulnerable Christian minority on the first day of the faith ’s Holy Week leading up to Easter, left at least 45 dead, Egypt’s health ministry said Monday. At least 28 people died in a bomb blast inside a church in the northern city of Tanta, according to the ministry. In Alexandria, 17 people    including civilians and police officers    were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a Coptic church, the ministry said.
