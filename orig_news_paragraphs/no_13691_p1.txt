Trump’s final stop of the night was scheduled to be Virginia, completing five rallies in one day, and travel to seven states.

Trump arrived in dramatic fashion on his plane, which taxied in front of the hangar, whose doors then opened. He came down the jetway and immediately waved a Terrible Towel, a favorite symbol of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
