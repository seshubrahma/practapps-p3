The Navy calculated the Russian planes may be have flown as close as 1, 000 yards laterally from the ship and 1, 000 feet over the water, but did not cross the deck of the Porter. Moscow pushed back on the allegation Tuesday, with Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov telling Russian state media "there has been no incident on February 10th involving flybys of Russian military planes in the Black Sea next to USS Porter."   Meanwhile, a US defense official told CNN that the Russian spy ship, the   Viktor Leonov, is sailing in international waters off the coast of Delaware. The vessel is outfitted with a variety of    spying equipment and is designed to intercept signals intelligence.
