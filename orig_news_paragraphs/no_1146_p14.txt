In an interview on Thursday at his office in the Capitol, Mr. Schumer said his party’s efforts were about more than protesting the treatment of Judge Garland. He cited concerns over Judge Gorsuch’s record on workers’ rights and his degree of independence from Mr. Trump and conservative groups like the Federalist Society, which pushed for Judge Gorsuch’s nomination. " It’s not vengeance for us," he said.
