Sasha Dyck said he was part of a group comprised of six Canadians and two French nationals who organized a trip to Washington for the Womenâ€™s March.   They arrived at the border on Thursday and when Dyck mentioned the march, the whole group was pulled over for inspection.   They had to submit their phones and passports, he said. Then, their fingerprints and photographs were taken.
