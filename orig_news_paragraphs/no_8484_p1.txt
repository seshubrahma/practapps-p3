Altogether in the first three days of early voting across the state, there was a 67 percent increase in early voting since 2012 with a   228, 865 casting their ballots in the general election. The 2008 Election was the first time Louisiana residents could early vote in a presidential contest, originally setting a record that year of 99, 190 early ballots cast. That record was quickly broken in the 2012 presidential election when 136, 694 voted after three days. At a polling station in one Baton Rouge district, the line was so long that the wait to vote was about 30 minutes, according to WAFB.
