It is deplorable for a candidate for president of a major party to kick off his campaign by labeling most Mexicans as rapists and murderers. It is deplorable when the Justice Department feels it has to sue you a second time for racial discrimination because you didnâ€™t get the hint the first time. It is deplorable to play footsie with David Duke, to repeatedly retweet white nationalists and false stats about black men and crime, to praise the enthusiasm of supporters who beat a homeless Hispanic man in Boston and punch a black man at rally, to say black people have a lazy trait and have them ushered off the casino floor when you show up.   It is deplorable to rise to national political prominence on the bigotry that is "birtherism," even more deplorable to have neither the character nor the courage either publicly to renounce or repeat that assertion while touting your supposed toughness as a primary reason to vote for you.
