Mr. Brennan told the BBC that the United States should continue to support moderate rebels fighting Mr. Assadâ€™s forces in Syria as a bulwark against the "onslaught" meted out by the Syrian government and its allies, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Alluding to the ferocious fighting in recent days in the Syrian city of Aleppo, which has seen thousands of civilians flee for their lives, he said Russia had failed to show that it was a dependable negotiating partner and had prolonged the discussion process with the aim of choking the city. " I do not have confidence that the Russians are going to relent until they are able to achieve as much tactical battlefield successes as possible," he said.
