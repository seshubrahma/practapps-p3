China poses a particular challenge for the United States. The country’s spectacular rise to become the world’s   economy in a few short decades has created huge opportunities for US exporters and investors. But as noted in the CSIS report, slowing growth, stalled reforms and mercantilist policies are creating a more difficult environment in China, while Beijing is pursuing more assertive policies externally.   The United States benefits from a cooperative   relationship, but this cannot be sustained if it does not advance the interests of both countries.
