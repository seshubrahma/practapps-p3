["That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe   —   and to keep out those who would do us harm," the president promised.   President Trump is expected to reveal those new steps when he signs a new executive order on refugees and immigration on Thursday. The signing was originally scheduled for Wednesday, but press reports indicate that the reaction to the president’s speech has been so positive, the White House chose to delay the signing so as to not step on its own positive message.
