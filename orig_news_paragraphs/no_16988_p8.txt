Nevada key to both parties, Nevada’s six electoral votes may be critical Tuesday night, and the Senate race is key in terms of the balance of power.   Nevada’s Republican Party chairman, Michael McDonald, told a Trump audience in Reno on Saturday that polling locations were kept open late so that a "certain group" could vote. " Last night, in Clark County, they kept a poll open ’til 10 o’clock at night so a certain group could vote," McDonald said in introductory remarks at a Trump rally.
