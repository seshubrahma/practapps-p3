If using the accurate term "radical Islamic terrorism" offends you, sorry, I don’t care. This in mind, President Trump’s willingness to explicitly label our enemy what they are during his Joint Address to Congress, which is radical Islamic terrorists, should be viewed as a victory not merely by those who voted for him, but by all those who embrace the idea of a free and tolerant society. We’ve tried political correctness for the past 15 years as a force for defeating our adversaries, the time has come to change course.
