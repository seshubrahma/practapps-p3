Twitter and other social networks have found themselves at the center of a debate over where and how to draw the line between free speech and harassment. While Mr. Spencerâ€™s suspension was due to a violation of the multiple accounts policy, it occurred as Twitter began a broader crackdown on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence, according to The Associated Press. Over the summer, in a move that seemed to signal a new approach to abuse, it suspended the account of Milo Yiannopoulos, a writer who had consistently violated its terms of service and led a harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Mr. Yiannopoulos has not returned to the social network.
