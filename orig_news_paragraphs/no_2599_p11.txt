Republicans on Capitol Hill spoke approvingly of Mr. Pence on Thursday: He is seen among his former colleagues there as a conventional politician with   conservative beliefs, including on some subjects where his policy instincts plainly conflict with Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Pence has endorsed   agreements, including the   Partnership, an Asian trade deal that Mr. Trump has described as a "rape" of the American economy. As a House member, Mr. Pence also voted for the Iraq War, which Trump has condemned, and last winter he denounced Mr. Trump’s call to ban all Muslim immigration into the United States. If those views place Mr. Pence at odds with Mr. Trump, they are in line with the outlook of Republican leaders in Congress.
