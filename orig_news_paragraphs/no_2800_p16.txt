The groups coming to Cleveland represent a broad spectrum of views. Some want simply to celebrate Mr. Trumpâ€™s nomination others identify as white supremacists and believe Mr. Trump will help advance their views. Large marches are also planned by liberal and progressive groups who see Mr. Trump as a demagogue and his candidacy as a danger to democracy. And some groups are coming with more encompassing causes, such as alleviating poverty, ending military interventions abroad and working on ways to combat institutional racism.
