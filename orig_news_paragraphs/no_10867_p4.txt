If Clinton wins the election and is sworn in as President, she can only be removed by impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate. If Democrats win majority control of the Senate on November 8, Clinton could defy the Congress and either refuse to appoint a Special Prosecutor or appoint someone who would rubber stamp her criminal behavior. The patriotic thing for Hillary Clinton to do would be to step aside and let the DNC select Tim Kaine as the partyâ€™s presidential candidate. But since that would almost certainly lead to a tidal wave of support for Donald Trump, that will not happen.
