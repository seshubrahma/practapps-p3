Confronted with the criticism that the Trump campaign is "whining" about Cruz’s success at picking up delegates, Miller replied, "That’s like saying we’re whining when we talk about the fact that we beg and plead for Washington to secure the borders, but they won’t.   That we’re whining because we beg and plead for them to pass an omnibus bill that blocks refugees, but they don’t.   That’s like saying that we’re whining because we beg and plead for them not to raise the debt limit without preconditions, but they just go ahead and raise it unilaterally with no reforms whatsoever.
