Rashed also discussed the challenge posed by the Muslim Brotherhood movement for Egypt and the Egyptian government. He wrote: "The Muslim Brotherhood is a general problem, not a problem that effects one country. This is a political movement that uses religion to come to power. This is a movement similar to communism in that itâ€™s a internationalist movement, a fact that turns it into a problem for all the governments in the region.
