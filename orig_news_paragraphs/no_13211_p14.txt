Meadows added that the support for amnesty on display in the   audience this evening wasn’t just counter to South Carolina or North Carolina values, but run counter to American values. " I can tell you from an amnesty standpoint, that’s not a South Carolina value, that’s not a North Carolina value —   it’s really not a value that most people across the country support," Meadows said.
