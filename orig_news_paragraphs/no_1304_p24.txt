Why Mr. Manafort opted to go to Spruce Capital and the Chicago bank for the loans is unclear. For Federal Savings, Mr. Manafort’s loans amount to about 5. 4 percent of the bank’s total assets. Mr. Calk did not respond to messages seeking comment, and a spokeswoman for Federal Savings said it would not discuss its customers’ business.
