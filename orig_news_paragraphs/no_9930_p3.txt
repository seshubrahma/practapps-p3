History teaches otherwise. Hubert Humphrey closed a   gap in the Gallup poll on Oct. 1 to reach a   photo finish with Richard Nixon in 1968. President Gerald Ford was down 33 points to Jimmy Carter in   1976, but lost by only 2 points on Election Day. In February 1980, Ronald Reagan was 29 points behind Jimmy Carter, whom he would crush   in a   landslide.
