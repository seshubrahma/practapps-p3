When the United States filed criminal charges against the businesswoman, Ma Xiaohong, the owner of the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Company, other Chinese companies conducting similar transactions were apparently left untouched. But Mr. Yang, who was a top negotiator for China during   talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2009, suggested that those companies may now be vulnerable. If the United States continues to present evidence of illegal activities that contravene Chinaâ€™s responsibilities under United Nations sanctions, "there is a great deal of room for cooperation," he said. He noted that China had published five executive orders, totaling more than 900 pages, listing items banned from export to North Korea.
