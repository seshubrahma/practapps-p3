He said he was especially looking for more answers on Gorsuch’s thoughts about reproductive rights, workers’ rights and consumer protection issues.   Asked if Blumenthal is open to supporting Gorsuch, the senator said he will wait until after the Judiciary Committee holds hearings on Gorsuch’s nomination to make a final decision but that he has "serious and deep concerns" about him. Blumenthal said he supports requiring a   threshold to confirm the Supreme Court nominee, and if he decides to oppose Gorsuch, Blumenthal said he will use "every tool" at his disposal to fight the nomination. Republicans need eight of their Democratic colleagues to break that threshold and prevent a filibuster.
