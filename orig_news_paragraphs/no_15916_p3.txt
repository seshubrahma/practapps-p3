The high turnout reflects the intense local and national interest a contest that    with more than $50 million spent between the candidates, their parties and super PACs    has become the most expensive House race ever.   Progressives who have pumped more than $23 million into Ossoff’s campaign have long viewed the race as their best chance to use a special election to deliver a political blow to Trump    and to send a message to House Republicans that aiding Trump will come at a price by capturing what for decades has been a reliably Republican seat.   Operatives in both parties acknowledge that more Republicans have voted early than Democrats    overall, a reason for Handel’s campaign to be optimistic and Ossoff’s campaign to sweat.   That reality, though, is no surprise in the district, which encompasses much of Atlanta’s northern suburbs.
