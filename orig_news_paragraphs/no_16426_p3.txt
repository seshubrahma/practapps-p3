The FBI conducted this investigation, as it does all investigations, in a competent, honest and independent way," FBI acting Assistant Director Jason V. Herring wrote in a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz and the committee’s ranking Democratic member, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings. The letter reiterates FBI Director James Comey’s assertion last month that it was not clear whether Clinton deliberately received classified information on her private email server.   " As the director stated, the FBI did find evidence that Secretary Clinton and her colleagues were extremely careless in their handling of certain, very sensitive, highly classified information," the letter said.
