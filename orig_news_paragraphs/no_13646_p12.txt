I watch about 30 minutes of Fox News a day, the roundtable on Bret Baierâ€™s "Special Report. " The   pundit panel is supposed to represent the smartest thinking in politics, and yet for months and months, every Friday during Candidate Casino, a feature where the pundits award up to a hundred chips (points) to various presidential candidates, no one would acknowledge the "Trump" writing on the wall. Some even admitted they could not acknowledge it.
