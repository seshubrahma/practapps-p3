 (CNN) Hank Paulson, the Republican Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial crisis, has endorsed Hillary Clinton, adding his name to prominent GOP heavyweights who are backing the presumptive Democratic nominee. Paulson’s support comes amid mounting concerns about Donald Trump’s candidacy. Paulson, a controversial figure given President George W. Bush’s handling of the downturn, said "a Trump presidency is unthinkable" and predicted that other conservatives would rally behind her.
