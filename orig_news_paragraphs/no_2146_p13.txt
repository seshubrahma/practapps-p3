Asher Cohen, a professor at   University who has specialized in Israeli culture, noted that there was a large political center in Israel, its size increasing at the expense of the shrinking left. And some of Mr. Kerry’s points, especially making East Jerusalem the capital of a Palestinian state, rankle Israelis across ideological lines, he said. " Even if Kerry’s remarks were close to their own views, centrists and leftists did not appreciate the   of the speech and the asymmetry in the blame assigned to Israel and to the Palestinians," Mr. Cohen said.
