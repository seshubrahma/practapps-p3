BEIJING  —    Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson signaled on Friday that the Trump administration was prepared to scrap nearly a decade of United States policy toward North Korea in favor of a more aggressive effort to eliminate the country’s nuclear weapons program. Whether that means   action, which he warned was "on the table," will depend a great deal on how China responds. North Korea relies on Chinese trade and aid to keep its economy afloat, and China has long been unwilling to withdraw that support.
