CNN Money speculates that fiscal doom could descend because Trump is using Twitter again (supposedly reminding investors of his volatility) because tech companies don’t want to lose the foreign labor they’ve been importing through the   visa program, because Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos don’t get along, because congressional Republicans may not be fully on board with Trump’s agenda  …      and, as with every other piece written Monday about the Trump rally fading, because the   hasn’t publicized enough details about his economic agenda. Strategist Tom DeMark told MarketWatch he expected the Trump rally to end with a peak and tumble, with values dropping by at least 11 percent.
