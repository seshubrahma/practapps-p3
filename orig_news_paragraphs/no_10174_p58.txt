While one video published by the Al Qaeda affiliate   in Somalia uses video of Trump calling for a "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," Trump is largely absent from Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Hamas, and Hezbollah propaganda   â€”    the major jihadist groups who expend resources on producing propaganda to recruit fighters. Much of the propaganda released by one of the most active jihadist groups in the world, the Islamic State, focuses largely on the Quranic theme of jihad ("holy war") and cites both the Quran and the Islamic documents known as hadiths.
