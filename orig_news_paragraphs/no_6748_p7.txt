The full debates have consumed so much time on the Senate floor that the only way to get the chamber flowing has been to keep the chamber open for days on end, conducting votes in the early morning hours. As he did when he voted to confirm Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Sen. Joseph Manchin III (D. . V.) was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans when he voted to confirm Mnuchin. Manchin is a moderate Democrat up for reelction in 2018, who has reached out to the Trump White House looking for ways he can work with the president.
