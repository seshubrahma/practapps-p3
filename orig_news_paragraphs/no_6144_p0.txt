TEL AVIV  â€”    Despite media reports to the contrary, President Donald Trump is still considering moving the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the White House said on Wednesday. ["The president has not made a decision yet and is still reviewing that," Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters at the daily press briefing.   Sanders was questioned about a report in the   news site NRG that said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received notice that Trump would renege on his campaign promise and sign the waiver on the congressional mandate to transfer the embassy.
