He noted that the campaign had attacked Mr. Trump over the tax returns and for his "demeaning millions of Americans. " "Our campaign has already shown the resolve to take him on and put him on defense in ways his Republican challengers never could," Mr. Mook added. William M. Daley, Mr. Obama’s former White House chief of staff, attributed any early shortcomings in taking on Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton’s prolonged primary battle against Mr. Sanders.
