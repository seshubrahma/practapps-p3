Thomas C. Korologos, DLA Piper, a national security aide to presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald W. Reagan and George W. Bush’s ambassador to Belgium, called for renewal of the Republican Party after Trump’s loss to his Democratic rival Hillary R. Clinton. In his  : "Memo to GOP: Forget 2016. Start thinking 2018 and 2020" he told Washington Post readers: There isn’t a snowball’s chance that Donald Trump will stop his bombast and preening. If he’s in trouble today, just bet that it’s going to be worse tomorrow.
