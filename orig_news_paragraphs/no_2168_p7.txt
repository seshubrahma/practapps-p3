Mr. Ryan, who serves as the convention’s ceremonial chairman, has made the provocative declaration that he is not ready to support his party’s likely nominee, a rebuke that drew Mr. Trump’s threat, in an interview with NBC News, to keep him from assuming that role.

They are holding back on sponsorships, leaving Cleveland about $7 million short of its $64 million   goal just 10 weeks before the festivities begin.
