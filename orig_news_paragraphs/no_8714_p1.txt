The "  Overstay Report," prepared by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) documents that in 2015 alone, more than half a million people, who had entered the country on a   or   visa, had illegally overstayed their visas and are believed to be unlawfully residing within the United States. The   and   visas are for business workers and tourists, respectively. The report also includes those who entered on the "Visa Waiver Program," which is another avenue for business workers and tourists to enter the United States on an allegedly temporary basis. This report does not even begin to address the numerous other forms of visas used by foreign migrants to gain entry into the country â€”   such as the H and L guest worker visas, the F student visa, and the   foreign exchange visa.
