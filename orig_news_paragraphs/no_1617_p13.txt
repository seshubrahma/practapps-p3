Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a staunch ally of Mr. Trumpâ€™s who advises him on immigration policy, also acknowledged the new uncertainty, saying on CBS that Mr. Trump was "wrestling" with what to do about deportations. Speculation that Mr. Trump was wavering also grew over the weekend after he met on Saturday with his newly formed Hispanic advisory council. Univision and BuzzFeed reported that he expressed interest in finding a "humane" way to deal with undocumented immigrants that sounded at odds with his previous plan to forcibly remove them from the country. The Trump campaign denied that he was wavering.
