The six items Trump detailed Monday are all somewhat easy lifts inside Washington    because they can be done with a simple signature by Trump and do not require congressional approval.   But Trump also left out his biggest campaign promises    including promises to build a wall along the Mexican border, establish a "deportation force," place new restrictions on immigration from some majority Muslim countries, repeal Obamacare and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure.   Unlike his items unveiled Monday, those measures would require the approval of Congress and are likely to take significantly more work.   Time and speed are very likely to be key factors as the new president looks for bigger, more durable wins in his first year.
