The extension is designed to expose users to   political views that are different from their own. " "   Once installed, Escape Your Bubble asks users to identify whether   they want to learn about Republicans or Democrats and inserts   stories into their feeds that align with the political leanings   they wish to be exposed to. The extension then adds one clearly   marked story that falls outside of the userâ€™s established   political viewpoint every time a user visits the social network. "
