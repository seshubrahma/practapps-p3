Obamacare strategy session, President Barack Obama will make an unusual trip for a   president    visiting Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to meet with congressional Democrats and discuss how to fight Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to push the repeal of Obamaâ€™s signature domestic achievement in the first week of the new Congress.   Democrats, meanwhile, face a defining moment in the early stages of the Trump era: If party members pledge not to help the GOP pass any replacement, it would place enormous pressure on Trump and congressional Republicans to come up with a way to keep 20 million Americans insured    and get Congress to approve such a program.   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will hold a conference call with House Democrats Monday on Obamacare.
