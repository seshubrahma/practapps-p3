Paula Jones is a former Arkansas state employee who accused Clinton of making "persistent and continuous" sexual advances toward her while he was governor. She filed a federal lawsuit in 1994, and Clinton settled the lawsuit in 1998, paying out $850, 000 to Jones and her lawyers. Clinton wasn’t disbarred in Arkansas, but he did lose his license for a time. Trump’s claims are true.
