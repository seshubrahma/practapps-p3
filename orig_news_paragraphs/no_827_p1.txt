Addressing reporters before the start of the annual National People’s Congress, Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for the legislature, said the increase would be "about" 7 percent. She said defense spending would amount to roughly 1. 3 percent of China’s gross domestic product. Last year’s proposed increase was 7. 6 percent, though China has yet to release final figures indicating how much was actually spent. Those figures, and the exact number of this year’s projected increase, will be revealed in a budget that the government releases on Sunday, when the national legislature starts its annual full session.
