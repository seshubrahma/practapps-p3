Husted, his counterpart in Ohio, accused the Obama administration of overreaching, saying it was trying to carry out a federal takeover.

" Our focus right now, in the remaining days before Nov. 8, is to encourage states to come forward and request our assistance," Mr. Johnson said in a recent interview.
