Currently, the United States is the only major industrialized nation not to employ a VAT system. As a consequence, foreign VAT taxes not only impose a surcharge on U. S. exports to a VAT country but also subsidize that countryâ€™s producers with rebates for their own exports. They do so legally under trade rules, while America has chosen to take it on the chin rather than respond. Notably, these foreign VAT systems amount to a stealth tax on   goods.
