PHILADELPHIA   —    Amid confusion over whether he would speak at a black church this weekend, Donald J. Trump’s halting attempts to win over   voters took him to Philadelphia on Friday, where he spoke with a small group of business owners and community leaders and had an emotional meeting with the mother of a young woman who was killed by undocumented immigrants. After largely avoiding black audiences during his campaign, Mr. Trump had arranged to appear at a prominent black church, Great Faith Ministries, in Detroit on Saturday.
