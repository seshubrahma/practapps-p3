Cleveland (CNN) Melania Trump stepped onto center stage Monday for the   speech of her life, but the moment was quickly overshadowed by controversy after it emerged that portions of the speech were plagiarized from Michelle Obamaâ€™s 2008 address to the Democratic National Convention.   Melania Trump initially appeared to deliver the speech her husband needed to portray him in a softer light. She offered testimony about the character of her husband, Donald Trump, and said he would never let America down.
