" Russell Verney, a former top strategist for Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who abruptly pulled out of the 1992 election, only to   and win 19 percent of the vote, said that outsider candidates were more vulnerable to questions about their resolve. " It never would be a subject raised with Romney and others, because the presidency is the ultimate goal of their entire professional career," said Mr. Verney, who conferred with Mr. Trump during his exploration of a presidential run in 2000, during which, he said, Mr. Trump expressed reservations about selling his casinos to fund his campaign.
