Immigration lawyers from the ACLU and other groups acted swiftly Friday night after Trump released his executive order limiting immigrants from seven   countries. A federal judge blocked part of the order on Saturday, preventing the removal of some individuals who arrived at airports after the order was issued. Lawsuits were also filed in a number of other states. Members of the California Legislature, which is dominated by Democrats, have retained former Attorney General Eric Holder, promising to challenge any Trump policy that threatens the stateâ€™s progressive actions on issues like climate change.
