No administration has ever been off to a worse   start," said Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategist who served as a counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney. As Mr. Trump seeks to recover, the president’s difficulties in governing effectively   —   building coalitions, anticipating roadblocks, neutralizing opponents and seeing around the corner  —   pose a far greater threat to his coming initiatives on a tax code overhaul and infrastructure than any obstruction Democrats could come up with. Mr. Schmidt said the White House would have to be "delusional" not to recognize the depths of the challenges for the new president.
