Some voters in Texas, which began its early voting period this week, have experienced problems casting their ballots. A Randall County voter recalled her own mishap in a Facebook post on Monday, saying that she tried to cast a straight Republican ballot    including a vote for Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence    but wound up inadvertently selecting the Democratic ticket of Clinton and Tim Kaine.   As of Thursday morning, the woman’s post has been shared nearly 10, 000 times and has generated hundreds of comments.   The Republican presidential nominee took to Twitter to suggest Thursday there have been widespread cases of "vote flipping," the act of casting a vote for one candidate only to see it awarded to the opponent instead.
