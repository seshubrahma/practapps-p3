The Post is correct that "[n]ever in the history of the   poll have the two major party nominees been viewed as harshly as Clinton and Trump. " Both Trump and Clinton are seen among registered voters as unfavorable by 57 percent, while Clinton leads in favorability by only 41 to 40 percent for Trump. But that is a stunning change from the Postâ€™s March Poll, which found Clinton leading Trump by 16 percentage points in favorability, 46 to 30 percent, while Trump was seen as 15 points more unfavorable than Clinton, 67 to 52 percent.
