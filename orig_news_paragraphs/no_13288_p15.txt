Sometimes, it’s knife attacks. The fact that they are random, they are unexpected, the police can’t predict them to prevent them in advance, sort of like what we saw in New York and New Jersey a couple of weeks ago at the opening of the U. N. General Assembly. That shows that the terrorist threat can appear anywhere, any time.   It can be a city in the middle of the United States, a small town as in France.
