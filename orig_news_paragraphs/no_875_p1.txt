And, its London bureau chief, Nikolay A. Bogachikhin, jokes, "We overlook MI5 and we’re near MI6," Britain’s domestic and foreign intelligence agencies.

But the West is not laughing. Even as Russia insists that RT is just another global network like the BBC or France 24, albeit one offering "alternative views" to the   news media, many Western countries regard RT as the slickly produced heart of a broad, often covert disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about democratic institutions and destabilize the West.
