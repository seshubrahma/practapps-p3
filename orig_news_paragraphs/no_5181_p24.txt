Before Trump’s electoral victory in November, Klobuchar’s seat was considered safe in 2018. Public concerns about health, security, and crime related to high levels of refugee resettlement, however, helped power Trump’s wins in the nearby states of Wisconsin and Michigan, and his    showing in Minnesota. There is no evidence that the individual diagnosed with active TB at St. Louis Park High School in November was either   or a   refugee. However, the six weeks concealment of the diagnosis from the public by Minnesota officials, combined with their failure to affirmatively declare whether the individual was   a   refugee, or U. S.  all serve to heighten public distrust of public officials in Minnesota and fuel   sentiment just as Klobuchar begins to prepare for her   campaign.
