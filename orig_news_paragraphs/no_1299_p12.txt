Later, after a meeting at the White House with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, Mr. Trump went out of his way to praise the military institution, which he called a "great alliance," and to express disappointment with Russia. Asked whether it was possible that Syrian forces could have launched the chemical attack without Russia’s knowledge, Mr. Trump said: "It’s certainly possible I think it’s probably unlikely. " "I would like to think that they didn’t know, but certainly they could have. They were there," Mr. Trump said of the Russians during a   news conference at the White House.
