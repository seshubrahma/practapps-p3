The law forbids the death penalty as punishment for rapists, yet it permits the death penalty for innocent preborn children conceived in rape. Before making pronouncements that these children somehow deserve less protection in the womb, those who support a "rape exception" for abortion should listen to Rebecca Kiessling, who escaped the abortionistâ€™s forceps and grew up to found a group that advocates for children who are innocent victims like she was. Those open to abortion for these children should also listen to Valerie Gatto, another child conceived in rape. Valerie is a successful young woman who is also known as Miss Pennsylvania and who competed for Miss USA in 2014.
