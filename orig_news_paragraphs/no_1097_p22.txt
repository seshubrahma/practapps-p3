Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York said he was preparing to challenge any effort to do away with regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. Such a move, he argued, violated the Clean Air Act, as well as established case law. " If they want to go back into the   process, we believe they are compelled under law to come up with something close to the Clean Power Plan," he said.
