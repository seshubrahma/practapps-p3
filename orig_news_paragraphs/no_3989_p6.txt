Prior to the show, a banner had been spotted near the event location in Seattle encouraging protesters to "stab" MILO on inauguration day. Earlier in January, MILO’s show at UC Davis was forcibly cancelled after   protesters ripped down barricades, allegedly threw furniture at attendees, assaulted a reporter with hot coffee, spat on camera men, screamed at police officers who were protecting those inside, and attempted to destroy the equipment of those filming. An event in December was also cancelled following threats from Dakota Pipeline protesters, while several protesters were arrested at Michigan State University last year. At the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, MILO’s video producer was attacked by communist protesters, while in May, two #BlackLivesMatter activists stormed MILO’s stage and threatened him, with one protester throwing her fist near his face while screaming.
