Pamela Colloff, executive editor of Texas Monthly had this to say, on Twitter: The Times’s national editor, Marc Lacey, pointed out that The Times has national correspondents who live across the country. And earlier Friday, The Times’s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. sent a note to the newsroom on the topic of covering the Trump White House. The Times will "approach the incoming Trump administration without bias," he wrote.
