Several members of Congress and two prominent advocacy groups on the left, MoveOn. org and Democracy for America, said on Wednesday that they would line up behind Mrs. Clinton as the candidate who has won the most pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders offered no immediate response to the signs that his core liberal coalition might be faltering. Activists on the right have had even less success at applying pressure to Mr. Trump. Republicans have repeatedly pleaded and cajoled Mr. Trump to run a more professional campaign, reflecting greater attentiveness to rules of political and social decorum.
