First Amendment lawyers are more immediately concerned with potential leak investigations, as well as Freedom of Information Act requests, which can provide the best way to expose government secrets. Look no farther than the potential attorney general candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani, who as mayor of New York was so allergic to records requests that news organizations and others regularly sued him for basic information. Success at court was meaningless given that proceedings kept the information out of public view for so long that "he really won," said George Freeman, who was the assistant general counsel for The New York Times then and is now the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center.
