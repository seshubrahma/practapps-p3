In an interview this week in San Francisco, Innate’s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, seemed amused at all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his "little biotech at the wrong end of the world. " Mr. Wilkinson and Michael Quinn, Innate’s chairman, said they had never heard of many of the company’s more prominent investors, and said they first learned that Mr. Price had invested in the company from an article in The Wall Street Journal, which first reported his investment. They also said they had not heard of Mr. Hook, the   shareholder, or Mr. Paxon and said they had little interest in gaining the ear of powerful Washington players.
