The 2014 salary paid to new ‘resident’ doctors at hospitals run by   medical schools was $49, 218. That’s similar to the $49, 945 salary paid by state hospitals. But six years after graduation, doctors in state hospitals have risen to $61, 272, while   doctors are paid almost $3, 000 less, or $58, 614. It should be noted that American doctors’ salaries have already been reduced by a large inflow of foreign doctors, many through the   ‘temporary’ visa program.
