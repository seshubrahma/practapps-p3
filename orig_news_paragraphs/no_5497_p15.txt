â€”   Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) February 25, 2017,   The Chronicle notes that on Sunday, at 10 a. m. several hundred   activists will also hold an "empty chair" town hall despite the fact that Feinstein will not attend in person. She reportedly declined their invitation. However, a spokeswoman for Indivisible East Bay told the Chronicle that Sunday "is not really a protest" of the senator.
