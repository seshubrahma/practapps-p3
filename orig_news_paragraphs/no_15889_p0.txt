Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) The Southern Baptist Convention moved to denounce the " " white nationalist movement Wednesday, a collective decision that occurred only after pastors pushed back against denominational leaders who initially chose not to address the issue. At their annual meeting, Southern Baptists agreed to a statement decrying "every form of racism, including   white supremacy, as antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ."   Denominational leaders had planned not to vote on a resolution about race relations, but reversed course following an outcry on the floor of the convention the day before.
