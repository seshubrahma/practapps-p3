, This is a man who keeps implying violence and you end up getting what you see. So I think that he, in fact, has got to tell his supporters that in the United States of America, you donâ€™t go beating up people, that people have a right to peacefully protest. I hope that become the tone of his campaign. But I will also say this, I think Trump is getting nervous because he is seeing in virtually every national poll, last NBC poll we were 18 points ahead of him, statewide polls we are way ahead of him.
