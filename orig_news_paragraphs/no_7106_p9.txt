Despite the stark decline in services other than abortions, Planned Parenthood’s government funding has more than doubled, from $272 million to $553 million, with the group claiming taxpayer funding is not used to pay for abortions.

Live Action’s most recent video highlights how   politicians promote Planned Parenthood’s   "healthcare services," when such services are either unavailable or largely declining.
