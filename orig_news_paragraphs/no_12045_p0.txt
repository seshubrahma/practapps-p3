The protests launched by militant leftists who shut down Donald Trump’s Chicago rally were far more aggressive and destructive than reported, says a Chicago Police officer. ["It seems the [media] aren’t broadcasting footage of the debris being thrown across Harrison by   supporters at Trump fans," the officer wrote shortly after the canceled Trump event.   The officer, who posed anonymously on the Second City Cop blog, also noted the media didn’t report that protesters were running through parking lots and breaking windows of cars with Trump stickers on them, or that the department called out emergency Incident Teams to cope with the   riot at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Later that same day the officer posted a second, much longer post, to detail the failures of the police leaders to plan for and respond to the protests.
