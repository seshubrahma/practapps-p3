When another reporter asked whether he would abide by the federal court’s ruling, Mr. Trump smiled thinly but did not answer, shifting from foot to foot, as the first lady, Melania Trump, resplendent in a pink evening gown and diamond and emerald earrings, stared serenely ahead.

Like his residence, Mr. Trump is also still in transition, caught between the demands of being president (a 5 p. m. phone call with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine) and the reassuring rituals of his old life (a round of golf at his club in nearby West Palm Beach). On his first weekend here since being inaugurated, the Red Cross ball fell into the   category.
