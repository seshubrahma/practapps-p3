Firstly, what is BuzzFeed implying here? That only   rape victims are credible?   That a   rape victim found in her hotel room with a swollen lip and mouth, and ripped off pantyhose loses credibility because she seemingly becomes "cozy with conservatives" 38 years after the incident and 17 years after she first went public?
