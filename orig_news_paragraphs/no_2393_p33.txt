One letter, 25 pages long, analyzed seven distinct components of Mr. Trump’s proposed tax maneuver. It found only "substantial authority" for six of the components. In the stilted language of tax opinion letters, the phrase "substantial authority" is a red flag that the lawyers believe the I. R. S. can be expected to rule against the taxpayer roughly   of the time. In other words, Mr. Trump’s tax lawyers were telling him there were at least six different reasons the I. R. S. would probably cry foul if he were audited.
