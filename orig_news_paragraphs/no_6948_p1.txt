Original story below: Leonardo DiCaprio apparently spared no expense while getting ready for last weekend ’s Academy Awards  —    the   actor and environmental activist reportedly flew a renowned "eyebrow artist" to the stars more than 7, 000 miles around the world to have his face tended to ahead of Hollywood’s big night. According to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Independent, the    Revenant star and fellow actor Tobey Maguire enlisted the services of beautician   Hamilton, who made the   trip from Sydney, Australia to Los Angeles to ensure the stars’ brows were just right for the big show.
