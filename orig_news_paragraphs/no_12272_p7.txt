We are fearless advocates for traditional American values, perhaps most important among them is freedom of speech, or our motto ‘more voices, not less. ’ For Kellogg’s, an American brand, to blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate   totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice. They insult our incredibly diverse staff and spit in the face of our 45, 000, 000 highly engaged, highly perceptive, highly loyal readers, many of whom are Kellogg’s customers.
