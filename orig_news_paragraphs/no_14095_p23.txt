In the years that followed, the country became a presidential republic with President Jammeh winning every election since then, until last month.   Thatâ€™s when Mr. Jammeh was surprisingly defeated by a property developer named Adama Barrow. Though Jammeh conceded the presidency at first, he then rejected the results and stayed put, while the new president was sworn in in neighboring Senegal last Thursday.    Military troops from other countries the region, supported by the United Nations Security Council were deployed to remove Jammeh from power.
