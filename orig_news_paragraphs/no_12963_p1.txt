I think for the other people still in the race, their path is becoming a slimmer and slimmer opening, and they’re having a difficult time communicating to their supporters just how they could become the nominee. It’s not impossible. I think it’s very difficult for any one of the   Trump contenders to be able to be a real threat, unless perhaps the field narrows. The field narrowing would, I think, create an opening, but that doesn’t seem to be happening other than Jeb Bush, who I think really put country first by saying, look, I’m going to step aside, and let my supporters go to someone else who they feel is representative of the kind of views that the country needs.
