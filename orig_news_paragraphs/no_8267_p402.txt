Anderson said the issue was fixed and there was no indication that anyoneâ€™s votes were incorrectly registered in the system. Other states have also reported problems with their voting machines on Election Day. In Utah, poll workers have had to resort to paper ballots because the machines in Washington County faced a programming problem. In Texas, a computer used by election clerks at a   polling station malfunctioned and voters had to be sent to another polling station two miles away.
