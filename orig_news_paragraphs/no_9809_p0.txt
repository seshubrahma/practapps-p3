Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) took to the United States House floor on Thursday afternoon to express criticism of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s comments about the North Carolina bathroom law that prohibits transgenders from using public restrooms, which Trump opposes. [After talking about the need for fair, free elections across the world and stressing the importance of stopping the expansion of radical Islamic extremism, Gohmert said, "North Carolina has gotten a bad [reputation]. "  Recently, North Carolina’s Gov. Pat McCrory signed a bill that blocks "cities from allowing transgender individuals to use public bathrooms for the sex they identify as  —   as well as restricting cities from passing nondiscrimination laws more broadly. " On Thursday morning, Trump was asked on NBC’s Today Show about the North Carolina legislation and said transgenders should "use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate," adding that he opposes North Carolina’s law.
