Paulson, once the CEO of Goldman Sachs, criticized Trump’s business record, divisiveness and brand of populist rhetoric.   Clinton has been criticized for close ties to Wall Street, but not many Republicans of Paulson’s stature have formally endorsed her. " I can’t help but think what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise and careful analysis were critical," Paulson wrote.
