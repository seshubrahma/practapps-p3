On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump used Twitter to assail Boeing for escalating costs on the development of a new Air Force One. But rarely has Mr. Trump used Twitter to express his ire at people like Mr. Jones, the president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, who described himself on Thursday as "just a regular working guy. " With the full power of the presidency just weeks away, Mr. Trumpâ€™s decision to single out Mr. Jones for ridicule has drawn condemnation from historians and White House veterans.
