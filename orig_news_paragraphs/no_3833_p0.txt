Democratic leaders of the California legislature have hired former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder to represent the liberal state in future legal battles with the Trump administration. ["With the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead," California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León and California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon wrote in a statement Wednesday.   " The Legislature will work with the Governor and our next Attorney General to protect California’s economy and our sensible policies on climate change, health care, civil rights and immigration," the statement says.
