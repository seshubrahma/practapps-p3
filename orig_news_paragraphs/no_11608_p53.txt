Abood, who speaks Arabic, said during testimony Wednesday that he was offered the interpreter job after warning U. S. troops that large weapons caches were being kept inside Iraqi schools. He said he also worked as a U. S. military contractor on civil affairs projects, such as building schools and roads. He joined the Army in 2010 and went through basic training at Fort Jackson, S. C. Abood said he trained U. S. troops on how to deal with Iraqi culture and customs. He said he left the Army because it wouldnâ€™t allow him to return to Iraq to see his sick mother.
