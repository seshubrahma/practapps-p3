He said in that interview that it would happen before the election," Lotter said when asked for a timeline on the release of Pence’s tax returns. Pence’s decision comes one day after Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and her running mate Tim Kaine released their tax returns to the public. Clinton on Friday released tax returns dating back to 1977 and Kaine released ten years of tax returns, giving voters insight into their annual income, charitable contributions and tax rate. Trump, meanwhile, has said that he will not release his tax returns while they are under audit by the IRS, though there is no law prohibiting him from doing so.
