A new video released Monday by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas shows   activists allegedly planning to use butyric acid bombs   —   commonly known as "stink bombs"  —   to disrupt an event scheduled for the week of Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th President of the United States. [The leftists captured on film were allegedly targeting the Deploraball, a   event being held on Thursday at the National Press Club "to celebrate and honor   …      the passionate citizens who worked social media, knocked on doors, and endured harassement to support" Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.
