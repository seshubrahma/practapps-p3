My favorite tweets were from the Republican political consultants who have hauled in multiple millions of dollars over the years, in exchange for turning the GOP into a minor fringe party, as exemplified in these electoral results: 1992: GOP loses to a   horndog. 1996 : GOP loses to a   horndog who tried to destroy health care. 2000: GOP barely wins an election so close it wasnâ€™t decided until December.
