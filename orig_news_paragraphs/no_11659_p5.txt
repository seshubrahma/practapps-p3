The fact that Bill Clinton ended up settling with Jones, ended up admitting he had lied about his affair with a White House intern, or that Broaddrick has contemporaneous witnesses she told about the assault, did nothing to alter the DC Media’s role in personally destroying any and all Clinton accusers. This is why God invented the super PAC. In 2016, Stone and Willey can go right over the heads of Hillary’s media. Free speech is a beautiful thing.
