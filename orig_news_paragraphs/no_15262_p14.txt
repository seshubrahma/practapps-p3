Jobs, Nonpartisan congressional research found in 2015 that NAFTA isnâ€™t responsible for an exodus of jobs south of the border, nor for a big jobs boom in the US. Researchers concluded the deal has had a minor impact on the US economy. Still, about 14 million US jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada, according to the US Chamber of Commerce. Canadian and Mexican officials say they are already ready to renegotiate.
