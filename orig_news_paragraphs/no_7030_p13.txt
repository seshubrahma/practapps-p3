I asked about the distortions that   rates creates it punishes savers and retirees. Former Fed chair Bernanke said we know it’s bad and we will try to restore interest rates, but they continued to add to the balance sheet for several years and interest rates are still probably lower than would be in a natural market. In Japan they’re more explicit about this, they’re trying to force people out of cash and into the stock market to stimulate the stock market.
