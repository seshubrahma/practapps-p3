During Donald Trump’s visit to Flint, Michigan on Wednesday, the Republican nominee commented on how the automobile manufacturing industry has moved to Mexico   —   impacting trade   —   and how people in Flint can’t drink the water, much like the water in Mexico. ["It used to be cars were made in Flint, and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico," Trump stated.
