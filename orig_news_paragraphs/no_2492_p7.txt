In 1990, a year after Hirohito’s death, notes were published based on interviews conducted with him shortly after Japan’s surrender. In the oral history, recorded by one of his aides, Hirohito asserted that if he had tried to stop the attack on Pearl Harbor, "it would have led to a coup d’état" in which he likely would have been assassinated. " That would have been fine," said Hirohito, who died of cancer in January 1989 at age 87.
