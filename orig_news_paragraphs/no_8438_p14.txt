Why do you believe that every single Republican who campaigned in the 2014 midterm elections against the Gang of Eight bill and called it amnesty —  such as Tom Cotton —   is wrong and that your bill did not in fact grant amnesty? Under your definition of amnesty, could a President Rubio enact the same legalization provisions of the Gang of Eight bill and still tell voters that you did not grant "amnesty" to illegal immigrants. You have previously said the Obama’s   Partnership agreement would be a "pillar" of you presidency. Do you stand by that statement?
