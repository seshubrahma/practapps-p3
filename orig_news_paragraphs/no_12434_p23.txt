But many   are employed in   jobs, such as those outsourced by the Clinton charities. For example, the nationâ€™s universities and business partners employ roughly 100, 000   including roughly 21, 754 professors, lecturers and instructors, 20, 566 doctors, clinicians and therapists, 25, 175 researchers,   and biologists, plus 30, 000 financial planners, p. r. experts, writers, editors, sports coaches, designers, accountants, economists, statisticians, lawyers, architects, computer experts and much else. The annual inflow of     plus the arrival of 1 million legal immigrants and a few hundred thousand illegal immigrants, provides employers with roughly one new foreign worker for every two of the 4 million Americans who turn 18 each year. The huge scale of the   program has been successfully hidden by business groups and by nearly all media outlets, many of which suggest the program only includes 65, 000 workers.
