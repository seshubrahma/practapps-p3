Both news programs lost handily to ABC’s broadcast of the NBA Finals Game 2 matchup between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors, which drew an average of around 15. 5 million viewers.   The Warriors’ victory over the Cavs also unsurprisingly led in the     demographic, drawing a 5. 7 rating Kelly’s show came in second with a 0. 8, while CBS’s rerun of 60 Minutes drew a 0. 6. Overall, NBC finished third on the night in total viewers with an average of 4. 7 million, but second in the demo, with an average 1. 0 rating. ABC blew away all competition with its NBA coverage, while Fox and CBS came in third and fourth in the demo, respectively.
