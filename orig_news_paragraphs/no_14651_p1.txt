The designated survivor goes to a distant, secure and undisclosed location outside of Washington while everyone else gathers to listen to the President â€™s address in the Capitol.    The designated survivor must be eligible to be president, and if a   successor survives a potential incident, that person would become president ahead of the designated survivor. The practice started in the 1960s during the Cold War when there were fears of a nuclear attack.
