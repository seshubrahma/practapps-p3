A prominent Sheriff from Massachusetts on Tuesday called for leaders of sanctuary cities to be arrested for failing to uphold federal law and endangering American citizens. [Testifying before Congress, Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson said that if "sanctuary cities are going to harbor and conceal criminal illegal aliens from ICE, which is in direct violation of Title 8 of the U. S. Code, federal arrest warrants should be issued for their elected officials. "   " Our citizens would be safer if we never stopped enforcing immigration law and if we never formed or turned a blind eye toward sanctuary cities," he continued.
