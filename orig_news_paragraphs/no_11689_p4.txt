The odds of the Democrat National Department of Justice charging their    presidential pick five months before the general election are extremely small. In my opinion, the only way Loretta Lynch seeks a prosecution of Secretary Clinton is if the evidence presented by the FBI is so overwhelming that it renders her unviable as a candidate. Remember, Clinton is already no more than a   bet versus Republican nominee Donald Trump in November as it is. In this scenario, the Obama Administration could make the big move and indict Clinton and set the stage for the dramatic last minute entry of a   ticket to enhance the prospects of a third term for the President (because Bernie Sanders is unelectable).
