What the focus on Trump’s numbers misses, however, is that Democrats aren’t in a great place with voters either. One number in the   poll really stood out to me as something that should worry Democrats pondering the party’s future: Asked whether the Democratic Party is in touch with the concerns of the average person, just 28% of respondents said it is    as opposed to 67% who said Democrats are out of touch. Those numbers are worse than the "in   of touch" numbers for either the Republican Party or Trump in that same poll. More amazing to me is that only 52% of   Democrats said their party was in touch with peoples’ concerns, while 44% said it was out of touch.
