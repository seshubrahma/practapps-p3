Some of us actually got threats because we were actually holding up San Francisco values. And you see that there’s a real level of intimidation that’s even here in our board chamber  —   people who actually are not fearful of being a minority in our board chambers who don’t fit with our values, and that’s something that makes sure that we have to stand up and be courageous in this time when the fear of immigrants is so strong, and it’s being trumped up in our presidential election. So colleagues, again, thank you for holding fast to our due process for all ordinances last year.
