I think that Trump raised that overall issue well, in terms of not disclosing everything that you are doing, just in order to get good PR. Within hours of bin Laden having been killed, they had people out backgrounding on how they had tricked the guards this way and how they’d done that way.   That’s just ridiculous. That’s a terrible idea.
