Others with valid visas and airline tickets were prevented from boarding planes destined for the United States    some stranded in foreign countries    as airlines and foreign airport officials scrambled to understand and comply with the new US immigration policy. But Saturday night, a federal judge granted an emergency stay for people who have already arrived in the United States and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be deported. However, it doesnâ€™t immediately order that they be released from detention, Zachary Manfredi, a lawyer involved in drafting the motion, told CNN. Judge Ann Donnelly, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote in her decision that government could not remove "individuals with refugee applications approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the US Refugee Admissions Program, holders of valid immigrant and   visas, and other individuals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen legally authorized to enter the United States." Anthony D. Romero, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the judge recognized the potential of harm to immigrants and visitors.
