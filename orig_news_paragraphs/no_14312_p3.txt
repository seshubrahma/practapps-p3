An injunction is a court order commanding a person either to perform or to refrain from performing a particular action.   In this case, the district court has not yet decided on the request for a preliminary injunction.   And even a preliminary injunction is not a decision on the merits. A preliminary injunction only preserves the status quo pending a resolution on the merits.
