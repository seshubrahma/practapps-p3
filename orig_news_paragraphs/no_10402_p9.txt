: Under what has been called the Plenary Power Doctrine, at least some of the protections guaranteed by the U. S. Constitution do not apply to   living abroad and seeking admission to the U. S.   Law Professor Eric Posner of Chicago Law School described the doctrine this way: "The Supreme Court has held consistently, for more than a century, that constitutional protections that normally benefit Americans and people on American territory do not apply when Congress decides who to admit and who to exclude as immigrants or other entrants. This is called the plenary power doctrine. The Court has repeatedly turned away challenges to immigration statutes and executive actions on grounds that they discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, and political belief, and that they deprive foreign nationals of due process protections. While the Court has not ruled on religious discrimination, it has also never given the slightest indication that religion would be exempt from the general rule.
