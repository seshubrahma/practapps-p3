Overall, the population of foreign college graduates working in the United States exceeds 1 million  â€”   and exceeds the annual number of young Americans who graduate with   degrees in technology, business or healthcare. The   jobs are mostly in the information technology business, but they also include many prestigious jobs in accounting, engineering, academia, government agencies, and in healthcare, both on the coasts and in the heartland of the country. Many universities, include Rice University, have hired roughly 100, 000 foreign graduates via the   visa program as   professors, doctors, therapists, and scientists. On Jan. 17, three days before he leaves office, Obama is expected to release a set of regulations that will further expand the   program.
