Couple all this with Trumpâ€™s calls during this campaign to change the libel laws to make it easier for him to sue media outlets who unfairly criticize him, and this is no laughing matter.   Would a President Trump use the apparatus of the federal government    such as the Federal Communications Commission    to intimidate comedians and dissuade them from mocking him?   Yes, I know we have a First Amendment, but alarmingly I bet there are Trump supporters who would go along with anything Trump asks for, even if it was flat out unconstitutional.   (Trump has bragged as much, claiming he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would stand with him.)
