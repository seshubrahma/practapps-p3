Breitbart News recently reported that the Iraqi Christian militias have reached an agreement to unify their armed groups to seize and secure the Nineveh Plain, their historical homeland in northern Iraqâ€™s Nineveh province, which fell into the hands of ISIS in 2014. Youkhana, one of the Christian militia leaders who signed the agreement, told Breitbart News: Today, the Assyrian Christian community in the Middle East is under siege and threatened with annihilation. But we are confident that, with the support of the United States and other allies, we can create a strong community that will be a bastion of liberty and democracy in the region.
