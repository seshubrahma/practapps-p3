Finally, after public pressure grew, I got a late Monday night meeting with Sen. Rubio the day before this    bill was introduced. I raised my many public safety concerns and pleaded with him not to drop the bill until these public safety concerns with law enforcement were addressed. They dropped it anyway  â€¦      [the bill will] put the public safety at risk without doubt.
