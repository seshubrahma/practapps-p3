Johnson wins 10% of the vote in a   competition, taking about equally from Trump and Clinton, whose lead scales down to 41% to 36%. Despite having seen off his last primary rival nearly eight weeks ago, Trump also lags behind Clinton on the party unity front. His lead among Republicans is down to 74% from 82% in May. And only 52% of registered GOP voters who had previously supported one of his opponents picked the billionaire businessman over Clinton.
