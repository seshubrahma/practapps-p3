In fact, for my fiancee, it took her a long time to come over to Trump, in part due to fearing that his ideology was more rooted in a sort of "America for Whites" (that and her fear of Trump being rooted in an "America for Men"). But I think that Trump, messaging problems aside, wants any race to be successful in America, be it black, white, Latino, or Asian. I do not want a Trump presidency to turn into a racist administration.      action is great, but actual discrimination?
