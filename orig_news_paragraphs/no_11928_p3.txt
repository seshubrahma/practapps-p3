In a second Florida case, authorities charged Tomika Curgil, a      woman from Liberty City, with filling out voter registration information for five voters without their consent and submitting 17 more registrations for fictitious people, ABC News 10 reported. Authorities said Curgil was working for a group working to legalize marijuana called People United for Medical Marijuana. Investigators alleged that despite never venturing out from her home on her "work day" for the voter registration drive, Curgil nonetheless handed in the stack of registrations.
