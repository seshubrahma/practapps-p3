Washington (CNN) Besieged by bad news at home, President Donald Trump is about to get religion, bigly.    In his first foreign trip as President, which begins Friday, Trump has planned a pilgrimage of sorts, visiting the homelands of all three Abrahamic faiths    Judaism, Christianity and Islam    before heading to Europe for meetings with Pope Francis and NATO leaders.   In all, itâ€™s an ambitious     tour that will test the religious acumen and diplomatic skills of a President who, beyond courting conservative Christians and casting suspicion on Muslims, rarely talks about religion.
