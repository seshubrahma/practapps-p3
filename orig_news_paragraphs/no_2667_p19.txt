In his video statement released early Saturday, Mr. Trump said: "Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize. " "I pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down," he added, before ending the message with a promise to bring up the sex scandals of Bill Clinton’s presidency and Hillary Clinton’s response to them.
