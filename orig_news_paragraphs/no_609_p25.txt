The final   legislative package would aim to "increase the quality, availability and affordability of private and public health insurance to over 44 million uninsured Americans," as the administration put it. Applicants whose income was between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line would be eligible for federally subsidized insurance. Those with incomes at or below 138 percent would now qualify for Medicaid in states that chose to participate in the program. Young people up to the age of 26 were permitted to stay on their parentsâ€™ health insurance.
