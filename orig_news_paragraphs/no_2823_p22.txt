Dr. Peale favored Republicans  â€”   in 1956, he assailed the Democratic presidential candidate, Adlai E. Stevenson, because he had been divorced. Mr. Stevenson countered, "I find the Apostle Paul appealing and the Apostle Peale appalling. " In 1960, when John F. Kennedy was the Democratic nominee, Dr. Peale and 25 other Protestant leaders were so fearful of Vatican influence on a Kennedy administration that they gathered at the invitation of the Rev. Billy Graham and discussed ways to defeat him. Dr. Peale was attacked for his involvement and later called the episode one of the most painful of his life.
