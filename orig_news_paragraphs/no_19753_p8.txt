* * Many Americans know AMOC as the Gulf Stream: the warm,   current in the Atlantic Ocean that hugs the East Coast. You may have seen it in the old map by Ben Franklin, pictured above: It flows up the Carolinas, passes by New England and Nova Scotia, and then veers toward Europe. Eventually it arrives near the British isles and northwestern Europe. The Gulf Stream is part of a much larger system, however.
