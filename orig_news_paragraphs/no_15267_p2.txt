The order is   for the conservatives that animated Trump, many of whom have long complained about the federal government guiding education standards and practices in their local schools. It is also in line with DeVos’ long record advocating for more local control of schools, something the top Republican donor has done for decades through her political giving. The order specifically calls for a   review of education regulations on grades   proposed and enacted by former President Barack Obama    and instructs DeVos, a longtime advocate for local control of education, to produce a report that details which actions she believes overreached. It isn’t entirely clear, however, whether the order actually provides the education secretary with more power.
