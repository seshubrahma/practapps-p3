I was a history and government major at Ohio State University, and I’ve spent a lot of time just fiddling around with who the next President’s going to be, over the years, or who would I like to see in that job, or whatever. And I’ve come to believe, without any reservation, in this era the   person for this job by far is Donald Trump. The reason is because he has learned how to deal with problems. You know, he’s not just an American.
