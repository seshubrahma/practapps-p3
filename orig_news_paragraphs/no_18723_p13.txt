"Gavin Wax, a Cruz campaign New York state director, told Business Insider that Cruz’s plan relies on pulling delegates away from Trump in downstate areas where he said Trump has little institutional support. " ’ "We think we can pull a few delegates here and there, especially downstate where there were a lot of Rubio supporters who are coming on either publicly or behind the scenes," Wax said, referring to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a former candidate. ’ ’Wax said that Cruz would be back in the state before the April 19 primary, and his wife, Heidi Cruz, would be holding a March 29 event in Sheepshead Bay, a Brooklyn neighborhood, as well as events in Staten Island and on Long Island.
