That connection has fueled concerns particularly because of Russia’s alleged hacking of the elections and Trump’s conciliatory stance toward Moscow, which many lawmakers see as a geopolitical threat. They point to Russian support for the Syrian regime, its 2014 annexation of Crimea, its destabilizing actions in eastern Ukraine and aggressive moves against NATO allies. Trump has rejected the intelligence community assessment that Russia was behind the hacks and has appointed a national security adviser who, at one point, was paid for appearances on a   Russian TV network. That makes Tillerson’s closeness to Putin additionally worrying for Russia critics.
