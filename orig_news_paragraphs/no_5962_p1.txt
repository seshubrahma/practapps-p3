"   The U. S. military "has become a de facto supporter of terrorist groups who are killing the innocent people of the region to put into practice the secret operation of the U. S. and U. S. intelligence organizations in the region," Boroujerdi added, according to Iran’s Mehr News Agency. " The Intelligence Organization of the U. S. and the U. S.
