Press reports indicate that he worked a   job at a Home Depot store near his home in Columbus for about a year. Besides that part time job, there is no other indication that anyone in Artanâ€™s family was employed. Breitbart News asked Jon Keeling, director of communication for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services how much total financial support Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and his six siblings received from the federal government and the state of Ohio between June 2014 and November 2016. Breitbart News also asked if   refugees who became secondary migrants to Ohio were eligible to receive food stamps, welfare payments, and other financial assistance.
