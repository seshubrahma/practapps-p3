I, evidently, needed to start writing for publications that were trusted by Trump supporters. So, two weeks ago, I emailed my contacts at Breitbart News to tell them I would be happy to start contributing. My reasoning is very simple: I believe we are living in a new political order, where populism is a permanent fixture in our democracy. I might vehemently disagree with some of the   and militaristic beliefs that Trump used to excite his supporters.
