Recent research from noted   economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard and Alan Krueger of Princeton   found that almost all the job growth in the United States between   2005 and 2015 came from temporary or freelance work, which   generally doesnâ€™t offer stability, never mind access to 401( k)s   with generous employer matches. And people like Whitehouse who   think they can remain in the workforce well past the traditional   retirement age could be in for a shock. About half of Americans   retire before they plan due to circumstances outside of their   control.
