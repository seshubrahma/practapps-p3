 (CNN) Hillary Clinton has pneumonia, her doctor said Sunday, hours after the Democratic nominee stumbled and exited a   commemoration ceremony early.   The incident seems certain to prompt further scrutiny of Clinton’s health and her campaign’s transparency    though Republican rival Donald Trump was uncharacteristically silent throughout a solemn day marking the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Clinton, 68, was diagnosed on Friday with pneumonia, and "was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule," Dr. Lisa Bardack said in a statement.
