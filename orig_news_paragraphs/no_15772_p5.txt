Trump’s attacks on Khan seem so unnecessary as to be incomprehensible, but they are not as   as some of the President’s other outbursts. For months, the President has sought to ban travelers from six   countries and been rebuffed by federal judges who see this action as a form of religious discrimination. One of the sticking points cited by the courts has been his repeated references to the policy as a "ban" on Muslims. Trump has continued to speak of a "ban," even though the label could hurt his legal case.
