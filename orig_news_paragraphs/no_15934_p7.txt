Mohammed bin Salman’s elevation to    to the throne comes at the expense of his cousin, the now former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz. He had been named to that role in 2015, in what many at the time called a surprise power shift, replacing the King’s   Prince Muqrin as future ruler and bumping Mohammed bin Salman to second in the line of succession.   That move has now been overturned, with Mohammed bin Nayef also stripped of his title and his roles as deputy prime minister and interior minister. Images published in Saudi state media showed the new crown prince kissing the hand of Mohammed bin Nayef, who was said to have pledged allegiance to the man who has replaced him at the Safa Palace in Mecca.
