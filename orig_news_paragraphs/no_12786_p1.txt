Trump certainly hasn’t articulated a specific proposal for how to counter the forces of globalization and ensure that   Americans can compete and win in a 21st century global economy," spokesman Josh Earnest said during the daily press briefing today.   " I just don’t think the results in Michigan tell us something that we didn’t already know about the public’s view of this, particularly in the state of Michigan," Earnest said. According to exit polls of Michigan, nearly 60 percent of voters said they believed free trade takes away jobs, while only 30 percent said it creates jobs.
