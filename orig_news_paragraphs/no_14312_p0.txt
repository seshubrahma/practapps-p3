 (CNN) The enforcement of President Donald Trump’s executive order halting the admission of refugees to the United States came to a grinding halt this weekend after a federal judge in Washington state issued a temporary restraining order. The judge’s ruling, which the President soon condemned on Twitter, raises more questions than it answers.   The state of Washington argued before Judge James Robart that the restraining order should be issued to stop any harm while it pursues its case.
