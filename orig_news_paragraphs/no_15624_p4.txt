Wittes added, "I suddenly understood them in a different and frankly, a more menacing and upsetting light than I had at the time of the conversation. "  Wittes detailed a few incidents that he said made Comey feel the agencyâ€™s independence and ability to do its job in an apolitical fashion were not being respected.   One incident was when Trump invited law enforcement officials to the Blue Room to express his thanks for their work at the inauguration just days before. Wittes says Comey was reluctant to attend and tried his best to not have any personal conversation with Trump.
