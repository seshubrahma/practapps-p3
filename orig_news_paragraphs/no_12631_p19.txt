I have taken advertising from Donald Trump. And I would take advertising from Hillary Clinton because this is a business and I donâ€™t believe keeping options gone. However, I think everybody should be able to have their voice heard on the public airwaves. However, me getting information or email list now on Donald Trump is really rather annoying.
