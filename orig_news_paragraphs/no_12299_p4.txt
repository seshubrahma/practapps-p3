For the first time since I became a citizen in 1983, I will not vote for the Republican candidate for President," Schwarzenegger, who is due to take over for Trump as host of NBCâ€™s The Apprentice next year, said in the statement. Schwarzenegger was a vocal supporter of Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the GOP primary earlier this year. De Niro, who endorsed Clinton in April, has taken repeated aim at both Trump and his celebrity supporters in recent months.
