U. S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith of the Eastern District of Michigan had originally granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) —  the most extreme form of judicial action —  ordering state officials to begin the recount on December 5. Michigan and the Michigan Republican Party filed an emergency appeal, and the next day, the TRO was upheld in a   decision by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. (Of the two judges voting to affirm the lower court, one was appointed by Bill Clinton, the other by Barack Obama.)
