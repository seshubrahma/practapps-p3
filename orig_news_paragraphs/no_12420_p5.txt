He then walked a few blocks to attend a service as passed in a congressional resolution two days prior: Resolved, That after the oath shall have been administered to the President, he, attended by the Vice President and members of the Senate and House of Representatives, shall proceed to St. Paul’s Chapel, to hear divine service.
