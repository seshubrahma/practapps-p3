Thursday on MSNBC’s "The Last Word," The Atlantic senior editor David Frum warned of "recriminations" aimed at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his supporters should Trump lose and "lose as big as he’s going to. "  Frum was skeptical the movement Trump is leading would survive beyond the November election and said the new movement would be made out of opposition to the "Hillary Clinton administration. " When Donald, should he lose and should he lose as big as he’s going to, there is going to be a scorched earth period of recrimination and Donald Trump will be the target of the recriminations and the people around him will be the target of the recrimination," Frum said.
