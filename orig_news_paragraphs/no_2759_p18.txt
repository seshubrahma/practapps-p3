For his part, Mr. Obama also made a startling admission as he described how his administration had reacted to the Russian hack: He said it was not until the "beginning of the summer" that the White House was "alerted to the possibility that the D. N. C. has been hacked. " That was nine months after an F. B. I. agent had first contacted the Democratic National Committee with evidence that a major,   hacking group was inside the committeeâ€™s networks, raising the question of why it took so long for that news to reach the president. Mr. Obama made it clear that he went out of his way to play down the news, because "in this hyperpartisan atmosphere" he did not think he or anyone else at the White House could talk about it without risking to appear to be acting on behalf of Mrs. Clinton.
