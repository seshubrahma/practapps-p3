Employers say they need the foreign workers because they can’t hire enough Americans for   jobs, even at wages of $12 per hour or higher. But critics  —   and much evidence   —   say the programs are rife with corruption, including fake resumes, fraudulent visa applications,    payments, workplace and hiring discrimination against Americans, as well as false claims by lobbyists and corporates that too few Americans want to work at companies such as Goldman Sachs or Facebook or in the New York fashion industry.
