It appears voters’ views of Trump are not yet set in stone even though he’s well known.   Some polls show his favorability numbers climbing among Republicans. The majority of Republicans    57%    had a favorable view of Trump and 40% had an unfavorable view or him in the latest Washington   News poll. That’s a big shift from late May, when the same poll found 65% of Republicans had an unfavorable view of Trump.
