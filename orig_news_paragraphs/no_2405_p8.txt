Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose immigration policies Mr. Trump has dismissed as "insane," offered her cooperation but emphasized the importance of human rights, while President François Hollande of France noted that some of Mr. Trump’s views might test "the values and the interests that we share with the United States. " Mexican officials congratulated Mr. Trump but said they would not pay for his proposed border wall, as he has flatly insisted they will. Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers said on Wednesday that he had been fielding calls from politicians like Mr. Ryan and world leaders, while also assembling a cabinet and White House team and selecting a conservative nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy.
