Update:   websites and social media are celebrating Yates’s exchange with Cruz, as if she "schooled" him. Yates cited the   provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which has never been interpreted to overrule the president’s broad authority under 8 U. S. C. 1182( f) to determine immigration policy   —   a statute that Yates failed to name when Cruz asked her about it, yet which is central to the executive order. Joel B.
