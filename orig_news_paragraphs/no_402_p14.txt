In September, Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary at the time, promised a "   review" of complaints filed against Wells Fargo. But a Labor Department web page on which Wells Fargo employees could report violations has abruptly disappeared, Ms. Warren noted in a letter sent on Friday. "Taking down this website enables Wells Fargo to escape full responsibility for its fraudulent actions and the department to shirk its outstanding obligations to American workers," Ms. Warren wrote. That page was taken down in early January, nearly two weeks before Mr. Trumpâ€™s inauguration, according to Stephen Barr, a Labor Department spokesman.
