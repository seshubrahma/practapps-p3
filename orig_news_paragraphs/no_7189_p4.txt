Giuliani is staying on as Vice Chairman of the Presidential Transition Team. " Rudy would have been an outstanding member of the Cabinet in several roles, but I fully respect and understand his reasons for remaining in the private sector," Trump added. In the press release about the withdrawal, Giuliani explained why he was removing his name: I joined the campaign because I love my country and because having known Donald Trump as a friend for 28 years and observing what he has been able to accomplish, I had no doubt he would be a great President.
