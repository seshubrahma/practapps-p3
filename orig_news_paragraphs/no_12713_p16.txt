Take all the responses from the PRRI poll together, and we might form a hypothesis that much of the "wrong track" feeling that grips American voters stems from their sense of helplessness, their anger at a   system that doesnâ€™t represent their interests, or grant them the independence to make their own decisions.   People on the Left and Right have very different ideas about who the masters of that system are, and those differences make meaningful political cooperation difficult.
