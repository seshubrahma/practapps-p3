Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private American placement, as did several other of Mr. Collinsâ€™s associates and donors, according to the company filing. Mr. Price and Mr. Hook also participated in a second offering in the summer, the filings show. Mr. Price purchased between $50, 000 and $100, 000 in Innate shares in August, which was among the largest stock buys he had made since 2012, according to congressional financial disclosures. The investment was larger than his trades in more established pharmaceutical stocks like Pfizer and Merck.
