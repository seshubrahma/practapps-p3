Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," conservative radio host Laura Ingraham advised President Donald Trump to remain on track when it comes delivering his promises to the country and to not allow the investigation into his ties with Russia to get him off track.   " I do think it’s probably pretty wise at this point for President Trump to not to tweet issues or points that are tangential or that are not factually confirmed," Ingraham said.
