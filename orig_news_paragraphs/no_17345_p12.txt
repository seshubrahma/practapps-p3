Rice called for Trump to leave the presidential race in October, as he became mired in sexual assault allegations. Other Bush officials praised the choice of Tillerson, including former Vice President Dick Cheney and Baker, who worked both for George W. Bush and his fatherâ€™s administration.   " Rex Tillerson, who is a friend of mine, is an excellent choice to head the State Department and has an opportunity to be a very effective secretary of state," Baker said.
