In fact, Johnson was a president who paid a steep price for refusing to change.   Although he campaigned in 1964 promising to be tough against communism, without going as far as his opponent Barry Goldwater, he refused to change course when officials such as Sen. Richard Russell and Vice President Hubert Humphrey warned him in 1965 that the Vietnam War was a mistake. Instead he got the nation deeper and deeper into a quagmire that eventually undid him and had disastrous consequences.   If Trump refuses to adjust and recalibrate on some key issues, there will be a tipping point where he canâ€™t overcome the institutional limits of his power, particularly given his weak standing in the national polls.
