Some Democrats planned to make a statement with their wardrobe as well: A group of female members planned to wear white, the color of the suffragist movement, in a signal to Mr. Trump on women’s rights. Representative Lois Frankel of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic Women’s Working Group, said on Twitter that the choice of attire symbolized "a pledge to protect women ’s health, fair pay, paid leave  more!" Based on the preview that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, gave reporters on Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to hark back to his "law and order" theme by promising more aggressive federal policing of gun crimes, drugs and other areas in response to a rise in violent crime in some big cities.
