A lot of that sentiment has been there," said Ms. Perry, who said the internet has helped spread the ideology. Canada has witnessed a flurry of nationalist groups proliferating in recent years, including the Soldiers of Odin, a white nationalist group that began in Finland. While the Canadian group has denied racist beliefs and members have participated in community foot patrols in cities like Edmonton and Vancouver, its main Canada Facebook page has   screeds and derogatory references to immigrants. The Canadian authorities have recorded thousands of   crimes in recent years, but Ms. Perry said Canadian law enforcement officials have played down the threat of   extremists, preferring instead to focus on Islamic terrorism.
