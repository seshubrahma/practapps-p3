She is also an emeritus trustee at A. U. B. and usually goes back to Beirut once a year for meetings. She remarried in 2008. She and Ken Adams share the California house that she and Malcolm bought in 1969. The stately living room, with a grand piano and views of the Pacific Ocean, is neatly decorated with treasures of a   life, like etchings of Cairo and Annâ€™s framed watercolors of Tunisia.
