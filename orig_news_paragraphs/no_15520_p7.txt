What purpose would that possibly serve? If you think Comey just misinterpreted the meeting, his history on this stuff would suggest thatâ€™s wrong. His detailed memory of an attempt by   House chief of staff Andy Card and   House counsel Alberto Gonzales to convince   General John Ashcroft, sick in the hospital, to reauthorize the domestic spying program in 2004, wound up being validated. The second big issue with the White House story is, why would Trump ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Vice President Mike Pence to leave the room before making the request of Comey unless Trump knew that what he was doing was extremely iffy    and wanted to avoid witnesses?
