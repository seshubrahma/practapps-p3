Reeling off a list of damages done to Sweden by mass migration in the opinion piece   with fellow SD politician Mattias Karlsson, Mr Åkesson urged America to take heed and not repeat the same mistakes of immigration and cultural capitulation made in Europe.   Mr Åkesson wrote: When President Trump last week raised Sweden’s problematic experience with   immigration, skeptics were quick to dismiss his claims. Two days later an immigrant suburb of Stockholm was racked by another riot. No one was seriously injured, though the crowd burned cars and hurled stones at police officers.
