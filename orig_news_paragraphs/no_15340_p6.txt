All in all, this is a record of which I am very proud, on behalf of myself, my management team and the many dedicated Heritage staff and members nationwide," he said. Known for helping fund   conservative Republican primary challengers through his Senate Conservatives Fund, DeMint resigned from his Senate seat in 2013 to take the helm at Heritage. The organization has been closely linked to Trump’s campaign and his White House    including helping craft the list of potential Supreme Court nominees that included recently confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch. Its board includes Rebekah Mercer, the GOP financial titan who is close to Trump’s organization and holds a stake in Breitbart, the   news outlet that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon ran prior to joining Trump’s campaign.
