Wikileaks’ Julian Assange said that the organisation plans to release a "lot more" leaked material on Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party in the run up to November’s presidential election. [Assange, who is still currently hiding from extradition in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, told CNN that the leaks are "having so much political impact in the United States" after Wikileaks released 19, 000 classified emails from the Democratic National Committee.   The emails revealed tactics used by the DNC to derail Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic nomination. The findings have increased tensions at the Democratic National Convention this week as Hilary Clinton receives the nomination, with many Sanders even walking out in protest.
