As it heads into its 42nd season and an autumn that is teeming with potential for political satire, "Saturday Night Live" is undergoing some visible changes and shedding three performers from its ensemble. Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah, principal cast members who had been with "S. N. L. " since 2010 and contributed many key impersonations on the program, are both leaving the show, as is Jon Rudnitsky, a featured player who appeared during the   season. Their departures were confirmed by Lauren Roseman, a press representative for NBC. Presidential contests tend to bring added focus and intensity to "S. N. L. ," which will have its season premiere on Oct. 1.
