Mr. Trump himself has been critical of the Electoral College in the past. On the eve of the 2012 election, he called it "a disaster for a democracy" in a Twitter post. Now, after months of railing against what he called a "rigged" election, he has become the unlikely beneficiary of an electoral system that enables a candidate to win the race without winning over the most voters. None of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters have gone so far as to suggest that the popular vote tally should delegitimize Mr. Trump’s victory, and the   margin in Tuesday’s election was in fact narrower than the one that separated Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore in 2000.
