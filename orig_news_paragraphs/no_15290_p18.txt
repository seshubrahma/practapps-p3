On April 20, the UN Security Council formally condemned North Koreaâ€™s latest missile launch, demanding that it "immediately" cease further actions that violate resolutions. Russia denied it had previously blocked the action, saying that it wanted to add language to the document. North Korea launched a missile April 29 that blew up over land, a US official said. The missile failed to reach the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.
