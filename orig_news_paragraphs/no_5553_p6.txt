Basha said he believed that Rama is George Soros’ primary investment in Albania and the Balkans. The mayor claimed that his attacks on Soros personally, and his support for President Donald Trump, have made him the target of Soros organization smears: "I have been viciously attacked by him and his people and also the international media because I am a Trump supporter. " Rama served at a board member of the Soros Foundation in Albania and Soros funded a   project designed to politically transform the country in partnership with Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.
