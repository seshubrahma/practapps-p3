Clinton’s less inspiring lessons, On the day Hillary Clinton clinched the nomination for president, it’s hard not to wonder what message young women in America will learn from this historic moment.   For sure, they will learn, if they didn’t already know, that a woman can compete for the highest office in the land. They’ll also learn that women are a major force in electoral politics, and if any politician wants to win, he or she will likely have to do it with the help of women voters. But I fear they’ll also take away some less inspiring lessons.
