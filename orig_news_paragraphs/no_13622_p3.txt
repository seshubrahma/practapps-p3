Another interesting note: Denver is   in games Clete Blakeman (today’s referee) referees. As ESPN pointed out, the Broncos had been   in games in which Ed Hochuli was the referee and made it   after their AFC title game victory over the Patriots. I’m not betting against Newton, though. He always is at his best when the klieg lights are the brightest.
