Manafort strongly denies any wrongdoing in connection with his work for Trump and foreign officials. He has offered to testify in the House and Senate intelligence committees’ investigations into Russia’s election interference. " Like many companies doing business internationally, my company was paid via wire transfer, typically using clients’ preferred financial institutions and instructions," Manafort said in a statement to CNN last Friday.
