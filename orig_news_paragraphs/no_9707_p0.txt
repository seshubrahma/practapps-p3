Sharyl Attkisson talked to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle Friday about her new show, Full Measure with Sheryl Attkisson, as well as current events and an extremely disturbing trend. Elites have become adept at controlling media narratives, going so far as to ostracize reporters who "veer" from a particular narrative: "It’s certainly happening here in the United States," said Attkisson. [Asked if American media appear to be aggressively pushing a particular narrative, specifically gun control in light of the recent terrorism in Orlando, Attkisson said:  I think they’ve been pushing narratives a lot for the last couple of years in a way I haven’t seen five years ago   …      ten years ago, for sure.
