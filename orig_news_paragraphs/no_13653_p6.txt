Trump, momentarily confused, mistook the silver plates circulated around the auditorium and dug several bills out of his pocket. If the AP’s reporting is accurate, Trump’s error is one I myself would have almost certainly made in his situation (being a visitor in this particular church). As a regular churchgoer for two decades now, my muscle memory is programmed to expect the collection plate before we take Communion. Moreover, only the collection plate is passed around at my church.
