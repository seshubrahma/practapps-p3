According to Lewis, the Trump campaign considered two other options: Republican operative Jimmy Camp, and former Arnold Schwarzenegger statewide director Kathy Tavoularis. Camp declined the job because of his opposition to Trump, and Tavoularis was passed over by Trump’s convention director, Paul Manafort, who ostensibly wanted "his people" in California. Clark, who spoke exclusively with Breitbart News earlier in April to announce that the Trump campaign already had a list of "about a thousand" potential delegates in California, is reportedly taking the controversy in stride and making campaign plans. He is setting up the campaign’s state headquarters in Sacramento, which allows the campaign to strike deep into territory otherwise held by Sen. Ted Cruz ( ).
