The report predicts that Social Security will provide a modest    adjustment, increasing benefits by   of 1 percent next year. But, it warned of a "substantial increase" in Medicare premiums in 2017 for about 30 percent of beneficiaries. Under assumptions in the report, the standard premium, now $121. 80 a month, would rise to $149, and the change could be announced just weeks before Election Day on Nov. 8. Congress took action last year to shore up Social Securityâ€™s disability insurance trust fund, but the report says the legislation was a   fix.
