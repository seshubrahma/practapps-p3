To support this work, our School Board is evaluating a Resolution in support of every student, every day in an equitable and inclusive environment. " "We will continue providing all students their legal right to access free public   education, regardless of their religion, their place of birth, their language, their citizenship, their immigration status, their parentsâ€™ status or any other legally protected characteristics," Santorno wrote in the letter. The Tacoma Public School District is one of the first education systems promising to protect migrants with a physical safe zone for them, echoing similar strategies by universities across the country which have promised to be "sanctuary campuses".
