Hamilton imagines that judges will be objective, that they will be rational, exercising reasonable judgment on what the words of the Constitution and laws mean. It’s a world away from what leftist activist judges want the Supreme Court to be. You don’t hear anything about "relativism" and "diversity," which claim to be the mothers of social peace and loving kindness, but in our day mean ramming boys on college campuses into kangaroo courts where they’re presumed guilty if a girl screams "rape!" or a black person screams "racist! "
