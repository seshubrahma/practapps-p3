We at Terps for Trump regret to inform that we have run into some bumps regarding funding for this event. Due to incidents bomb threats made at other schools that Milo had agreed to perform at and the general tensions with unruly students, the security team has increased our rate for their coverage to around 2000 dollars as they need extra   units along with the forced change to a more expensive, venue (i. e Richie Coliseum) bringing the total cost of the event to 6500 dollars. We all love and appreciate Milo’s work and wholeheartedly want him to give his talk at our University, however we simply cannot afford to pay for this more or less enormous last minute bill by ourselves. At the end of the day, we’re simply a group of college students with a limited pool of income.
