Schumer confirms Trump told him he likes him better than Republicans, "What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a   economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didnâ€™t have that in this election," Schumer said.
