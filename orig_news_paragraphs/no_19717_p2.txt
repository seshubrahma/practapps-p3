I feel like the wall, and his strong   immigration stance, are his signature policy proposals, and he would have to cave to pressure from establishment   Republicans and betray his immigration policies he laid out in his AZ speech. His   policies and ideas are very important to my family and I as well. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, he has to appoint conservative,   SCOTUS judges. Really, for me it comes down to the immigration, trade, and SCOTUS issues.
