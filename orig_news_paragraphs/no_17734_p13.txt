’ ’    The International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) which   organizes law students and lawyers to protect legal and human   rights for refugees and displaced persons, put out a call on its   website last week for lawyers to travel to airports to offer   legal advice to refugees arriving in the US who might be   detained. ’ ’    A representative for the project told Business Insider last week   that they received a "great response," but that they were waiting   to mobilize until it was clear that the refugees with valid visas   would actually be denied entry.
