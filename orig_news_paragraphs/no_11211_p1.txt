Comedian Amy Schumer has openly stated that she wonâ€™t be leaving the country via a lengthy Instagram post, featuring a previously debunked photo of Donald Trump.    First of all the interview where I said I would move was in London and was said in jest. Not that anyone needs more than a headline to count something as official news. Anyone saying pack your bags is just as disgusting as anyone who voted for this racist homophobic openly disrespectful woman abuser.
