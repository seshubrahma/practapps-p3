Pollster and political strategist Pat Caddell told Breitbart Newsâ€™ Matt Boyle that the recount was little more than an effort to undermine the legitimacy of the forthcoming Trump administration. There have been no reports of hacking or any other major irregularities during the election to justify any recounts, but   Donald Trump has noted that if the illegal votes of millions of undocumented aliens were eliminated, we might just find that he won the popular vote as well as the Electoral College vote. Voter integrity organization True The Vote agrees with Trump that millions of illegals voted in this past election, having a negative impact on the election.
