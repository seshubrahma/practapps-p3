The Times reported on Sunday night that FBI director James Comey is asking the Department of Justice to deny publicly "that President Barack Obama ordered the tapping of Mr. Trump’s phones," as if that amounts to a refutation of the entire scandal. But again, the report hinges on the word "phones," and has nothing to do with the mountain of evidence that the Times itself has presented. In that report, and in an accompanying report dismissing Breitbart News’ reporting on the story as a "conspiracy theory," the Times pointedly refused to link to Breitbart, refusing to allow its readers an opportunity to make up their own minds. The fact is that there is more evidence in the Times‘ own pages to substantiate the "conspiracy theory" of the Obama administration
