right, your sense of time is going to be a little bit compressed, given what you are dealing with there.   But I totally get your concern that it seemed like you guys were on your own for a while and outgunned, even though you had some Capitol police there, some security detail there.    You are saying they had handguns and you believe this was a long gun to be sure.
