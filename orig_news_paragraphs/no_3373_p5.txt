The "  policy" may possibly become a "  policy" but China’s police state population control policies will not end anytime soon. The Chinese government retains the power to tell couples what their families must look like and the power to punish those who disobey birth quotas. For the past 35 years the Chinese government has wasted precious human potential and sanctioned   violence against women and children —  enabled by   groups globally and the United Nations Population Fund. No one should applaud China’s announced " " policy instead we should be insisting they abolish intrusive and abusive birth restrictions forever.
