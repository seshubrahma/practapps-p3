Anyone who treasures integrity in the federal judiciary cannot help but cringe every time Donald J. Trump complains about the federal judge handling the   lawsuit against him on the grounds that the judge is of Mexican descent. [Because   U. S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curielâ€™s parents were legal immigrants from Mexico, Mr. Trump says, the judge is unable to give him a fair trial, since the GOP nominee has devoted so much of his presidential campaign to cleaning up the real scourge of illegal immigration.   Yuck! This is precisely the kind of confusion the left loves to use to dishonestly smear normal, decent Americans who are in no way racist but simply believe in the rule of law.
