" The Coloradans are joined in rebellion by New Jersey politician Steve Lonegan, the fierce Cruz supporter who ran against Cory Booker for Senate in 2013. Lonegan works for the   Courageous Conservatives PAC, which is fighting to free the delegates. The rebels also include Eric Oâ€™Keefe, the Wisconsin Club For Growth director who battled   efforts to crush his governor Scott Walker, and who adamantly supports Cruz.
