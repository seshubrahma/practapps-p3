There will never be another first time that somebody like Andy Warhol could step into a room with somebody like Babe Paley," said Deborah Davis, the author of the 2006 book "Party of the Century: The Fabulous Story of Truman Capote and the Black and White Ball," referring to one of Capote’s   swans   —    the socialite wife of William Paley, who built the CBS network. Before the Black and White Ball, no one had ever imagined, let alone attended, a formal party with a guest list so wildly catholic that it brought into one room the poet Marianne Moore and Frank Sinatra, Gloria Vanderbilt and Lionel Trilling, Lynda Bird Johnson and the Maharani of Jaipur, the Italian princess Luciana Pignatelli (wearing a   diamond borrowed from Harry Winston) and the documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles.
