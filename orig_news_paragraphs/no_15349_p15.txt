The President called about a dozen wavering Republican lawmakers throughout the day Tuesday, urging them to back the bill, a White House official said. Upton and Long were joined by GOP Reps. Greg Walden and Michael Burgess in their meeting with Trump Wednesday morning. Upton had rocked Capitol Hill Tuesday by publicly coming out against the GOP health care bill. His amendment would add $8 billion over five years to fund   pools and go toward patients with   conditions in states that seek waivers under the Republican legislation.
