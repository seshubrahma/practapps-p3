At the dog park, still covered in March snow, the old stranger with the husky appears again, and we chat about the promise of new blooms, our worries of climate change, the complications that separate and connect us. Happy New Year, we say to each other, Nowruz Mobarak. She reveals to me she taught in Iran long ago, and I realize she knows the hospital where I was born and has been to my mother’s hometown, that she remembers skiing on a day like this in our mountains. We walk together and laugh at how our dogs can’t stop licking the mounds of gray city ice that have a way to go until they are gone, but finally show signs of melting.
