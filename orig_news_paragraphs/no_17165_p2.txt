"Over the last   hours, reports have come in from experts, cyber experts, who are reporting to us some very troubling news about the possibility of security breaches in voting results across this country," Stein campaign manager David Cobb said in a video posted to Stein’s Facebook page Wednesday afternoon.    Donald Trump claimed Pennsylvania and Wisconsin    wins that helped push him comfortably over the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory    while Michigan remains too close to call, more than two weeks after Election Day.   While the loss of those states played a large part in Clinton’s downfall, her lead in the popular vote has continued to grow. She now has close to 2 million more votes than Trump    and pressure has been mounting among liberals for an investigation into what happened on Election Day.
