A few weeks after lunch with Signorelli von Braunhut, I visited the grand estate built by   south of the nationâ€™s capital just off a road called Hard Bargain. Large metal gates decorated with prancing     open to a number of No Trespassing signs. About a mile down the road, it turned into farmland, with a barn and a scalloped wood bridge decorated with large festive red bows crossing a pond gleaming with bright chartreuse scum. From the trees, like a visual illusion, a large brick house emerges.
