Pierson highlighted that Trumpâ€™s home state of New York is coming up after Wisconsin as is other northeastern states. She noted though, that in Wisconsin on Tuesday, "A win for Donald Trump would be phenomenal. " "We do have some other things we are going to be rolling out with regards to foreign policy," she teased, saying Trump is the only candidate not on the government pay roll who is taking it personal to fix the mess that politicians have created. Pierson said that in Wisconsin, Trump is "going to remind people that it was Senator Ted Cru and Paul Ryan that wrote a joint   together pushing for Obamatrade," she challenged, referencing a recent ad put out by Cruz saying Americans need fair trade.
