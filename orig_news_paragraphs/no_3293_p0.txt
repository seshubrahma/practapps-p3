The Australian government has taken the lead from President Donald Trump in the race to improve vetting of immigrants who may hold hostile Islamic attitudes, and to reform     programs like the     outsourcing visa. ["We’re defined by a commitment to common values, political values, the rule of law, democracy, freedom, mutual respect, equality for men and women," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the media on Thursday, where he described the reformed vetting process:  our citizenship process should reflect that. So today we are announcing changes to strengthen citizenship, to make for a stronger Australia, stronger citizenship, stronger citizen   …      before you apply to be a citizen. You will need to have competent English.
