On immigration issues, the federal government hides data about the scale of   programs, such as the   program, and it hides data about green card holders, said Steven Camarota, research director at the   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). Similarly, the federal government has muddled data regarding repatriations, he said, adding: "This is how the Obama administration made [the number of] deportations look higher. " The federal government does have data from the states about the number of illegal aliens in U. S. jails, but it only releases data about the annual number of hours spent by all illegal alien prisoners, he continued.
