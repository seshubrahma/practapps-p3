—   Fox Nation (@foxnation) June 4, 2017,   Nuttall also echoed Colonel Richard Kemp, a former COBRA committee member and commander of British forces in Afghanistan, in calling for Islamic State volunteers holding British nationality to have their "passport revoked [and] their citizenship removed" ensuring they "never be allowed to return to this country". He said he would "make no apologies for taking nothing off the table to ensure our people are kept safe". However, he stopped short of joining Colonel Kemp in calling for foreign nationals on the terror watch list to be deported or interned, and ruled out following U. S. President Donald Trump’s lead in attempting to impose restrictions on travel to and from failed states such as Libya and Syria, which have become major hotbeds of Islamic radicalism.
