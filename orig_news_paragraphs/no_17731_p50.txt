If I’m going to Europe, which is typically an   overnight flight, I’ll have a bite to eat and then immediately go   to sleep. When I go to Asia, typically you’re landing at night   time. I try to stay awake the full 13 or 14 hour flight over, so   that by the time I get there, I’m exhausted enough to get a great   night sleep. "
