Beck knows he has evangelical fans. But what he doesn’t realise is that they like him for the same reason they like NASCAR: they’re watching with craned necks for the next   disaster, complete with smoke, flames and burning tyres flying into the crowd.

After all, until Trump entered the market, Beck was the most popular conservative media personality that people secretly referred to as a dirty pinko.
