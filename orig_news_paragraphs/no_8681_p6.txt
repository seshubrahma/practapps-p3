The poll in 2004 was the first time the media confidence fell below 50 percent. But, from 2007 to 2015, the confidence bounced between 47 percent in 2007 and 40 percent in 2012, 2014, and 2015. The Gallup results validate findings of the   poll conducted Sept. 7 and Sept. 8, wherein 52 percent of respondents said the media treats GOP nominee for president Donald J. Trump negatively compared to how other politicians are treated and 44 percent said the media treats Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton positively compared to others.
