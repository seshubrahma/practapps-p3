If that seems shocking, buckle your seat belt. ISDS could lead to gigantic fines, but it wouldnâ€™t employ independent judges. Instead, highly paid corporate lawyers would go back and forth between representing corporations one day and sitting in judgment the next. Maybe that makes sense in an arbitration between two corporations, but not in cases between corporations and governments.
