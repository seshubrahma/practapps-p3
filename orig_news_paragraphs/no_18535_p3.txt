Senate Democrats   have raised questions about whether the men met at an April 2016   foreign policy event at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. The   Justice Department has said that while Sessions was there, for a   speech by Trump, there were no meetings or private encounters. ’ ’    Former FBI Director James Comey raised additional questions at a   hearing on Thursday, saying that the FBI expected Sessions to   recuse himself weeks before he actually did.
