"Underground" chronicles the story of a group of slaves and their grueling   escape from a Georgia plantation in the 1850s. The Macon 7, as theyâ€™re called, were aided by abolitionists along their journey through the Underground Raailroad during the antebellum South. Season 2, which premiered last Wednesday, begins with Rosalee on the run after having been separated from her family and the love of her life. Even though she has attained her own freedom, she is unable to be happy knowing that her loved ones are enslaved.
