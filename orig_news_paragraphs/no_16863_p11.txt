Where were Trump’s new critics    Rep. Jason Chaffetz, or Rep. Mike Coffman, or Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, or Sen. Crapo or Sen. Ayotte    at any point during the year’s long litany of outrages that preceded the release of this "Access Hollywood" videotape? Chaffetz has couched his withdrawal of support from Donald Trump in the context of having a daughter. If he had only a son    and not, as he does, a son and two daughters    would he still support Donald Trump? Putting aside the obvious critique that we stop rape culture when we teach our sons and every other man that consent is the only thing, fathers cannot just care about sexual violence against women if they have daughters.
