Indeed, millennial voters are becoming a significant problem for Clinton, dogged by her email controversy, questions about her honesty and being a   fixture of the Democratic establishment. In a Bloomberg poll released this week, Clinton leads Trump 50% % among voters under 35 in a   race, down from her   lead in August.
