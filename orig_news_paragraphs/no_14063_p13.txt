In 2016, Washington and its coalition partners conducted more than 7, 000 strikes in Iraq and Syria.   And in Libya, the United States has conducted more than 350 air strikes since August as part of its military campaign against ISIS there. Alternatively, it is possible the Obama administration decided that it is not worth antagonizing Pakistan with further strikes. Though Pakistan has criticized American strikes before  —   publicly, at least  —   the strike on Mullah Mansour may have generated a more significant reaction as it occurred in the province of Balochistan, violating an agreement that restricted American strikes to Pakistan’s tribal areas.
