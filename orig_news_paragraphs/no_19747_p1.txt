The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released a declassified version of its report on Russian interference with the U. S. election, following a Senate hearing on the subject yesterday. The report concludes that while hackers did not attempt to meddle directly with vote counts, the Russian government did order a series of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns in order to help Donald Trump win the election. However, it doesn’t make any new evidence public, and it’s unlikely to sway any of those who still doubt Russia’s role —  including Trump himself. The  ’s friendliness toward Russia sets him apart from most members of his own party as well as from Democrats.
