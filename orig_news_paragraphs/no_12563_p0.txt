Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s cabinet picks are starting to shape up just days before the election is to take place. [According to three campaign advisers who asked to remain anonymous, Trump’s transition staff is eyeing Rudy Giuliani for the position of attorney general, Newt Gingrich for the position of secretary of state, and Reince Priebus for chief of staff should Trump win the election, NBC News reported.   Other picks for the potential administration include retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary, the sources said. NBC News reports that Trump has not been too involved in transition efforts because he’s too worried about jinxing the election.
