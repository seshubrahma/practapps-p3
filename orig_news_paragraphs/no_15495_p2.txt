We saw more of that last night on "SNL," where McCarthy was back as Spicer and funnier than ever.   The sketch opened with Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (played by Aidy Bryant) holding a press conference because she claimed Spicer was away.    When a reporter pointed that he could see Spicer, who’s in the US Navy Reserve, outside the window hiding in the bushes, Sanders responded, "I believe that’s a naval exercise. He’s trying to blend in with his surroundings."
