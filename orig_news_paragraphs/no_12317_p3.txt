The first attempt by about a dozen   students to have a meeting eight days ago ended up with those students having their First Amendment rights trampled on as dozens of radical protestors affiliated with the Black Studies department and other   groups connected to the Portland State University Student Union jumped on furniture, screamed at   students and intimidated anyone who disagreed with them. As Portland State University’s student newspaper The Vanguard reported about the first event: Protesters could also be seen gathered outside the cafeteria window in the Portland State Park Blocks donning banners, international flags and signs of protest. Protesters took over the attempted meeting using the mic check call and response method —   mostly instigated by PSU Student Union organizers Olivia Pace and Alyssa Pagan.
