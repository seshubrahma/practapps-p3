He is prepared to work with the R. N. C. and the committees to raise the money necessary so that we will be well funded," Mr. Manafort said. In the 2012 elections, the R. N. C. raised more than $409 million. The party has raised $135 million this election, but what is deeply concerning to many Republican candidates, contributors and strategists is that it only had a little more than $16 million on hand, along with nearly $2 million in debt, at the end of March. Mr. Spicer stressed that this was partly because the committee had already begun paying to send staff members to battleground states, well ahead of the same time four years ago.
