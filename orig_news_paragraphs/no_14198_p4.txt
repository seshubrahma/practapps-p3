Harbour ended his speech with a call to action on what was already a   evening.   " Now, as we act in the continuing narrative of ’Stranger Things,’ we 1983 midwesterners will repel bullies, we will shelter freaks and outcasts    those who have no homes     [and] we will get past the lies, we will hunt monsters and when we are lost amidst the hypocrisy and casual violence of certain individuals and institutions, we will as per Chief Jim Hopper, punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy the weak, and the disenfranchised and the marginalized and we will do it all with soul, with heart and joy," he said.
