Instead, evangelicals are split into two camps and the divide has grown in the 20 years that Michael Lindsay, a sociologist who wrote the   book Faith in the Halls of Power: How Evangelicals Joined the American Elite, has studied evangelicalism in politics. Trump, and to a lesser extent Cruz, have tapped into the "populist evangelicals," those   folks who listen to conservative talk radio, are drawn to mass rallies and hold the idea that motivating great masses of people is the way to achieve political influence, Lindsay said. In this election, the populist,   sentiment has dominated so far, and Trump, the unlikely evangelical candidate, has benefited, he said.
