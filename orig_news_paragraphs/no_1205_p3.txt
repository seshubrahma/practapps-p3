Five of the eight judges in the majority were appointed by Republican presidents. The case stems from a lawsuit by Kimberly Hively, an Indiana teacher who has alleged that she was fired from Ivy Tech Community College because she is a lesbian. She applied to six   jobs at the school in South Bend, Ind. that she did not get, and she was let go from her   position there in 2014. The community college denies that she was discriminated against because of her sexual orientation.
