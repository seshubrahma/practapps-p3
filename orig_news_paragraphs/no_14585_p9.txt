But in pushing back on CNNâ€™s reporting Friday morning, two senior administration officials said Priebus had asked top FBI officials to brief reporters on background, or anonymously, after the FBI refused requests to publicly knock down the reports of contacts between Trump advisers and Russians known to US intelligence. And when that request was also denied, Priebus asked if he could cite "senior intelligence officials" in pushing back on the story himself in TV interviews last Sunday    which he did. Comey and McCabe both agreed to that request, telling Priebus he could say he was briefed by officials. The senior administration officials on Friday revealed the identity of those officials as McCabe and Comey, claiming that both privately called the reports about contacts inaccurate.
