WASHINGTON   —   President Trump, looking for a flicker of hope after his Republican majority fell to pieces last week, predicted that the opposition party would eventually give in: "I honestly believe the Democrats will come to us and say let’s get together and get a great health care bill or plan," he said. But Democrats will not be lending a hand anytime soon. Invigorated by the Republican dysfunction that led to a stunningly swift collapse of the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and relieved that President Barack Obama’s signature domestic accomplishment remains intact, Democrats are in their best position since their embarrassing loss in the November election.
