Can we stop playing like Democrats and Progressives don’t control the school system? Can we do some of that basic math and look at the "power plus influence plus money of the union equals total domination of the school system" equation? And if I could chose one event to prove Republicans really have no power in the school system, I’d point to the fact that God, Jesus, the Bible and prayer have been removed from schools. If Republicans had any control  —   shit, if the Republicans had total control  —   they would all be mandatory.
