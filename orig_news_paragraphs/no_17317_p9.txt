Cornerstone of diplomacy, Trump’s comments Sunday made clear he intends to force a new deal with China.   But it hasn’t been clear whether Trump was ready to eliminate the "one China" policy that has been the cornerstone of diplomatic relations since President Richard Nixon went to China. The formula, enshrined in the documents that eventually led to the establishment of US relations with China, permits Beijing to regard Taiwan as a part of China and the United States to sell the nationalist island arms to defend itself against the mainland, and has headed off a major   clash over the issue. But Trump has bristled at the policy, ignoring it and provoking China before even taking office.
