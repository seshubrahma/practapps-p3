Itâ€™s very unusual for a president to fire the head of the FBI, though it has happened before.    In a letter to the FBI chief, President Trump wrote: While I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you were not able to lead the bureau. One thing that is under investigation, formerly lead by Director Comey, was whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with alleged Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 U. S. presidential election.   President Trump has called that story phony, but critics say it was inappropriate for the president to fire Comey while that investigation is going on.
