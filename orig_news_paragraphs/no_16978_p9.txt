Vice President Joe Biden â€™s name was also floated for State, but he shot down the rumor in an interview.   Former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and former California Rep. Jane Harman are the likely candidates for CIA director or director of national intelligence.   For Treasury, names include Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg and former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler    who is also on the list for Commerce secretary, with   Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg.
