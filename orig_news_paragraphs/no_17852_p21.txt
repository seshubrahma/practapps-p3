that resolute faith in his own judgment, that     earnest sense of himself as unerring adjudicator and master     bullshit detector —   is a fundamental part of his vibe and     sometimes his appeal. Tapper’s confidence is a not altogether     uncharming element of his confrontational style (see that "no"     to Bannon) though it can wear thin. His recent contretemps     with BuzzFeed over that website’s decision     to share the specific contents of the "golden shower" memo, a     story CNN first broke, is another example of Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy and, in so doing, missing the forest to yell at     another tree.
