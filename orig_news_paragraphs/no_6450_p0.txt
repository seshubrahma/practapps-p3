["I applaud House conservatives for keeping their word to the American people and standing up against Obamacare Lite," said Sen. Rand Paul ( ) —  the sponsor of his own bill, the Obamacare Repeal Act, S. 554, which is the same legislation, with an updated timeline, to repeal major components of Obamacare that every Republican in the House and Senate voted to pass in 2015.
