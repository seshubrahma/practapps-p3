The Republicans used an unusual parliamentary procedure to repeal a rule that stems from the law with only a majority of votes, rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The Senate voted 52 to 47 to void the rule, which requires oil companies to publicly disclose payments made to governments when developing resources around the world. The rule, which   assigned to the S. E. C. to enforce, was tangential to the law â€™s mission of reforming Wall Street, but lawmakers included it anyway with the hope of exposing bribes and corruption.
