Mr. Trump would face difficulties in his plans to eliminate the E. P. A. although it is likely he could substantively reduce its size. He would need approval from Congress to completely erase the agency, said Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University and a former counselor to Mr. Obama. Ms. Freeman noted that several major environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, specifically call for rules to be enacted and overseen by the E. P. A. Changing those   rules would also require action from Congress, and Senate Democrats would certainly block such efforts  —   unless Senate Republican leaders opt to scuttle what is left of filibuster rules already weakened by Democrats. In China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas polluter, climate change officials said they intended to continue with plans to cut carbon emissions regardless of Mr. Trump’s plans.
