The latter substantially undermines the U. S. strategy of resolving the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea and securing the sea lanes from Chinese control by relying on the recent UN tribunal ruling denying Beijingâ€™s claims and through U. S. military and diplomatic cooperation with regional allies. The South China Sea has huge   mineral deposits and is a vital passage for some $5 trillion annually of international shipping. Open access has been secured by the U. S. Navy in cooperation with regional allies since World War II, and the stability of that framework is vital not merely to global commerce but also U. S. credibility with strategic allies in the Middle East and Europe. The new president must prepare for a diplomatic and perhaps military showdown in the Pacific and confront Beijing on the massive trade imbalance that finances Chinese mercantilism and adventurism.
