It is not, to bastardize Teddy Roosevelt’s famous line, talking loudly while not carrying a stick at all. Conservatives must have the courage to risk being smeared, must be courageous enough to leave the ghetto and talk to everyone of all political persuasions, to wade into the bastions of the enemy like universities, black neighborhoods, and Silicon Valley to engage. We must be courageous enough to challenge the foe’s presuppositions directly, root  branch, not accept them first. Courageous enough to name the enemy.
