This dynamic is part of the novelâ€™s origins. The earliest English novels, from "Moll Flanders" (1722) to "Clarissa" (1748) were published anonymously, with titles that implied they were true stories. It took generations to establish the conventions of fiction sufficiently to allow readers to take pleasure in novels that were explicitly untrue. The suspension of disbelief that fiction involves is a late stage in the evolution of taste, and it may prove to have been a temporary one.
