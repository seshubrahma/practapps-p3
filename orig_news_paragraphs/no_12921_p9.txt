The Register itself actually ran a model of its poll with a larger number of evangelicals that showed a   race between Trump and Cruz. Even that model, however, undercounted the number of evangelicals who ultimately voted. Of the above polls, the NBC poll has a sample that is closest to what the South Carolina electorate looked like in the 2008 and 2012 primary elections. The South Carolina Republican poll has far too many seniors in its poll, compared to the elections in 2012 and 2008.
