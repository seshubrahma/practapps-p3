Perera said she was especially struck by the absence of any mention of the earthquakes occurring in Oklahoma at the time, which scientists believed to be tied to fracking activity in the state. " Pruitt never expressed concern about the increased number of earthquakes believed to be linked to the fracking activity in Oklahoma.   He never mentioned launching an investigation into the earthquakes," Perera said.
