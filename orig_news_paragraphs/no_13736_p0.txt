Monday on "CNN Newsroom," Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said he is worried because his opponent Donald Trump’s "narcissism" and "delusions of grandeur" now have him "saying he can shoot people and people will still vote for him. "   Paul said, "We also joke that we have our own airline also, it just doesn’t have my name on it, has Southwest on the side of it. No I think a dose of humility might be good. I am worried that his narcissism exceeds nothing and that his delusions of grandeur have him saying he can shoot people and people will still vote for him.
