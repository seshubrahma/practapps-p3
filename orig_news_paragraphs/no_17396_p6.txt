Each time a   fanatic group is finally beaten down, we view the remains and repeat the promise of "Never Again" articulated at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1946.   And each time, we break that promise anew by waiting too long and not working hard enough at our commitment to prevent genocide or crimes against humanity. Labeling is far from enough, but it is an important first step. Because once we recognize something as genocide, America and other leading nations are then obligated to act.
