Many Egyptians have accepted Sisi’s argument that another prolonged round of protests could invite radical Islamists to capitalize on the chaos. " He’s positioned himself as the sole leader who makes decisions because he knows what’s best for the nation, and he’s saving us from the fate of Syria and Libya," Khaled Dawoud, a prominent Egyptian journalist and the leader of a small opposition party, told me. Egyptians are proud that the first Arab leader to whom President Trump spoke after his electoral victory was Sisi, a sharp contrast to Barack Obama, who had suspended military aid to Egypt for two years after the police massacre of 1, 000 Muslim Brotherhood supporters in August 2013 at Rabaa, a Cairo encampment.
