Comey said the FBI did not find "direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal   domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked," But, more importantly and sounding like he wanted the public to read the tea leaves, he added that "given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence. " "We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial   accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal   domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent," he continued, leaving people to connect the dots.
