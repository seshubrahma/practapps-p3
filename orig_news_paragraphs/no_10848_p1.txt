Part of Clinton’s advantage in fundraising comes from her decision to embrace super PACs from the start of the presidential race, helping her to get more out of donors than Obama did. A Washington Post analysis found that more than a fifth of the $1 billion donated to her campaign was given by just 100 wealthy individuals and labor unions, many with a long history of donating to the Clintons. The analysis included contributions to her campaigns, joint fundraising committees, national parties, convention host committees, and   super PACs. The top five donors to Clinton’s campaign combined gave one out of every $17 to her presidential bid.
