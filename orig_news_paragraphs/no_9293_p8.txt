No other campaign, including Rubio’s, has released their numbers yet. The filing deadline, according to the Federal Election Commission, for this quarter and the   numbers is not until Jan. 31, 2016, which gives campaigns a full month before they are required by law to tell the public what they really raised. That’s the day before the Iowa caucuses, which are on Feb. 1, so candidates who don’t release their numbers early in January could have something —  potentially embarrassingly low totals —  to hide. Rubio’s team hasn’t released their numbers yet and hasn’t responded to a request from Breitbart News for where they’re at a    in fundraising or what they hauled in in the fourth quarter of the year.
