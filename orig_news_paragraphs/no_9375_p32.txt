For instance, Sarah Rumpf —  then a Breitbart News reporter, now no longer with this network —  was sent to cover Rubio’s campaign launch in Miami back in April 2015. She wrote multiple stories from the Rubio campaign launch for this news network at the time, including an exclusive interview with the senator.
