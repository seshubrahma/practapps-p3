This group’s messaging was focused on racism, white privilege, patriarchal oppression, as well as transgender and queer issues. The second group consisted of about 150 women and a few men dressed mostly in red who had been brought together by the Santa Cruz General Strike Organizing Committee. Older and less diverse, this group focused on issues primary to the larger International Women’s Day Strike   —   reserving most of its anger for the administration of President Donald Trump.
