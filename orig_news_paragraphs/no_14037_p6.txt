In fact, this was the whitest inauguration Iâ€™ve witnessed in my lifetime. Still, I believe Trump when he said we are all one nation with one home, one heart and one shared destiny. Harder to believe his vow to end "right now"crime, drugs, failing schools and political corruption. Trump promised to bring back jobs, build new airports, tunnels and roads.
