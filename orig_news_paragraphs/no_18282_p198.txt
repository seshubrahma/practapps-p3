As someone who formerly had a show on Fox   News, I’m curious what your thoughts on some of the developments   that happened over the past year. Roger Ailes is out. Bill   O’Reilly was just basically forced out. What do you think of the   culture at Fox News, and what do you think of what’s transpired   over the past year, which has been monumental?
