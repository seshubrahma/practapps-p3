What happened? On Friday, federal Judge James Robart of the US District Court for the Western District of Washington temporarily suspended key parts of the executive order nationwide.   The powerful 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, a federal appeals court in San Francisco, early Sunday denied the US governmentâ€™s emergency request to resume the ban. That court ordered both sides to submit arguments for and against the ban by Monday night.
