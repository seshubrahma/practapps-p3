Trump has promised he will push the Clintons on these questions throughout the course of the election. Meanwhile, Paul, one of Trump’s former competitors in the 2016 GOP primary, backed his candidacy in the first part of this Breitbart News exclusive interview on Tuesday. Paul said that now that Trump is the GOP’s presidential candidate, he intends to support the pledge he made to back the nominee. Paul just won   as the GOP nominee for U. S. Senate in Kentucky and is expected to easily defeat his   Democratic opponent in November’s general election in the   coal mining state.
