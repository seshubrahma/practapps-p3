Todd Stern, Obama’s special envoy for climate change, told me this week that while this is the intent of the Paris Agreement, countries are not legally bound to ratchet up their ambitions. In fact, he said, negotiators discussed and then left out language in the   sentence that would have required countries not to moderate their pledges. " We obviously didn’t want parties to be going back, but we also thought it would be counterproductive to have a legal bar saying ’thou shalt not go back,’" Stern told me.
