Clinton handed 30, 000 emails over to the State Department and said she deleted another 32, 000 personal messages. So the number was actually 32, 000, not 39, 000, 35, 000 or 33, 000, as Trump charged. Of the 32, 000 emails the FBI was able to find, more than 17, 000 of them and determined that a "substantial number" were duplicates of emails that had already been turned over to the State Department. The State Department has reviewed about 15, 000 of the emails and determined that more than 9, 400 were purely personal and will not be released and that another 5, 600 are probably   and will be made public in the weeks before the election.
