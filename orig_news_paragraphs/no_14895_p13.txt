The other flew 400 kilometers (250 miles) before falling into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, which North Korea claimed was a success. Still, both of those were more successful than North Korea’s launches earlier in 2016. In May, one Musudan flew for about two seconds before exploding, while an April launch was described by the Pentagon as a "fiery, catastrophic failure," according to CSIS. Even the four missiles launched this month, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appeared to celebrate in state media photos, didn’t go off without a hitch    a fifth missile failed to launch as planned.
