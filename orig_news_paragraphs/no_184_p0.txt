A former contestant on "The Apprentice" who accused Donald J. Trump of sexual assault during the presidential race filed a lawsuit against him on Tuesday alleging that Mr. Trump defamed her when he claimed that she fabricated the assault. Summer Zervos and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, announced the lawsuit at a news conference in Los Angeles, days before Mr. Trump is set to enter the White House. During the campaign, more than 10 women accused Mr. Trump of inappropriate sexual contact. Mr. Trump denied every allegation.
