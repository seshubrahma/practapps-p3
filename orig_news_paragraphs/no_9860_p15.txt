Italian authorities already made fingerprint checks and confirmed the identification of the subject. I have expressed my gratitude to my colleague in Italy, and congratulated him on the success of Italian authorities and police. I also expressed that the police officers were very professional and very brave. A special team will be sent to Italy to collaborate with Italian authorities in an investigation.
