Three other Americans were wounded, and a $75 million aircraft was deliberately destroyed. In a risky mission where almost everything that could go wrong did, the Pentagon has acknowledged that several civilians, including some children, were also killed. The dead included, by the account of relatives interviewed by human rights groups in Yemen, the    daughter of Anwar   the   Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. The missionâ€™s casualties have raised doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation, initially during the Obama administration, and whether the right questions were raised before its approval, which took place over a dinner Mr. Trump held with top advisers five days after taking office.
