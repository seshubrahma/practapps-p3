Murkowski came out in support of the abortion business and against its defunding of taxpayer dollars, even as she acknowledged it was possible Planned Parenthood had been engaged in illegal activity. She said: What I was concerned about and remain concerned about was that Planned Parenthood, through some of its affiliates, may have been engaged in illegal activity when it came to the collection of fetal tissue. We donâ€™t know yet if illegal activity was conducted. The head of Planned Parenthood has come before congressional committees and said there was none.
