The current president, Francois Hollande, has four children by another politician and former presidential candidate, Segolene Royal.

Imagine an American president riding a moped around the streets of Washington to an affair. Insert your Bill Clinton comparisons here, but his extramarital relationship was a major scandal that nearly brought down his presidency.
