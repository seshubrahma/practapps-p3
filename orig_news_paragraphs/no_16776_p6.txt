Trump also noted, "Boy, did I do well with evangelicals" as he touted the group’s importance to his second place showing in Iowa’s GOP primary and his subsequent victory in the South Carolina primary. Trump also for the first time publicly drew attention to the recent endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz, who defeated Trump and won first place in the Iowa caucuses during the Republican primary. " Even Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed me the other day and I know the people of Iowa like Ted Cruz," Trump said of the Texas senator, who endorsed him on Friday in a statement.
