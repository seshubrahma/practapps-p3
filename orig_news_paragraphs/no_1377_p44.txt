It is a complex system that involves water flowing down the Colorado River through Nevada and Arizona into Mexico, and down the Rio Grande from New Mexico into Mexico, where it is replenished by major tributaries before turning to Texas. (On the United States side, the Rio Grande watershed alone includes well over four million people.) The relationship has been strained by drought: Tensions have flared over the last 15 years when Texas accused Mexico of delivering insufficient supplies of water. The Texas Commission of Environmental Quality, overseen by appointees of the governor, cited a 2013 Texas AM study saying that Mexicoâ€™s failure to deliver its annual water allotment cost the state economy nearly 5, 000 jobs and $400 million each year.
