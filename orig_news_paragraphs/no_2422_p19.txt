One would have to go back to Abraham Lincolnâ€™s election in 1860 to see these types of widespread demonstrations in response to the election of a president, said Douglas G. Brinkley, a presidential historian who teaches at Rice University in Houston. President Lincoln won only about 40 percent of the popular vote and was not even on the ballot in some Southern states. Spontaneous protests broke out across the country after the Lincoln victory, Professor Brinkley said. For many of the people who have turned out for the current protests, it has been a kind of group therapy, and already seem to be cementing new,   liberal coalitions.
