That distinction went to William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States. After his reelection defeat in 1912, Taft did not don the robe of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court until 1921 when appointed by Republican President Warren G. Harding. Taft then led the high court for nine years until 1930.   It is doubtful that Chief Justice John Roberts would step aside for President Obama to follow in Taftâ€™s exact footsteps, so technically Obama could be the first former president to serve as an Associate Justice.
