During the George W. Bush administration, Sergei B. Ivanov, the Russian defense minister, suggested that the treaty be dropped because Russia still faced threats from nations on its periphery, including China.

In June 2013, Mr. Putin complained that "nearly all of our neighbors are developing these kinds of weapons systems" and described the Soviet Union’s decision to conclude the I. N. F. treaty as "debatable to say the least. "
