There is very little in the way of philosophical conversation about what binds us    and ails us    as a country. It’s full speed ahead at all times no BS    or      allowed. That isn’t to say one style of leadership is better than the other (although public polling suggests Trump is significantly less popular at this stage of his   term than Obama was).   It is to say that it’s hard for me to imagine that the American public could have chosen two more opposite people to lead the country in consecutive elections.
