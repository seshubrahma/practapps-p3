In a brief phone interview on Friday night, Mr. Madasani described the remarks made Wednesday by the man sitting near him and Mr. Kuchibhotla at the restaurant. " He asked us what visa are we currently on and whether we are staying here illegally," Mr. Madasani said. (Both men were educated in the United States and were working here legally.)
