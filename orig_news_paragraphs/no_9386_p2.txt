90 percent of respondents said they were following the presidential race very or somewhat closely, and 85 percent said they were absolutely certain to vote. Clinton and Trump had roughly comparable percentages of voters who said they were "locked in" and would not change their minds before the election, and comparable levels of enthusiasm from their voters. As in most other surveys, both candidates are "underwater" in their   ratings, but Trump’s were worse  —   43 percent to 53 percent for Clinton, 31 percent to 66 percent for Trump. They have nearly identical ratings for honesty, with 34 percent describing each of them as honest and trustworthy.
