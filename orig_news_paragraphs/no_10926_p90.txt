â€”   Alex Swoyer (@ASwoyer) July 19, 2016,  10:10: On MSNBC, Dan Senor, a "Never Trump" establishment Republican, claims a generic Republican would be leading Clinton by 15 points right now. More proof of how clueless people like Senor and Bill Kristol are. A generic Republican like Romney who got trounced by Obama even after GOP establishment figures insisted he was the best chance to beat Obama would never be able to get their message out and combat the mainstream media like Trump is doing.
