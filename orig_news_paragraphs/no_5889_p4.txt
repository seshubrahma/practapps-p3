" An Israeli assessment has found that Assadâ€™s regime was still in possession of "a few tonnes" of chemical weapons, a military official confirmed. Assad, backed by his ally Russia, has strongly denied the allegation that his forces used chemical weapons against the   town of Khan Sheikhun on April 4, describing it as a "100 percent fabrication". He has said repeatedly that his forces turned over all chemical weapons stockpiles in 2013, under a deal brokered by Russia to avoid threatened US military action.
