I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales.   They told me  —   without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it   —   that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.   They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.
