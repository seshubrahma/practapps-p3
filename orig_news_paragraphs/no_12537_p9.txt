One young lady, Crockett High School Valedictorian Mayte Lara, took to Twitter and boasted, "Valedictorian, 4. 5GPA, full tuition paid for at UT, 13   nice legs, oh, and I’m undocumented," Breitbart Texas’ Lana Shadwick reported in June. A few days later, Breitbart Texas’ Merrill Hope reported another school’s Valedictorian, McKinney Boyd High School’s Larissa Martinez, used the occasion of her graduation speech to brag about her "undocumented status" and take a swipe at GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.
