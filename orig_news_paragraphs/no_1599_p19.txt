Milwaukee plans to aggressively enforce a curfew of 10 p. m. for teenagers under 17, and the National Guard remains on standby. The city is struggling to quell a burst of unrest in the neighborhood of Sherman Park after a    armed suspect was fatally shot by a    police officer, both black. " We’re going to make sure that there is peace and order restored to this neighborhood," said the mayor, Tom Barrett.
