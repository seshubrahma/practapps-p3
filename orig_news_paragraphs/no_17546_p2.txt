These 2012 figures illustrate the shifting demographics of battleground Iowa: In the GOP caucuses, women are a smaller slice of the pie but come November, they are the majority. Iowa voted Democratic in the past two presidential elections. A very similar dynamic in another small but important swing state    New Hamsphire. Men are a majority in the Republican primary, but women are the bigger slice when the general election rolls around in November.
