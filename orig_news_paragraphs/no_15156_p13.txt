There are several cases that have yet to be decided, which could indicate the justices are evenly split and may vote to have the case   before the full   court. One case that seemed close during oral argument concerns a    Mexican national who was shot to death in 2010 by a US Customs and Border Patrol agent standing on American soil. The teenager was cowering behind a pillar just across the border in Mexico. The family of Sergio Hernandez is seeking to sue the border official for their sonâ€™s death.
