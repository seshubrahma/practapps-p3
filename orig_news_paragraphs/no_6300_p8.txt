Porter, who is the founder and leader of Faith2Action, told Breitbart News she started fighting for the Ohio heartbeat bill on St. Valentineâ€™s Day 2011, and in December it passed the Ohio House and Senate, but it was vetoed by Gov. John Kasich. The governor signed a bill that protected unborn children at the   mark, which is about the point when the child has the nerve development to feel pain, she said. " He signed the pain bill, which saves 125 babies every year, but he vetoed the heartbeat bill that would have protected 20, 000 every year," she said.
