But in 2011, an Egyptian court found Sajwani guilty in a case involving allegations of government corruption over a land deal. The Canadian government then froze Sajwani’s assets between 2011 and 2014, a spokesperson for Canada’s foreign relations department confirmed to CNN. A spokesperson for Sajwani’s company said the conviction was a result of political instability following the Egyptian revolution when a new government administration targeted officials from the former regime. Sajwani eventually reached a private settlement with the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority and avoided jail time.
