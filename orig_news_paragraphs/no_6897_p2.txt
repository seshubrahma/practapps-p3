Trump and Abe left    early Saturday morning and headed north to one of Trump’s golf courses in Jupiter, Florida. Reporters weren’t able to catch a glimpse of the pair as they played on the   property. But Trump later posted a photo of them giving each other a   on the golf course and tweeted, "Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States!" The Trump National Golf Club website, in typical Trumpian language, claims the course "features the finest revetted bunkers in the United States, incredible water hazards, including a magnificent island green, and one of the most picturesque landscapes, all of which make for a truly memorable round.
