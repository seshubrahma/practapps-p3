After the city and state demanded payment, the hotel partners sued them in 1990. The suit was settled in 2004. Neither court files nor the cityâ€™s Law Department have a copy of the agreement, but a city official who requested anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter, said that the city recouped $850, 000. By the time of the settlement, the Pritzker family, which controls the Hyatt hotel chain, had paid Mr. Trump $140 million for his share of the hotel, after their partnership turned acrimonious.
