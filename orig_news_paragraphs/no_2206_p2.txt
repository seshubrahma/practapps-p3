In addition, the four gun measures were attached to legislation that contains several other thorny issues, such as the question of whether to take passports away from terrorism suspects, which suggests there will be little chance for further debate. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has been working on a compromise, disliked by both party leaders, that would bar the sale of guns to terrorism suspects who appear on either the government’s   list or the   selectee list of people who receive additional scrutiny at airports. That bill, which is not as broad as the Democratic   measure that failed on Monday, could surface later in the week. Partisanship and the power of the gun lobby played a large role in the amendments’ failure.
