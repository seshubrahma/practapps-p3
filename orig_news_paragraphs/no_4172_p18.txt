In November 2015, Ortiz reported on the arrest of Border Patrol Agent Joel Juna for his alleged role in a cartel beheading in South Texas. Despite the capital murder conviction of his brother, Gulf Cartel Commander Eduardo "Comandante Pajarito" Luna, a jury failed to find enough evidence to convict the Border Patrol agent and found him not guilty. " At the time of Joel Lunaâ€™s arrest, authorities discovered inside a safe a badge, a   rifle, a jeweled handgun with the words Cartel Del Golfo and Pajarito inscribed on them, $90, 000 and various drugs," Ortiz wrote.
