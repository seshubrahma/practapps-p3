It is important to understand that FBI   investigations are different than the   known criminal investigative work. The Bureauâ€™s goal in a   investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power.
