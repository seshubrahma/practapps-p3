It may seem   that the US president who tried to stop people from several Muslim countries from entering the United States, a man many see as Islamophobic, has found his strongest support outside the country precisely in the birthplace of Islam. But that, in fact, is the case. Arab leaders are happy to see the end of America’s push to improve relations with Iran, and they don’t mind that Washington has decided to stop making a fuss over human rights and democracy.   The stops in Israel and Saudi Arabia will feed Trump’s appetite for approval.
