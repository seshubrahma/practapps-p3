Presumably DNI   Coats would be more forthcoming in a closed Congressional   session, where classified information can be revealed. ’ ’   Director Rogers, in contrast, has made no public statements about   the president’s effort to enlist him in his   campaign.    This is typical of his famously   agency —  for decades,   NSA was humorously said to stand for Never Say Anything —  and why   Trump approached Rogers is no mystery.
