But I do not ever remember this degree of fear and hatred. The LA Times article, while bemoaning the fate of certain conservatives in the entertainment industry, is also a hit piece on President Trump. The headline alone suggests it, and those great souls in the article who make it known they are reluctant or not Trump supporters provide the tell. The left in Hollywood are quick to flaunt their political allegiances this provides them the ability to both grow in number and maintain their level of influence.
