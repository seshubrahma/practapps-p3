  Donald Trump is set to impose a range of executive orders immediately after his inauguration on Friday, according to his transition team. ["He’s got a few of them, probably in the area of four or five, that we’re looking at for Friday," said incoming press secretary Sean Spicer at the Trump transition headquarters.   " Then there are some other ones that I expect him to sign with respect to a couple of issues that have been high on his priority list," he continued.
