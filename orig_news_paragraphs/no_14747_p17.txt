Freeing businesses to hurt people is not libertarian.   The libertarians    at least, the ones who donâ€™t see through Trump    are being played.   If the crippling of the state allows economic behemoths to do whatever they like to others, then what libertarianism licenses, in the garb of liberty, is the creation of a new aristocracy, entitled to hurt the commoners.   This is just a different kind of mooching and looting.
