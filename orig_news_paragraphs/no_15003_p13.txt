Trump has visited one of his namesake properties as President. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has defended the trips, saying Trump has talked about how to use the game to build relationships with people. Spicer has also pointed out that Trump has not played golf every time he visited one of his courses, instead conducting official business in the clubhouses, such as hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his    resort in Florida and meeting with some Cabinet officials and senior staff at his Virginia golf course.
