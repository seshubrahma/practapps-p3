Monday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh maintained a House Intelligence Committee hearing that featured testimony from FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Michael Rogers was meant to send a message to President Donald Trump and his administration.   Limbaugh argued that although there were some good questions from Republicans members during the hearing, it was meant to be a warning shot at Trump   â€”    allow Washington Republicans to run the town or face possible impeachment.
