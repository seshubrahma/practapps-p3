The Clean Power Plan is the ambitious centerpiece of Mr. Obamaâ€™s climate change legacy and the key to his commitment under the Paris accord. At its heart is a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to curb   pollution from   power plants. If enacted, the rules could transform the American electricity sector, close hundreds of   plants and usher in the construction of vast new wind and solar farms. The plan is projected to cut United States power plant emissions 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.
