We (Medina Co Women for Trump) are literally knocking on EVERY door one township at a time.   There are 17 townships, we nearly have 9 of those and several smaller villages completed.   As soon as we complete our designated townships we will be picking up the remaining townships.   We are on track to have EVERY Door canvassed before the general election with over   of those completed prior to the start of early voting.
