Hereâ€™s where things really go off the rails. The accusations are baseless. There is no evidence that the Obama administration ordered surveillance of any kind    phone "tapp" or otherwise    at Trump Tower. In subsequent testimony, delivered under oath to the House Intelligence Committee, Comey very publicly dismisses the allegations.
