Sales of electric cars are now growing at 60 percent a year, albeit from a tiny base, according to a recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Moreover, car companies are promising a wave of electric models with improved range over the next couple of years, including the Tesla Model 3 that inspired more than 300, 000 people to put down deposits over the last three weeks. Even more significant, perhaps, is that most of the capital being spent in the world to build new power plants is being spent on renewables, twice as much in 2015 as on   power plants, Bloomberg New Energy Finance found. Most of the existing power plants still run on nonrenewable energy, however, and because the plants last for decades, that is likely to change only slowly.
