The United States ranks 15th in broadband connectivity, behind countries such as South Korea and Canada, according to a 2011 study from the Organisation for Economic   and Development. The challenge in the United States is that it has vast tracts of sparsely populated regions where the cost of laying new fiber and cable wiring for broadband significantly outweighs the profits   —    39 percent of Americans living in rural areas lack broadband access, compared with 4 percent of those living in cities, according to the F. C. C. Under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s "Broadband for All" initiative, New York’s program is one of the most aggressive broadband expansions in the country, and is designed to help stem any losses a private company incurs through what is known as a reverse auction process.
