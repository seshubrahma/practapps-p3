The United States is expected to bid to host the world’s other major sporting event, the World Cup, in 2026. In June, Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, told reporters that a Trump presidency could complicate an American bid, especially if it were a joint bid with Mexico, given Mr. Trump’s plans to build a wall across America’s southern border. " I think a   World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn’t in the White House," Mr. Gulati said at the time, in a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Mr. Trump.
