The 2016 toll of 32 dead cops does not include wounded cops who survived shootings. For example, the July 17 attack on police in Baton Rouge by a black militant killed three police and wounded and additional three. In Dallas, seven police were wounded and survived the   attack by another   radical. Police in several states have been shot and wounded in   attacks since the Dallas attack, including in Georgia, Tennessee and Missouri.
