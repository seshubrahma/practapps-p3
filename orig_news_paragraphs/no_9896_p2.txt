It’s like a Cleveland Indians baseball fan yelling that his team won a majority of the runs scored in all seven games. Well, sorry, but the Cubs won four of the seven games, and that’s how the World Series is decided. Trump won the Electoral College vote and that’s how the Presidency is decided under the Constitution. However, as a matter of fact, Hillary Clinton did NOT win a majority of the popular vote, her opponents did.
