Black and Hispanic youth who back Clinton are far more likely to describe their vote as one of support for the former Secretary of State, while white and Asian young adults who favor her mostly say they are expressing opposition to Trump. The Harvard IOP Poll echoes that sentiment, with just 21% of Clinton’s backers saying they’re very enthusiastic about supporting her, while 36% of Trump’s backers say the same. In both polls, majorities express unfavorable views of Clinton and Trump, but the GenForward study suggests they have more faith in Clinton’s qualifications for president    55% see Clinton as qualified compared with just 21% who say Trump is. This week also featured a survey sponsored by Fusion which asked those age 35 or younger to describe a Trump presidency in one word, and found far more negative responses than positive ones: 70% used a negative word or phrase, with variations on "scary," "horror" and "terrified" topping the list.
