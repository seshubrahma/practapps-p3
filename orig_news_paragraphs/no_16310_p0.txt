Columbus, Ohio (CNN) Even before Donald Trump kicked off his town hall event Monday he gathered reporters to decry "politics at its lowest"    but he wasnâ€™t talking about Hillary Clinton or the latest controversy swirling around his campaign, his feud with the parents of a slain Muslim US soldier. Instead, Trump was unleashing on the local fire marshal, accusing the city official of turning away thousands of Trump supporters without cause. It was the second time in three days Trump has lambasted a local fire marshal during a campaign rally.
