Washington  (CNN) Donald Trump surrogate Omarosa Manigault said the  ’s campaign is keeping a list of people who did not support his run to the White House.   "Let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory and we’re keeping a list," Manigault, the campaign’s director of   outreach, told the Independent Journal Review, an online news outlet started by two former GOP staffers aimed at a   audience. Manigault made the comment in response to Sen. Lindsey Graham’s tweet that he supported conservative presidential candidate Evan McMullin.
