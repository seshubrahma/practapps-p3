Some GOP lawmakers have said the investigations should focus on the leaks from the intelligence community rather than the reported campaign contact with Russian individuals.   Earlier this week, multiple U. S. officials briefed on the matter told CNN that the FBI rejected a recent White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Trumpâ€™s associates and Russians known to US intelligence during the presidential campaign. But a White House official said late Thursday that the request was made only after the FBI indicated to the White House that it did not believe the reporting to be accurate. White House officials sought the help of the intelligence community investigating the issue to say reports were incorrect and that there had been no contacts, the officials said.
