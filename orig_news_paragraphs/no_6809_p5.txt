In his Haaretz piece, Greenblatt failed to mention that Obamaâ€™s State Department in 2011 reportedly imposed a six month freeze on the processing of Iraqi refugees. The halt was the result of the discovery of two   members admitted as refugees from Iraq who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky and admitted to targeting U. S. troops in Iraq. The Washington Examiner found five other instances of Obama temporarily banning immigrants over national security concerns.   Greenblatt did not mention those either.
