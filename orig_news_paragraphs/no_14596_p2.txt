Only 14 Trump appointees have been confirmed as of February 21, while President Barack Obama had twice as many   appointments confirmed by that date. George W. Bush and Bill Clinton also bested Trump in getting the Senate to approve their choices, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a   nonprofit. George H. W.
