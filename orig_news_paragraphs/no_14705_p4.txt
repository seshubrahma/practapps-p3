In a written order granting the Trump administration a   extension to respond to a federal   lawsuit against the travel ban, Judge James Robart noted the plaintiffs’ frustrations over the apparent contradictions between what Spicer and Justice Department lawyers have said about plans to revise the ban. [T]he court will continue to rely on the representations of the government’s attorneys, as officers of the court, which indicate that the new Executive Order will ’rescind,’ ’replace,’ ’supersed[e],’ and ’substantially revise[]’ the existing Executive Order," Robart wrote in his decision. Robart is the same judge who, in a different case, granted a temporary restraining order against key provisions of current executive order, which the White House rolled out in January.
