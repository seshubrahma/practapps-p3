Last week, she and the President stepped out on the town for the first time, well, not counting a few steak dinners at the Trump International Hotel. The couple attended the Fordâ€™s Theatre Gala, Trump dressed in a   flowing $2, 595 silk frock by designer Monique Lhuillier. The next night, they hosted a reception at the White House for Gold Star families.   Melania Trump is also expected to fill out her staffing needs, building teams for communications, platform and events.
