House Speaker Paul Ryan also said Republicans would continue to push for repeal and replace. " I wonâ€™t tell you the timeline because we want to get it right," Ryan said, adding that members had a "very constructive meeting" where some who had pledged to defeat the bill last week appeared open to working with the rest of the conference to find a solution. Ryan specifically advocated that the health care bill was still the best path to defund Planned Parenthood, a key conservative agenda item.
