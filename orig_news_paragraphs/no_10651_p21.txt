Trump suggested that it is time for the nation to "close the chapter on the Clintons" and begin focusing on the needs and interests of the American people. " Hillary Clinton put the office of secretary of state up for sale, and if she ever got the chance, sheâ€™d put the oval office up for sale, too," Trump warned. He added: When we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People.
