A photograph of Mrs. Trump’s hospital story time appeared in her Twitter feed on Thursday. Mrs. Trump has said she is interested in working to combat cyberbullying, but has yet to start such a program. And while she has named a chief of staff and a social secretary, the White House has not announced the hiring of other key players in the East Wing, such as a communications director, a press secretary or other senior staff members. Mrs. Trump has made it known she does not intend to be much of a presence in Washington at least in the short term she has opted to reside in New York while the couple’s    son, Barron, finishes his school year.
