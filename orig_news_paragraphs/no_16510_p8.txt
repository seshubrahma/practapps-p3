LePage has been mired in controversy throughout much of his governorship, no more so than last week, when a voicemail he left for a state representative was made public. In the voicemail, the GOP governor berates Democratic State Rep. Drew Gattine with expletives and threats, apparently in response to Gattine calling him a racist    something Gattine denied saying in an interview with CNN. " It’s not something that I’ve ever called anybody," he said.
