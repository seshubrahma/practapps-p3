The Republican Jewish Coalition issued a statement also calling for defunding the UN: By allowing the United Nations’   resolution to be adopted by the Security Council, in the face of fierce   opposition, the actions of the Obama Administration will forever be remembered as a dark, shameful moment for our country. The resolution passed today will only serve as a greater barrier to peace, which can only truly be achieved through negotiations. Instead of pressuring the Palestinians to be a partner for peace, President Obama chose to break with long standing diplomatic practices and allowed the     United Nations to be used as a tool to bludgeon Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East.
