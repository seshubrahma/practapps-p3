The British version of the American dream: "The Great Gatsby" may be the great American novel, but Gatsby could have existed in Britain too. In practice, there were probably not all that many    stories in   Britain. But the fact that Benjamin Disraeli, the son of Sephardic Jews, could become prime minister, and an earl, no less, provided the basis for many generations in Europe to believe in Britain as an exceptional country. Jews from Russia or Lithuania, or from Germany, like my own   flocked to Britain as immigrants in the hope that they, too, could become English gentlemen.
