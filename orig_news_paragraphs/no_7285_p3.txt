Berta   in White, The Ladies in White (Damas de Blanco) and their leader, Berta Soler, are the wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of Cubaâ€™s prisoners of conscience. For years they have congregated in Havana every Sunday to attend Catholic Mass, marching to their church in silence wearing white and carrying the photos of their imprisoned relatives. For this, the Cuban government has arrested many every Sunday for years, beating them and shoving them into police vans, later abandoning them hours from their homes with no way of getting back.
