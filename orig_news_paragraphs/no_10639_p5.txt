As the poll internals show, the discrepancy is largely due to a much larger percentage of Republican voters declaring it doesn’t trust either Clinton or Trump, while Clinton gets   from fully 84% of Democrats. As a point of comparison, Military Times performed a survey of military personnel in May, and found Trump leading Clinton by 54% to 25% which is not far from NBC’s results. Bernie Sanders actually fared much better against Trump in that poll, but was still behind, 51% to 38%. The poll found fully 21 percent of respondents saying they planned to abstain from voting.
