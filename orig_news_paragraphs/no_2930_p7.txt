Mr. Trump has business and government connections in the Philippines, where he has partnered with a real estate company controlled by Jose E. B. Antonio, named in October as Mr. Duterte’s special envoy to the United States, on a $150 million office tower in Manila. Officials for Mr. Trump’s transition did not confirm the call or include it in a rundown they gave on Friday of conversations with world leaders that Mr. Trump and Vice   Mike Pence had held over the past 24 hours. They did provide official accounts on Thursday of calls Mr. Trump had with the prime minister of Pakistan and the president of Kazakhstan, but those were sanitized versions of the readouts provided by those countries, which indicated that the   had heaped praise on their leaders and suggested a readiness to side with them on delicate matters of diplomacy. Senator David Perdue of Georgia, a Republican and an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump, stopped by the microphones at Trump Tower to share his views of the legislative rush to come next year.
