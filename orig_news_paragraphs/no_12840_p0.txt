Sunday on NBCâ€™s "Meet The Press," after coming in second place last night in the South Carolina Republican primary, GOP presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said he feels good about his chances because he argued a large number of Republican voters are seeking an alternative to party   Donald Trump.   Rubio said, "  percent of the people voted yesterday and about 70 percent of Republicans around the country have said we want someone other than Donald Trump to be our nominee. The problem is that vote was still divided even last night among five other people or four other people. I think now the race is narrowing even more.
