By most unclassified estimates, it will take North Korea perhaps five years to marry its missile advances with a weapon small enough and strong enough to survive the stresses of   the atmosphere atop an intercontinental ballistic missile. So far, Mr. Kim’s engineers have never executed a military test flight that could reach beyond the middle of the Pacific, though in a statement on Friday, the North threatened to attack Guam, home of the American   bombers that conducted simulated runs last week over the Korean Peninsula. The potential links to Iran complicate the issue. Iran has ignored a United Nations Security Council resolution, passed in conjunction with last year’s agreement freezing its nuclear program, to refrain from tests of   missiles for eight years.
