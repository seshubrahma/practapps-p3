Yet, for a select group of artisans, designers and their clients, interest flourishes in contemporary interpretations of   objects.

At his studio in Long Island City, Queens, beneath the Long Island Expressway, William P. Sullivan creates   furnishings for the architect Robert A. M. Stern and Michael S. Smith, who designed the Obama family’s living quarters at the White House. Mr. Stern deployed Mr. Sullivan’s   and   mirror in the private sales suite of Tiffany’s Fifth Avenue headquarters.
