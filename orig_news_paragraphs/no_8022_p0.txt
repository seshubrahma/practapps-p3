President Barack Obama joined the liberal chorus of  criticizing "fake news" suggesting that the     journalism spread on social media was part of the reason why Democrats lost in the 2016 election. ["If, generally, we’ve got elections that aren’t focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what’s happening from the outside the issue is going to be what are we doing for ourselves from the inside," Obama said during a press conference in Peru over the weekend.   Obama discussed the issue as reporters questioned him about Russia hacking the Democratic National Committee and seemingly releasing emails to swing the election. He said that he was less concerned about propaganda and hacking and more concerned about the way information was promulgated on social media.
