The guidelines propose to penalize healthcare professionals who are morally and professionally opposed to sex change surgeries and treatments.   Severino and Ryan Anderson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, observed in a report in 2016 that Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) provides guidelines that "force many physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers to participate in   surgeries and treatments, even if it violates their religious beliefs or their best medical judgment. " " Moreover, because they apply so broadly, the regulations propose to also force employers, individuals, and taxpayers to fund coverage for such procedures even if doing so conflicts with their sincere beliefs," Severino and Anderson added.
