California Governor Jerry Brown warned Thursday that the Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation would have to perform "penance" for having voted for the American Health Care Act in the U.

Every one of California’s 14 Republicans voted for the bill, which now proceeds to the Senate. (Both of Califorina’s U. S. Senators are Democrats.)
