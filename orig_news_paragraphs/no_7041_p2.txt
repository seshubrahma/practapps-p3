In a statement released Saturday, Lieu lists a litany of complaints against Trump, including his "global business holdings "  —   an odd complaint, given that Hillary Clinton’s overseas foundation donors did not dissuade him from supporting her. Lieu goes on to describe the choice as between Trump and Rep. John Lewis ( ) a civil rights icon who has morphed in recent years into a partisan hack: "I respect Members of Congress who choose to attend the Inauguration of   Donald Trump or choose not to, just as I respect Members of Congress who attended or did not attend the two Inaugurations of President Barack Obama. I view this as a personal decision because no votes are being taken and no policies will be enacted at this ceremony.
