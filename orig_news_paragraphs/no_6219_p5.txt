One of the motivations behind the launch of One Belt, One Road was to give massively overbuilt domestic Chinese industries —  including construction, cement, steel and coal —  new sources of demand. Reducing excess industrial capacity in China, however, could have the effect of bolstering prices globally. Steel makers in the U. S. would be beneficiaries of a Chinese government program that sent Chinese steel to build rails, bridges and tunnels across Eurasia instead of into the U. S. market. Trump has surprised many political and economic "thought leaders" by seeking better relations with China but that is more of a reflection of their misunderstanding than a change on the part of Trump.
