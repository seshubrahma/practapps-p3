A sampling: We have video of Trump telling CNN’s Jake Tapper that an   judge should be disqualified from hearing the Trump University lawsuit because of his Mexican heritage. We have lots of instances of Trump telling us President Obama, our country’s first black president, was not an American citizen and that he made him show his papers.   We have Trump calling for a ban on all Muslims’ travel to the United States.
