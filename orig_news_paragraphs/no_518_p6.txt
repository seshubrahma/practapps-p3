" Trump is trying to corner Iran, to make us bow before the U. S. and change our behavior, or face confrontation," said Nader Karimi Joni, a political activist close to Mr. Rouhani’s government. Mr. Trump included Iran on  a list of seven predominantly Muslim countries whose citizens have been barred from entering the United States under an executive order that has been blocked, for now, in the American court system. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Tehran last week that it had been put "on notice" after an Iranian missile test.
