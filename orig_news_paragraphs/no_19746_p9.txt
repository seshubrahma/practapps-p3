On appeal, a state court set aside the   conviction and affirmed the assault count then a state trial judge decided that Maddenâ€™s lawyer had been ineffective and therefore vacated the assault conviction as well. The state chose not to try Madden again. Both defendants had paid a fee to the state crime victim compensation fund, a "docket fee," a "time payment fee," a   fee, and other fees, as well as restitution payments to the victims of the crimes. After their cases ended, each asked for repayment of the sums they had paid.
