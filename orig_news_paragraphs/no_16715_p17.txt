That number does not include attacks from this year, such as the shooting at an Orlando nightclub by Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people. Still, violent extremists are outnumbered nearly 10, 000 to 1 in the United States, which means that Omar Mateen is not the norm. Aleena Khan is.   Aleena graduated from Northwest High School in Germantown, where she gave tours to guests, was a member of four honor societies and ran the Green Club with her friend Haley, helping the school earn Green Ribbon environmental status    "a nationally recognized thing," she says with a smidge of satisfaction.
