Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. The increased public skepticism towards Islamic migration follows 14 years of jihadi attacks, starting with the   atrocity by 19 Muslims who killed 3, 000 Americans. Since then, the Islamic population in the United States has risen sharply, and so have the number of converts and jihad plots. Staff working for Sen. Jeff Sesions, the chairman of the Senateâ€™s immigration panel, are keeping track of the many Islamic jihad arrests.
