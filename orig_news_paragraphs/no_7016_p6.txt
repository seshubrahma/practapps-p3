Already this year, police have vowed to tackle the warring gangs in the city after a    boy was gunned down in January. Only days after U. S. President Donald J. Trump spoke about the situation in Sweden, a live hand grenade was found in a park in the city. Police say they were looking for a weapon in connection with a shooting in the same area but don’t believe the grenade had anything to do with the shooting leading to speculation from many of what the object was doing there. Less than a week later, a hand grenade was thrown in a residential area of the city’s Lindängen suburb injuring a man.
