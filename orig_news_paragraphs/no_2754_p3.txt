Mr. Trump will soon be in charge of the agency that issued the lease for the Old Post Office Building, which the   transformed unto a luxury hotel. He will also appoint the head of the G. S. A. To avoid such an obvious conflict, the lease that Mr. Trump signed states: "No   …     elected official of the government of the United States   …     shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom[. ] " No word yet from Mr. Trump about how he will proceed.
