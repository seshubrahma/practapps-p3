The official also pushed back on critics who have questioned whether Trump should have met in the Oval Office with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, whose interactions with Trump campaign officials have come under scrutiny by federal and congressional investigators. " It is ridiculous to say that an ambassador can’t meet with the President as part of a visit from a foreign minister. It’s standard practice," the official said.
