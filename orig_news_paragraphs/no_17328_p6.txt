Several media outlets suggest there were fundamental disagreements between the FBI and the CIA about whether Russian influence was meant to disrupt our democratic process or assist Trump.   If that is true, then a further review by the Obama administration is essential.    The FBI, which historically focuses on whether it can make a criminal case in court, is described in news reports as reluctant to say Russia favored Trump the CIA and every other intelligence agency believe the evidence supports that very assessment.   The public, for the most part, does not know the extent of the evidence but one can surmise    given the CIAâ€™s expertise    that it comes from sources and methods abroad, mainly Russia.
