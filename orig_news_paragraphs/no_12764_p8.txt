On January 26th, the Independent hit back, claiming U. S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump was only succeeding because of Breitbart readers and their "racism". The paper was subsequently exposed for employing Islamist extremists. The paper had a circulation of around 60, 000 on weekdays, and around 100, 000 on Sundays. The last edition of the Independent is expected to be on 26th March and the last Independent on Sunday on 20 March.
