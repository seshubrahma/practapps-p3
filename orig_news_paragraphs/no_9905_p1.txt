The DNC, and Wasserman Schultz in particular, came under heavy criticism from Sanders during the primaries, during which he accused them of showing favouritism to Hillary Clinton.

Prior to the WikiLeaks revelations, there had been growing signs of unity between Clinton and Sanders, who endorsed his primary opponent in a   joint announcement earlier this month.
