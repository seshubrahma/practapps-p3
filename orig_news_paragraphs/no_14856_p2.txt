Several local Meals on Wheels organizations said they had received similar support. Metro Meals on Wheels, which covers Minneapolis and St. Paul, said the group received about 40 donations in the past 24 hours, well over the usual average of three or four donations a day. " The good news that it has rallied folks around the cause and reminded folks that they canâ€™t really take these kinds of services for granted," said Patrick Rowan, executive director of Metro Meals on Wheels.
