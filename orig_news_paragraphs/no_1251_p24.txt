It was this week in 1910 that the inaugural race was held at the Los Angeles Motordrome, the worldâ€™s first wooden plank track built for automobile racing. Until then, races commonly happened in the dirt and across big distances. At the Motordrome, erected near the beach in Playa del Rey, fans had a view of all the   action on a   circular track. Crowds of more than 10, 000 people came to see the early stars of the sport push the limits of the big machines at more than 90 miles an hour around the banked track, essentially a   version of a bicycle velodrome.
