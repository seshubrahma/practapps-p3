The Romney campaign threw Donehue under the bus and claimed he was never an employee. Amazingly, the Fred Thompson staffer who called for the Romney folks to fire Donehue is now a Rubio staffer, Todd Harris. Harris and Donehue now work together on the Rubio campaign under campaign manager Sullivan, a former Romney aide himself. Another current   figure named Warren Tompkins was also involved in that 2012 fight.
