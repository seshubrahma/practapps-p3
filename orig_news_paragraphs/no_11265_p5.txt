Miller, a former senior staffer to Sen. Jeff Sessions, hammered Rubio at length for the Florida senator’s   of the Gang of 8 bill with Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and others. Miller said that Rubio left Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officer Chris Crane out in the cold on behalf of powerful donors and special interests. Miller went on to say: You have to ask yourself, when you’re thinking about who you want to choose as a commander in chief, how you feel about somebody who is willing to give the Chamber of Commerce everything they want, and willing to give La Raza everything that they want, a notorious   group that’s pushed for a lot of   measures. Someone who’s willing to give Larry Ellison everything he wants, someone who’s willing to give Microsoft everything they want, someone who’s willing to give Mark Zuckerberg everything he wants, but is not willing to have an honest meeting with ICE officers?
