In North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory, also a Republican, charged that   fraud in more than half the stateâ€™s 100 counties contributed to his   defeat by the state attorney general, Roy Cooper. Mr. McCrory conceded on Dec. 6. But for three weeks before that, he and others repeatedly accused Democrats of concocting illegal absentee ballots and relying on votes by criminals, the dead and   voters. The accusations proved largely spurious.
