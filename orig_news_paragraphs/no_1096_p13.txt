The website Spotrac, which evaluates sports contracts, sees Kaepernick as still having significant value. First, it compares him to four similar players who signed contracts at about Kaepernick’s age: Brock Osweiler, Sam Bradford, Nick Foles and Robert Griffin III. It then assesses his statistics and finds that his numbers are 11 to 14 percent better than that group’s, particularly his very low interception rate, just 0. 4 per game. That leads Spotrac to estimate his value as $14 million a year.
