When I caught up with Mr. Emerson this week he acknowledged making "a mistake" that should not tarnish a career spent mostly in broadcast news, starting in a $1.   job as a cameraman. " I had to make a decision in what was about 20 minutes," he said. He acknowledged that "clearly we always worry about funding for public television," but said that wasnâ€™t the "principal reason" for his decision to hold back the commentary.
