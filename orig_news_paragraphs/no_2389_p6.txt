Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, the provocative chairman of Breitbart News, made Mr. Ryan a frequent target of its coverage while he ran the website and is said to be particularly intent on forcing Mr. Ryan out. And Mr. Bannon, who declined to be interviewed for this article, would be able to pick up at Breitbart where he left off: as a persistent irritant to the Republican establishment. In interviews, Mr. Trump’s supporters said they were determined to harness the   energy that Mr. Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress   —   a target many of them seem just as eager to take down as they are to bring down Mrs. Clinton.
