Bush, of course, followed Reagan into the White House. That, too, may serve as inspiration for Pence, the former Indiana governor who was floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2016 and is now considered a top contender to become the Republican Party’s presidential nominee after   Donald Trump’s time in office comes to a close. The former congressman is also expected to be a particularly powerful vice president to Trump, who has never served in government. Pence will spend much of his time spearheading the Trump administration’s legislative in Congress, where he has been given an office on the House side in addition to the vice presidential office in the Senate side of Capitol Hill.
