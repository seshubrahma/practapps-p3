The other 280 were arrested for being in the U. S. illegally.   Three of the gang members arrested in the ICE operation had protected status as illegal immigrants under the   DACA program. Since DACAâ€™s inception, more than 1, 500 illegal immigrants have had their protected status revoked after they were found to be involved with a gang or committed a crime. DACA recipients are given protection by the federal government and since the Trump Administration has not ended the program, experts like Mark Krikorian have previously said that 800 new permits for protected DACA status can be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) every day.
