I think the third risk for the international process on climate   change is really the next step. In the Paris Agreement, there is   a provision to have and a 2018 facilitative dialogue and then a   2023 global stocktaking exercise. Those are fancy names for   trying to determine how we take the next step beyond the Paris   agreement to go beyond stabilizing emissions, which is what the   Paris agreement actually achieved, to bending the curve down and   getting actual global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to   avoid a   or even a    degrees Celsius   temperature change. So, while the Paris Agreement was a great   success, it really should still be understood as a first step in   actually achieving the goal of preventing dangerous climate   change.
