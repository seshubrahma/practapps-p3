Compete in the new Arctic international economic order, If we expect to be the leader of other nations, then we can expect to compete aggressively in the emerging   Arctic international economic order. For starters, weâ€™ll need to reduce domestic and foreign barriers by lifting   restrictions on oil and gas development in the US Arctic, reach a deal with Canada on our disputed maritime boundary in the   Beaufort Sea and create sustainable economic growth strategies with Arctic and   states.   Cutting across all these challenges is the need to craft effective multilateral strategies for addressing global environmental problems without undercutting economic growth. 6.
