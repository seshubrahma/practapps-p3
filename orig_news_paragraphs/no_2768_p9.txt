" Israeli leaders have used American pressure as an excuse to avoid doing something they really donâ€™t want to do but are being pressured to do by coalition members," said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel teaching at Princeton University. If Mr. Trump advances views to the right of Mr. Netanyahu, "this will put the prime minister in an awkward position with no excuses for not doing what   want him to do," Mr. Kurtzer said. Now in his fourth term, Mr. Netanyahu has focused lately on keeping the Palestinian conflict relatively contained while he forges new bonds around the world.
