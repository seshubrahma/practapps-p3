War Machine," one of his two new films out this fall, is based on "The Operators," Michael Hastings’s blistering account of U. S. military command, their occasionally reckless maneuvers and the political blowback that happened when a certain decorated general  —   played by Pitt   —    let his guard way, way down. (The other movie is Robert Zemeckis’s romantic assassination thriller "Allied," also based on actual events.)
