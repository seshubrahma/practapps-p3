The brochure also offers various versions of the package for the $500, 000, $250, 000, $100, 000 and $25, 000 price points. All the packages include travel bookings and tickets to various events, with decreasing amounts of tickets and less access. While $250, 000 and up includes the "candlelight" dinner and first family luncheon, less than that only gets access to the official inaugural events and, for $100, 000 donors, the Cabinet.   The inaugural committee is a separate entity from the campaign and the transition, and can raise money as it sees fit, though donors and bundlers of $200 or more will be made public.
