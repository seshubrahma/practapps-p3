Last night, in the wake of his feud with Fox News, guess where Trump appeared: on Fox News! Trump has already debated six times and constantly exposes himself to tough questions. McCain closed things with a stirring defense of Michael Mooreâ€™s girlfriend and a status quo that for decades has failed everyone but the Elite Establishment: I believe that Megyn Kelly is an outstanding journalist. But whether she is or not, that a candidate can decide who the questioners are would be a break down, as you know, of the system as we know it.
