The Russian ship has been identified as the   AGI ship Kurily  —   the same type of ship that was reportedly patrolling the U. S.’s east coast earlier this year. The   ships are designed to gather signals intelligence via an extensive array of sensors. The Chinese ship began shadowing the Vinson as soon as it entered the South China Sea on February 18, but the Russian ship began shadowing it after it headed north near the Sea of Japan, the official said. The spy ships are staying "at least" a couple of miles away from the Vinson, the official said.
