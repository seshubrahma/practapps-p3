The Japanese government can begin removing spent shells and other detritus from nearly 10, 000 acres of land on Okinawa that was returned by the U. S. military. The parcel may eventually be turned into a national park. In a sign of the prevalence of intense opposition to the U. S. military presence on Okinawa, the prefecture’s governor boycotted the return ceremony on Thursday, issuing a statement that said: "I greatly regret that the U. S. military doesn’t have any consideration for the people of Okinawa. "
