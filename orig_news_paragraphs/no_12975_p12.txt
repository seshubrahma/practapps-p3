Political correspondent Dana Bash, for one, vowed to "keep this discussion going, at least in the near future,"asserting that the Trump campaign would only be able to move on to other issues once it answered every detailed question about the Birther controversy. No one believes that, which is why Trumpâ€™s setup on Friday hit the mark. Trump knows, as other Republican presidential candidates only realized too late, that the mainstream media use such contrived controversies for the sole purpose of helping the Democrats and their nominee. The media expected to see Trump implode, his rising poll numbers brought low again.
