The man with the knife stabbed a waitress, who was hiding behind a partition, in the neck and stabbed a man in the back before running out of the restaurant, the witness said. Another witness said a masked man entered El Pastor restaurant down the street and slashed a woman in the side with a knife. Jack Applebee, who owns a restaurant a block away from Elliot’s, said he was standing outside when people came running down the street. A girl said, "They’re stabbing everyone."
