 (CNN) Donald Trump will have 90 minutes Sunday night to save his presidential campaign, as he faces off against Hillary Clinton in a debate that will cap one of the most extraordinary weekends in American political history.   Republicans    including vice presidential nominee Mike Pence    are criticizing Trump for his vulgar comments about advances he has made toward women that came to light Friday. And an   list of senators and top GOP officials want Trump replaced on the ticket.
