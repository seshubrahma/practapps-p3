And then on Friday    the day after Comey testifies before Congress    Trump will visit the Department of Transportation, where he will push for shorter review time in the way the federal government approves road and railways and other regulatory changes. " Infrastructure is a priority of his," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said this week.
