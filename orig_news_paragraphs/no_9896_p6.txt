If you need more evidence of voter support of Trump’s mandate, consider the OTHER national election held on November 8  —   the election of 438 members of United States House of Representatives: Republican candidates won some 3, 000, 000 more votes that Democratic candidates and retained majority control of that body. The street demonstrations against   Trump are not merely a temper tantrum by "sore losers" who were expecting a different outcome. Those street protests are a foretaste of what is in store for the country as we slide toward Third World politics. The left does not accept the moral legitimacy of the US Constitution, so why should we expect the left to respect Trump’s 306   victory in the Electoral College?
