Thousands of demonstrators gathered at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Saturday to protest President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order temporarily banning entry to nationals from   countries. [Though the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) helped obtain a judicial stay of the deportation of several arriving passengers, hundreds of protesters vowed to stay at SFO until those who had been detained were released.   SFO protesters are hearing that two more detainees remain in the airport. This crowd is committed to staying until every last one is out.
