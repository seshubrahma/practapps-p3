President Donald Trump was warmly welcomed by union workers attending the 2017 North America’s Building Trades Union legislative conference, as he promised to restore American jobs. ["I’m not, and I don’t want to be the president of the world. I’m the president of the United States, and from now on it’s going to be America first," Trump said as the crowd of workers applauded.   Trump criticized American leaders of the past for listening to "failed consultants" instead of the American worker, allowing their jobs to be shipped overseas.
