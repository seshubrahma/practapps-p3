Yatesâ€™ testimony May 8 will be the first time the former acting attorney general will publicly speak about the White House meeting. A source familiar with the situation says that Yates will be limited on what she can tell the Senate judiciary subcommittee because many of the details involving Flynn are classified, meaning there may only be a few new revelations. Yates would not comment ahead of the testimony. Her previously scheduled appearance in front of the House intelligence committee was canceled by its chairman Rep. Devin Nunes,   who said he wanted to hear first in a classified setting from FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers.
