It is only after the inauguration, though, that "It Canâ€™t Happen Here" takes a truly dark turn. Upon moving into the White House, Windrip immediately declares Congress an "advisory" body, stripped of all real power. When members of Congress resist, he locks them up without the slightest semblance of due process, the beginning of the end for American democracy. The rest of the book describes one long, disorienting nightmare, a national descent into labor camps and torture chambers and martial law.
