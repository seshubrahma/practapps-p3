But new satellite images made public this week appeared to reveal weapons emplacements for the first time. The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, which released the images through its Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said they showed "large antiaircraft guns and probable   weapons systems," which can theoretically thwart cruise missile attacks. The Defense Ministry statement, posted on its website in response to the images, did not specify what kinds of weapons the images showed but said any military hardware on the islands was reasonable. It repeated Chinaâ€™s contention that its construction on the islands is mainly for civilian purposes.
