In another example, the city government of San Jose, California, said it received about $2. 5 million in federal funding under the Community Development Block Grant program to address the homeless and other local needs. A total of $100, 650 of that funding went to Meals on Wheels. The Southern Maine Agency on Aging, which provides meals to elderly in Maineâ€™s Cumberland and York counties, said it would be "shortsighted" to cut that funding.
