As some in Mr. Farage’s party suggested him as the next ambassador to the United States, Prime Minister Theresa May’s office on Monday was quick to slap him down, saying that there would be no "third person" in her relationship with Mr. Trump. Responding to the cool reception from the prime minister’s office, Mr. Farage told LBC Radio: " It just goes to show they are not really interested in the country or the national interest, they are more concerned about petty party politics and trying to keep me out of everything. " Mr. Farage’s unannounced   diplomacy is a nuisance for Mrs. May, who reportedly had no prior knowledge of his excursion to Manhattan.
