Tester was considered one of the most vulnerable of the 23 Senate Democrats up in 2018. Tester won in 2012 with less than 50 percent of the vote in a state where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 20 points, 56 percent to her 35 percent. All House vacancies must be filled by a special election and Montana state law prohibits the setting of a date for a special election until after the vacancy occurs. Democrat Gov. Steve Bullock is required to set the date for the special election within 100 days of Zinkeâ€™s swearing in.
