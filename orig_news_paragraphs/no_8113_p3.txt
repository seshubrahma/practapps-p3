This is important, because if a candidate receives more than 50 percent of the statewide vote, they receive all of a Alabama’s delegates. Trump is near this threshold in Alabama, which could potentially push Rubio and Cruz out of contention for some of the state’s 50 delegates. In Oklahoma, Trump has 35 percent, followed by Ted Cruz with 23 and Rubio with 22 percent support. John Kasich is fourth, with 8 percent, followed closely by Ben Carson with 7 percent support.
