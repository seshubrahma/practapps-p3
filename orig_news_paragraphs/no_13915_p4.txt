Multiple civil rights groups, along with Democratic lawmakers, have expressed concern about Sessions’ ability to represent historically disenfranchised groups given his past statements on the Voting Rights Act, the NAACP and allegations of racist language, which he has denied. " Senator Sessions has failed to convince me that he will be a champion of constitutional rights: voting rights, women’s health care and privacy rights, and   protections. Rather, he has demonstrated hostility and antipathy    even downright opposition    to these bedrock Constitutional principles," Sen. Richard Blumenthal,   said in a statement Thursday announcing his opposition to Sessions.
