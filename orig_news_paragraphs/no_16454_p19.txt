After Bayh stayed at a JW Marriott a short cab ride from his Indianapolis condo last summer, a reimbursement check from his campaign account was sent to his address in Washington, according to Federal Election Commission records.   When he contributed to Clinton’s campaign last year, Bayh recorded a different Washington address for his home: his $2. 9 million house in Georgetown. Earlier this year when he contributed to the congressional campaign of Leon Panetta’s son, Jimmy, he did list an Indiana address. Yet after he purchased his    southern Florida condo in Key Biscayne, the 2013 deed    obtained by CNN    noted that his mailing address was in Washington, making no mention of his Indianapolis condo.
