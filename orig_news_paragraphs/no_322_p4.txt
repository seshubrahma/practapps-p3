The man did not need to be hospitalized, the detective said. The livestream is part of Mr. LaBeouf’s latest art project, "He Will Not Divide Us," a collaboration with the artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner. On Inauguration Day, the actor placed a camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, Queens, and invited members of the public to repeat the words "he will not divide us" into the camera. The aim is to keep streaming images of people repeating the words,   throughout Mr. Trump’s time in office.
