More robust programs that work directly with individuals who have committed crimes are needed to help prevent recidivism. About   of inmates released between   were arrested for a new crime within three years of release. In Philadelphia, where I was mayor, we launched Philly Rising (now known as SERVE Philadelphia) and RISE, and partnered with the Center for Returning Citizens, working immediately with the individuals on life plans and job opportunities after release to avoid recidivism.   CureViolence is another   program that trains previously incarcerated individuals to serve as "interrupters" who help identify conflicts and high risk individuals in their own neighborhoods to mobilize the community to change norms.
