With these efforts failed and Trump’s inauguration but days away, Democrats have taken up a new strategy: They will cripple the American government before they’ll see Donald Trump lead it.   As reported in the Washington Post,  Democratic Party leaders, well aware that they lack the votes in the Senate to defeat Trump’s Cabinet choices, have vowed to delay them for as long as possible, saying they want to see more information from the nominees on their personal finances. If successful, Democrats may prevent Trump from filling critical posts in government, from secretary of state to the United States attorney general, until March or beyond.
