As far back as 1987, Mr. Trump talked about his desire to negotiate nuclear arms control agreements with a declining but aggressive Soviet Union. In recent weeks, he has met with some of the most savvy survivors of the Cold War  —   notably Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary  —   at a moment when American relations with Russia are clearly at a turning point. Republicans who have spoken to Mr. Trump say he seems to realize that his opening gestures to Moscow will be closely observed at home, in Europe and among other allies. Republicans have split with him on Russia’s meddling in the American election, promising congressional inquiries after intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had used a combination of hacking and information warfare techniques to help elect Mr. Trump as president.
