Haaretz later updated the aforementioned paragraph to read thusly (emphasis added): Foreign visitors stream to the White House, but there is an embarrassing emptiness there behind the power of Trump’s     Jared Kushner. The senior adviser boasted that (according to reports that some say were satirical) while waiting to board ski lifts on vacation, he read up on the Middle East on his smartphone. Later still the article was updated a third time (it’s worth noting that none of the amendments were mentioned in an disclaimer endnote) this time reading: Foreign visitors stream to the White House, but there is an embarrassing emptiness there behind the power of Trump’s     Jared Kushner. The senior adviser was ridiculed as ostensibly taking a crash course on the Middle East while waiting for ski lifts on vacation.
