GM is hardly the only Wisconsin company that’s closing down U. S. operations. In October, Dairy Farmers of America announced it would close a Plymouth, Wisconsin, cheese factory —  and lay off the 304 workers there —  according to the Sheboygan Press local newspaper. Oscar Mayer is announcing it will close a Madison, Wisconsin, plant after it produced hot dogs there for a century. General Electric last year announced it is closing facilities in Wisconsin —  and reopening them in Canada.
