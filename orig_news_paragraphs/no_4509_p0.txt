White House National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banking executive, has reopened the U. S. government’s war on coal in direct contravention of directions from President Donald Trump. ["Coal doesn’t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock," Cohn said in Europe on Air Force One, while speaking for the White House to the press, the New York Times’ Brad Plumer noted.   " Natural gas, which we have become an abundant producer, which we’re going to become a major exporter is, is such a cleaner fuel," Cohn continued.
