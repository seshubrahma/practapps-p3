This is similar to the direct election process in Illinois, with the notable exception that the Pennsylvania delegates aren’t publicly affiliated with any Presidential campaign. In other words, the delegate’s candidate preference isn’t listed on the ballot, as it is in Illinois. The top three   in each Congressional district become delegates to the convention. This gives an enormous advantage to campaigns that have a large and sophisticated ground operation in the state.
