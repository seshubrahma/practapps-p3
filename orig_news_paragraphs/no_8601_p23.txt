it’s even more critical to get this stuff right. Facebook and twitter might hire some bad fits to avoid groupthink (though you’d never know to see them operate) but would they really tolerate employees who advocate for the overthrow of their platform and a return to Google’s Orkut? That’s a closer analogy for Europe’s, and soon America’s, Muslim problem. If Silicon Valley’s inhabitants were thinking critically and were not so obsessed with gender and race, they would recognise their own hypocrisy and realise that building the wall isn’t, for most Americans, a matter of race or even of economics
