Public spectacle came in with the next generation, who "took it to the streets," with street corner soapbox speakers and parades, which appalled more conservative members of the movement. Early marches were fueled by white working class women fighting the exploitations of industrial capitalism. Believing that winning the vote would help that fight, they carried signs demanding equal pay for equal work and an end to sweatshops.
