According to the bank: The idea here is that hackers recently knocked on the Trump serverâ€™s door, but posed as Alfa Bank    so the Trump server sent the bank real, unsolicited responses. One attack happened on February 18, the bank said. (The bank did not mention that to CNN before its story published on March 10.) After CNN published its story about the puzzling   situation, hackers stepped up their attack on the Trump Organization with "spoofed" signals for five hours, which were then directed back towards the bank, Alfa Bank said.
