No injuries were reported and damage assessments for both ships are underway, according to a Navy press release.    "It’s very common" to have small boats come up close, a Navy official told CNN, adding that there were no guns displayed or obvious signs of hostile intent in Tuesday’s incident. The fishing vessel crew later said it didn’t have a radio and didn’t hear the radio calls from the Navy, according to the official. While Navy officials are downplaying the collision, former sailors said that incidents of this kind are not "commonplace," as the service suggested and, at the very least, represent a significant professional embarrassment.
