Some of Brooklyn’s other cultural offerings have a price, but are well worth it. I took a friend to "Remains," a dance performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, known as BAM. The show was excellent and the $24 seats were reasonable. A word of caution, though: When tickets say "obstructed view" at BAM, they’re not kidding.
