Mike Pence (@mike_pence) September 10, 2016,  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called Clinton’s remarks "insulting" to many of his supporters and said that he even respects Clinton’s supporters even though they would never vote for him.   Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2016,
