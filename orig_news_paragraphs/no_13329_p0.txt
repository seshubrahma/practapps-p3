[From The Hill:  Bannon is best known for his domestic positions, particularly his populist nationalist views on trade and immigration. His detractors accuse him of trafficking in racism and   which he denies his defenders believe he has a rare gift for identifying and channeling the nationalist and populist energy building through America and around the world. Less discussed is Bannon’s fascination with the military and global affairs.
