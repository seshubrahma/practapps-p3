a television star to sing the national anthem at his inauguration on Jan. 20. Jackie Evancho, a    singer who gained popularity as a contestant on "America’s Got Talent," said on Wednesday that it was "a great honor" to be asked to perform by Mr. Trump. Hers is the first name released by the inaugural planning committee for a day that typically features   star power. President Obama had Beyoncé perform the anthem in 2013, and asked other   artists like Aretha Franklin and James Taylor to deliver supplementary performances at his inaugurations.
