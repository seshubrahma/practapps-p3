Sunday on CBS’s "Face The Nation," Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson said once in office,   Donald Trump will cause a "constitutional crisis or have a completely incompetent presidency. "   Gerson said, "Well, I think pretty much even chance that we are going to have a constitutional crisis or have a completely incompetent presidency, that doesn’t know how to exercise power, which I think is another possibility in this circumstance. We have a White House, Donald Trump has a White House with almost no skill of governing. We have a cheif of staff who has never been in government, which is absolutely extraordinary. "
