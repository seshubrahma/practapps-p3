North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said Friday that the bureau has been looking for several days into the deadly encounter between Scott and police. State investigators have interviewed most of the critical witnesses in the shooting, McCrory said. Meanwhile, a photo obtained by CNN affiliate   shows the immediate aftermath of the shooting, a source close to the investigation told CNN.   A black object near the bottom of the photo is a gun that police found at the scene, the source said.
