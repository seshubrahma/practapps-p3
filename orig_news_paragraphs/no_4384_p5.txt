Mayor Murray will vigorously fight these allegations in court. Murray also pledged to continue his bid for   as the cityâ€™s Mayor. The Seattle mayor has been the subject of such allegations in the past, with one case going as far back as 1984. Jeff Simpson came forward decades ago alleging that he met Murray in a Portland center for troubled children and was later molested for an extended period by the man who would become mayor.
