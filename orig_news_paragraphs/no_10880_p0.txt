Breitbart London Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam yesterday told a BBC presenter that conflating criticism of the press with Nazism is as ridiculous as making Volkswagen cars taboo. [On BBC World Service yesterday Kassam was asked whether he finds it "concerning" that both Breitbart and the head of a controversial think tank had used the term "lugenpresse".   " Yeah and people still drive Volkswagens, heaven forbid," the Breitbart London editor responded mockingly, referring to the fact the car giant was set up in 1937 by Germanyâ€™s National Socialist government.
