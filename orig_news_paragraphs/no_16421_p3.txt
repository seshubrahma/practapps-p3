The open letter to RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, which was first released last week, is part of a growing push inside the party to protect margins inside the House and Senate, amid fears that Trump could drag the entire ticket if he keeps falling in the polls.   " Rather than throwing good money after bad, the RNC should shift its strategy and its resources to convince voters not to give Hillary Clinton the ’blank check’ of a   Congress to advance her big government agenda," the   Republicans write in the letter. RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer said that there were no talks under way inside the RNC to move any money from Trump and said it would be almost impossible if they even wanted to.
