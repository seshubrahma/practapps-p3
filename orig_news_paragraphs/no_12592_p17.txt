Senator Cruz will be on The Glenn Beck radio program Monday between 9am and 12n eastern. The exact time of the interview is yet to be determined by the Cruz camp and GBP producers. Glenn has much to say on this issue and to the Senator and will be addressing his personal views as soon as Monday on his national radio program which is seen and heard by 10 million Americans on over 400 stations nationwide,   and the Blaze TV. Beck, an ardent supporter of Cruz, campaigned tirelessly for the Texas Senator throughout the primary season, even to the detriment of his own business interests, as the increasingly strident tone of his support for Cruz and denunciations of Trump reportedly alienated listeners and advertisers.
