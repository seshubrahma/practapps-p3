Republicans in Washington were initially skeptical that Mr. Pence, a former talk radio host, would sign on as Mr. Trumpâ€™s running mate. He has repeatedly flirted with bids for higher office, including president and speaker of the House, enjoying the attention he gets but never taking the plunge. Yet Mr. Pence, who endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican primary campaign, has steadily grown more interested in the vice presidency in recent days, according to Republicans who have been in touch with the governor and his aides. After initially describing a planned meeting with Mr. Trump as a pro forma exercise, Mr. Pence told a number of associates afterward that he would be inclined to accept the second spot on the ticket if it was offered.
