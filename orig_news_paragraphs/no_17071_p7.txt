The position of America’s chief diplomat is considered a particularly   one, charged with maintaining relationships around the globe. But some of the names being rumored for the job seem to indicate that Trump will favor an iconoclastic approach to the role: Rudy Giuliani, possible secretary of state, Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and mayor of New York, has little foreign policy experience to speak of but has been a vocal advocate of Trump’s since early on in the campaign. During his own run for the presidency in 2008, Giuliani espoused a fairly conventional Republican foreign policy view, calling on continued US engagement abroad and robust efforts to fight terrorism and stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan. He also signaled support for democracy promotion, something at odds with Trump’s pronouncements where he has put value on stability and   as opposed to democracy and human rights.
