It is perhaps bizarre to suggest that Trump’s desire to temporarily pause the nation’s   importation of Islamic migrants —  some of whom may hold     and   tolerance beliefs —   poses a threat to Mormons in Utah. Moreover, Lee’s invocation of the Mormon community to defend his opposition to Trump is perhaps curious for two reasons. First, Lee does not explain how it benefits the Mormon community —  or how it furthers religious freedom in the United States —  to import into the country large flows of   Islamic migrants, who do not believe in religious tolerance.
