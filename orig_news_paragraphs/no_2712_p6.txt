Most memorably, perhaps, the   mogul Sean Combs used the party as a template for a   wingding he tossed for himself in 1998, reportedly spending more than $500, 000 to furnish Cipriani with a translucent monogrammed dance floor and Plexiglas   booths for the amusement of a collection of celebrities, among them Martha Stewart, Ronald Perelman, Sarah Ferguson and Donald J. Trump. Now it is difficult to recall a time when the borders between society and celebrity were sharply delineated and seldom crossed. And in an era when many celebrities attend parties because they have been paid to do so (and post the evidence later on Instagram) it is startling to remember a time when people went to parties to have fun. A certain indulgent pleasure can be had in reliving the innocent wonder that inspired Capoteâ€™s Black and White Ball, a party its host had in some ways begun to plan as a precocious, lonely    in Monroeville, Ala. but did not have the social power to pull off until the year of his huge literary success.
