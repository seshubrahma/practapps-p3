One of the big progressive complaints is that HUD doesn’t attach enough strings to these mortgages when selling them to banks. Of course, if they had more strings attached, the banks would be less likely to buy them, and a rule like "no foreclosures against people who aren’t making mortgage payments for a year" is already a very thick string. It’s amusing how progressives always act surprised when the people expected to pay for their agenda try to escape their clutches.
