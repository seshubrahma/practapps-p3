Eileen Hill, a New Jersey resident who attended the Philadelphia march, said: "I’m concerned for the future of democracy in the United States. .. The ’March for Truth’ is to tell them we know what truth is from lying."   In response to the   marches, supporters of the President held a counter "Pittsburgh Not Paris" rally in Lafayette Square in Washington.
