John Sandweg, who led ICE for seven months under Mr. Obama, said wholesale deportations could make it easier for immigrant gang members and drug traffickers to escape detection. " If the agents are looking for volume, they wonâ€™t spend the time to do the detective work tracking down the   bad guy who has fake documents, the hardened criminals in the shadows," he said. To prevent flight after arrest, the authorities would have to detain most immigrants awaiting deportation.
