The president has an opportunity to acknowledge that U. S. policy on the Syrian war has been an unmitigated catastrophe. Obama’s decision to keep a mostly   approach to the conflict, even after he declared that President Assad "must go," allowed other players to move into the inferno, stoking the fires of sectarianism and conjuring a brand of terrorism so vile that it made previous terrorist horrors appear mild. The White House ignored Assad’s barrel bombs and looked away when he used chemical weapons     even after claiming he had moved them all out of the country. Obama finally decided to take action, but against the   Islamic State or ISIS.
