By contrast, Obama seems to believe that the United States and its allies should —  in an ideal world, at least —  share interests and values. When an ally acts in ways he disapproves of, Obama has been more willing than his recent predecessors to publicly criticize or marginalize it. Often this takes the form of Obama suggesting that while the ally ultimately wants what the U. S. wants, it is going about things the wrong way. Hence Obama’s claim that he and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte share a desire to crack down on drug trafficking, but that Duterte isn’t doing it "the right way" or his assertion that steadfast U. S. support for Saudi Arabia against Iran isn’t good for the Saudis, even though they think it is or his advice, as a "friend and partner of Turkey’s,"  that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan avoid an   "overreaction" after a failed coup attempt.
