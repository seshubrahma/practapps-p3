Also this week, Trumps will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his    resort in Florida, where the subject of North Korea’s nuclear proliferation will be a focus of conversation. In her remarks, Haley blasted China for not doing enough to stop North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests. " That’s the goal of this weekend, is to make sure that China shows they are willing to act on North Korea, because we know that, at the end of the day, the only one that North Korea is really going to respond to is China," she said.
