Under the Merida Initiative, the State Dept has given Mexico $2. 6 billion since 2008. That’s to strengthen rule of law, counter   support judicial reform and police professionalization. It doesn’t include aid from other State Department programs. Mexico also gets funding from the departments of Defense, Energy, Labor, Health and Human Services, Interior, the Peace Corps, the US Agency for International Development and DHS.
