Schweizer added that the Clinton Foundation scandal was also about the rule of law: "I mean, if we have a senior government official who engaged in corrupt practices, which I believe they did, it should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI, and if crimes were committed, they ought to face the consequences   â€”   as would a   bureaucrat in government, as would a businessman or a   worker. " He anticipated much would come down to how the investigation of the Clinton Foundation was conducted.
