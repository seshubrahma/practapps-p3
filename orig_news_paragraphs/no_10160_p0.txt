A group of men who appear to be organizers of today’s massive   Trump rally in New York City are thrilled they were captured saying they believed CNN’s coverage of the event was "great" because it made the chaotic protest that lead to dozens of clashes with the police out to be "nonviolent. " [The audio, captured exclusively by Breitbart News, also shows that the organizers want to give the impression that the video was "nonviolent," despite the fact that they know there was violence at the protest, which they want the media to chalk up to "a few troublemakers. "   At one point, the organizers can be heard discussing a video that they say is "amazing" but that they admit they will not be putting out, presumably because it contradicts the nonviolent narrative they wish to promote. The unidentified organizers were noticeable before the march, texting unknown people and discussing the logistics of the protest.
