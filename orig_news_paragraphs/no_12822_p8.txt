The core cast of Hamilton, including Miranda, had been vocal supporters of Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. In October, Miranda and actress Renee Elise Goldsberry headline a "Broadway for Hillary" fundraiser in New York alongside comedian Billy Crystal. Clinton took in a performance of the hit show in July, just hours after she was grilled by federal investigators about her use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, later met with Miranda backstage.
