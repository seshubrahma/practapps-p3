But let’s pretend, for a moment, that facts actually matter, especially when it comes to the safety of American citizens. Here are the facts about terrorism in the United States: Americans are almost seven times as likely to be killed by a white extremist than by an Islamic one, according to one study. Citing a 2013 study, the New York Times notes: "  extremists averaged 337 attacks per year in the decade after   causing a total of 254 fatalities."    According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there were 42 militia groups in 2008 today, there are 276.
