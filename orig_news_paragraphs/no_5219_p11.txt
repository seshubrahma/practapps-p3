Anticipating Tillerson’s visit, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters Wednesday he was "optimistic about the future of   relations" and anticipated a positive outcome from Tillerson’s visit. President Donald Trump is reportedly working with Chinese officials to plan a U. S. visit by President Xi Jinping next month. These statements represent a nearly complete shift away from what former Secretary of State and   presidential candidate Hillary Clinton described as "strategic patience": a policy of waiting for the North Korean economy to implode and Pyongyang finding itself no longer able to afford to ignore UN sanctions and the rejection of the international community. This policy largely failed because China continued to trade with North Korea, providing the fellow communist regime a vital lifeline.
