The RNC noted there is documentary evidence that Abedin was "notified by a State Department official in January 2013 that she had not completed her required annual ethics training," and after some confusion, she promised to go online to complete the training, but State could find no evidence she actually did so. Abedin’s unique work relationship with the State Department, in which she was simultaneously allowed to perform lucrative consulting for   firms   —   including Teneo, a company founded by Bill Clinton’s onetime "body man" Doug Band, and the notorious Clinton Foundation  —   has been the subject of much controversy, a   investigation by watchdog group Judicial Watch, and inquiries by Senator Charles Grassley ( ) of the Judiciary Committee. Thursday on the Breitbart News Daily radio show, former Donald Trump campaign consultant Roger Stone asked how someone with Abedin’s background could have been given the security clearance necessary to see the Top Secret documents Hillary Clinton has been handling, and mishandling.
