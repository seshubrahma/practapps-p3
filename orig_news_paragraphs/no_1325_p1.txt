If the state adopted the delegate rules of any other primary, he would probably be an   favorite, or better, to amass the 1, 237 delegates needed before the convention. Instead, his chances may come down to the whims of 54 unpledged Pennsylvania delegates. No other state leaves so many of its delegates unbound   â€”   allowed to vote for whomever they please at the convention.
