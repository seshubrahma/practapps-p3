And now the Iowa caucus looks like being the first step of the Trumpian equivalent of Mussolini’s infamous March on Rome. Where Mussolini was hard to pin down in the political spectrum between the socialist newspaper editor and   dictator, Trump has embraced universal healthcare for all, then said that it’s too expensive, then said that he was in favour of comprehensive health insurance for every American. Where Mussolini made comparisons between his Italy and the Roman Empire, Trump promises to make America great again without saying how. Where Mussolini attempted to make good his imperial promises by, in Churchill’s words, "frisking up to the side of the German tiger" Trump has publicly praised Vladimir Putin, who is fast turning Russia into a dictatorship.
