’s enemies hellbent on decimating us militarily and economically, it’s wise to insist gentlemanly politics to take a back seat to the fighting Warrior spirit that must drive all our leaders in this upcoming epic battle for America’s security, solvency and sovereignty. A GOP team is now set to win that battle through strengthening our military, our Supreme Court, our balance sheet, and our common resolve to finally put America first. Congratulations to the Pence family: stand your ground and fight alongside your dad through the coming months and years of scrutiny. Illegitimi non carborundum.
