Farming and ranching groups from across the Great Plains sent skeins of fence wire and new metal posts to drive three feet into the soil. Members of   clubs and National FFA Organization chapters drove down to help with the cleanup, sleeping in guest bedrooms and on   floors around the towns of Ashland, Meade and Protection. " We donâ€™t like to receive," said Kendal Kay, the mayor of Ashland and president of a community bank here.
