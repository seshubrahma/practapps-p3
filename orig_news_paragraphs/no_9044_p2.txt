I respect their skepticism when it is attached to reasonable arguments, since no candidate is perfect and no one can know the future. I am put in mind of the wit who said that Republicans are always looking for the perfect candidate while Democrats are looking for the perfect lie. But the primaries are over and Donald Trump is now the nominee. That means he is the only obstacle to the party of Obama and Hillary and Huma Abedin, of the Iran deal and the appeasement of Islamic   beginning with the Hamas terrorists of Gaza and the Fatah terrorists of the West Bank.
