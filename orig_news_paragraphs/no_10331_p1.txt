Former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has collected $21. 1 million for her campaign and its supporting political action committees from 17 U. S. donors on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Republican Donald Trump has received $1. 02 million from 12 members of the group. While the role the wealthiest play in American politics has come under increased scrutiny with growing attention to income inequality fueling the rise of populist candidates, contributions from U. S. billionaires on the Bloomberg index amount to 3 percent of the $708 million raised by the two candidates, as of the latest Federal Election Commission filings.
