The CBO said 28 million would be uninsured by 2026 if Obamacare remained the law of the land. Pelosi said Obamacare had "good bones," meaning structurally the law was sound, though she admitted it could still be improved. War on drugs, Norman Brown, who served 20 years in prison for drug crimes before former President Barack Obama commuted his sentence, asked Pelosi what she would do to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from rolling back   reforms to the Department of Justice. Pelosi cited previous bills to reduce disparities between crack and powder cocaine sentences, which critics said unfairly targeted people of color.
