President Trump continually surrounds himself with key advisers and personnel who share his commitment to protecting the lives of the vulnerable, as well as   taxpayers. We have been impressed by the skill and experience of the team he has put in place during the transition. Together, we will advance a culture of life by fulfilling the   commitments made during the campaign. With   President Trump and a   Congress, we have an historic opportunity to advance policy that will save lives.
