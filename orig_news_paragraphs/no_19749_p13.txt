The report states that "The tradecraft standards for analytic products have been refined over the past ten years," a timeline that picks up after the   to the Iraq War. It also offers an appendix explaining the jargon used to describe levels of certainty. Peculiarly, the longest single section of the report is a lengthy appendix focusing on RT, the Russian   television network, which was originally published by the CIA’s Open Source Center in 2012. While the purpose of the appendix appears to be to demonstrate the way that Russia uses RT (previously known as Russia Today) to spread disinformation and the Russian government line, its length and its rather obvious conclusion —  a Russian   channel is a medium for Russian messaging —  sit somewhat awkwardly beside the blunt but unspecified accusations in the short body of the report.
