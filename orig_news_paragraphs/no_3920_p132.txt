#ComeyTestimony,  —   Michelle Ruiz (@michelleruiz) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:30 A. M. As Comey comes under questions from Burr, our very own Joel Pollak notes that Comey’s altered opening statement was a deeply personal statement furthering the giant nothingburger he put out last night through the committee. Comey failing again so far, just like he did when he was working on the Hillary Clinton email scandal last year. So far the Comey testimony is all about him  all about political retribution against the president for firing him.
