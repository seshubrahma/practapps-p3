Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with Netanyahu Thursday, the State Department said. Tillerson "stressed America’s steadfast commitment to its key allies and partners as it works to protect the interests and safety of the American people," a State Department statement said, adding that Tillerson also spoke with his German, Mexican and Canadian counterparts. It was not immediately clear if Tillerson spoke with Netanyahu before or after the White House’s statement on settlements, though the White House statement was issued during the middle of the night in Israel. Netanyahu is due at the White House for talks on February 15.
