Jeffrey Lewis, director of the   East Asia Nonproliferation Program, told CNN last year that North Korean simultaneous missile testing seemed to indicate it was trying to find a way to bypass THAAD’s defenses.   Developments in Pyongyang’s SLBM systems also pose a threat to its neighbors, as missiles launched from underwater are far harder to detect.   While the danger posed by ICBMs may be overstated, North Korea’s conventional and nuclear threat to its neighbors is profound, and may be why Trump is left with few options other than sitting down with Kim Jong Un.   If North Korea is hoping for just such a meeting, as some analysts have argued, Inbar said it is "logical to assume" that Kim will want to test an ICBM as soon as possible.
