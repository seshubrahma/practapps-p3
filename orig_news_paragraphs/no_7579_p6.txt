Where Teddy Roosevelt proclaimed, "Thank God I am not a free trader," neoconservatives have embraced the utopian trade policies of Democrat Woodrow Wilson. The fact is that the neoconservatism is not steeped in the experience of the four men on Mount Rushmore, nor is it a part of the GOP tradition. Rep. Paul Ryan may try and claim the moral mantle of Republicanism, but his brand is one that perverts traditional conservatism. So if these individuals feel a disdain for a Trump campaign that is restoring Republicanism, their departure is not a loss.
