LPGA superstar Natalie Gulbis (great choice as a character witness) wants to speak about a man she admires and found to be gracious, generous and inspiring. Gulbis says that when she earned her tour card 16 years ago, she was told there were only two things you shouldn’t talk about in public —  politics and faith. She says she is going to violate that rule today at the RNC as a Christian woman. Gulbis says she has always wanted to own a Boys and Girls Club and felt that she was treated unfairly as a woman.
