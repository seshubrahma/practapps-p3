In a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas, Senator Ted Cruz said, "Despite any record of achievement and a liberal ideology out of touch with the majority of Texans, the Castro brothers have the full support of the mainstream media and Washington establishment willing to do everything in their power to turn Texas blue. " Cruz also added, "This November, it is critical we elect conservatives up and down the ballot in order to prevent a liberal takeover of Washington D. C. " He emphasized, "But our opponents are already making plans to defeat us, so we cannot afford to wait to engage until 2018. "
