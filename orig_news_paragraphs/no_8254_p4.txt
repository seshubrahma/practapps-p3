Shockingly, Trump seems to argue that because eminent domain exists, the people must ignore and sanction its misuse. For more than two centuries, the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment imposed an essential limitation on the scope of government’s eminent domain authority, since the "takings" clause of the Amendment was consistently and correctly interpreted to prohibit the taking of private property for private use even if just compensation was paid. The government was not permitted to confiscate property from one private individual and transfer it to another all government takings of private property presupposed an actual public purpose such as highways, schools or courthouses. So, at least to this extent, Trump is correct
