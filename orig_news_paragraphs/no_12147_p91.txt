Trump has since softened that stance somewhat, and now wants to keep people out from   countries. But regardless, the constitutional protection against religious discrimination does not apply to people who are not yet immigrants, residents or citizens. In fact, our current immigration policy "discriminates" against Muslims because it does not permit people to bring over their spouses from polygamous marriages, which are permitted in many Muslim countries. That kind of discrimination is constitutional and lawful.
