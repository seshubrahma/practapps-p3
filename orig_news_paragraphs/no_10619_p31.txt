Muslims have their hands chopped off. Or worse.   The thing I always miss in discussions of Islam is what Muslims actually believe about God.   Christians believe in God, the Creator of heaven and earth, who loved his creation so much that he entered into it through the womb of a woman to become one with his creatures in their suffering.
