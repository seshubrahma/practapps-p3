" Of course, we always support the Republican nominee in every race," Republican National Committee (RNC) communications director Sean Spicer told Breitbart News on Wednesday when asked if Reince Priebus and the RNC would back Nehlen in November if he topples Ryan next week. Spicer did say that Priebus supports Ryan, however, and sources external to the RNC have confirmed to Breitbart News that Priebus has been putting his thumb on the scales in this primary pushing people to either not endorse Nehlen or to back Ryan. Earlier this week, Donald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential nominee, refused to endorse Ryan for Congress.
