What black guy would do that to his own mama? Shaun is as shady as they come, the ultimate Black Lives Matter opportunist, as Sheriff Clarke would describe him. He has engaged in so much strange behavior over the last year I’m not going to waste your time trying to catalogue it. I will tell you my favorite bit, which was when he wrote me a bizarre email claiming I am obsessed with him, the NRA is a white supremacist organization  —   that will come as a shock to Sheriff Clarke, who both frequently works with the NRA and is an actual black man  —   and that the game of pool is a racial symbol.
