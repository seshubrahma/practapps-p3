The Associated Press (@AP) February 19, 2016,   Donald Trump has emerged as the   for the GOP nomination by winning over roughly a third of Republicans in the early voting states and in preference polls, packing his rallies with men and women, evangelical Christians and military veterans,   workers and wealthy retirees. His critics have argued for months heâ€™ll never be able to grow that      coalition by clashing with Pope Francis, attacking former President George W. Bush and skipping debates like he did once in Iowa. His negatives, they say, are just too high.
