So far, we say it was an unidentified explosive device as investigators and the Federal Security Serviceâ€™s bomb specialists are to establish the exact cause of this explosion," Andrei Przhezdomsky told   Russia 24.    A second device was found at another metro station    Revolutionary Square    and was disabled, the committee said in statement. That device, hidden in a fire extinguisher, was larger than the one that went off, according to state media reports quoting law enforcement. It carried about a kilogram of TNT, the reports said.
