On the first ballot, the party voted on a delegate slate that would have taken away one of Trumpâ€™s delegates but would have, at least, still given him one representative. That bloc would have given Trump supporter Debbie Dooley one of the slots and a Cruz supporter named Carolyn Fisher another slot, with a Rubio slot going to local party convention chairman BJ Van Gundy. But Cruz supporters voted down that slate. So on the next ballot it came time to replace one or all of those delegates with new people.
