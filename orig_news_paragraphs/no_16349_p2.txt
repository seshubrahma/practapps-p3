Hanna and Rigell’s defections come as other notable Republicans have said they will either not vote for Trump or will back other candidates. Earlier this week, longtime Chris Christie aide Maria Comella told CNN’s Jamie Gangel she plans to vote for Clinton, and Sally Bradshaw, Jeb Bush’s top adviser, told Gangel she’s leaving the Republican Party over Trump and will vote for Clinton in Florida if the race there is close. And major GOP donor Meg Whitman announced earlier this week she’ll support Clinton over Trump as well. Amid Republican infighting over its   nominee, the Clinton and Johnson campaigns have sought to grow their bases of support.
