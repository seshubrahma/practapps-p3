" The Trump administration is taking steps to enhance our ability to defend against North Korea’s ballistic missiles, such as through the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Korea."  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters he and President Donald Trump talked by phone about 8 a. m. Tuesday local time (6 p. m. ET Monday) and agreed the missile launches were "a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions" and a threat to the international community. President Trump also spoke Monday with the acting South Korean President Hwang   to discuss North Korea’s missile test, a US official says, in addition to the call with Abe. According to the acting president’s office, they agreed to continue annual military drills and add pressure and impose sanctions against North Korea.
