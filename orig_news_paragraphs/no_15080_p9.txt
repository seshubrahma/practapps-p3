Not long afterward, a suicide bomber attacked outside St. Markâ€™s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, according to state news outlets.   Police officers who had been posted outside the church stopped a man wearing an explosive belt from entering the church, the Interior Ministry said. Two of those officers, a man and a woman, were killed, along with civilians and other police staff. Egyptian blogger Maged Butter said he saw five or six ambulances and bloodstains 100 meters away from the site of the explosion, which happened near the church gate.
