Updated voting technology can increase turnout by making voting easier. As just one example, Do√±a Ana County, New Mexico uses Voting Convenience Centers instead of   polling places, meaning that anyone in the county can vote at any of the 40 centers instead of having to go to their assigned home precinct. This makes it easier to vote near work or school and eliminates the possibility of having to vote via a provisional ballot    which could potentially not count    if a voter shows up at the wrong place.   This system shows that improved technology can both enhance the integrity of our election system    a standard Republican talking point    and also make voting more accessible to more people, thereby increasing the electorate    something Democrats usually strive to achieve.
