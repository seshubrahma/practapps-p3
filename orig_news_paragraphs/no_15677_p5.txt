In a major speech on his second day in Riyadh to leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries, the President attempted to tone down his rhetoric and took his first major step toward attempting to unite the Muslim world in common cause against terrorism. Rather than reiterating calls for banning Muslims from the United States or arguing as he did on the campaign that "Islam hates us," Trump sought to make clear that the US is not at war with Islam, which he praised as "one of the world’s great faiths. " Senior Trump administration officials said that the change in rhetoric wasn’t a softening of his stance, instead pointing to Trump’s direct call for Muslim leaders to bear more responsibility for the plight of Islamist extremism.
