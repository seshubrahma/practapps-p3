Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has explained that, far from being "fundamentally unAmerican," recognizing limits and curbing immigration to protect American jobs and wages is "rational" and is the "mainstream" view held by most Americans. " It is not mainstream, but extreme, to continue surging immigration beyond all historical precedent. And it is not rational, but radical, to refuse to recognize limits," Sessions has explained.
