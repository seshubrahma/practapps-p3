The paper introduces a "Developed World Populism Index," which Dalio says measures the strength of populism over time. Itâ€™s a weighted index of the vote share of   parties or candidates in national elections for major developed countries since 1900. The index shows that populism is now at its highest level since the early 1930s. Contemporary populism includes supporters of Donald Trump, UKIP in the UK, AfD in Germany, National Front in France, Podemos in Spain and Five Star Movement in Italy.
