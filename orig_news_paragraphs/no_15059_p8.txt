There may also be a sense that Trump has finally smelt the coffee on Russia, having previously sounded softer than recent US presidents when it came to Vladimir Putin. After months of concern he wouldn’t be tough on Assad’s biggest backer, there will be relief that after the chemical weapons attack, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations and his secretary of state publicly challenged Russia to call Assad to heel. But there is still every reason to believe that Russia won’t listen    even after the US cruise missiles. Trump is left at odds with Putin.
