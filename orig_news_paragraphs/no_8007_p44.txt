Now, faced with international outrage, Merkel is considering making deportations of criminal refugees easier. The only Germans still cheering #refugeeswelcome are paid protestors in Th√ºringen and the   who protested a week after Cologne against "sexism" and "racism". On top of that, Vera Lengsfeld, a former representative in the Bundestag (German Federal Parliament) has accused the government of funding Antifa, an extreme   organization,   at   events.   Her accusations went without notice, response or investigation, although many suspected before and after that this was the case.
