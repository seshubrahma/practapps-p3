Breitbart News reported at the time that police officers shot Woods after he refused to disarm himself of a knife that he was brandishing. According to police, they used beanbag rounds and pepper spray to force Woods to drop the weapon, but he refused. The national anthem, Coach Hill claims, moved him to tears during his own playing days because "it represented the freedom of being an American. "
