In recent days, Mulvaney had conceded the budget deal would not allow the White House to build a "bricks and mortar" wall on the border this year.   " There are several hundreds of millions of dollars for us to replace cyclone fencing with   high steel wall," Mulvaney told reporters Tuesday. The administration will only be able to use the additional border security funding secured in the budget deal for the 2017 fiscal year because of an existing border fencing law passed by Congress in 2006.
