The Wall Street Journal was first to report that investigators had looked at the calls. Among the communications being scrutinized are calls between Russiaâ€™s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and Flynn on December 29.   The calls came on the same day the US announced further sanctions against Russia and expelled a group of 35 Russian diplomats the US had accused of spying.                                                   A Trump official told CNN on January 16th that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss the Russian sanctions.
