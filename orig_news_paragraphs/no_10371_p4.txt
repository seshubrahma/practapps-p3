In a New York City hate crime hoax, the Muslim woman alleged that Trump supporters attacked her on the subway, calling her a "terrorist" and blamed New Yorkers for not stepping in to help her. A week after the incident was reported as fact by BuzzFeed and other mainstream media outlets, police announced that the Muslim woman had fabricated the incident. She was then pictured going into court on charges for faking a police report with a shaved head and eyebrows sans hijab, a Muslim headdress. Sources told the New York Daily News that her parents shaved her head as punishment and were similarly upset that she was dating a Christian.
