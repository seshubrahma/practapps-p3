Someone like Judge Pamela Harris    who was placed on the DC circuit after the so called "nuclear option" was triggered. Or Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who sits on the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Or Sen. Elizabeth Warren?   But if Clinton were to win, she may not want to engage in an immediate battle royale over the Supreme Court.
