One year later, a man who would soon eclipse Mr. Assange in terms of   fame boarded a plane in Hong Kong. His name was Edward J. Snowden, and he was a National Security Agency    having stunned the world and strained American alliances by leaking documents that revealed a United   network of global surveillance programs. Mr. Snowden had not given his thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks. Still, it was at the suggestion of Mr. Assange that the flight Mr. Snowden boarded on June 23, 2013, accompanied by his WikiLeaks colleague Sarah Harrison, was bound for Moscow, where Mr. Snowden remains today after the United States canceled his passport en route.
