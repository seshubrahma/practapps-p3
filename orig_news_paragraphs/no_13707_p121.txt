Cruz compares Trump to Clinton on Social Security and says he will get rid of bureaucrats that are enabling all of the waste, fraud, abuse. Cruz says if you are fed  up with Washington, the question to ask is who is going to take on Washington. Cruz says Trump has funded liberal Democrats and funded the liberal establishment while he stood up to lead the fight against Obamacare to honor his commitment to the   men and women of the country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare. He says he also stood against amnesty and implies Cruz has never stood up to lobbyists.
