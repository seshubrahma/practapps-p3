" CNN reported on this claim last month. In June, both USA Today and The Wall Street Journal published investigations on this subject, reporting that Trump’s companies face hundreds of claims that the businessman has not paid contractors    including waiters, painters, a banking firm and more. USA Today looked at 60 lawsuits and more than 200 mechanic’s liens, and interviewed businesses like an Atlantic City cabinet builder who claimed that the Trump Organization did not pay more than $80, 000 owed to him, which started the closure of the builder’s business. Hundreds of other contractors in the 1980s made similar claims.
