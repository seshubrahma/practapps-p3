9:08: Holt asks the candidates for their top three priorities in their first 100 days. Sanders says his first days will be about bringing America together to end the decline of the middle class, make the wealthy pay their "fair share" of taxes, and have a government that works for all. Clinton, speaking robotically and like a Senator, says she would work quickly to present to Congress her plans to create more good jobs and equal pay for womenâ€™s work, etc. She says she will present her plans to build on Obamacare and improve it.
