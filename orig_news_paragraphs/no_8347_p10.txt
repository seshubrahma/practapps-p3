And we should also remember that the Bank of England  —   a better operation than the European Central Bank   —   will still be in business, as will the British pound sterling.   My advice to investors is to ride out the   market volatility, which may last several months, and look instead at the   positives of political and economic freedom.   It will now be up to Boris Johnson, the likely new British prime minster, and the Tory party, perhaps with bipartisan help, to negotiate a good trade deal and move more aggressively on the   path of     policies.
