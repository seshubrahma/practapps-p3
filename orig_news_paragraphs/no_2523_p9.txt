Mr. Friedman is a staunch opponent of basic tenets of Washington’s longstanding approach to much of the ambassadorial portfolio. He refers to the West Bank by its biblical name, Judea and Samaria, something hard to imagine his predecessors doing publicly. Upon being nominated Thursday night, he said he looked forward to working "from the U. S. Embassy in Israel’s eternal capital, Jerusalem," rather than Tel Aviv, where the American Embassy has been for decades, under the State Department ’s insistence that the holy city’s status be determined as part of a broader deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
