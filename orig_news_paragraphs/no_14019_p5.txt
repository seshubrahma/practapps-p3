Only Democrats    Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama    have had a poet read from the steps of the Capitol. The air was bitterly cold in January 2009 when poet Elizabeth Alexander read "Praise Song for the Morning," composed for the occasion of Barack Obama’s first inauguration. She had the perhaps unenviable task of following the President as a speaker, but her placement on the program    between Obama’s inaugural address and the final benediction from the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery    offers some insight into what role poems have historically played in the   of presidents. Between the new leader’s vision for our nation and a prayer to keep it safe and free, there was poetry.
