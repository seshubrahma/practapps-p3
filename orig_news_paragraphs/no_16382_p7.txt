The Justice Department declined to press charges against Clinton for her use of the private server earlier this year.   The Clinton Foundation was not part of the investigation into her private server. The FBI went to the Justice Department earlier this year asking for it to open a case into the foundation, but the public integrity unit declined. The Justice Department had looked into whether it should open a case on the foundation a year prior and found it didnâ€™t have sufficient evidence to do so.
