This has not sat well with Ms. Conway, who after all did have a small kernel of truth to back her up, though no killings happened in Bowling Green, Ky. and a "massacre" does not appear to have ever occurred anywhere. In 2013, the State Department imposed a   freeze on processing Iraqi refugees after two Qaeda members were discovered in Iraq setting roadside bombs targeting American troops. They had been admitted to the United States in 2009 and lived in Bowling Green before they returned to Iraq. The fingerprint that nailed them was on a cellphone detonator tied to a bomb that had not exploded.
