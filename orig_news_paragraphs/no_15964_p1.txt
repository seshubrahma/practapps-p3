Still, if we combine what we know about tax loopholes for real estate investors with Trumpâ€™s limited financial disclosures and other publicly available information, it is reasonable to surmise, as does expert and Pulitzer   David Cay Johnston, that the presumptive Republican presidential contender is paying very little in federal income taxes. We know that Trump has repeatedly received a New York state tax break intended only for families earning less than $500, 000 per year. And a CNN investigative piece about Trump and his golf courses demonstrates further that the reality TV star is adept at using legal maneuvers to get unreasonably low real estate valuations, ensuring he pays minimal property tax, For example, according to the investigation, he owns a golf course in Westchester, New York (where he gave a   speech not too long ago) that he claims in FEC statements is worth $50 million. But his attorney has filed appeals claiming the property is only worth $1. 4 million.
