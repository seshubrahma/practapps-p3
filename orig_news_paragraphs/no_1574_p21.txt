At the International Rescue Committee’s resettlement office in Baltimore this week, the small waiting room was filled with Syrian families preparing to register for health care with the Maryland Department of Social Services and English classes at Baltimore City Community College. They also attended cultural or   training in small classrooms equipped with white boards,   fliers and task lists. " This is where the realities begin to set in for the clients: that while they have certain rights and benefits, they also have a lot of responsibilities," said Ruben Chandrasekar, the executive director of the rescue committee’s Maryland programs, gesturing to an orientation classroom.
