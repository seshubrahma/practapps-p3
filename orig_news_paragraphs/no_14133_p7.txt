Immigrant rights activists have long warned that the human smuggling routes, often controlled by ruthless "coyotes" (smugglers) are potentially deadly threats for female migrants. According to the US Border Patrol, of the almost 409, 000 migrants apprehended in 2016 along the southern border, 101, 000 were women. Statistics for assaults of female migrants are difficult to collect because many of these crimes often go unreported. In 2010, Amnesty International reported that as many 60% of migrant women and girls traveling through Central America and Mexico were sexually assaulted.
