House Speaker Paul Ryan has a critical choice to make in the next few days: Whether he will please company executives by allowing them to import more     visa workers, or else please the GOPâ€™s base of   Americans by helping them get jobs at higher wages? [Business groups, led by the H2B Workforce Coalition, want him to include language in the 2017 supplemental budget which would allow companies to import another 100, 000 or more     visa workers for summer work at low wages. The supplemental must be completed by April 28.   But   groups want the number of visas kept at 66, 000 for the year, which will force companies to raise wages and to recruit some of the millions of young Americans who have dropped out of the workforce.
