Paulson writes: With Donald Trump as the presumptive presidential nominee, we are witnessing a populist hijacking of one of the United Statesâ€™ great political parties. The GOP, in putting Trump at the top of the ticket, is endorsing a brand of populism rooted in ignorance, prejudice, fear and isolationism. This troubles me deeply as a Republican, but it troubles me even more as an American. Enough is enough.
