Thursday on Fox New Channel’s "America’s Election HQ," Pinal Co. AZ Sheriff Paul Babeu said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is making "illegals and refugees" a priority and "not Americans. "   Babeu said, "I can tell you that Donald Trump was very clear as he always has been about a secure border, about this novel concept of enforcing the law for immigration, which is not happening now.   I think there is a clear difference with him making this a priority. Not just with illegal immigrants, or the drug cartels, but about ISIS —  about a clear, obvious threat from terrorists coming across this unsecured border.
