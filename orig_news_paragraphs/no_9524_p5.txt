the white, Christian,   family aspiring to suburban serenity and accomplishing   security —  is fast becoming a minority. That’s why John Kasich prevails only in Ohio and Ted Cruz cannot win primaries outside a few southern and   states or quite white Wisconsin. Campaign talk of tax cuts, free trade, bans on abortion and gay marriage, and repealing Obamacare may appeal to the keepers of   orthodoxy at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference but simply has little resonance with voters earning too little to pay meaningful federal income taxes, or afford more expensive necessities at   a decent home or health insurance without a $5000 deductible. History teaches that frustrated expectations and rising inequality —  falling average family incomes alongside   Wall Street traders and software developers earning vast sums —  is a highly combustible combination.
