Former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy on Sunday blamed the Black Lives Matter movement for the uptick in violent crime in this country. [During an interview with John Catsimatidis on AM 970 in New York, McCarthy blamed   brutality protests in Baltimore, Ferguson, and Charlotte for creating a "political atmosphere of   sentiment," according to the Hill.   " So whatâ€™s happening, and this is ironic, is that a movement with the goal of saving black lives at this point is getting black lives taken, because 80 percent of our murder victims here in Chicago are male blacks," McCarthy said.
