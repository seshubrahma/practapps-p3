Diaz’s landlord, Schwab Properties, is allowing the family to break their lease without a penalty or move to another Schwab property in another part of town. Diaz created a GoFundMe page that raised $2, 942 in donations as of Saturday afternoon to relocate her family and pay her attorney’s fees. She says she plans to sue the person who posted her address on Facebook.
