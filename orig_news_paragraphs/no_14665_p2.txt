Hernandez had been locked up for 20 days after being arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during a sweep that targeted another person. Hernandez remained in detention because of two DUIs and faced possible deportation.   But on Wednesday, he was released on a $3, 000 bond issued by a federal immigration court in Missouri.   According to The New York Times, which observed the proceedings, Hernandezâ€™s case was bolstered by letters from community leaders.
