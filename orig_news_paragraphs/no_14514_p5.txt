" Bolton, a controversial figure who had to secure a recess appointment to serve as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations after failing to win Senate confirmation, is emerging as a strong favorite among political staffers on the NSC. While there is a lot of affection for Kellogg, the current NSC chief of staff, supporters believe that Bolton brings a mix of   credentials that fit Trump’s political temperament and   knowledge of Washington and how the foreign policy process works, a senior administration official said. The official said Bolton is close to both CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Pence, who is "extremely powerful at this point" and so may have some sway on who gets the job.
