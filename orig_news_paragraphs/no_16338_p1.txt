The protest was a reference to Khizr Khan’s   condemnation of Trump at the Democratic National Convention last week. Khan is the father of a   soldier who was killed in action in the Iraq War. The seven protesters held up pocket copies of the Constitution issued by the American Civil Liberties Union. It was not immediately clear whether the demonstrators were affiliated with a particular organization.
