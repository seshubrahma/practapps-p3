He likewise does not seem to be playing a central role in the few     decisions that the Trump administration has made:    He does not appear to have been consulted before      Security Advisor Michael Flynn took the White House podium to   announce that Iran was now "on notice" not to conduct further   provocative missile tests; there is no evidence that his advice   was sought when Trump huddled with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo   Abe in January after a North Korean missile launch; nor does he   appear to have been involved in Trump’s equivocation on whether   he still supported a   solution in the Middle East. Most   dramatically, he has not been able to stave off Trump’s proposal   for deep cuts in the budget for diplomacy and foreign aid.
