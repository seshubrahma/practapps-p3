Marlow asked Gaffney about the significance of President Trump’s plan to move the U. S. embassy for Israel to Jerusalem. Gaffney described the   state of affairs as "bizarre," noting that Israel is the only country he knows of where the U. S. embassy isn’t located in the national capital. " The signals that Donald Trump has sent, in terms of his commitment to restore the kind of strong partnership and strategic alliance that we have historically had with Israel, is a signal, a statement, of his break with his predecessor," he said.
