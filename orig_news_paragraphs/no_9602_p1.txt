Archer City High School is comprised of about 83 percent white students. The chants were directed at students from Fort Hancock High School, a school located along the   border east of El Paso. That school is said to be 97 percent Hispanic, the San Antonio   reported.   Students from the   school were offended by what they believed were racially motivated chants to "build a wall," a reference to   Donald Trumpâ€™s pledge to secure the U. S.  border.
