Live Action’s investigators seeking "  care" contacted 97 Planned Parenthood clinics across the country and were told at 92 of them that "  services" were not available. Similarly, investigators discovered that Planned Parenthood staff members admitted ultrasounds are only done prior to abortions and not for   care. " The reality is Planned Parenthood’s focus for pregnant women is abortion," Live Action President Lila Rose said at a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday.
