The group had solicited the owners of Florida buildings it highlighted as great architecture, including Mr. Trump’s    estate in Palm Beach, which was honored as the top historic structure in the state. In return for their donations, the owners "got great publicity," said Vicki Long, the association’s vice president and chief executive. The same year, foundation tax records show, it gave $50, 000 to the Child Mind Institute in New York, which bought Mr. Trump and his wife seats at the organization’s gala dinner. They also attended a gala for Operation Smile, a nonprofit that treats cleft palates and lips, and to which the foundation gave $100, 000.
