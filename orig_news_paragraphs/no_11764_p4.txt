This convention is no     event, either. Currently, no GOP primary candidate has secured enough delegates to sail through the nomination process, and there is such resistance to Donald Trump’s candidacy within the party that there’s lots of talk about a potential contested convention. That means not only will there be the protesters you normally see at any political event, but there could be protesters from separate factions of the Republican Party itself. Planting this idea continues the "blame the victim" reporting of media outlets that Republicans such as Donald Trump are to black for disruptions at their events.
