US   officials accept barely    of refugees who start the vetting process, according to the   UNHCR. ’ ’    Bryan Scott Hicks, an   immigration lawyer who works   with resettled refugee families, said he has seen cases where   refugees were denied resettlement simply because they may have   once offered food to someone considered a terrorist. Refugee   officers consider that providing "material support" to terrorism   and immediately deny them entry.
