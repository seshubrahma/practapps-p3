Washington (CNN)   Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials. The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.   Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed.
