Ryan, a supporter of the "Gang of Eight" style of amnesty bill and comprehensive immigration reform in whatever shape it comes, has had to claim to the voters of his own district that he wants border security and more immigration enforcement. Like the trade claims, Ryan’s campaign’s statements are easily proven to be a farce.
