Later today, we will make history again with the opening of a new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology   â€”   located right here, in this central part of the Islamic World. This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that   countries must take the lead in combatting radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for this strong demonstration of leadership. I have had the pleasure of welcoming several of the leaders present today to the White House, and I look forward to working with all of you.
