But our lawmakers in D. C. and our political system in D. C. and our lobbyists in D. C. have become so desensitized to the abuse of Americans that that horrendous slaughter, in broad daylight in the streets of San Francisco, was not enough to stir our political class to meaningful, sustained action. That death was not enough to stir to action Washington, D. C. If you want to stay with that system, if you want to double down on that kind of failure, then there are candidates in this race who can give you that kind of failure for four or eight more years. But if you want to end the fever grip of special interests, and the pollution of donors and lobbyists on our political system, then you have one choice.
