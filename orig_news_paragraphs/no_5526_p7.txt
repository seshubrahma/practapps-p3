April 26, 2017,  CODEPINK bills itself as supporting "peace and human rights initiatives" and says itâ€™s "against racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, ageism, and other forms of oppression and prejudice. " Ironically, the group is vehemently opposed to the only true democracy in the Middle East: Israel. Israel is the only nation in the region where there is religious freedom for all, women have equal rights, members of the LGBTQ community can live in peace and free from fear of persecution and death, and Arabs, Africans and minority groups who hold citizenship enjoy full rights.
