WASHINGTON   â€”    After George W. Bush twice carried the New Hampshire county that includes   Manchester and Nashua, President Obama turned the tables and won it in both his elections by similar margins. Mr. Bush handily captured the Ohio county that includes Cincinnati and its mostly white suburbs in 2004, while Mr. Obama won there running away in 2012.
