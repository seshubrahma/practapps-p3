It is both a slick modern television network, dressed up with great visuals and stylish presenters, and a content farm that helps feed the European far right.

A recent evening featured reports of Britain refusing to condemn human rights violations in Bahrain and a "mainstream media firestorm" over Attorney General Jeff Sessionsâ€™s chats with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
