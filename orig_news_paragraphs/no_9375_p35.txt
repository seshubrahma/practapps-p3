Howley, this reporter and the Rubio staffers conversed over the course of several emails about that. Charlie Spiering, Breitbart’s White House reporter who is credentialed by the White House Correspondents’ Association, was credentialed by Sen. Rubio’s campaign to cover one of his campaign events in Las Vegas, Nevada, in December. Rubio did an exclusive interview with Spiering at that event as well. Oh hey, it’s my @marcorubio credential from December pic.
