This is partly a matter of   analysis: total up the time and money spent on Obamacare compliance, divide by the number of people who were truly   by   insurance, and you could afford to not only cover those peoples’ insurance needs but buy each one of them a   car. Research produced late in the Obamacare debate showed that   was never as big of a problem as we were led to believe  —   certainly not a $1, 000 secret tax, or a problem big enough to justify the costs in dollars and liberty imposed by the Affordable Care Act. It was easy for Democrats to exaggerate the size of the problem because the insurance industry and its lobbyists have always pushed   mythology as a convenient excuse for high insurance premiums. Everyone involved in dumping Obamacare on us knew   was a seemingly logical argument they could sell to a vast number of moderate voters.
