In response to reports of his meetings with Kislyak, Sessionsâ€™ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said there was nothing "misleading about his answer" to Congress because he "was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign    not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee. " Sessions also strongly denied ever discussing   issues with anyone from Russia. "
