Thereâ€™s an annual cap of 85, 000 new visas for requested   workers. When the requests exceed the supply, the visas are distributed by lottery to employers, who then use the visas they win to import the   workers for roughly six years. But the Clinton foundation is exempt from the annual limit, which also does not apply to   universities or their corporate partners. That exemption means the foundation likely was able to get a   worker for every approved request.
