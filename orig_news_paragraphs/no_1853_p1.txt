But after Tuesday’s election, the states bordering the Pacific Ocean feel increasingly like an island unto its own. While large parts of the American electoral map, particularly in the industrial Rust Belt, turned more Republican in Tuesday’s election, California went more Democratic, with 61. 5 percent of voters choosing Hillary Clinton, the highest percentage for a Democratic presidential nominee since the   of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. On social policies, the election made the Rockies look more like a border than a mountain range. In a raft of ballot measures, voters embraced causes like bilingual education, stricter gun control and taxes on sugary drinks.
