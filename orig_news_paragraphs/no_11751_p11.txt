As for this coming Tuesday, Sununu said of Kasich’s best opportunities, "I think Pennsylvania is going to be a very good state for him. Maryland in a weird state, they give them out by Congressional Districts, I think we’ll win at least 2 or 3 congressional districts in Maryland. And then the New England states. We’ll win delegates in both Rhode Island and Connecticut. "
