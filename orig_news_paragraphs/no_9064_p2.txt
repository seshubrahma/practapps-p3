the winner of a state wins that state’s electoral votes on Election Day in the general election.   The reliably red Republican states —   Alaska, Idaho, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, West Virginia, and South Carolina —  are all expected to easily vote for Trump for president. That totals 164 electoral votes.
