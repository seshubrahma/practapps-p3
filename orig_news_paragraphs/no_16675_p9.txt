Enter Trump. Working class white voters have been critical to Trump’s success. Throughout the Republican primaries, Trump’s victories were bolstered by support from whites without degrees. Across 28 states with exit or entrance polls this spring, Trump averaged 50% support among white   GOP primary voters or caucus participants, compared with 37% among whites with college degrees.
