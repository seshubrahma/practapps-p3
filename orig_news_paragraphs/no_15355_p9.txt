Sessions says he detests the Klan and white nationalism, and that all claims of racism are a distortion of the truth. But so far Sessions has not disappointed his supporters. Although there is no evidence for it, he has attributed an increase in violent crime to a lack of respect for police officers, claiming "in recent years law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable deeds of a few bad actors."   Further, Sessions has made it clear that he will take a step back and review the more than 20 consent decrees governing over 20 cities in the US.
