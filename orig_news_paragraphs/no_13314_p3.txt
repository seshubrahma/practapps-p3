On the other hand, Pew Research Center had a poll in April that showed American opinions on immigrants sharply improving over the last 20 years, with only 33% describing them as a "burden" now, as opposed to 63% who felt that way in 1994. Pew found a sharp partisan divide on the issue, with Republican and Democrat views beginning to "diverge" around 2006, as a growing percentage of Democrats and   independents began saying "immigrants strengthen the country," while the opinions of Republicans and   independents remained largely unchanged. Pew also detected a much larger generation gap in opinion than A. T.   Group did, with millennial approval for immigrants positively skyrocketing from 59 percent to 76 percent since 2013, while older cohorts gave approval ratings over 20 points lower. Some pollsters have argued that immigration approval tends to rise and fall with public perception of the economy, on the theory that people are less concerned with immigration problems when a roaring economy is producing plenty of jobs.
