This allowed Temple to be paid for their inpatient care, but often not for the care they needed after being discharged. " We donâ€™t know that that program would come back," Mr. Lux said, adding that the program used to pay for about $23 million a year worth of care provided at Temple University Hospital. Mr. Colston, who was still returning daily to Temple for intravenous antibiotics a month after his discharge, would have qualified to have most of his inpatient costs met under the old   program.
