That bill, the Utah Public Lands Initiative, would have also opened up thousands of acres nearby to mining or development. It affected far more than the buttes, though. Bishop described it as a kind of "grand bargain" to decide the fate of 18 million acres in southern and eastern Utah. Under the bill, huge expanses of wilderness in the state would have received lasting federal protection, other expanses would be opened up to development and extraction â€”  and, in return, the federal government would permanently lose the ability to set aside new national monuments in seven Utah counties.
