The Republican Party does not need any of those groups to vote for them in order to win, but it does need white women’s support.    It is virtually impossible for Trump to win without a strong majority of white women’s votes.   and other Republicans cannot win elections without white women going to the polls and casting Republican ballots. Republicans are alive to this    they get it.   We know that either Trump does not care or does not get it because of his first apology, and his second one.
