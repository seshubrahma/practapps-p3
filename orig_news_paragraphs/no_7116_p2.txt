The U. S. mining industry had not reported profits since the third quarter of 2014 when it cited profits of  $10. 258 billion. The most profitable quarter for the U. S. mining industry in the 16 years the U. S. Census tracked profits and losses for the mining industry was in the third quarter of 2008, when it cited $31. 376 billion in profits. There is more evidence of a resurgence in the mining industry than just the numbers.
