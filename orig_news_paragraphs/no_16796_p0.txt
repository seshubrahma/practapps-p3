Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton expressed sympathy earlier this year for Bernie Sanders supporters who "are living in their parents’ basement" who were attracted to his "false promise" because they are "children of the Great Recession. " The comments were posted late Friday by the conservative website Washington Free Beacon, which says it obtained the audio from a Clinton campaign staffer’s hacked email.
