That is not what independent analysts concluded after analyzing the tax proposal Mr. Trump made during his campaign, which would reduce the income tax rate on the wealthiest families from its current 39. 6 percent to 33 percent. In that plan,   families would see a 0. 8 percent increase in their   income, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, while the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see a 10. 2 to 16 percent gain. Another group, the Tax Policy Center, calculated   families would get a 1. 8 percent boost in   income, while the top 0. 1 percent of earners would see a 14 percent gain and a tax cut worth an average of $1. 1 million.
