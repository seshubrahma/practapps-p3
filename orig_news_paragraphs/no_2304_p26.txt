The cliché rings true that all art is imitation, and "Famous" was heavily inspired by Vincent Desiderio’s "Sleep," which was based on Jackson Pollock’s "Mural" painting. And though "Famous" wasn’t built by Mr. West’s own hand, the concept and direction were his own. Ask others who borrow liberally  —   such as Werner Herzog or Mr. Desiderio   —
