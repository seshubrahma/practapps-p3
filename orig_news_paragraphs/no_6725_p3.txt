The agency followed that up with two additional tweets saying, "These reports create mass panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger," and "Any groups falsely reporting such activities are doing a disservice to those they claim to support. " "The focus of these targeted enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICEâ€™s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis," DHS spokesperson Gillian Christensen told the New York Times. DHS Secretary John F. Kelly issued a statement that read, in part, "Of those arrested, approximately 75 percent were criminal aliens, convicted of crimes including, but not limited to, homicide, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual assault of a minor, lewd and lascivious acts with a child, indecent liberties with a minor, drug trafficking, battery, assault, DUI and weapons charges.
