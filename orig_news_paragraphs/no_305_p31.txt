In an   post on Twitter, Mr. Trump expressed outrage that Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst whose sentence for leaking American secrets was commuted by Mr. Obama, had criticized the 44th president for not being strong enough. Even though Mr. Trump repeatedly characterized Mr. Obama the same way during last year’s campaign  —   "weak attitude and pathetic president," "so weak and so bad," "he’s been weak, he’s been ineffective "  —   he evidently thought Ms. Manning was ungracious to do so.
