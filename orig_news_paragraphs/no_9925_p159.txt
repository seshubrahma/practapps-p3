Dirty tricks, after all, are the modus operandi in our nationâ€™s Capitol. It is a dirty trick to say you are "reducing spending," when all you are doing is simply not spending as much as you could have spent or wanted to spend. It was a dirty trick when the Democrats decided to use a procedural technique to "deem" Obamacare to have been passed, even though the Senate and the House never voted on the same bill. And it was a dirty trick for Republicans to campaign on repealing Obamacare, but then simply sit back in Congress while the law went into effect.
