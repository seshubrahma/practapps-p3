Some members have said they will be protesting in Washington and in their districts instead.   Responding to a question from CNN’s Michelle Kosinski, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that he believed the boycotts were "a reflection of the division in the country right now" and said members of Congress are "freer to express their opinion" than administration officials. Asked if members of the Obama administration would boycott the inauguration if they could, Earnest said he "wouldn’t speculate on what people around here would say. "
