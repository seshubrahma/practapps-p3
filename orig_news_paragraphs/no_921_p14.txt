By the time his public corruption unit had won the convictions of Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos, Mr. Bharara had successfully prosecuted a dozen current or former state legislators, as well as 15 local officials, party leaders, political consultants and   including two current or former New York City Council members. Only one was acquitted. Not all of Mr. Bharara’s public corruption inquiries led to criminal charges, most notably his sweeping examination of Mr. Cuomo’s abrupt shutdown in March 2014 of an anticorruption commission that the governor had formed with great fanfare just nine months earlier. A Times investigation published in July 2014 showed that before disbanding the panel, known as the Moreland Commission, Mr. Cuomo had hobbled its work, intervening when it focused on groups with ties to the governor or on issues that might reflect poorly on him.
