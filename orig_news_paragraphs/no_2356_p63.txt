Friends wondered whether the marriage had reached its breaking point. But weeks later, Mrs. Clinton told her friend Ms. Blair that "they’re connected in every way imaginable, she feels strongly about him and family and Chelsea and marriage, and she’s just got to try to work it through," according to Ms. Blair’s personal writings, which her family gave to the University of Arkansas after her death in 2000. While Mrs. Clinton considered the Lewinsky affair a "personal lapse" by her husband, she gave him credit for trying to break it off and manage someone who was a "narcissistic loony toon," according to Ms. Blair’s papers. Soon after, Mrs. Clinton expressed pleasure to her friend that she and her husband were able to drive "their adversaries totally nuts" because they did not appear to be suffering.
