—   two audiences with which Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. While Mr. Trump is not ready to give up entirely on any of the major battlegrounds, advisers have become increasingly convinced that his most plausible route to the presidency, and perhaps his only realistic victory scenario, involves capturing all three of the biggest contested electoral prizes on the map, and keeping North Carolina in the Republican column. Mr. Trump and his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, are expected to campaign intensively across those four   states, with Mr. Trump trumpeting a set of blunt slogans through mass media and Mr. Pence focused on shoring up support from conservatives and    whites. There is no imminent plan, Trump advisers say, to match Mrs. Clinton’s spending on television ads.
