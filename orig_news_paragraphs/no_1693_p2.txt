The failure to be invited to the Sept. 26 debate at Hofstra University deals a significant blow to Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein, who are desperate for national exposure to promote their   bids for the White House. Their running mates will also not be allowed to participate in the   debate on Oct. 4, the commission said. Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein were excluded because they did not reach an average of 15 percent support in the five national polls that the commission used as a benchmark. Mr. Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico who is polling in   in many state polls, reached 8. 4 percent and Ms. Stein reached 3. 2 percent.
