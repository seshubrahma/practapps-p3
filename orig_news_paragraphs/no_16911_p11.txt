There is no pending lawsuit or apparent grounds for a court order or subpoena. If someone does try to subpoena the companyâ€™s footage, courts can "quash" or modify a subpoena if it requires disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. There must be a substantial need for the material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship. If   insists this is "important proprietary information," they must establish they have historically sought to maintain the confidentiality of this information.
