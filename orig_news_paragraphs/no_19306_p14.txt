With two wildly unpopular candidates this cycle,       candidates who by nature of their   unpopularity have       run campaigns of personal destruction against their opponent,        it’s natural that these undecideds would frame the decision       as a matter of which contemptible personage they could       tolerate for four years.      ’ ’       None saw any aspect of the election as anywhere near       edifying. Jennifer Meador, a    homemaker, described       the election as "embarrassing for our country," while Katie       Burak, a    financial planner, said she’s seen       nothing but "personal attacks" this year.
