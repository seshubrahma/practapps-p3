The two inspected dozens of rivers and selected a length of the Arkansas, partly because it was a popular rafting spot, and the canopied fabric, stretched over steel wire cables anchored on the banks, would be best seen from beneath, on the water itself. The project, expected to take more than two years to construct, was to remain in place for two weeks, during an August, before, like all of Christo and  â€™s projects, being dismantled. In court, Christo argued that he had taken every step possible to prevent   damage to the river, land around it, or animal or plant life.
