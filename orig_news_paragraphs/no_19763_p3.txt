Betsy DeVos is an outstanding nominee who has complied with all of the committee’s requirements and no one doubts that she will be confirmed as education secretary," a Senate GOP aide said late Monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity. An aide to Senator Murray said the Democrat "is hopeful that this additional time will allow Ms. DeVos to complete the required ethics paperwork in time for the Office of Government Ethics to submit it to the HELP Committee before her hearing. " Even with the delay in DeVos’ hearing, as many as three top Cabinet picks will receive confirmation hearings this week without having completed financial disclosure reports and ethics agreements.
