If the right fails to do that, we end up with Obama’s America —  or Hillary’s America. In fact, today, it’s an open question as to whether or not the   coalition —  greens, multiculturalists, plus George Soros and Al Sharpton —  are even interested in economic growth and development. So that’s a huge opportunity for Republicans, should they choose to seize it. Seizing it, of course, would require a return to the Hamiltonian policies that guided such Republican presidents as Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower.
