I propose that Meryl Steep, Chelsea Handler, Richard Gere, Robert DeNiro, Christoph Waltz and others lead an Oscar first: let’s do away with the rules, barriers, and tickets to the Oscars and   such as the swanky Vanity Fair party or the Weinsteins’   affair. I ask all migrants, all illegal immigrant criminals and all   refugees to converge on Hollywood to come to the Oscars and all the   even those held at the mansions or the Chateau Marmont or anywhere else. After all, we in the Hollywood community want to show all Islamic extremists that we have love in our hearts
