Voters were not given the option of simply staying home and not voting. Last week, when a Rasmussen poll gave voters that option, Trump and Clinton were tied, taking 38 percent of the vote each.   Even with the "staying home" option removed, 20 percent of voters say they would support a third candidate or are undecided between Trump and Clinton. Obviously, one canâ€™t really remove the "stay home" option for voters.
