The ban was instigated after intelligence and law enforcement agencies determined that terrorists were working to place explosives inside laptop battery compartments in a way that would enable the devices to still power on in order to pass airport screenings, according to information shared with CNN. Intelligence officials received a   call in February 2016, when an operative from   an al Qaeda affiliate in Somali, detonated a laptop bomb on a Daallo Airlines flight from Mogadishu to Djibouti. The explosives were hidden in a part of the laptop where   had removed a DVD drive, according to investigators. Airport workers helped smuggle the bomb on the plane after it passed through an   machine.
