Trump and Pence’s offices did not respond to questions about the transition team lobbyist ban. What is clear is that some aides who were a key part of the effort are out. Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who was leading national security, was asked to leave the transition, and it was not clear who would replace him.   Two people working with Rogers were also out: Matthew Freedman, a former DIA innovation adviser and former Bush transition official, was focused on the National Security Council, and Kevin O’Connor, a former Bush administration official at the Department of Justice, was working on DOJ.
