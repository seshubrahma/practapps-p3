The Iranians who support the deal (moderates around Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif) say it is not up for debate and that the US cannot cancel it unilaterally. They also say that Trump not backing it shows that it is good for Iran. Iran’s Foreign minister says it will abide by the deal but the US has to do the same.   There are many in Iran, however, who don’t like the deal    mostly the religious conservatives and hardliners close to the Revolutionary Guard.
