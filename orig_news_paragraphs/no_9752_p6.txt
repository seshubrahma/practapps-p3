Tolerance of true diversity on university campuses  —   diversity of opinion and belief —   has been eroding for decades while alumni and trustees looked the other way. Conservative faculty have been weeded out by faculty hiring committees, and progressives have taken control of administrative functions as well as the faculty lounge. Meanwhile, generations of "loyal alumni" continue to send their checks to help subsidize the corrupt enterprise while worshiping the icons and memories of a different era. This epidemic of student demands for "safe places" to protect against threatening words and ideas would make a great science fiction film, but unbelievably, events seem to be outpacing the political imagination.
