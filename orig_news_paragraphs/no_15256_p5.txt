At the time of the fall, Russian media reported that Gorokhov was trying to winch a large bathtub up to his fourth floor apartment.   CNN visited the scene 24 hours later and a neighbor shared video shot with his cellphone shortly after the incident, showing an ambulance on scene and what looked like a pool of blood next to the upended bathtub.   Sergei Magnitsky, the independent Russian lawyer who initially exposed this massive alleged money laundering operation, died in a Russian prison in November 2009. Gorokhov, who has continued that private investigation on behalf of Magnitskyâ€™s family, is recovering from his fall, and has yet to speak publicly about what happened.
