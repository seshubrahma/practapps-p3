A second Mexican official emphasized that Mexico is not bound by a US presidential order and said there’s nothing the US can do to force the issue. This official pointed out that there is no bilateral agreement between the US and Mexico on having to take these immigrants. This official said that for more than two years, Mexico has been stopping Central American migrants before they reach the US    and added that this is one of the pieces of leverage they have. If Trump doesn’t stop these "orders," it will make it more difficult for Mexico to continue this cooperation, the official said.
