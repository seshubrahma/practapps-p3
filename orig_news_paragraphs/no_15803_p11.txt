At the same time as the Parliament attack was launched, a shooting spree and suicide bombing targeted the Ayatollah Khomeini mausoleum about 25 kilometers (15 miles) away, on the southern outskirts of the Iranian capital. Fars reported that one person was arrested at the tomb. Gruesome video footage from inside Iranâ€™s Parliament during the attack was published by Amaq and appears to have been filmed on a phone by one of the gunmen. The video opens by showing a quick shot of a man carrying an   rifle walking out of an office, while a bloodied body of a man lies on the office floor.
