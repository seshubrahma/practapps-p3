There have been, however, large fluctuations in the number of children and their families and unaccompanied children apprehended on the   border. Between fiscal years   there are there was a huge spike in the number of unaccompanied children and family unit subjects apprehended by Border Patrol. The trend slowed the following year, and apprehensions picked back up in the first half of fiscal year 2016 when there were almost as many unaccompanied children and family units apprehended as there were in all of fiscal year 2015. The reason that people are crossing the border is shifting, said Donald Kerwin, director of the Center for Migration Studies of New York.
