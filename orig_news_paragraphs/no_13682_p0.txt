London’s first elected Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, has accused U. S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump of "playing into the hands" of Islamic State terrorists. ["I’m really keen for Donald Trump to come to London, because Donald Trump, it appears to me, is under the impression that western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam," Mr. Khan told USA Today on Thursday.   " I want him to come to London to meet Londoners of Islamic faith who love being British, love being a Londoner, love being a Muslim" continued the man who became the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital in May.
