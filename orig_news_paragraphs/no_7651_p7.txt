Let me point out this, there’s a very strong model for that kind of action in the Constitution of the United States. The president’s cabinet, a majority of the president’s cabinet, can declare the president to be physically or mentally unfit to exercise the powers of his office, and immediately thereupon those powers are transferred to the vice president. Now if the president is conscious, he may appeal to the House, and that initiates another process of appeal. But the fact is, the president’s cabinet, a majority of them, can remove the president, effectively from office, at least temporarily.
