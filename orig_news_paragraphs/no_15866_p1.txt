Rodman would be arriving in Pyongyang at a time of heightened tension between Washington and Pyongyang, which is currently detaining four Americans. It’s unclear what the purpose of Rodman’s visit to the secretive country could be, but the eccentric former basketball player    and a former contestant on Donald Trump’s   reality TV show "Celebrity Apprentice"     is one of the only Americans to have met current North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. When asked by CNN journalists in Pyongyang, unnamed North Korean officials confirmed that Rodman is expected to arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday.
