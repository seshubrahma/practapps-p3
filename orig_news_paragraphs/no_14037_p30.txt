Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts, someone Trump described as an "an absolute disaster" during a campaign in which he insulted hundreds of people. After the oath, he gave a speech that most experts had predicted would do what inaugural addresses do, namely call for national unity, for healing the wounds of a   election. But no, Trumpâ€™s speech was a populist, nationalistic campaign screed, with   attacks on the outgoing administration, and a triumphalist tone that would have sounded routine eight decades ago in Europe.   An administration that starts under the cloud of investigations over interference by a foreign power, with disdain for conflicts of interest, and with a track record of lying to the American public, also begins with much of the nation determined to keep it in check.
