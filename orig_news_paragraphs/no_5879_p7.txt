The Trump administration is talking about using unprecedented sanctions to halt Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, potentially instituting what one official described to Reuters as "essentially a trade quarantine on North Korea. " The measures under consideration could include "an oil embargo, banning its airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang," according to the officials who spoke to Reuters. Other possibilities include interdicting North Korean freighters, prohibiting the use of North Korean contract labor abroad, implementing a global ban on coal, or banning North Korea’s seafood exports.
