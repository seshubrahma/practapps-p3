By "preserve" it really means "disseminate": officials spread evidence throughout other government agencies "to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators" and perhaps the media as well. In summary: the Obama administration sought, and eventually obtained, authorization to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found then relaxed the NSA rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government, virtually ensuring that the information, including the conversations of private citizens, would be leaked to the media. Levin called the effort a "silent coup" by the Obama administration and demanded that it be investigated. In addition, Levin castigated Republicans in Congress for focusing their attention on Trump and Attorney General Sessions rather than Obama.
