Counterdemonstrators chanted   slogans denouncing Trump. They carried signs proclaiming "Supporters of Trump are traitors to America" and "Freedom ends where harm begins."   Across the street, Trump supporters waved "Make America Great Again" signs and wore the corresponding red hats.   In addition to the arrests, a large pickup truck flying two large American flags cruised past hundreds of   protesters and honked its horn.
