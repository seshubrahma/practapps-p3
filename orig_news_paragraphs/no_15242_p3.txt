" "I see no data to support the notion that Gen. Flynn complied with the law," Chaffetz said, referring to whether Flynn received permission from the Pentagon or the State Department or that he disclosed the more than $45, 000 he was paid for a speech he gave to   in Russia.   Chaffetz said that the committee will send a letter now requesting information from the inspector general at the Department of Defense and the comptroller of the US Army to determine how they will handle news of Flynnâ€™s security clearance. One action, he said, may be seeking repayment of money from Flynn    possibly in the tens of thousands of dollars.
