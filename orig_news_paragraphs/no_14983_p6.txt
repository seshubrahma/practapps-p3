The revised forms specify nearly 30 entities that paid Flynn to give speeches during the same period, saying he received at least $250, 000 from individual companies, groups and speakers bureaus for the work. Fourteen of those speeches were arranged by Leading Authorities, the bureau Flynn listed on his initial disclosure. The agency set him up with the three speeches to Russian groups, as well as talks to a slew of other companies and organizations, such as Wells Fargo and the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce. Flynn also left some speeches off his initial forms that donâ€™t appear to be linked to Leading Authorities or another speakers bureau.
