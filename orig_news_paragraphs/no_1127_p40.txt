An online poll done in Britain following the   bombings, for example, showed that more than a fifth of British Muslims felt some sympathy for the bombers’ feelings and motives more than half said they could understand the bombers’ behavior and nearly a third agreed that "Western society is decadent and immoral and that Muslims should seek to bring it to an end" by nonviolent means. One incredible Gallup report from 2009 found that 0 percent of British Muslims viewed homosexual acts as morally acceptable. Though it is not at all clear what pushes any given individual to cross the line into violence, attitudes like these are what Nawaz and Quilliam have controversially described as the "mood music" to terrorist acts. It is this last contention that seems to be the crux of the S. P. L. C. complaint against Nawaz, along with the disclosure that, in 2010, Quilliam provided a list of nonviolent "Islamist" organizations to a British counterterrorism official.
