Unfortunately, the campaign finished short of its $2, 000 fundraising goal. As a result, the "Terps for Trump" were forced to cancel the event. This event has been cancelled by Terps For Trump due to the school rasing costs for the venue and security at the second. Our organization cannot the $6, 500 it will now cost to put on the event (Milo was coming for $0, these are 100% costs the school wants to run the event).
