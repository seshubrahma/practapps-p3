Since September, the Obama administration has blocked construction on a critical section where the pipeline would burrow underneath a dammed section of the Missouri River that tribes say sits near sacred burial sites. The tribe and activists are pushing Mr. Obama to order up a yearslong environmental review or otherwise block the project before he leaves office.    Donald J. Trump said on Friday that he supported finishing the $3. 7 billion pipeline. Nobody here knows what to expect.
