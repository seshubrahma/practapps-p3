Mr. Ginsberg says that the laws are murky here, with voters technically picking "electors" who are bound in some states to whoever is the nominee and in other states to the specific candidates. Ideally for the party, votes cast for Mr. Trump would go to the new nominee, but that would probably be subject to litigation. " It is an exercise of lawyersâ€™ fantasies to imagine the litigation that would take place," Mr. Ginsberg said.
