VICE PRINCIPALSâ€™ (HBO) To like this series, you need to be able to tolerate two very unlikable lead characters. They are vice principals played by Danny R. McBride and the great Walton Goggins, enemies who band together to take on their new boss. The humor is often crass, and the lead characters have exceedingly foul mouths, but over all the series is an amusingly caustic variation on both the teenage comedy and the bromance genre.
