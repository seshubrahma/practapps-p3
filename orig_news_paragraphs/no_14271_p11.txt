While Haley’s remarks echoed many speeches delivered by the Obama administration’s UN ambassador, Russia’s Ambassador to the UN Vitaly Churkin told reporters that he thinks "there is a change in tone" with the new US administration. He added that he wasn’t surprised by Haley’s speech. Some analysts see the surge in fighting as a Russian test of US resolve or perhaps an attempt to send Ukraine a message that after years of Obama administration support, the Trump administration will be more friendly to Moscow than Kiev.   Fighting between   rebels from the   Donetsk People’s Republic and the Ukrainian army exploded a day after Trump had his first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday.
