The Highlander was later spotted tucked away at a service entrance in a garage under the   building where the fundraiser was being held.   When security asked two reporters to leave the garage, another reporter with the local Boston station NECN hid in a stairwell. He saw luggage from the Highlander being moved into another SUV, before both cars exited the garage through a back entrance. The intrigue took a dark turn later in the day when news broke of a shooting in Munich, Germany.
