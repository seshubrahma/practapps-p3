The same "genius" pundits who thought Trump may have a tough time qualifying for the first debate are incessantly repeating talking points about Trump’s "ceiling" and what they claim will be his inability to win over moderates and independents. But not only is Trump bringing in new voters into the political process like Obama did in 2008, one can make the argument that Trump is accomplishing what the GOP establishment tried to argue that Rubio would do best —  win over Tea Party conservatives and moderate Republicans: This argument, which has been floating out there today, strikes me as lazy and thin. https:  .    —   Brett LoGiurato (@BrettLoGiurato)
