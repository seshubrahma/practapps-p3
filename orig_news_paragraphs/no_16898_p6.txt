Two senior government officials    former Christie Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly and Port Authority Deputy Director Bill Baroni     were indicted in May 2015. Both were indicated as part of the Bridgegate scheme, receiving charges of conspiracy and fraud, among others.   The case against Kelly and Baroni was taken to court late September, where federal prosecutors alleged in their opening statements that Christie, along with his confidants, had knowledge of the closures.   The Bergen County Prosecutorâ€™s Office now holds jurisdiction, according to Brendis Wrigley with the Bergen Superior Court Municipal Division.
