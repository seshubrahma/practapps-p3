We will make decisions based on   outcomes  —   not inflexible ideology. We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms  —   not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection —  and to make allies of all who share our goals.
