And Montana, too? Nate I think he’s a very clear favorite in North Dakota, a caucus, and Montana, an open primary in the Mountain West. He’s a somewhat more modest favorite in South Dakota, but Clinton overperformed a bit in caucuses in neighboring Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Wyoming, so I wouldn’t completely write off a Clinton win in a primary there.
