What’s different about Popovich’s rant, as opposed to Kerr’s and Van Gundy’s, is that instead of mostly confining his criticisms to Trump, "Pop" makes a point of going after Trump’s supporters. Probably not a great move, considering Popovich lives and works in a state that Trump won by nearly ten percent.
