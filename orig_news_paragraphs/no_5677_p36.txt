In Cairo, President Obama used the word an even more whopping ZERO times. Obama described   as an "enormous trauma" rather than a terrorist atrocity, opting to deploy the word "extremism" 11 times in his speech, which President Trump also used nine times. As a result, Obama lacked action points, policy goals, or anything of substance when it came to tacking terrorism. President Trump on the other hand announced the formulation of the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, insisting: "Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion".
