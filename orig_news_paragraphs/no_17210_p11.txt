The US Embassy in Havana is one of the few diplomatic missions in the Cuban capital that has not lowered its flag to   to mark Castro’s death.    Trump has slammed Obama’s policy and promised a tougher line on Cuba. " If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the   people and the US as a whole, I will terminate deal," Trump tweeted on Sunday.
