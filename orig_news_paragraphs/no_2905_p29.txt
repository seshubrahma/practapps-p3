Mr. Trump’s aides have said he will give a speech on immigration next week in Arizona   —   an address originally set for this week but delayed as he grappled with precisely what he would say. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he would deport only "the bad ones" while letting   undocumented immigrants stay is quite similar to the approach announced by Mr. Obama in November 2014, when he directed the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize its immigration enforcement on violent criminals and people who have crossed the border illegally multiple times. His statement about payment of "back taxes" is also very similar to the president’s "deferred action" proposals, which would have required millions of immigrants in the country illegally to pay taxes, among other things, in exchange for legal protections.
