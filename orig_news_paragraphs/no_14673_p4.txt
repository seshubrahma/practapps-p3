Sessions acted after it emerged that he had failed at his Senate confirmation hearing to disclose two   meetings with Russia’s ambassador to Washington, at a time when Moscow was accused of interfering in the presidential race. " I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States," Sessions told reporters. Later Thursday night, on Fox News, Sessions said he plans to submit a "supplement" to the record of his congressional testimony, detailing the meetings he didn’t mention at the time.
