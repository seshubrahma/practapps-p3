: Muir asks Rubio about his "Gang of Eight" bill and asks if he fought for his legislation or did he run from it. Rubio says we cannot get that legislation passed because Americans will not support any type of amnesty legislation until the border is secured because people  have "zero trust" in the federal government to enforce the laws. He says the "key that unlocks the door" to comprehensive amnesty legislation is actually enforce the law and hire border agents and finish   while putting in place   tracking system. He says Americans will support a "reasonable" and "responsible" approach to legalizing illegal immigrants.
