â€”   and at least seven other people can be seen brandishing a number of weapons, including rifles, pistols and a   shotgun, according to Baton Rouge ABC affiliate WBRZ. When authorities examined the video, they noticed similarities between the weapons being waved around and weapons that had been stolen from a local Meaux Guns and Ammo store last July. A Baton Rouge police spokesman told the outlet that a stolen Ruger being brandished in the video was particularly easy to identify because it had been customized before it was stolen. Davis was arrested on June 3 and charged with three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of illegal possession of a firearm, according to WBRZ.
