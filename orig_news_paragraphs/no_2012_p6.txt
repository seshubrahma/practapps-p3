Mr. Bolton met with Mr. Trump on the day he took the phone call from Ms. Tsai. Later, he said the United States "should shake up the relationship" with China. Mr. Trump himself seemed to take umbrage at the suggestion that he needed China’s approval to speak with Ms. Tsai. In two posts on Twitter, he wrote: "Did China ask us if it was O. K. to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete) heavily tax our products going into their country (the U. S. doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?
