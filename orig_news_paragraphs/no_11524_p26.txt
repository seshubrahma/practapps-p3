Trump says nobody discusses the 5, 000 killings in Chicago since Obama became President. He promises to build the wall and keep out refugees before discussing the need for a "smart" foreign policy. He says we should have left some troops in Iraq and says we should have taken the oil like he has been saying from the beginning. Trump also says he was opposed to the Iraq War.
