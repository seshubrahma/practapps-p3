One day after Netanyahu’s first meeting with Greenblatt, Trump’s envoy met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. According to a readout of that meeting, Abbas stressed the Palestinian commitment to a   solution, while Greenblatt emphasized Trump’s desire for peace through direct negotiations. The statement mentioned the possibility of a meeting in Washington between Abbas and Trump    which would only ratchet up the pressure on Netanyahu to make concessions if Abbas presents himself as a partner for peace, willing to compromise for the sake of an agreement. Israel’s right, however, wants to move in the other direction.
