Dr. Mitchell was first publicly identified as one of the architects of the C. I. A. â€™s "enhanced interrogation" program nearly a decade ago, and has given some news media interviews, but is now providing a more detailed account of his involvement. His book, "Enhanced Interrogation: Inside the Minds and Motives of the Islamic Terrorists Trying to Destroy America" (Crown Forum) was written with Bill Harlow, a former C. I. A. spokesman. It was reviewed by the agency before release. (The New York Times obtained a copy of the book before its publication date.)
