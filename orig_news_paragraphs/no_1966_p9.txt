During the George W. Bush administration, a C. I. A. contractor was convicted in the death of an Afghan detainee at an American military base in Afghanistan. Henry F. Schuelke, a Washington lawyer with the firm Blank Rome, who represents Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen, said that he believed his clients "were left holding the bag" while C. I. A. officials involved in the program have been protected from the lawsuit. " The government and its officers, namely many of the C. I. A. officers, enjoy sovereign immunity," Mr. Schuelke said in an interview.
