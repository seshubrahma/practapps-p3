Wages are going up dramatically, but it is not adding even one person to the workforce," Nassif complained.    "All it does is encourage people who are farmworkers to play musical chairs by going from farmer to farmer, seeking higher wages, and the farmers are competing with each other [for American and illegal workers] by raising those wages," he said during a   press conference by   lobbyists for a 2017 amnesty. That type of     hasn’t existed in the United States since the late 1990s, and it is an indirect validation of Donald Trump’s     economic policy, as described in his speeches and   policy paper. Support from   and   Americans for that   labor reform has fueled his unorthodox campaign, despite furious   opposition from business groups and urban professionals who profit from cheap labor policies.
