People like that think that "working class white voters" is a descriptor of who we are as a socioeconomic group, with a dash of race and political functionality. " Working class (white) voters" are machinists, assemblers, machine operators, mechanics, nurse’s aides, waitresses, small retail store managers, bus drivers, taxi drivers, truck drivers, and all the jobs that they wouldn’t dare do themselves, being so much smarter than the rest of us (doubtful they know which end of a wrench to use).
