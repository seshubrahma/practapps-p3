A peace agreement signed in 2015 between the two leaders calmed the violence. However clashes resumed on July 8 of this year, with around 300 people killed.    Nearly 122, 000 refugees have fled South Sudan since this latest fighting, adding to the more than 2. 5 million people who have been displaced since  2013, according to the UNâ€™s refugee agency UNHCR. Both sides of the conflict have been accused atrocities, which include the use of rape as a weapon of war, attacks on civilians, and the recruitment of child soldiers.
