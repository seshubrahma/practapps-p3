Ninety minutes before the debate, Trump held a surprise event with three women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and one woman who was 12 when Hillary Clinton was the   defendant for the man she said raped her. Trump also invited them into the debate hall as his guests. And he attacked Clinton over her husband’s behavior during the debate.    "What he’s done to women, there’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation who’s been so abusive to women," Trump said of Bill Clinton.
