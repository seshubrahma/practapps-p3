But it is also true that there is no consensus on what other "obstacles " there are, or how many there are, or how much of an "obstacle" the settlements are, or why only Israeli and not Palestinian settlements, and whether the Israeli settlements, which actually cover only 1. 7 percent of the disputed West Bank territory, are in fact a necessary bargaining chip for Israel to hold when dealing with an opponent that still refuses to recognize its very right to exist.   And it is equally true that Israel has already given back the vast majority of the land it regained that 98 percent of Palestinians in the West Bank already live under Palestinian, not Israeli rule and that recent    moves by Israel, including uprooting Israeli settlements, has led to more violence, and not peace.   Regardless, none of these political considerations make the legal argument( s) any different.
