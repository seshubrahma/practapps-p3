History has looked back on it as one of the more frothy     deals," said Jed Reagan, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm. The Kushners sold portions of the buildingâ€™s retail space on Fifth Avenue to investors, gave up a 49. 5 percent stake in the office space to Vornado Realty Trust and renegotiated the terms of the debt. But the building is still losing millions of dollars a year, in part because the owners were no longer leasing office space as it became vacant in preparation for a complete redevelopment of the property. Mr. Kushner and his father Charles began showing potential investors a "white book," which laid out their vision for tearing down the blocky building to make way for the much taller, glassier skyscraper designed by Ms. Hadid.
