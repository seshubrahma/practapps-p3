The main thrust of Mr. Trumpâ€™s plan involves a reordering of the tax code so working parents can take an income tax deduction for care of up to four children and   dependents. The deduction is available for individuals earning up to $250, 000, or $500, 000 for a married couple filing jointly. There would also be child care spending rebates as high as $1, 200 a year for families on the lower end of the income scale. That is an amount that some critics called inadequate given that the cost of child care in some states is $10, 000 to $20, 000 a year.
