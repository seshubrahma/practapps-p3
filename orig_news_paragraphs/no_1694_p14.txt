The Tax Foundation says it would cost the government about $1 trillion over 10 years. On Thursday, Mr. Trump’s campaign initially indicated that it had decided to abandon that plan. Mr. Trump took the stage at the Waldorf Astoria, before the members of the Economic Club of New York, and declared that his new tax plan would cost just $2. 6 trillion, far less than the estimated $10 trillion price tag for the previous version of his plan. That estimated cost came from the Tax Foundation, which performed an analysis based on the specific changes detailed by the Trump campaign, including the elimination of the   tax cut, the Tax Foundation’s Mr. Cole said.
