Such power is something that President Trump might see as quite delicious, and something that he may well push for if Republicans confirm Judge Neil M. Gorsuch for the Supreme Court without meaningful support from Democrats. " There is not a single senator from the majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster," said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. He is expected to move this week to remove the   threshold to proceed with a vote on Judge Gorsuch’s nomination.
