—   Update on injuries , There has been an update on the number injured, bringing the figure of 60 injuries in addition to the 22 fatalities up to 120. The reason for this change is the previous figure only counted those who were treated in hospital  —   paramedics also treated an additional 60 "walking wounded" on the scene last night as well. Many of those who were admitted to hospital last night remain there, some in "critical" condition, with a reported third of injured under the age of 16.
