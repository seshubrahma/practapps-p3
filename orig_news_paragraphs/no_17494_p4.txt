The pair joined the race during the first week of May and their rise may reflect a   bump as much as it does any durable groundswell that will carry them to the GOP nomination. The Republican candidate will likely face Hillary Clinton in November 2016, who continues to enjoy a huge lead over her Democratic competitors in Thursdayâ€™s poll. Her closest competitor, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who held his first campaign rally this week, trails Clinton by more than 40 points. Americans, however, still say they do not find Clinton honest or trustworthy, character measures that Republicans see as a liability in a general election.
