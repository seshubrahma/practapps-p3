More than two hundred people protested at the Colorado State Capitol in Denver on Friday afternoon to call for justice after Ted Cruz won all 34 delegates at a Colorado caucus in which the people were not allowed to vote for president. [   A speaker who wished to remain anonymous delivered an address on the Capitol steps in front of approximately 200 people organized by the group Coloradans for Trump, which has an "invite only" Facebook page to protect the identities of its members from personal or professional consequences if they were outed as Trump supporters. The speaker railed against the organization at the state party convention, where   candidates for delegate were left off some ballots and at least one Trump supporter was prevented from voting.
