Irish golfer Rory McIlroy finds it is funny that the PGA removed the   Memorial Tournament from Donald Trump’s Doral resort near Miami and moved it to Mexico City. [After the PGA announced that after 53 years it was dumping Trump’s Florida property for Mexico City, McIlroy joked about the "wall" between Mexico and the U. S. that Trump has made a staple of his campaign for the GOP nomination for president.   " It’s quite ironic that we’re going to Mexico after being at Doral," McIlroy said according to CBS Sports.
