St. Petersburg, Florida (CNN) Hillary Clinton launched fresh attacks on Donald Trumpâ€™s business record and temperament on Monday, casting the businessman as a cheat who has repeatedly "stiffed" American workers and a person who appears to take "pleasure" in attacking protesters, journalists and a Gold Star family.   With Election Day exactly three months away, Clinton kicked off the week with campaign stops in the crucial battleground state of Florida. Speaking to supporters in St. Petersburg, the former secretary of state warned that her Republican opponent is a threat to both national security and the economy.
