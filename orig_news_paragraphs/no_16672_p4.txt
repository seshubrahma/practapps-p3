Clinton has, in fact, discussed terrorism. Earlier in the day, she touted her national security experience from serving as secretary of state, saying she would "launch an intelligence surge" and that she would put more into "training and intelligence they need to effectively prevent and respond to terrorist attacks."   Rather than the policies of President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration, which Trump argued are responsible for the threat of terrorism, Trump called once again for a radical rethinking of counterterrorism policies in the US. He emphasized the need for "extreme vetting" and again called for a ban on immigrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism    the latest iteration of his ban on Muslims    while arguing that "immigration security is national security."
