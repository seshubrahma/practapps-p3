History remembers the brave. It recalls those heroic Jewish fighters, the Maccabees, who faced down the Greeks who hoped to force them into religious conversion. It recalls Pope Leo the Great, who left his own safe space and faced down Atila the Hun, and by his courage saved Rome and the civilization she stood for. So let us fight, but let our motto be Risus et bellum, Laughter and war.
