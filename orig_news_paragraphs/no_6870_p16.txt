Growers who can’t raise wages are shedding employees and mechanizing, or switching to less   crops. For example, Jeff Klein, a   farmer in Stockton told the Los Angeles Times that "he’ll spend the next five years replacing his 1, 000 acres of grapevines with almond and olive trees, which require a fraction of the human contact to grow. " The market for farm labor is so tight that vineyards in Napa County are now paying farmworkers almost $42, 000 year, and other farmers are testing robotic machinery being developed in Silicon Valley:   …     strawberry growers in Ventura are experimenting with robots that plant seedlings, and growers in Central Coast counties are culling, weeding and even harvesting heads of lettuce with machines.
