Unfortunately for them, it was actually caught on tape, so we have the tape of Donald Trump’s lobbyist campaign manager saying this is all an act , this is all a fake, he’s a phony. Interestingly enough, that’s almost the exact same thing Donald Trump told "The New York Times" back in January when he sat down with "The New York Times" editorial board. Trump told them he doesn’t believe what he’s saying on immigration, he’s not going to build a wall, he’s not going to deport anyone.
