The popularity of sugary drinks and cultural preferences for filling but   foods like tacos and tamales contribute to the obesity of farmworkers and their families, public health officials say. Because an estimated half of agricultural workers in the Salinas Valley are in the country illegally, many do not have health insurance and go without treatment until symptoms become acute. The combination of high rents and low incomes  —   wages typically fall in the range of $10 to $15 an hour   —   leaves farmworkers with minimal and often inadequate money for food and is a contributor to the housing crisis in Salinas.
