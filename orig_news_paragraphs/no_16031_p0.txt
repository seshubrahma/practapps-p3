St. Clairsville, Ohio (CNN) Donald Trump on Tuesday once again used the word "rape" to describe the economic turmoil he believes bad trade deals are inflicting on the U. S. "The   Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country    just a continuing rape of our country," Trump told a crowd of supporters in Ohio. Hours earlier, Trump announced in an economic policy speech that as president he would pull the U. S. out of the TPP, a massive free trade agreement between the U. S. and 11 other countries.
