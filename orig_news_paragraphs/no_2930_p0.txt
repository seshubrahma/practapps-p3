  Donald J. Trump is back at Trump Tower as his team takes shape, and he’s staying busy. ■ He invited President Rodrigo R. Duterte of the Philippines to visit the White House, despite the Filipino’s ruthless campaign of extrajudicial killings and insults to President Obama. ■ He named a new advisory team headed by the billionaire hedge fund titan Stephen A. Schwarzman. ■ He is meeting with Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a Democrat who seems interested in a job in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, perhaps as the secretary of agriculture.
