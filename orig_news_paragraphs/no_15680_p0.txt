Washington (CNN) In an apparent break with a nearly   long bipartisan tradition, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has declined to host an event commemorating the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, according to two administration officials familiar with the decision. The officials said Tillerson rejected a request by the State Departmentâ€™s Office of Religion and Global Affairs to host a reception marking the Eid   the end of the holy month of Ramadan, which begins Saturday in many countries. Reuters first reported that Tillerson declined to host an event for Ramadan.
