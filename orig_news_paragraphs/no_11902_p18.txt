While Republican nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly made the case that his opponent supports open borders, many in the media have denounced Trump’s assertion as false —  without providing any substantive evidence to counter his claim. For instance, Politifact, the Associated Press, CNN, and FactCheck. org have all claimed that it is not true that Clinton supports open borders. They make this case by pushing unrelated arguments about how Clinton supports "border security" —  which has nothing to do with the fact that she endorsed, championed and, is now campaigning, on open borders immigration policies that would allow virtually unlimited amounts of foreign migrants to enter the country on U. S. visas.
