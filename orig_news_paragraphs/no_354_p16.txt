In innumerable interviews over the years, Mr. Trump glibly inflated everything from the size of his speaking fees to the cost of his golf club memberships to the number of units he had sold in new Trump buildings. In project after project, he faced allegations of broken promises, deceit or outright fraud, from Trump University students who said they had been defrauded, to Trump condominium buyers who said they had been fleeced, to   contractors who said Mr. Trump had fabricated complaints about their work to avoid paying them. In the early 1980s, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had filed a "spurious" lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. In the early 1990s, a federal judge ruled that despite Mr. Trumpâ€™s denials, there was "strong evidence" he and his subordinates had conspired to hire undocumented workers and deprive them of employment benefits.
