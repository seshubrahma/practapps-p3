 (CNN) The American drone war in Pakistan effectively ended nearly eight months ago when the US conducted its last drone strike, killing the Taliban’s leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour. After using CIA drones regularly for 7 years in Pakistan    a country  where the United States is not waging a traditional war, such as in Iraq    the Obama administration has now presided over the longest cessation of strikes since President Obama took office, according to data collected by New America. It is in Pakistan where the majority of CIA drone strikes have occurred under Obama, resulting in the death of a minimum of 1, 904 people and perhaps as many as 3, 114, according to New America’s research.
