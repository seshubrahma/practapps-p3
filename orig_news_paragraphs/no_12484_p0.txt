Donald Trump issued a statement following Huma Abedinâ€™s decision to leave her husband, Anthony Weiner, after his latest online sexting scandal. ["Huma is making a very wise decision. I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him. I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information," Trump stated in a press release on Monday afternoon.
