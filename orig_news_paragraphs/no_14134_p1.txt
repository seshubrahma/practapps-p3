This sensible change in focus, for as long as it might endure, provides an opportunity to contemplate what else may be possible regarding immigration policy during the next four years. The new administration has made several promises on immigration that everyone is familiar with by now, including building a border wall and making Mexico pay for it addressing existing legal impediments to removing criminal noncitizens strengthening the process for screening and vetting foreign nationals for terrorism concerns and ending abuses of foreign worker programs. Conventional wisdom says that each of these issues will soon be subject to contentious debate in Congress, likely resulting in a legislative stalemate. Lack of progress on these fights might then lead the administration to take unilateral action on these issues (some of which it has already started to take) which would then lead civil rights groups and corporations to file federal litigation challenging these actions.
