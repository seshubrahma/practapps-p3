This summer series, a humorous version of "Lost," hasn’t received much attention, but it’s a   show with a sly sense of incongruity. A plane crashes on an island the survivors try to, well, survive. Among the major issues they face: where to go to the bathroom and what movie to watch with the last bit of DVD battery. It’s broad, sometimes gross comedy, delivered with verve.
