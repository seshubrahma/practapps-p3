Sessions emphasized that Congress has outlawed since it was used in the George W. Bush administration during the war on terror. " Congress has taken an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture in the United States by our military and by all our other departments and agencies," he said.   Sessions has come under fire for his support of   immigration policies also embraced by Trump, and deferred on a question as to whether he agrees with past statements from Trump calling for a complete ban on foreign Muslims from entering the United States    saying that Trump has since moved away from that position.
