The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was "premature to accuse the Syrian government of using chemical weapons in Idlib," insisting on a full investigation. Autopsies on three victims conducted in Turkey indicated exposure to chemical substances, Turkey’s Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said. It’s not yet confirmed what chemical agent was involved in the attack, but early indicators point to the release of a nerve agent like Sarin. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Assad a "murderer" over the incident.
