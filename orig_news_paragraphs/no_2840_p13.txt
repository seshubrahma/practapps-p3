A Nurseâ€™s Story of Falling Through the Safety Net (She Writes Press, paper, $16. 95). Ensign, who now teaches at the University of Washington, traces several years in the late 1980s when she headed up a   medical clinic for the homeless in Richmond, Va. At 25, she has studied at Oberlin and Harvard but is still beholden to the legacy of her Bible Belt family, which is "riddled with Christian zealots, ministers and missionaries" and has put her in a "   marriage" to an aspiring preacher.
