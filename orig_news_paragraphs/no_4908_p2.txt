On the other side are those who want to maintain the current level of troops but limit U. S. involvement in the war. That option would leave it up to the Afghan government and the Taliban to resolve the conflict, but assist the Afghan government with a minimal    mission, also known as "foreign internal defense," and assist local partners in fighting extremist ideology. It would also include a counterterrorism presence to target   targets. It would take notably longer than the kinetic plan but would be significantly cheaper.
