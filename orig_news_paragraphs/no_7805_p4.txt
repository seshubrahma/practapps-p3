Instead, a source said, Zucker and CNN could offer Kelly greater international exposure as well as "synergy" across all Time Warner properties, including possible movie roles at Warner Bros. Drudge also reported that Kelly’s public feud with    Donald Trump during the contentious election season has raised tensions inside the network, and that the anchor is now "despised" by her   colleagues. There is also reportedly significant drama within the network over Kelly’s   memoir, Settle for More, in which she accused former Fox News boss Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her during her early years at the cable news outlet. Meanwhile, Ailes successors Lachlan and James Murdoch reportedly see Kelly as the centerpiece of the network in a   world.
