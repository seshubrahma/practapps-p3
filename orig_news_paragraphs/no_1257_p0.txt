MONTGOMERY, Ala.   â€”    Gov. Robert Bentley engaged in an "inappropriate relationship" with his chief adviser, then used intimidation tactics and deployed state law enforcement officials in an effort to cover it up, according to a bruising report released Friday in support of the effort to impeach him. The report also claims that the   governor tried to pin nonexistent crimes on a top law enforcement official.
