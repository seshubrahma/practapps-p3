About 70 law enforcement officers, most dressed in navy uniforms and wearing ball caps, stood in groups, watching the 150 or so people who milled about while other students traversed the plaza in between classes.   Most of the officers had riot helmets and zip ties hanging from their belts, but there was little tension. Thirty more police officers arrived about noon. Some people brought signs.
