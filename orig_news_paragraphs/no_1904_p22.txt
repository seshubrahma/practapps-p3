Mr. Giulianiâ€™s work earned him a spot on several lists of the   speakers in the world, just one spot below Mr. Clinton in one ranking. In one instance in 2006, Mr. Giuliani collected $100, 000 for speaking at Oklahoma State University. His contract with the university, which is public, laid out what appeared to be his standard demands beyond a fee. Besides the requests related to air travel, his team required a sedan and an S. U. V. and an extra S. U. V. for luggage when he traveled to other countries.
