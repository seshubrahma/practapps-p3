TEL AVIV  —    Eastern European leaders have "drawn inspiration" from conservative U. S. media outlets, especially Breitbart News, to crack down on groups financed by billionaire George Soros that are allegedly attempting to meddle in domestic politics, Reuters reported. [The news agency reported on Thursday:   The campaign against Soros in countries formerly dominated by Moscow appears to follow a template set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose own crackdown on   charities drove Soros’s foundation out of Russia two years ago.
