Last Monday, just days before the announcement of the Facebook partnership, Poynter issued a press release revealing that Newmark donated $1 million to the group to fund a faculty chair in journalism ethics. States the press release: The gift will support a   program at Poynter that focuses on verification,   and accountability in journalism. It’s the largest donation Poynter’s ever received from an individual foundation. The Newmark Chair will expand on Poynter’s teaching in journalism ethics and develop certification programs for journalists that commit to ethical   practices.
