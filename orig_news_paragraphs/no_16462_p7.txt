In a bit of dark irony, Clinton’s political opponents then, most notably the Republican former U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, suggested that Clinton was faking it    that the secretary of state, as Bolton put it, had come down with a "diplomatic illness" in order to avoid the congressional inquiry. In the weeks after the injury, Clinton would be hospitalized and prescribed blood thinners to dissolve a blood clot located in a vein behind her right ear. The diagnosis was made during a   exam related to her concussion. The clot did not, per Clinton’s doctors, result in a stroke or any other neurological complications.
