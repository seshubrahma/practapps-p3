The location is no coincidence, as Santorum drew on his own   roots, just 10 miles away from Cabot, setting the stage for his campaign’s focus on   and   Americans. Santorum also highlighted his family story in his speech, touching on veterans’ issues, as both of his parents worked for the Veterans Administration. For a politician who won the Iowa caucus in 2012 and was able to keep his campaign    fueled by support from Christian conservatives    running through the spring, Santorum is starting the 2016 race in a humble place: the bottom. He came in at 3% and 2% in the latest   and Fox News polls, respectively.
