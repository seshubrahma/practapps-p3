Suddenly the First Amendment means something to our Media Overlords. Now that Donald Trump has taken to trolling the corrupt media with a promise to further open up libel laws against them, the DC Media is back to treating the First Amendment as something inviolable and sacrosanct. As you read this, keep in mind that Trump is breaking the b*lls of the same media that has spent the last two years crusading to violate your First Amendment religious protections:  One of the things I’m gonna do, and this is only gonna make it tougher for me, and I’ve never said this before, but one of the things I’m gonna do if I win   …      is I’m gonna open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.
