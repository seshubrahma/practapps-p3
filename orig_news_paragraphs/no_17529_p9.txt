Same play for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who was accused by Trump of doing a "terrible job," allowing the Texas border to become a porous mess. Perry then accused Trump of a "fundamental misunderstanding" of how border security works. Whatâ€™s more, he added for good measure, Trump spouts "a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense" on immigration. Clearly, the Perry camp has had enough.
