A group of state and national   leaders are urging Iowa voters to support anyone except Donald Trump, referring to him as a man who "has impugned the dignity of women," including Fox News host Megyn Kelly and his 2016 GOP rival, Carly Fiorina. [The   leaders sent the following letter to Iowa voters:   Dear Iowans, As   women leaders from Iowa and across the nation, we urge Republican   and voters to support anyone but Donald Trump. On the issue of defending unborn children and protecting women from the violence of abortion, Mr. Trump cannot be trusted and there is, thankfully, an abundance of alternative candidates with proven records of   leadership whom   voters can support.
