Page has denied any wrongdoing.   What’s become clear over the first few months of the Trump White House is that we aren’t in the midst of a "he   said" when it comes to the campaign’s ties to Russia. It’s more of a "he   said, he said, she said, he said, he said" sort of situation. As in, on the one hand, we have Trump asserting that the whole story of Russia’s attempts to influence the election via connections within his campaign apparatus is "fake news," and grasping at the idea that somehow, some way he will be eventually proven right in his baseless claims that   Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower.
