The speech itself was a risk because the Trump campaign had planned the event before Sunday’s riots less than an hour south in the black neighborhoods of Wisconsin’s largest city. The main theme of the speech was law and order and the need to back up law enforcement in a climate where police officers are now tagged as the enemy of the common people. Trump took that straight on: The main victims of these riots are     citizens living in these neighborhoods. It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.
