Washington (CNN) Boxing promoter Don King thrust himself back into the political scene Wednesday when he dropped the   at a Donald Trump minority outreach event. Itâ€™s the latest step into the political fray for King, who has a long history of colorfully weighing in on politics on both sides of the aisle going back half a century. After serving nearly four years in prison for a manslaughter conviction in 1966 for killing an associate who owed him $600, King was later pardoned of the crime in 1983 by   Gov. Jim Rhodes.
