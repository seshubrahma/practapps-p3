Additional new groups are taking on tasks such as training potential candidates for office. Two veteran Democratic operatives launched "Run for Something"    with about 200 party professionals volunteering to help   activists who want to get involved on the local or state level but don’t know where to start.   As of Friday, the group said, 3, 300 people had already signed up to run for some office.   Emily’s List, which funds female Democratic candidates, held a training session the day after the Women’s March in Washington for 500 women.
