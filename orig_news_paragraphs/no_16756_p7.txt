But it was my senior year and my platform to tell this story was about to vanish, so I hijacked the news cycle in hopes I would bridge a gap between city and suburbs, stereotypes and truths, whites and blacks. Itâ€™s the same divide I want bridged today, as I watch Chicago admonished on a scale much larger than the school bus bombast that motivated me years ago. A case can be made for Chicago not to bear the brunt of national outrage: its per capita murder rate over the last 30 years is actually lower than cities like St. Louis, Detroit and New Orleans.
