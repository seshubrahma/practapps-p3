There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this theory, dating from the nationâ€™s first televised presidential debate: Richard M. Nixon versus John F. Kennedy in 1960, which set the handsome and composed Kennedy on a course to victory over the conspicuously underweight and sweaty Nixon. Ever since, presidential debates have routinely been defined more powerfully by images than by words. You can even find academic research on the subject: nonverbal expression, the experts call it. A psychology professor has had some success predicting the outcome of elections based purely on which candidate blinks less frequently during debates, the idea being that   blinking is a sign of stress and anxiety, generally not desirable qualities in a commander in chief.
