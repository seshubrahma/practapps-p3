And earlier on Thursday, Mr. Obama created three new national monuments to honor the struggle for civil rights in America. He designated the historic A. G. Gaston Motel in Birmingham, Ala. as the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument identified four sites in South Carolina to be called the Reconstruction Era National Monument and established the Freedom Riders National Monument at the Greyhound bus station where Freedom Riders were attacked in the spring of 1961. Mr. Obama also expanded two national monuments in the West, protecting more areas of cultural, historic and environmental significance in Oregon and California.
