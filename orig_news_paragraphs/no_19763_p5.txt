A President Without an Administration, Senate committees have scheduled confirmation hearings for seven nominees over a   period beginning Tuesday. As of Monday night, DeVos was one of four scheduled for this week who did not have signed ethics agreements. The others are retired General John Kelly, the nominee for homeland security secretary Ben Carson, the nominee to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Wilbur Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary. The nominees are behind schedule because the Trump transition did not follow the usual practice of   the  â€™s choices for potential ethical conflicts or security issues before sending their names to the Senate.
