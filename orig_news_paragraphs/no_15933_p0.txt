 (CNN) The announcement that North Korea has released American detainee Otto Warmbier comes on the same day that former basketball star Dennis Rodman arrives for his fifth visit to see his "friend" Kim Jong Un. And while Rodman appears to not have been involved in Warmbierâ€™s release, his arrival does beg the question: Why did North Korea release Warmbier today? In January 2016, Warmbier was arrested for stealing a banner from his Pyongyang hotel.
