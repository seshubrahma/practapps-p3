In a statement, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the United States was "disappointed" to learn about Guterres’ intention to appoint Fayyad and said "going forward, the United States will act, not just talk, in support of our allies. " Haley said she was blocking the Guterres’ selection on the grounds that "the UN has been unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel." "The United States does not currently recognize a Palestinian state or support the signal this appointment would send within the United Nations," Haley said.
