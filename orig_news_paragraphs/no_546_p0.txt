WASHINGTON   —    As the Central Intelligence Agency was setting up its secret prisons overseas 15 years ago to interrogate terrorism suspects, a Defense Department unit was considering a proposal to establish a secret military prison abroad, according to previously undisclosed government documents. The proposal was presented in a 2002 memo written in part by Bruce Jessen, one of two psychologists who eventually helped create the C. I. A. ’s "enhanced interrogation" program.
