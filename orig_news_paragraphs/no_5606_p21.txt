For the rich, health insurance is no problem they can afford all the healthcare they need or want, with or without health insurance.   And for the poor, health insurance is also not an issue they get it from the government, mostly through Medicaid, but also by simply coming into a hospital emergency room.   (Under a federal law in place since 1986, the ER has to take of anyone, regardless of ability to pay, or of citizenship status.)    Stuck in between, of course, is the middle class.
