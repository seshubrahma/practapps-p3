Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali, who helped organize Sunday’s event, joined Simmons before a much smaller Times Square crowd in 2011 to protest congressional hearings on Islamic terrorism.   Simmons also took part in Occupy Wall Street protests and has been an outspoken supporter of marriage equality, animal rights and overturning what he’s criticized as harsh drug laws.   In December 2015, Simmons wrote his "old friend" Trump, urging him to "stop the bullsh **" in regard to the    US President’s call to ban Muslims from entering the United States.
