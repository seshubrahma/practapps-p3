In its statement Friday afternoon, the Secret Service offered some information about the incident and said the "investigation is ongoing," so far including more than 50 interviews and a review of radio transmissions and video footage. The review found that the intruder climbed a   fence and an   gate and then hopped a     foot fence while Secret Service members struggled to locate him. House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz told CNNâ€™s Wolf Blitzer on Friday that the intruder even managed to rattle a door handle at the South Portico entrance to the White House, although he did not make it inside.
