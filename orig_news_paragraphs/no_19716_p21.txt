Earlier this month, the Senate unanimously passed legislation that amends current law by adding human exploration of Mars to one of NASA’s objectives. The bill —  which is not expected to become law this year but could come up again in the next Congress —  is intended to make it politically difficult for future administrations to drastically alter NASA’s plans to send astronauts to Mars by the 2030s. The legislation is sponsored by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, a supporter of   exploration. The bill wouldn’t stop Trump, if he wanted to, from switching NASA’s main goal to a return to the moon first before Mars —  a move that would likely be welcomed by his adviser, Newt Gingrich, a   advocate.
