Emails uncovered by Judicial Watch reveal Hillary’s top aide Huma Abedin coordinating foreign favors with the Clinton Foundation, including greasing requests for billionaire   oligarch Gilbert Chagoury, a former business associate of the late billionaire fugitive Marc Rich. On Wednesday, the Democrat presidential nominee went on CNN to try and tamp down calls for her foundation to close. Liberal CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Clinton, "Why was it okay for the Clinton Foundation to accept foreign donations when you were secretary of state, but it wouldn’t be okay if you were president?"
