Put simply, the Hawaii federal judge ruled that because the imam was Muslim and his   migrant visas   came from   nations, the First Amendment gave him a special right to bring whomever he wanted into the country, even from   countries in security compromised states the President recognized as a direct threat to the peace of the people. The First Amendment has never applied to a right of immigration of foreign aliens, nor does it compel religious favoritism toward Muslims. This is the new left’s interpretation of the Constitution, and it is as perilous to our politics as the deep state within and radical Islam abroad. The Hawaii Obama judge didn’t interpret the Constitution he rewrote it, usurping to himself the sole power to control borders, then delegated the exercise of that power to a Muslim imam and his free visa wish list.
