On this weekend’s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," when asked about Democrats uproar over then candidate Donald Trump saying during a debate that he would wait and see when asked if would accept the elections results, liberal political analyst Juan Williams said Democrats now pushing for electors to vote against   Donald Trump "run the risk of looking like hypocrites. "  Williams said, "There’s no question Democrats run the risk of looking like hypocrites given what happened at that expertly moderated debate in October. But in fairness, you know, at the time what was on the table was the idea of voter fraud, and it was being pushed by Republicans and Trump. There’s so much voter fraud in the country that the race could be tossed to Hillary Clinton and legitimately he could win the popular vote and be denied.
