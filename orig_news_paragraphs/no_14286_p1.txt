Fatemeh Reshad and her parents are expected to arrive in the United States in a few days, the Portland hospital said Saturday. They initially had been scheduled to meet Sunday with doctors in Portland but had been barred from traveling from Tehran, Fatemeh’s uncle, Samad Teghizadeh, told CNN. Several congressional Democrats released a letter Friday evening asking Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to grant a waiver for the child and her parents. The delay came after Trump’s executive order put an abrupt stop on travel to the United States for citizens of seven   countries, including Iran.
