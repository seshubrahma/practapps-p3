In an interview Cincinnati ABC affiliate WCPO, former House Speaker John Boehner talked about his life after politics and expressed no regrets in having left when he had, given the current political climate which has led to Donald Trump being elected president.   Boehner told WCPO he knew Trump well, having played golf with him on occasions and likened the   to "larger than life" former President Teddy Roosevelt. " I think Donald Trump sees himself larger than life," Boehner said.
