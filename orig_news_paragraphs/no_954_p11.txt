The chances of the United States taking the other three into custody any time soon appear slim, especially because the United States has no extradition treaty with Russia. The fourth person involved in the scheme, a Russian named Alexsey Belan, had been indicted twice before for three intrusions into American   companies. At one point, he was arrested in Europe, but he escaped to Russia before he could be extradited. Prosecutors said they had repeatedly asked the Russian government to hand over Mr. Belan but had gotten no response.
