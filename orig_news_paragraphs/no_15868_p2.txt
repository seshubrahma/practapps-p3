The possibility that Trump might at some point want to fire Mueller has to be viewed quite seriously.   As the former host of both "The Apprentice" and "The Celebrity Apprentice," not to mention his lengthy career as a real estate and "branding" entrepreneur, President Trump brings a special expertise to the subject of firing people.
