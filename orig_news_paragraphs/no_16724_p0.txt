Washington (CNN) Donald Trump threatened Saturday to bring Gennifer Flowers, with whom Bill Clinton admitted to having a sexual relationship decades ago, to Monday’s presidential debate. The taunt is a response to prominent Trump critic Mark Cuban’s plans to sit in the front row of the debate at the invitation of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. It’s the Republican nominee’s latest public reference to the 42nd president’s infidelity, which he has occasionally cited in his campaign to criticize his Democratic challenger.
