McMaster, who rose through the ranks as an unconventional military thinker, dismissed comparisons to the Vietnam War, in which the US military tried to prop up the failing Diem regime amidst an insurgency sponsored by North Vietnam, and the war in Afghanistan, in which the US government is supporting the faltering government in Kabul against a   insurgency. McMaster and allies on the National Security Council reportedly support sending 3, 000 to 5, 000 more U. S. troops in Afghanistan and hitting the Taliban harder in order to drive them to the negotiating table. Others in the White House want to scale back the U. S. role in Afghanistanâ€™s war with the Taliban, with enough U. S. troops to advise Afghan forces and fight terrorists. The Duffel Blog post underscored the futility with which some veterans and members of the military view escalation in the Afghanistan War, which is now in its 16th year.
