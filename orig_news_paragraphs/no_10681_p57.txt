It’s strange that Clinton has attacked Sanders for wanting to go further to the left than Obama on healthcare and used Chelsea Clinton to make that attack. Clinton says the "details really matter" on healthcare and that is why she has been raising questions about the nine bills that Sanders have introduced. She says she believes that Democrats since Harry Truman have worked to get the Affordable Care Act passed and she doesn’t want to see Republicans repeal it and start over it. She says she wants to defend Obamacare and improve it.
