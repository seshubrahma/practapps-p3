In the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, even failed terrorist plots often have drawn saturation coverage   â€”    think of the fizzled   underwear bomb on a   airliner on Christmas Day 2009 or the S. U. V.   to blow up that produced only smoke in Times Square on a May night in 2010. Though no target was harmed, both attempts drew mountains of coverage, much of it focused on how terrorists went undetected.
