Rubio allies and mainstream media writers who don’t want to concede that Trump won the Hispanic vote in Nevada are endlessly talking about the supposedly small sample of Latino voters. But if Rubio had received 51% of the Hispanic vote, would these same people be pointing to the "small sample size" —  or would they be pushing the narrative that Trump can’t even win minorities in his own party? Bottom line: Trump won nearly half of the Latino vote on Tuesday.
