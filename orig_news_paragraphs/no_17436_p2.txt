Trump on Saturday touted the money the foundation has donated over the years to veterans, law enforcement and children’s groups and said that he intends to pursue his "strong interest in philanthropy in other ways," though he had not donated to the foundation since 2008, according to the foundation’s tax records. On Monday night Trump continued to defend his philanthropic efforts, over Twitter.   " I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won’t report!"
