The least expensive drink, the   "Romanesque Revival," costs $24, while the barâ€™s namesake cocktail, comprised of rye, vodka, raw Kumamoto oysters and Royal Ossetra caviar, goes for $100.   A previous version of the bar menu, tweeted in September, shows "Romanesque Revival" at $20, and other cocktails from $16 to $21    hardly a bargain, but certainly more affordable. Looking for something more reasonable? A bottled Bud Light runs $8, a glass of milk $6.
