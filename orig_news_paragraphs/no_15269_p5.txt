Judge Alex Kozinski, a Ronald   who formerly served as the chief judge of the Court, testified against the efforts last month. In an interview with CNN Wednesday night, Kozinski declined to comment directly on the President’s statement, but he made clear he thinks splitting up the 9th Circuit is a "bad idea."   " It doesn’t accomplish anything," he said, and noted that unless California is split into two circuits, there would still be one very large circuit composed of mostly judges from the state.
