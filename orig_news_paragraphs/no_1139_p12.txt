The assessment that the actual policies of the United States might not end up being as harsh as those espoused by Mr. Trump during the campaign is reflected in the confidence in the Mexican peso. Measured against a basket of currencies, it has gained about 17. 5 percent in value since the inauguration, more than any other major currency. On Thursday, it traded at 18. 72 pesos to the dollar, approaching the levels it held before Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory.
