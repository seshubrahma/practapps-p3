Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said that the news coverage Mr. Trump is receiving is not helping him. She said that unlike Mr. Trump, who uses "nothing but his own mouth," Mrs. Clinton has a campaign that employs many methods of communication, including videos, respected surrogates and bilingual outreach. " We hear from friends who think we should act more like Trump or criticize us for sometimes using traditional communications tactics," she said.
