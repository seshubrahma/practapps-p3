The Times cited Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, as telling reporters that Trump was not aware of the source of the information. Israeli officials reached by the Times would not confirm that Israel provided the intelligence, which reportedly concerns the inner workings of the Islamic State. McMaster told the Post that "the president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation. " "At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly," McMaster stated.
