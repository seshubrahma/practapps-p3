The testiest exchange during the hearing came when Sen. Elizabeth Warren,   urged Carson to promise none of HUD’s budget would wind up financially benefiting Trump or his real estate company. Carson declined to rule it out, insisting instead that he would "absolutely not play favorites "  "I will manage things that benefit the American people," he said, adding he would not unequivocally rule out any HUD funds making their way to the Trump Organization in an appropriate context if such a move would benefit   Americans. Warren said she was not raising questions about Carson’s integrity but rather about Trump’s decision not to place his assets in a blind trust or fully divest from his businesses, instead putting his sons and a top executive in charge of the Trump Organization while he is President.
