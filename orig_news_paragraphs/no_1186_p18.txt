Ms. Roginsky, who has been a paid contributor on Fox News since 2011, stated in her complaint that Mr. Ailes made sexist comments and unwanted sexual advances toward her during    meetings in his office, including requiring that she "bend down to kiss him hello" when he sat in a low armchair and telling her that they would get into "so much trouble" if he took her "out for a drink. " Mr. Ailes also would tell her that she should "engage in sexual relationships with ‘older, married, conservative men,’" the suit stated. Ms. Roginsky asserted in the suit that she faced retaliation for refusing Mr. Ailes’s advances.
