Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told reporters in the West Bank on Friday that Mr. Trump’s appointments were "his business," but that it was "not up to Trump or anybody else" to take steps like moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Daniel C. Kurtzer, who served President George W. Bush as ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005, was alarmed by the appointment. " He has made clear that he will appeal to a small minority of Israeli  —   and American  —   extremists, ignoring the majority of Israelis who continue to seek peace," Mr. Kurtzer, now a professor at Princeton, said in an interview.
