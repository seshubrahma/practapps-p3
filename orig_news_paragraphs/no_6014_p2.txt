In the early morning hours of Sunday, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has jurisdiction over Washington, denied the request for an immediate administrative stay. Contrary to media reports, the court did not deny the Justice Departmentâ€™s motion for an emergency stay pending appeal. Instead, a   administrative panel of the San   appeals court ruled that the court would not decide on the motion for an emergency stay until it had received all legal briefs presenting the arguments on both sides.
