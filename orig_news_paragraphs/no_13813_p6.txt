Repealing Obamacare alone would deliver tax cuts totaling $346 billion over 10 years, every penny going to households making $200, 000 or more. Interesting that the 12 states with the largest percentage of such households all voted for Hillary Clinton.   No more universal health coverage?   Not necessarily.
