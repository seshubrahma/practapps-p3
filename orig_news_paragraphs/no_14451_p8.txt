Until Monday, the White House expressed only faith in Flynn, a retired general who caused deep consternation among career National Security Council staff during his brief tenure. It wasn’t until late in the day, after Trump’s counselor Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC that Trump had "full confidence" in Flynn, that signs of trouble emerged.

Spicer, appearing in a West Wing hallway after the President brushed off the questions about Flynn, said that Trump was "evaluating the situation" with input from Pence.
