Despite diverse cultures, histories, and geographies, there is a surprising uniformity when nations splinter apart. I wrote a piece several years ago called "The Police State Playbook"  on how dictators from Zimbabwe to Myanmar to Iran    whether African and Christian, Asian and Buddhist, or Middle Eastern and Muslim    turned on their people in nearly identical ways. The same goes for their populations.    And Iâ€™m not talking about natural political disagreement, but an    mentality that leads people to see the other side as not only wrong but unpatriotic and dangerous.
