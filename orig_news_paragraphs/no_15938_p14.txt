As CNN’s Hunter Schwarz wrote earlier this year: "Perhaps the Clinton most effective at Twitter trolling, though, is Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea. Employing Internet colloquialisms, like linking to the latest Trump controversy while referencing how early it is (as if to say, "Trump has already ruined X, Y, and Z, and it’s only Monday") @ChelseaClinton benefits from being conversational. Her feed is more typical liberal millennial than her scripted political family members.
