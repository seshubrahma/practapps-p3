Last season, the Super Bowl quarterbacks, Matt Ryan and Tom Brady, led the league at 10. 1 and 9. 3. Anything over 8 is very good most solid quarterbacks land somewhere in the 7s. Kaepernick took over the Ninersâ€™ starting job when Alex Smith sustained a concussion in 2012 and put up a figure of 8. 6, the best in league, before his trip to the Super Bowl.
