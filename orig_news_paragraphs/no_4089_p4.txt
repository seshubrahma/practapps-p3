Trumpâ€™s 2018 budget calls for an increase in federal spending on school choice programs by $1. 4 billion, ultimately reaching an annual total of $20 billion. Additional spending in 2018 on school choice would include: A $168 million increase for charter schools, $250 million for a new private school choice program, and a $1 billion increase for Title I, dedicated to encouraging districts to adopt a system of   based budgeting and open enrollment that enables Federal, State, and local funding to follow the student to the public school of his or her choice. " The budget also includes both   and   voucher programs that further an ideological crusade against public education," Weingarten said during the press conference.
