Berlin (CNN) Thereâ€™s no secret about which of the two American presidents German Chancellor Angela Merkel is meeting Thursday that she likes the most. On a day of odd political coincidences, Merkel sat down with one President she calls a friend and with whom she shares a political wavelength    Barack Obama, and another, with whom she has had a frosty start    Donald Trump. Merkel, the most powerful leader in Europe, first met Obama in Berlin discussing democracy and faith at the Brandenburg Gate, meters away from the path of the Cold War wall which once split the city, at an event hosted by the German protestant church.
