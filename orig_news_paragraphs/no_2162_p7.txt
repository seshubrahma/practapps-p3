By many measures, the state is humming economically, offering a contrarian reality to the gloomy scenario that the presidential candidates are presenting to motivate voters. With nearly one in five jobs in manufacturing, the highest share of any state, Indianaâ€™s gross domestic product is accelerating faster than any of its Great Lakes neighbors, according to the latest figures from the Commerce Department. Unemployment at the end of last year was 4. 4 percent, below the national average of about  5 percent. Even though the figure has ticked up in 2016, economists attribute the increase to the large number of people returning to the work force, including job seekers moving to Indiana.
