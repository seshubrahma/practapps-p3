In Friday’s filing, Trump’s lawyers make several claims in response to the lawsuit, including that Trump had a right to remove protesters from his event, that getting tickets to the rally waived their claims, and that their "claims are barred by their unclean hands," in addition to claiming immunity. Experts say that the immunity argument, though, will be tough for the Trump administration to justify    and the reference to the Clinton v. Jones case is particularly puzzling.   Two major Supreme Court cases, one under President Andrew Johnson and one with President Richard Nixon, held that presidents have broad immunity when it comes to their actions in office.   But the court decided unanimously in former President Bill Clinton’s case that he could face a lawsuit for actions he allegedly took prior to becoming President, leading to his famous impeachment.
