" The main spillway was releasing water at 100, 000 cubic feet per second Monday afternoon in an effort to reduce the amount of water traveling down the emergency spillway, Croyle said. Normal flows down the main spillway are about 55, 000 cubic feet per second.   Crews used helicopters to drop bags of rocks into the gouged portion of the emergency spillway, in an effort to plug the hole.
