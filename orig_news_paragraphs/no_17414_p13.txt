A draft of the resolution calls on Israel to "immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. " It also declares that the establishment of Israeli settlements, "including in East Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the   solution."   The draft wouldnâ€™t make the settlements illegal, as they have been declared in previous resolutions, but would reiterate that point.
