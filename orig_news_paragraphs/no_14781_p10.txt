Earlier this month, immigration agents detained Daniela Vargas, 22, after she publicly criticized the recent spate of federal raids during a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi. She told the story of her father and brother, who were arrested by ICE agents in February. Vargas also advocated for young people such as herself who were brought to the US as children by their undocumented parents, then qualified for a temporary reprieve from deportation under DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Attorneys for Vargas    whose DACA status expired in November    have filed a petition in federal court asking for her immediate release.
