To be sure, the terms in many of these questions are highly subjective. " Since the 1950s, do you think American culture and way of life has mostly changed for the better, or has it mostly changed for the worse?" is a very big question, especially given that many of the poll respondents werenâ€™t around during the Fifties and Sixties.   Younger people on the Left side of the American political spectrum are generally given a negative view of the Fifties, especially with respect to racism and stodgy, judgmental "Ozzie and Harriet" culture, while the late Sixties are seen as a mystical transformative experience.
