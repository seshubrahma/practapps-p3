The campaign also responded in 2008 to allegations, made by Matt Drudge, that "stressed Clinton staffers" were circulating a photo of Obama wearing a turban with a blanket denunciation.   On Friday, the former Washington bureau chief for McClatchy, James Asher, tweeted that in 2008, Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal told him "in person" that Obama was born in Kenya. Blumenthal denied the claim to CNNâ€™s Dan Merica, saying Trump "is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and bears the responsibility for it. "
