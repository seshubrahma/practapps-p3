The question I still have is how is it possible that Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump could have been recorded saying such things and, for 11 years, NBC News took no action whatsoever against its reporter? Does NBC News, owner of the Access Hollywood program, condone such behavior and comments from their "on air talent"? And when they finally decided to take action, did company officials actually discuss ways of releasing the tape of Mr. Trumpâ€™s comments while covering up for Mr. Bush? And how long exactly did the company sit on the tape before dropping the bombshell "October surprise" just weeks before the election?
