50 years later    we were getting a black president before a woman president.   Much as I admired Barack Obama, I was sad that once again women came second. My daughter, Molly   who was then 30, believed that Obama was better than Clinton. But I saw Obama as a brilliant constitutional lawyer with limited experience    and Hillary Clinton as a brilliant lawyer with lots of experience.
