Democrats and some Republicans said Mr. Trump’s attack on the courts would color the battle over the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as well as the president’s relationship with Congress. Other presidents have clashed with the judiciary. The Supreme Court invalidated parts of Franklin D.

The last two presidents battled with courts repeatedly over the limits of their power.
