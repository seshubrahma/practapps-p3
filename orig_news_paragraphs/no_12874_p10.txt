It simply can’t understand how countries can have interests adverse to the United States, and why we need to protect them.   My hope for the next four months, until the Obama administration goes out of office, is that the world just goes to sleep. That’s the best we can hope for because with his time in office dwindling down, I’m very worried that Obama and Kerry are going to be trying to build their legacy in an ideological way that’s gonna cause significant damage to the United States.
