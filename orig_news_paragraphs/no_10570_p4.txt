While the specifics are still being hammered out, one of the first battles on which this war will likely play itself out is with regard to tariffs on imported   goods. Some proposals like a possible 10 percent tariff —  or a lower five percent tariff —  on all imported goods are being discussed internally, according to a recent CNN report, but senior sources say the specifics aren’t yet finalized. CNN’s John King and Jeremy Diamond reported this week:   Donald Trump’s transition team is discussing a proposal to impose tariffs as high as 10% on imports, according to multiple sources. A senior Trump transition official said Thursday the team is mulling up to a 10% tariff aimed at spurring US manufacturing, which could be implemented via executive action or as part of a sweeping tax reform package they would push through Congress.
