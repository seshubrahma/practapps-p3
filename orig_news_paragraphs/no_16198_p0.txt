 (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was slow to endorse Donald Trump for president, referenced the divide in his party and attempted a football analogy    that fell flat    to describe how the GOP can unify behind its nominee.   Ryan made the comments Tuesday at a breakfast with Texas delegates to the Republican National Convention, in a room where with many people who had backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the nomination.   " Conventions can be pretty darn exciting sometimes," Ryan said, a day after   delegates protested on the convention floor.
