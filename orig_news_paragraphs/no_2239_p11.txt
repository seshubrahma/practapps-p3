In 2014, Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate (26 percent) among cities with more than a million people, while Cleveland has the   poverty rate (39. 2 percent) among cities with more than 100, 000 residents, according to census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution. Cleveland also has exceedingly high rates of "concentrated poverty "  â€”   poor people living in poor neighborhoods. Both cities have very segregated   populations, according to William H. Frey, a Brookings demographer.
