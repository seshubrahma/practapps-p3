Mark DeSaulnier, a Democratic Member of the National Security Subcommittee, used part of his opening remarks to play a video featuring Republicans like Sen. John McCain ( ) who never supported President Trump’s plans for a wall, saying they did not think he could get "Mexico to pay for the wall" as he promised on the campaign trail. Maria Espinoza, national director of the Remembrance Project, a   representing the victims of illegal immigrant crime and their families, testified that: Americans will continue to be under assault until the wall is built   …     While it seemed as though the politicians listened and even publicly gave the families their condolences, congressional leadership, the bodies of both houses, Republican and Democrat, have failed to enact the very measures that would have saved American lives. America has spoken. We want the wall built right away
