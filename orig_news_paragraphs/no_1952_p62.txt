Suraj Hegde, the secretary of the All India Congress Committee, a national body of Indian National Congress party members, said he was troubled by the dual roles Mr. Trump and his family would play in Indian affairs   —    particularly given real estate’s important role in India’s   economy, and the clout the United States has on the world stage.
