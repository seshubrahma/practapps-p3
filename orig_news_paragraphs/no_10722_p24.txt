The article then deflects from the original claim by throwing in statistics about the crime rate of all immigrants: In vowing to promptly remove   million criminal aliens, Trump appears to draw on, and inflate, the 1. 9 million   identified by Homeland Security as removable criminal aliens. However most of those 1. 9 million are here legally. Only 820, 000 are undocumented, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Immigration Policy Center. Which means that of 10 million undocumented adults in the US, 8. 2% have a criminal record and 3% have committed a felony.
