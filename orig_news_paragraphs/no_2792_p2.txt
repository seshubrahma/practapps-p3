Mr. Rubio is not expected to have much difficulty in the Republican primary, where a few contenders have withdrawn, but he still faces several   opponents. In November he will probably be challenged by Representative Patrick Murphy, a    congressman whom Republicans have mocked as young, overambitious and lacking in accomplishment   —   attributes that Democrats have pinned on Mr. Rubio. Political handicappers have rated the seat as a tossup, though Mr. Rubio’s decision to run probably improved Republicans’ chances of keeping the seat and their control of the Senate.
