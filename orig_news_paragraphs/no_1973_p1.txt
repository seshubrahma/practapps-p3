Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, will attend the funeral, as will Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top American diplomat in Cuba, to represent the United States, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary.

S.  relationship that were characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil, not just during the Castro regime.
