The   joint fundraising committee is comprised of Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and 32 state party committees. It was advertised as building state infrastructure for a grassroots     effort in the November general election. The Victory Fund did make transfers of $3. 8 million, or 6 percent, to the state parties. But $3. 3 million, or 88 percent, was wired within two days to the Democrat National Committee by the Clinton staffers that control the DNC, according to POLITICO.
