While building and vetting a Cabinet and developing policy are primary focuses of the transition, the effort also has to work on preparing that new administration to lead from day one    no matter what circumstances are thrown at it. An effective transition should run   exercises to run through simulated emergencies of a variety of types, from terrorism, to public health, to natural disasters, the hope being that when the first crisis hits the presidency, it wonâ€™t be the first time principals have gathered into a room to respond.    The transition period is one of the most vulnerable in American democracy. In addition to a new president taking office, only a few hundred of the 4, 000 appointed officials are usually in place by August recess, meaning agencies are operating without permanent leadership or brand new leadership.
