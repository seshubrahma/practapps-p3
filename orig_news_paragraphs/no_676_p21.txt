With the adoption of all this   software and stuff, weâ€™ve had to bring in a lot of new technicians," said Dennis A. Smith, a Nabors vice president. A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel, a    mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources. In less than two years, he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the best designs for hydraulic fracturing, optimizing the amounts of fluids, sand and chemicals pumped into the wells. Now, connected by computers to technicians in the field, he is monitoring the production of 950 wells, instantly checking the maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse.
