From 2010 to 2014, about half a million of these workers gained new health insurance through Obamacare, estimates PHI, a New   nonprofit that researches this slice of the labor force and advocates for improved working conditions, in a March issue brief. Most home care workersâ€™ gains came from living in states that, like Montana, expanded Medicaid. But even with Obamacare in place, many home health workers    perhaps 1 in 5    remain uninsured. By contrast, about 8. 6 percent of all Americans lack coverage.
