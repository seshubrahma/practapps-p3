Trump took the oath of office just before noon Friday and then gave his inaugural address. A rally associated with the march was slated for between 10 a. m. and 1 p. m. on Saturday. Some differences to note: Trumpâ€™s speech was on the West Front of the Capitol, which was at capacity on Friday. It was cordoned off and empty on Saturday as protesters gathered on the Mall.
