Ms. Yahya, the analyst, said the refugee decision was part of the growing "moral and reputational toll" from Mr. Trump’s actions in the Middle East. Yet there was not much of an immediate outcry in many countries   —   possibly because, as elsewhere, citizens were becoming slowly used to a steady stream of   yet often perishable, decisions from Mr. Trump’s White House.
