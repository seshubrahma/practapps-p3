UNITED NATIONS   â€”     hours after President Trump swatted away at a broad international consensus on how to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, his United Nations envoy sought to assure the world on Thursday that his administration supports Palestinian statehood but wants a "thinking out of the box" approach. " We absolutely support a   solution," the American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, said in answer to a question after a United Nations Security Council meeting devoted to the   conflict.
