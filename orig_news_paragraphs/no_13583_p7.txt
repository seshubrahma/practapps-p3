"baited" Trump on how rich he is, the loan from his father, a lawsuit in 1972, the birther claims, who he said what to about the Iraq War from 2001 to 2003, and so on. For the media, their gal was winning whenever precious minutes of a   debate were spent rehashing allegations about Trump. Ha ha! We prevented Trump from talking about issues that matter to the American people!
