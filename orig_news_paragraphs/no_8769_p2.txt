When asked if the Senator agrees with the Huffington Post’s   editors’ note, Lee’s office did not answer. Instead, Lee’s office said that he did the interview praising   Senator Warren as part of Lee’s effort to promote his book about defending our Constitution and our fundamental liberties from big government. Sen. Lee’s spokesman said that Lee is opposed to Hillary Clinton winning the election, but  he would not explain how Sen. Lee can be opposed to Clinton while also being opposed to the only person who can beat her. Given that the United States is a   system, and since Trump will be the Republican nominee and Clinton will be the Democratic nominee, only one of them will win the election in November.
