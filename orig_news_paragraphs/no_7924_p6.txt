According to a September 2015 Rasmussen survey, 85 percent black voters oppose Clinton’s refugee agenda to admit more than 100, 000 Middle Eastern refugees —  with less than one percent of black voters (. 56 percent) in favor of her refugee plan. Yet during the Clinton Global Initiative discussion, Bill Clinton seemed to suggest that the U. S. ought to accept more Syrian refugees —  on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U. S. already admits annually from other nations across the globe.
