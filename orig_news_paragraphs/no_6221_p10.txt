DHS and VOICE operate the   Information and Notification Exchange ( ) —  the automated, national system which sends automatic updates regarding custody information about a specific illegal alien charged with, or convicted of, a crime. The   service simply allows anyone, citizens or   to privately keep track of court appearances and release dates. Those who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens have told Breitbart News in detail how difficult it is to seek justice for a child or spouse suddenly cut down because the government refused to enforce the nation’s routine immigration laws. For example, parents may wait years for a trial to take place, may be forced to hire an attorney out of their own pocket as they struggle to pay the bills while mired in grief, and then watch their child’s killer describe exactly how he murdered him while on the stand.
