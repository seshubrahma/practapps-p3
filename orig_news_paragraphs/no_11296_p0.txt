In case you happened to wonder what billionaire businessman, investor, and NBA owner Mark Cuban thinks of a potential Donald Trump presidency, the Dallas Mavericks owner held court on NBC Sports Radio’s Newy Scruggs Show, and informed all that he would rather go flat broke, and experience all Mavericks fans turn on him and his team, than see Donald Trump in the White House. [Cuban told Scruggs, "When it’s all said and done, I’d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president, because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And if it means we have to play in empty arenas, I’m down with that.   "
