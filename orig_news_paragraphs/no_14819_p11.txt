As "Carlos Danger," he abandoned his identity as a nerdy and hyper New York politician and chose one he could use to send pictures of his private parts to a young woman he met on the Internet. He also indulged in conversations that anyone would deem dangerous to the personal and professional   of a member of Congress who was also a (supposedly)   husband and father.     Was Carlos’s last name a subconscious acknowledgment of the   involved when a congressman (and later, a candidate for office) behaves so recklessly? Certainly the contents of Weiner’s messages give us a clue to the insecurity behind the alias.
