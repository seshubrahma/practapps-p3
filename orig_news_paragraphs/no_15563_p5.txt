Trump’s position on the Comey firing has shifted several times over the past few days from a claim that the firing was motivated by a critical memo prepared by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (a claim Rosenstein denies) to the President’s current assertion that he intended to fire Comey before Rosenstein even wrote his memo.    Trump has variously asserted that Comey was incompetent, that morale was low in the FBI and that Comey was a "showboater."   These claims would supply an innocent motive to the firing, though Trump’s loyalty demands and his alleged request that Comey lay off his former national security adviser have caused many to suspect an improper and possibly criminal motivation, even before Friday’s startling developments. Now they can add to the growing stack of motive evidence these accounts of explicit statements to the Russians that the Russia investigation "pressure" was off and the FBI "nut" was out of the way.
