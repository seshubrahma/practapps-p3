Trump has proposed friendlier ties to Moscow, which he said would lead to greater partnership on a series of sticky global issues from Syria to Ukraine. Obama offered a cautious note on developing friendlier ties to Moscow, saying a constructive   relationship is "in America’s interest and the world’s interest."   But he said fostering warmer ties during his presidency was stymied by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s combative stance when he returned to power in 2012.
