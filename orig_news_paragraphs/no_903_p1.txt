Under Mr. Bharara, the office prosecuted Democratic and Republican officials with equal ardor, most notably Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic speaker of New York’s Assembly, and Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican majority leader of the State Senate. His office is preparing to try a group of former aides and associates of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in a   bribery and   case and has been investigating Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign   as part of an inquiry into whether he or other officials exchanged official acts for political donations. The investigation into Mr. de Blasio’s   perhaps the office ’s highest profile continuing inquiry, began roughly a year ago and appears to be in its final stages, with prosecutors and F. B. I. agents interviewing the mayor for four hours two weeks ago.
