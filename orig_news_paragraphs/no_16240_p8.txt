Traditionally, presidential campaigns get supporters involved by encouraging them to visit a local office, where a field leader dispatches them to knock on doors in a neighborhood or make phone calls on behalf of the candidate. But the campaign found a large swath of people who are supportive of the campaign but don’t have the time to put in several hours at the phone bank. The app aims to get those people involved, and the gaming element keeps them coming back. The campaign’s data and research teams also found that key voting demographics      women and Latinos    engage more with game apps than the rest of the population.
