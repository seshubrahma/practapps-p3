More sanctions designed to inflict greater pain on North Korea only steels Pyongyang’s resolve to hold on tight to what it calls the "treasured sword" of a nuclear arsenal.   That brings us to the final, sad irony in these years spent trying to "tighten the noose" around Kim Jong Un’s neck and build a wall around the North Korean economy. The sanctions effort is not only futile, it’s counterproductive and dangerous.   "Comprehensive" sanctions send North Korea deeper into isolation and increase the risks of a war that no one wants, a war that could be truly catastrophic.
