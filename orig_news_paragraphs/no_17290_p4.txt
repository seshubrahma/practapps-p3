According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 14 states added restrictive voting laws between the 2012 and 2016 elections. These states are home to 93 million people and hold 155 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.   A few examples illuminate how this cynical strategy can translate into the Electoral College and tip the balance in a presidential election: In Wisconsin, which Trump won by just over 25, 000 votes, more than 10 times that many eligible voters    as many as 300, 000 people    may have been disenfranchised because they lacked the proper ID under a strict new voter ID law. While some of North Carolinaâ€™s more draconian voting restrictions were struck down just before the election, a purge of early voting sites remained in place.
