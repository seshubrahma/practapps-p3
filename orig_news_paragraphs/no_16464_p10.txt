State Department spokesman Mark Toner said a "wide range" of outside individuals and organizations contact the State Department through both formal and informal channels. " Individuals, including those who have donated to political campaigns,   or foundations    including the Clinton Foundation    may contact or have meetings with officials in the administration," Toner said. Clinton critics have not proven that Clinton or the State Department materially granted any favors to possible donors, but the report and other emerging information is reigniting the firestorm over the foundation.
