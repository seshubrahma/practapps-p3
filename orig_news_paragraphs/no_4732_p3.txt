The territory Dowd carved out for himself was: patriotic sage, above partisanship, announcing on every subject that both sides were wrong, he alone was right. This made him a regular panelist on ABC’s "This Week" with George Stephanopoulos. Dowd’s "both sides are wrong" offering to the   church was condescending and tiresome, but it would help if he were, from time to time, correct. Instead, from the moment Trump announced, Dowd treated us to hilariously boneheaded prognostications that were instantly proved wrong and never acknowledged as he issued each successive boneheaded prediction.
