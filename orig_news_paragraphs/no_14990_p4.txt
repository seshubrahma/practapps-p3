But here’s a secret: When it comes to passing legislation that’s in the best interest of the American people and reflects the priorities of the House Democratic Caucus and candidates, Nancy Pelosi will work to deliver the votes, no matter who’s holding the speaker’s gavel or sitting in the Oval Office. As a member of the House Democratic leadership, I saw firsthand that the path to a majority vote often went through the minority leader ’s office. I would sit in leadership meetings, in that room, amid baseball bats signed by her beloved San Francisco Giants and bowls filled with her favorite chocolates (I always appreciated the symbolism of sweets and baseball bats) while elsewhere, House Speaker Paul Ryan or   John Boehner were struggling  to round up Republican votes to pass legislation vital to the administration of our government.
