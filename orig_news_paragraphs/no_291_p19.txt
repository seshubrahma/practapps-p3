Mr. Trump has not brought along any household staff from Trump Tower, an aide said. The president spent a part of Tuesday poring over artwork from the White House collections, settling on a portrait of Andrew Jackson  —    America’s first populist president, who has been invoked by Mr. Trump’s aides as inspiration   —   to hang in the Oval Office.
