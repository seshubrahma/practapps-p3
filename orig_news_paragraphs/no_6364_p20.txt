If Bernie Sanders’s comments are any indication, they’re more determined than ever to wipe men and women of faith off the public service map. Just because Christians believe what Jesus said about man’s spiritual destiny ("I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me") doesn’t mean they think other faith groups have no rights. On the contrary, Christians are the most consistent defenders of religious liberty for all.
