For military jets, oxygen deprivation has been a nagging problem. The Navy’s    fighter jet pilots experienced a rising rate of "physiological episodes," Navy officials told Congress in March. Navy investigators had identified 382 cases, including 130 that involved some form of oxygen contamination, and 114 with a failure of the jet’s system that maintains cabin pressure. The Air Force’s   fighter pilots also struggled with   symptoms back in 2012, which led to limitations on   flights until the issue was resolved.
