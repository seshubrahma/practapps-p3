House Republicans learned   just how difficult it is to work in tandem with the president and his top advisers on a task as enormous as overhauling Obamacare. Often, it was the President himself who made things unnecessarily difficult    making promises that were not in line with the party message, demonstrating a lack of knowledge on policy details and handing out deadlines on the House conference to act swiftly, even when the votes werenâ€™t there. Over the weekend, Trump tweeted that Republicans should "add more dollars" to health care    a puzzling statement given that this is the opposite of what the House bill would do.   Trump weighed in with another tweet on Tuesday that again demonstrated a lack of understanding about the legislative process.
