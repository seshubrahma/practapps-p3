He seemed to be   and I don’t think Hillary Clinton did a good job at answering it. Woolsey said Trump made an "excellent point" about Clinton and Obama perpetually telegraphing their   strategies to the Islamic State and other enemies: It may not have been optimally applied in this particular discussion, but he’s on to something that the Obama administration and its State Department under Hillary [have] done very badly, which is ignore the substance and be the slave of the narrative.   They fiddle around with the facts, in order to make them fit into their narrative, rather than seeing what reality is, and changing their story to comport with reality if they have to. I think that Trump raised that overall issue well, in terms of not disclosing everything that you are doing, just in order to get good PR.
