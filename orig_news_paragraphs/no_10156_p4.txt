Oregon was an easier win for Sanders, where he took 53 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 47 percent. It was a state that candidate Barack Obama won from Clinton 59 percent to 41 percent in 2008. The real story of the night was the turnout. Going first to the 2008 Kentucky Democratic Primary, Clinton beat Obama, 66 percent to 30 percent with the former secretary of state receiving 459, 511 votes to Obama’s 209, 954.
