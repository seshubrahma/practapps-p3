The New York Times offered a revisionist history of the ongoing crisis at Evergreen State College in Washington on Saturday, ignoring   violence and smearing liberal professor Bret Weinstein (above) who is a victim of the chaos. [The Timesâ€˜ Anemona Hartocollis reported that the college "had to hold its commencement 30 miles from campus, at a rented baseball stadium where everyone had to pass through metal detectors. "   Her explanation of why that came to pass suggests conservative media are to blame for stirring up threats from outside the campus, and totally ignores the violent role of   activists on campus, some of whom have been "patrolling" campus with baseball bats. She ignored critical details in the story, such as the fact that campus police told Weinstein they could not protect him.
