Washington (CNN) For those in the White House yearning for a more controlled structure than existed in Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign, the messy rollout of the executive order restricting travel into the US may have been a gift. White House sources tell CNN the President himself was unhappy with the way it was executed    particularly the backlash caused by poor communication to key agencies and members of Congress. According to sources familiar with internal White House conversations, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus will now take more control of the systems dealing with basic functions, like executive orders.
