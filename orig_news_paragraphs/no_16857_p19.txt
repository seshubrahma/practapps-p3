Even at an event that the Trump campaign billed as a "town hall" in New Hampshire Thursday, the format was such that the nominee didn’t interact with audience members (the questions were read out loud, instead, by moderator Howie Carr) and answered softball questions for just over 30 minutes. The   event will be   by Cooper and ABC’s Martha Raddatz, but the real wild card is the audience members who will grill Clinton and Trump. Past town hall debates have produced famously awkward moments, including John McCain referring to President Barack Obama as "that one," and George W. Bush prompting the audience to bust into laughter with a raise of the eyebrows and a head nod at   President Al Gore. The debate also has the potential to produce some raw interactions between voters and the candidates.
