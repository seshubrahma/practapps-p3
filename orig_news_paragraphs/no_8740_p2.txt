As the Texas GOP’s victory chair, Bush is responsible for turning out the vote for all Republican candidates, including the man who beat his father in this year ’s presidential primary.   The announcement at the SREC meeting where Bush discussed the party’s Victory Fund campaign came just two months after the Land Commissioner said he would not be supporting the party’s nominee despite being appointed as the Victory Fund chairman, Breitbart News reported in June. The younger Bush had received strong criticism from some about taking the position as Victory Fund chair while opposing the person at the top of the ballot.
