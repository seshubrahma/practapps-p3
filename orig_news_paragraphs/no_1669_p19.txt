The deal also failed to mention anything about the presence of foreign Shiite militias   —   such as Hezbollah, which like Al Qaeda and Islamic State is considered a terrorist group by the United States  —   fighting on the Syrian government ’s side. It also said nothing about the tens of thousands of detainees in Syrian government prisons, whose release had long been touted as a possible measure under a deal.
