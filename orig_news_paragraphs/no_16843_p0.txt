WARNING: This story contains graphic language. Donald Trump apologized early Saturday for lewd and sexually aggressive remarks he made a decade ago    and then made it clear he is girding himself for a nasty political battle. The GOP presidential nominee posted a defiant   video just after midnight on social media, telling voters that he is not a "perfect person" and that the words captured by a hot mic in 2005 "donâ€™t reflect who I am."
