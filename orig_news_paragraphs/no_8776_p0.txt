From Andy McCarthy in National Review:  Is Donald Trump the sharia of American politics? I’m having trouble finding much daylight between Islamic law’s repressive blasphemy standards and the mogul’s   sense of privilege. None of us wants to be insulted or smeared. But sharia forbids not only ridicule or slander against Islam it bans any examination that casts Islam in an unflattering light.
