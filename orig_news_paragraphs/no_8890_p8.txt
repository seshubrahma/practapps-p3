Ryan supports the same   policies as Kasich. For example, he favors an "any willing worker" plan that would allow companies to import foreign workers when Americans demand higher wages, and he favors President Barack Obamaâ€™s   Partnership, which would allow U. S. companies to export jobs held by U. S. employees and also to import an unlimited number of foreign workers for service jobs in the United States. In December 2015, Ryan even inserted a new rule in the 2016 budget allowing companies to import roughly 200, 000 extra   per year, even as GOP voters were showing their strong opposition to the use of foreign workers inside the United States. He has reiterated his   opposition to any curbs on immigration and   this year.
