Why would ABC move one of its   flagship series, Marvel’s Inhumans, to Friday night, traditionally a wasteland for unwanted shows? Dungey said on the call that the network wants to make Friday night a "destination" for   and fantasy fans. To achieve that, ABC set its     series Once Upon a Time at 8 p. m. Friday, followed by Marvel’s Inhumans, a superhero   and then once Inhumans finishes its run, the network will run Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. in its place.
