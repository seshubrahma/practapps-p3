Though the health care law may have come to bear President Obama’s name, as Obamacare, its future will be shaped by the president who replaces him   —   and by the next Congress. Hillary Clinton has proposed an array of policies to expand outreach to the uninsured and increase financial assistance to   Americans buying health insurance, policies designed to bring more people into the health law’s programs. She has also proposed introducing public insurance programs for more Americans, including a Medicare   for   people.
