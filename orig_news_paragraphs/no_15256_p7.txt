According to US investigators, corrupt Russian government officials allegedly teamed up with a powerful Russian organized crime organization to pull off that country’s largest ever tax fraud. According to American investigators, in 2007, Russian police raided the offices of Hermitage Capital Management, at that time the largest portfolio investor in Russia. Members of the Russian organized crime ring stole Hermitage’s corporate identity, according to the U. S. federal complaint. The mobsters then created fake subsidiaries and had other corporate entities under their control launch   dollar sham lawsuits against those subsidiaries, US prosecutors allege.
