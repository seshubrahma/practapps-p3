We’re about to enter a place that we’re rarely allowed to go.   This is one of the many housing complexes here in Pyongyang and we’re going to go inside the apartment of a North Korean family. In 12 trips in this country, I’ve actually only been inside a North Korean apartment just twice. This family lives on the 13th floor, and in North Korea, in a lot of the buildings, people don’t use the elevators because of electricity interruptions.
