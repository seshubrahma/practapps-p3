" There is still not an iota of proof that anyone on the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians," said Mr. Stone, who met Mr. Trump through their mutual mentor, the   fixer and lawyer Roy M. Cohn. Mr. Stone learned from Mr. Cohn that all press is good press, and to hit back, hard and often, and he is doing just that. His recent book, "The Making of the President 2016," is part paean to Mr. Trump and part pushback against the claims related to Russia.
