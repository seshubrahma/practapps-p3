Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio’s loss in the Republican presidential primary turned out to be the Florida GOP’s gain, as Rubio    who had planned to retire    was coaxed by GOP leaders into running for a second term.   Rubio’s presence turned his opponent, Rep. Patrick Murphy, from a   recruit into a candidate Democrats considered leaving for dead before a super PAC tied to Harry Reid made a   play in the state.   Murphy has been stung by reports that he inflated his business resume. Rubio, meanwhile, has struggled to distance himself from Trump, and has faced constant questions from Democrats over whether he’d serve a full   term rather than running for president again in 2020.
