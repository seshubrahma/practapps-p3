Only   said it was worse. Hillary Clinton handily won the vote of those who feel things have improved, by a 73% to 21% margin, and more narrowly among those who think the situation is about the same, by a 46% to 44% split.   But some 70% of those with a more dour view voted for Donald Trump, compared to 21% for his Democratic rival. Some 37% of Michigan voters feel their familyâ€™s financial situation has improved, and they overwhelmingly supported Clinton.
