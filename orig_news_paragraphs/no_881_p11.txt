Mr. Krein grew up in Eureka, S. D. and studied political philosophy at Harvard with the noted conservative scholar Harvey C. Mansfield before going into finance, working at Bank of America, the Blackstone Group and smaller firms. (He now works   on the journal.) Heâ€™s also a skilled connector, as the crowd at the Harvard Club attested. The main event was a discussion of globalization between Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and Trump supporter, and   Slaughter, the president and chief executive of the   think tank New America.
