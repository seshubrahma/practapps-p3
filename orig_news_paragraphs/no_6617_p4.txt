But first, a brief word about AHCA.   It was a piece of legislation that nobody truly loved.   It wasn’t ideologically pure enough for libertarian Republicans, and it wasn’t compassionately comprehensive enough for moderate Republicans.   And yet since nothing about AHCA was acceptable to   Democrats, it was entirely up to Republicans to see if they could muster the   needed to pass it.
