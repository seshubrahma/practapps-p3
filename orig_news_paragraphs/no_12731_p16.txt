Voters who considered whether the candidate "is a strong leader," made up 18 percent of the electorate of which Romney won 61 percent and Obama just 38 percent. And voters who thought the most important attribute in a candidate was whether that candidate "has a vision for the future" made up 29 percent of the electorate, 54 percent of which went for Romney and 45 percent for Obama. So, if Romney had convinced the electorate that he â€˜cares about people like" them, he probably would have won in 2012. But he failed, in large part thanks to the "47 percent" comments he made behind closed doors.
