If the Rubio campaign says the decision to scale back advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire is linked to the primary in South Carolina, it seems likely the changes have been made to pay for ads currently reserved in South Carolina. In Iowa, Rubioâ€™s campaign trimmed just over $830, 000 in paid advertising. As noted, the amount cut in New Hampshire is reported to be around $125, 000. Combined, these savings would pay for most of the time Rubio has reserved in South Carolina over the next two weeks.
