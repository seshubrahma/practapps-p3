A person’s PQ indicates the degree to which he is liberal. For instance, as I have calculated, the PQs of Barney Frank ( .) and Nancy Pelosi ( .) are approximately 100. Meanwhile the PQs of noted conservatives Michele Bachmann ( .) and Jim DeMint ( . C.) are approximately 0. Two other people whose PQs are approximately 25 are Bill O’Reilly and Dennis Miller.
