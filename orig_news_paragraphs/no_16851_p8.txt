The ad will air in the battleground states of Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, in addition to time on national cable TV, a Clinton campaign official told CNN. The TV spot evoked the infamous "Daisy" ad President Lyndon Johnson ran against 1964 Republican nominee Barry Goldwater, which featured a little girl counting down petals on a daisy before a man’s voice counts down to a nuclear explosion, featuring a mushroom cloud. The ad is also similar to the Clinton campaign’s "Just One" ad the Clinton campaign aired in August which also warned that Trump was not stable enough to be president and included similar clips of Trump to those used in the latest ad.
