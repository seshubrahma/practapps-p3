European Commission President   Juncker has indicated that he will support parts of the U. S. breaking away as revenge for President Donald J. Trump supporting Britain’s decision to leave the European Union (EU) and predicting other countries will follow. ["The newly elected U. S. president was happy that Brexit was taking place, and asked other countries to do the same," he told at a European People’s Party conference, recalling the president’s prediction that Brexit will be "fantastic" for the United Kingdom.   " If he goes on like that," he said, "I am going to promote the independence of Ohio and Austin, Texas. "
