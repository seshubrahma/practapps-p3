While President Barack Obama has at times opened the American sectors of the Arctic Ocean for oil exploration and at other times banned oil exploration there, the Russian government has had a more consistent and nurturing approach, with oil companies such as   drilling in its own corner of the Arctic Ocean and in western Siberia. In 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin inducted Tillerson into Russia’s Order of Friendship to mark the company’s energy investments in Russia. In 2014,   hit the largest oil deposit in the company’s history, estimated to be larger than the entire Gulf of Mexico. Later in 2014, President Barack Obama placed economic sanctions on Russia —  in response to its aggression into Ukraine —  that shut down  ’s Russian operations before they really began to pay off.
