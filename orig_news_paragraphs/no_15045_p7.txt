These kinds of resolutions have always failed in the past because Russia invariably backs Assad and will almost certainly veto it    as will China.    For obvious reasons, neither Russia nor China are in favor of UN resolutions that condemn the human rights abuses of authoritarian regimes and that may even lead to their ouster.

China and Russia had abstained from the Libyan resolution and neither country plans to make what they regard as a similar mistake again.
