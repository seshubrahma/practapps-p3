@BraddJaffy) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:32 A. M. While obstruction is now off the table for Trump, as Breitbart’s Joel Pollak detailed, Breitbart’s John Hayward notes that obstruction is back on the table for several leading officials from now former President Barack Obama’s administration. Hayward says Congress needs to investigate Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General, as well as Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton —   the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee —  for obstruction of justice.
