In a "loose" market for labor, workers compete against other workers for jobs, so allowing employers to pay lower wages. In a tight market, where there are plenty of unfilled jobs, employers must bargain with employees by offering higher wages and benefits, plus better condition and treatment. That "tight labor market" pressure also prods employers to find, recruit and train marginalized workers, including some of the millions of   men who have quit the labor market since 2008.   A tight labor market also pressures employers to invest in boost their workersâ€™ productivity by buying   machinery, such as tractors, forklifts, and robots.
