While the US possesses overwhelming firepower compared to North Korea, an American strike on North Korea could expose South Korea to devastating casualties in retaliation, experts say. Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at the Rand Corp. think tank, said in an email to CNN that the movement of the Vinson strike group to Korean waters is likely defensive in nature. Sailing with the Vinson are the   destroyers USS Wayne E. Meyer and USS Michael Murphy and the   cruiser USS Lake Champlain, according to a statement from US Pacific Command. The destroyers and the cruiser are all equipped with the Aegis missile defense system.
