In April 1999, Skuratov was fired by Yeltsin’s presidential fiat, and Skuratov’s political patron , Yevgeni Primakov —  who had pushed for the Swiss bribery investigation, but was also often and openly referred to by Yeltsin as his successor —  was knocked out of the running by Putin and his political patrons. It also allowed Putin to show loyalty to the deeply corrupt Yeltsin family, and eventually resulted in the agreement at the foundation of the transfer of power to Putin: don’t investigate The Family, as Yeltsin and his daughter and    were known. Between then and whatever tape the FSB may or may not have of a man who may or may not look like Donald Trump, Putin and the FSB have perfected the art of kompromat.
