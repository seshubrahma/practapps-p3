Trump is also under pressure to take action on NAFTA before Saturday, the 100th day of his presidency, by which point he pledged to make good on a slew of campaign promises. Trump has signed several executive actions on trade    the most significant of which was withdrawing from the   Partnership    but movement on NAFTA has been scarce, despite Trump’s ongoing criticism of the deal. Trump in recent months has labeled NAFTA as a "  deal," called it a "disaster" for the US and has argued that the deal has led to the loss of millions of US manufacturing jobs. But many Republicans on Capitol Hill have expressed concerns about Trump’s hardline on free trade deals.
