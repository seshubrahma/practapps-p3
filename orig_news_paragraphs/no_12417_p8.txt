at the same time I do feel a special responsibility. And you know what, I do feel like kickin’ up my heels a little because I worked in a Republican Party infrastructure that doesn’t always elevate female consultants to the top and that there’s not always an opportunity. But I want everybody to remember, Sonnie, that it was Donald J. Trump who elevated a woman to the highest position in his campaign, much like he has done in the Trump Corporation for a number of decades, and it is he who gave women responsibilities and it is he, by the way, who did the same among female voters as did Mitt Romney and John McCain for all this talk. I mean the first female President, it did not attract a critical mass of women.
