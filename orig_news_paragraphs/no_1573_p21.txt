An analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers last year estimated that about half of the decline in labor force participation since 2009 was caused by aging of the population (which was anticipated in the projection) and about 14 percent from the economic cycle. About a third of the decline was a mysterious "residual": younger people leaving the work force, perhaps because they saw little opportunity or viewed the potential wages they could earn as inadequate. Weak productivity and fewer workers are hits to the "supply" side of the economy. But there is evidence that a shortage of demand is a major part of the problem, too.
