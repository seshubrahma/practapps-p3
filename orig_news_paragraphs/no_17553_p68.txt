It didn’t seem to occur to him that driving the   collectivo, which more or less means following the same   bus route day in and day out, might be boring. To him, he was   running his own business and that’s what was important. For every   rider, almost all Cubans, collectivos make   cents   CUC. Collectivos appeared to always be at or   near their full capacity of five passengers.
