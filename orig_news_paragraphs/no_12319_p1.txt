Thatâ€™s up from a total of 16 dead in 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. The site tracks police and correctional officers killed in routine crime, accidents, and in     attacks, such as the July 7 killing of five cops in Dallas. The latest casualty in what some critics say is a "War on Cops" was Captain Dave Melton, who was shot and killed July 9 while searching for a suspect in Kansas City. The gunman escaped.
