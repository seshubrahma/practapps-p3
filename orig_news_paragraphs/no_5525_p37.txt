There is interesting testimony, I think it was just last week, by the commander of the U. S. Strategic Command, who said that of all the things you need to do to have a worldwide ballistic missile delivery capability for nuclear weapons that he doesn’t think the North Koreans have is the miniaturization issue   —   taking the nuclear device and putting it in a small enough package that it can actually be delivered via missile," Bolton said. " Since we know that Russia and China both obviously mastered that a long time ago, you have to worry that the North may be even closer than we thought," he continued.
