half the country now hates Beyoncé. Her show led police groups to boycott her concerts, even as she audaciously used a police escort to get to the game (and later cashed in on the   sentiment by offering her very own line of "Boycott Beyoncé" merchandise at her tour stops). More division. More disconnection between law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.
