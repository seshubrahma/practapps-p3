On the same show, another Trump backer, Dr. Ben Carson, rebuked Obama for bringing up gun control in his remarks in Poland.   In another tweet, Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King said the Dallas shootings had their roots in "in first of    events illuminated by Obama."  Former Illinois GOP Rep. Joe Walsh meanwhile deleted a tweet saying, "This is now war" against Obama and Black Lives Matter protesters.   Given such sentiment, it is unlikely Washington will be shaken from its political torpor by a summer of violence and rage.   Leadership may come from lower down the political scale.
