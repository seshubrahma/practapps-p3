The Assad regime, in partnership with its Iranian and Russian allies, have been engaged in a pitched battle to restore all of Syria to Assad’s nominal control (I say nominal because, of course, Assad was an Iranian puppet long before the Arab Spring, and Russia presumably has no intention of restoring the port of Tartus to its pal Bashar in the event he reigns once again).   The Obama administration, despite initial unhappiness with the whole Syria mess and Assad himself, largely stood by watching the systematic murder of around half a million Syrians, by some estimates, and fretting whether the feelings of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be hurt if the United States lifted more than a finger to oppose Assad. ISIS, al Qaeda and a variety of other nasties were the greatest beneficiaries of Western indifference and now control major swathes of Syria.   The Syria situation is a mess of almost epic proportions, and even the limited strategy pursued by the Obama administration did much to empower Iran, Russia, al Qaeda and other enemies without advancing the goal of stabilizing Syria.
