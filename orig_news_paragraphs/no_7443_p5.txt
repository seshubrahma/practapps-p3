That data suggests     Rubio voters would support Cruz over Trump, and almost    of Cruz’s supporters would pick Rubio over Trump. This is the second recent poll to show that Rubio doesn’t enjoy a bounce from other establishment candidates getting out of the race. So it is likely that the 26 percent Rubio earns in a   race is the ceiling for an   candidate this cycle. Many pundits have predicted that, if other more mainstream candidates like Chris Christie, Jeb Bush or John Kasich dropped out, Rubio could consolidate their supporters and topple Trump or Cruz from the leading positions.
