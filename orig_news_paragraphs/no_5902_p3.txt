The New York Times reported that when Perry accepted the nomination for Secretary of Energy, he "initially misunderstood" the job and had no clue that the energy secretary is in charge of safeguarding the nuclear arsenal. The source for the Times story, former Trump transition official Michael McKenna, told the Daily Caller Wednesday that the Times misinterpreted him and "of course" Perry understood that the Department of Energy role includes controlling the nationâ€™s nuclear arsenal. Journalists initially cheered the report, but started criticizing the Times story and sharing articles that debunked the original story after it was discovered that the report was false. "
