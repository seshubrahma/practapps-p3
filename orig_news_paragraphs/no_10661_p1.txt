Conspiracy theorists have long claimed that George W. Bush not only failed to stop the   attacks, but that he also knew about them, or engineered them as a pretext to launch a global war. Trump is not going that far, but rather challenging the GOP mantra that "he kept us safe," as Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said in Bushâ€™s defense. Indeed, in the years after   there was only one successful terror attack on U. S. soil, and none from   to 2009. Trump is arguing that Bush was asleep at the switch.
