Despite admitting that it has gone too far to the left by mixing liberal politics with its sports commentary, ESPN announced the return of   Keith Olbermann to the network to host a 25th anniversary special on ESPN Radio. [Olbermann is set to host a   special celebrating ESPN Radioâ€™s 25th anniversary, which airs on January 4th with guests Tony Bruno and Chuck Wilson, according to The Hollywood Reporter.   ESPN fired Olbermann, known for his tirades against Republicans, in 2015 when the network reportedly wanted him to talk about sports and lay off the   political commentary. Also part of ESPN radio from 2005 to 2007, Olbermann served as a   on the "Dan Patrick Show" during that period.
