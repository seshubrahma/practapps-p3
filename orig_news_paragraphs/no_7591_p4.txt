Comey said no charges are appropriate following an extensive investigation of Clinton’s use of a personal   system during her time as Secretary of State. The FBI investigation began as a referral last July from the Intelligence Community Inspector General and focused on whether classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on Secretary Clinton’s personal   servers during her   tenure. " Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case," Comey said.
