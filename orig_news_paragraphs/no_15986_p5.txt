Trumpâ€™s primary campaign relied mainly on personal loans of millions of dollars and free publicity. Already high in name recognition, and prone to outrageous statements, Trump got a huge amount of free media exposure    one study estimated it to be worth $2 billion. By cranking up the outrage and appealing to the Republican base, Trump was able to succeed in the primaries despite being outspent by rivals.    Now that we are entering the general election, it is clear that Trump can use neither outrage nor   to propel himself into competition with Hillary Clinton.
