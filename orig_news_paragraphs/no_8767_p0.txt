Columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s abortion statement during an interview with NBC’s "Today" show isn’t "unreasonable," but it does have a slight "moral contradiction" and "doesn’t square with what he said originally about punishing the woman. So he’s a little bit confused on this" and that there isn’t "an epidemic of transgenders being evil in bathrooms across the country" on Thursday’s "Special Report" on  the Fox News Channel.   Krauthammer said [relevant remarks begin around 4:00] that Trump’s statement that the GOP platform should have exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother for abortion, seems to be something he truly believes, and "[T]here is a split even among conservatives, surely in the country as a whole, on this issue. On the one hand, there’s sort of a moral contradiction.
