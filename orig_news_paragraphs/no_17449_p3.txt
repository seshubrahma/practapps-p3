, The launch comes at a time when global concerns about nuclear proliferation have been on the rise, specifically with the election of Donald Trump as the next US President and recent comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin said last week that he would seek to enhance his countryâ€™s nuclear capabilities. Trump responded on Twitter,  saying "the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes," Trump wrote. The two countries have more than 14, 000 nuclear warheads between them.
