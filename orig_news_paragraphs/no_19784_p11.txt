One of the barriers to   students applying to college is that the U. S.â€™s   system (FAFSA) makes it so that they do not know how much college is going to cost them until they apply. It is no surprise that some students assume they cannot afford college, even though they will in fact not have to pay tuition. " FAFSA simplification only helps those people who got   earlier in high school,"   told me.
