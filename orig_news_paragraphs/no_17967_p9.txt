The White House press secretary told VICE News Thursday that   Sessions did not disclose his meeting because it was "in the   regular course of his work on the Armed Services Committee" and   not as a campaign surrogate. Burr echoed this defense to   reporters on Thursday, saying, "We’re not in the business of   investigating individual senators that say they were doing senate   business. " ’ ’   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah also defended Sessions and attacked   Democrats, several of whom have called for the attorney   general to resign. "
