CLEVELAND, Ohio   —    Members of the Ohio delegation to the Republican National Convention told Breitbart News on Wednesday that despite Gov. John Kasich’s steadfast refusal to back Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, they hoped he would do so. ["I do think, at the end of the day, Gov. Kasich and Trump [need to] come together for the sake of the party," said Ed Anderson, a voting delegate from University Heights.
