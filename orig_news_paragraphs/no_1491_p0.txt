The ambush that left five police officers dead at a protest in Dallas on Thursday has altered the contours of the presidential campaign, with Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump canceling political events on Friday and striking different tones about the killings. Mr. Trump called the episode "an attack on our country," and Mrs. Clinton used it as evidence of the need for "more love and kindness. " "We must stand in solidarity with law enforcement, which we must remember is the force between civilization and total chaos," Mr. Trump said in a video statement that his campaign released to TV networks on Friday evening. He also alluded to the two black men, Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. who were killed by white police officers this week.
