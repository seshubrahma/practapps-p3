Last week, CNN revealed that the FBI’s counterintelligence team is still investigating whether there was a computer server connection between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank during the U. S. election, according to sources close to the investigation.   The CNN report showed that the corporations offered only possible explanations     but no proof    as to why Alfa Bank was repeatedly looking up the contact information for a computer server used by the Trump Organization.   But on Friday, Alfa Bank claimed hackers are now trying to perpetuate that suspicion by tricking the Trump Organization into sending communication toward the bank.   According to the bank: The idea here is that hackers recently knocked on the Trump server’s door, but posed as Alfa Bank    so the Trump server sent the bank real, unsolicited responses.
