Morello concludes.   Morello’s     video was part of an intro to musician Ryan Harvey’s updated version of the song "Old Man Trump "  —   which was inspired by folk singer Woody Guthrie’s unrecorded 1950s song of the same name, that assails Donald Trump’s father, Fred Trump, as a racist. The lyrics for Harvey’s version, on which Morello is featured, of "Old Man Trump" were originally written by Guthrie, and recently discovered by professor of American literature and culture at the University of Central Lancashire in Britain Will Kaufman.
