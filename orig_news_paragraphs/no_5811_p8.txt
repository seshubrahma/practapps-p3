In August 1978, Islamic militants and fanatics within the current Iranian regime set the famous Rex Movie Theatre in Abadan on fire, killing hundreds of innocent  . Reports later revealed that several   Islamists set the theater on fire using gasoline and lighting it with a match. They then ran to the exterior of the theater and locked the doors so no one could get out, except for those who were able to escape through the roof. In a speech this month in the East Azerbaijan region of Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said the regimeâ€™s "real war" with the west is a "culture war" taking place on the TV and the Internet.
