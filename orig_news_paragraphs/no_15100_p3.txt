These trips included personal trips   including ski trips to Aspen and the Obama’s annual family vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts    and work trips, like a visit to Everglades National Park on Earth Day in 2015. Trump’s frequent weekend travel makes it all but certain the 45th President will surpass Obama’s spending in his first term, likely within months. The spending comes as Trump asks the federal government to slash   spending by $54 billion, including deep cuts to the State Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency and the wholesale elimination of other federal programs. The proposed cuts, which are unlikely to be adopted in total, will correspond with $54 billion in increases to defense spending.
