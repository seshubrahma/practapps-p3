In general, the Electoral College’s   bias does hurt the Democrats. In fact, the   bias tipped the 2000 election. Al Gore would have won the presidency, 225 to 211, if electors were just awarded by representative, not by senators and representatives. But the   bias was almost entirely irrelevant to Mr. Trump’s advantage.
