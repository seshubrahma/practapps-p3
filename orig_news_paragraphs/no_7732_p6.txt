And when I hear Republican and conservative elites lecture the rest of us about Trumpâ€™s supposed deviations from their ideological strictures, or his shortcomings as a human being, I think about what Jesus said about casting the first stone. I seriously doubt any of these critics would be able to stand up to the same type of scrutiny they are giving Trump, assuming they had to guts to get into the arena. Be clear about the alternative Hillary Clinton cannot be president of the United States under any circumstances. She is bereft of integrity and honesty.
