Each man is essentially being asked to shed part of his core political persona in the interest of party unity. For Mr. Sanders to step away from the roaring crowd, or for Mr. Trump to back away from a televised brawl, would represent a wrenching departure from form. Mindful of that, Democrats want to ease Mr. Sanders from the race without alienating his supporters. In a taped appearance for "The Tonight Show" that will air Thursday night, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Sanders, saying he brought "enormous energy" and "new ideas" to the campaign, making Mrs. Clinton better.
