How about someone found the Northern Poverty Law Center (NPLC) to document actual hate crimes and expose the hoaxes being spit out on an assembly line by the SPLC? Maybe the Koch brothers could get back in Trumpâ€™s good graces by funding this   service. The    NPLC ought to be in the Rolodexes of every media organization, so they can stop reporting fake news and start covering the real hate crimes currently ignored by the press. The only incidents of actual "hate" since the election have been entirely in one direction: against (mostly white) Trump supporters.
