Dr. Jessen soon left his military position to help set up the C. I. A. interrogation program, along with Dr. Mitchell. The two men eventually created their own company, Mitchell, Jessen and Associates, which received $81 million from the C. I. A. to manage the program. The existence of the 2002 memo was mentioned in the Senate report on detainee abuse published in 2008, but the document itself had not previously been made public. The memo recommended practices similar to those later used at C. I. A. sites, such as holding only one or two "subjects" at a time and having an "operational team" that included a psychologist, interrogators, interpreters, guards, a physician, an intelligence officer and other support personnel, including video technicians.
