Trump demanded Tuesday that his fellow Republicans act immediately to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He told The New York Times that he wants a repeal vote to happen "some time next week" followed by a vote on a replacement bill "very quickly or simultaneously." According to the Times, Trump said "he would not accept a delay of more than a few weeks before a replacement plan was voted on. " Congressional Republicans, however, are nowhere close to proposing a plan to replace the sweeping healthcare law, let alone having something in place that can be voted on, withstand a Senate filibuster and be sent to the White House for Trumpâ€™s signature.
