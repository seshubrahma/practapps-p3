People in this heavily industrialized city just south of Chicago are also asking why their governor, Mike Pence, the Republican   nominee, visited flood victims in Baton Rouge, La. this month while campaigning with Donald J. Trump, but has not found time to come to East Chicago. Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pence, wrote in an email that he had "directed his staff and cabinet to provide support to the federal government" there, and that some of his staff and cabinet members visited the area last week. But the most pressing question for residents is why they were not informed until last month that even the top six inches of soil in their yards had up to 30 times more lead than the level considered safe for children to play in, and that it also had hazardous levels of arsenic. Farther down, the contamination is much worse.
