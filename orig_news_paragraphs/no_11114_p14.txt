In Washington D. C. George Washington University has created a portal where local employers can hire its foreign graduates instead of Americans. The practice is normal at many universities around the country, which use the promise of Americans jobs to recruit foreign students. Nationwide, Americans companies employ at least 120, 000 foreign graduates via the "Optional Practical Training" visa, instead of hiring young American graduates. American universities also employ almost 100, 000 of the roughly 650, 000   working in the United States.
