Social media erupted after Avengers director Joss Whedon attacked President Donald Trump’s    Jared Kushner and compared his wife, Ivanka Trump, to a dog. ["Hey, keep your eyes on this fu*king prize too. He’s a Voldemort in training," Whedon wrote on Twitter Tuesday, sharing a photo of Jared Kushner standing next to Trump in the Oval Office.   "Unlike the Pekingese he married under, can play the long game," Whedon wrote, comparing Ivanka to the dog breed.
