Trump takes the border and the Jihadi threat seriously. Whatever you think of Donald Trump’s positions, including their various incarnations over the course of the campaign, he has taken perhaps the strongest stance in the originally   GOP field on immigration.

If he decides to totally abandon those positions, he couldn’t possibly be worse than Hillary Clinton on border security.
