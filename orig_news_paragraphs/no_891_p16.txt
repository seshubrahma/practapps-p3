Within the T. S. A. the proposal calls for the elimination of a handful of programs that have played a critical role in airport security and counterterrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. They include a program that trains pilots to respond to an attempted armed takeover of the cockpit a grant program that supports local law enforcement patrols at airports and another, the Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response program, that sends both undercover and highly visible officers to conduct security sweeps in   airports and train stations. At FEMA, potential cuts would target for reduction an array of grants to state and local governments that have helped fund the development of emergency preparedness and response plans for natural disasters and   events. The proposed savings would allow the Homeland Security Department to take significant steps toward addressing Mr. Trumpâ€™s priorities along the border between the United States and Mexico.
