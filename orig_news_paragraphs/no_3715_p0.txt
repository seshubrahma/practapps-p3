President Donald Trump urged members of the NATO alliance to start paying their fair share Thursday in Brussels, pointing out that their failures were hurting American taxpayers. ["NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations," Trump said, pointing out that 23 of 28 members were still not paying enough money for their national defense and even owed a great deal of money.   " This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States," Trump said, reminding the foreign leaders that the United States spent more on defense than all the other nations together.
