Prosecutors said Mr. Rogata, who lives in Virginia, walked into the Midtown tower ’s atrium, sneaked into a   area and began his climb of the building’s exterior on the fifth floor. Mr. Rogata had been scaling the building for nearly three hours when he was grabbed by officers who had removed a window on the 21st floor. The climb, which was watched by millions of viewers on television and online, as well as hundreds of people from the streets below, was the latest   chapter for Trump Tower, since Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign there last summer.
