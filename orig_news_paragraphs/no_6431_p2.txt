A strong   relationship is in all of our best interests. In that same vein, the United States will continue to work closely with our EU friends, and chart a path forward on   negotiations. At the same time, we are committed to work with President Trump and your government to achieve a bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Great Britain. This is one of the bipartisan messages I bring with me: that the United States stands ready to forge a new trade agreement with Great Britain as soon as possible, so that we may further tap into the great potential between our people.
