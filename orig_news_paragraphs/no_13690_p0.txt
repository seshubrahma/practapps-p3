  Donald Trump is noting the death of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro by urging Cuba to seek freedom. ["Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades," Trump said in a statement, noting that Fidel Castro’s legacy was "one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. "   Trump called for Cubans to seek a better life, despite Fidel’s brother Raul Castro’s firm grip of power over it’s citizens. "
