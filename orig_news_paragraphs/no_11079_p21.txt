There could be some discussion of policy and all that instead of personal ugliness. So I am not engaging anymore because I see no hope, I do see hope where the people who are thinking to vote for this candidate, I think it is plenty clear, his surrogates will not admit, it’s plenty clear to the world that this person is not fit for the office he’s seeking. He wants to do everything, I will do it by myself, I will do it in democracy, you cannot do this. That is against the basic principle of democracy.
