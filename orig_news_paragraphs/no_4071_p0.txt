Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions told the Senate Tuesday morning that voters believe immigration policy should prioritize the needs of American workers. [Sessions’ remark came when Democratic Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin claimed Sessions would not support a "humane" rewrite of the nation’s immigration law. " There’s not a spot of evidence in your career to suggest that as Attorney General you would use the authority of that office to resolve the challenges of our broken immigration system in a fair and humane manner," Durbin said to Sessions.
