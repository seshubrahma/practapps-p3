 (CNN) Federal appeals court judges appeared divided Monday after hearing the Trump administration’s defense of its travel ban, with one saying President Donald Trump never disavowed his campaign statements on keeping Muslims out of the country and another asking if the ban would still be illegitimate if Trump hadn’t won the election. " He’s never repudiated what he said about the Muslim ban," Judge Robert B. King said, underscoring a key rationale for a Maryland federal district court’s halt to the ban: That it is intended, as evidenced by Trump’s campaign statements, to target Muslims and is therefore discriminatory.
