2. A friend of mine who lives in Utrecht, Holland, described to me what itâ€™s like living in her community now. She said she used to be able to walk freely anywhere, in any neighborhood regardless of what she was wearing without being harassed. She described it as a "free society," not having to worry about her safety.
