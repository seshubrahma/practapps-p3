I am glad to see that the Senate is still functioning amid such hysteria. Senator Warren is championing a hysterical and inflammatory approach toward moving forward. She is convinced of her own righteousness, and is unfit for office, as she and others like her are the bigots, filled with hate and unwilling to hear nor consider opposing points of view.   â€”
