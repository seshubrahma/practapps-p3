A group of Indian scientists think it might have brought Everest down a few feet.    So, they want to send a team of about 30 researchers and surveyors to measure the mountain.   Theyâ€™d use GPS and triangulation to do it and the estimated cost of the project, about $800, 000.   It takes months of planning and the scientists have to consult with Nepal and China first.
