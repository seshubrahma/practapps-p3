The millionaire then went on to say that he supported private education in some circumstance. It was also reported today that the Organisation of Economic   and Development (OECD) has slammed the UKâ€™s state education system for providing only "superficial" teaching. Mr. Blair said there is "real anxiety" about the world changing, but argued that attributing falling wages to migration is wrong and simplistic.
