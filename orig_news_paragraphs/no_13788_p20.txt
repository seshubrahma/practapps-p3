If so, then politicians could ban anyone, even on the basis of race, religion, or national origin. Second, they could say that the Fifth Amendment is irrelevant, but when a court reviews an   claim here, strict scrutiny does not apply because the ban is not based solely on race, nationality, or religion. Instead, it is a ban on potential immigrants who fit a   profile, which applies only to specific parts of multiple nations. Religion is only one factor among several.
