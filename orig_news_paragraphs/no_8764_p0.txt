Activists on Friday called for presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to come to Twin Falls, Idaho, in order to address a vile rape allegedly perpetrated by Middle Eastern Muslim refugees against a      child, challenging them to "see how America is being changed by this new crisis" of Third World migrants.   As Breitbart News previously reported,    and    Muslims allegedly orally raped the the victim, and the    suspect allegedly anally raped her as well. Another alleged perpetrator recorded the attack while coaching them throughout the rape. The rapists also defiled their victim by urinating on her clothes and in her mouth.
