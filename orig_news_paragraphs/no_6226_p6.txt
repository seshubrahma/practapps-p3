Passing a spending bill will require the support of at least eight Senate Democrats, making a compromise all but unavoidable. In one prospective deal, reported by The Hill on Tuesday, Democrats would agree to only a $15 billion increase in military spending, in exchange for Republicans agreeing to fund healthcare subsidies. With $5 billion slated for war fighting, that would leave $10 billion for more troops and the things Trump said he wanted to spend on. Republican defense hawks on Capitol Hill are fuming, and donâ€™t understand why Trump, or any administration official, is not fighting for his original $30 billion request, according to a source.
