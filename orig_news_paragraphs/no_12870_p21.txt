Lessig has been a close associate of Free Press founder Robert W. McChesney, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at   who has called for the U. S. capitalist system to be dismantled and replaced with a   system. " In the end, there is no real answer but to remove brick by brick the capitalist system itself, rebuilding the entire society on socialist principles," McChesney wrote in a 2009 essay. Lessig and McChesney have worked on projects together and have   academic papers and opinion pieces in major newspapers.
