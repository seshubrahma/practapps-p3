Few public details are available about Mr. Giuliani’s role in the real estate venture, and Mr. Berman did not return a call for comment. But some of Mr. Giuliani’s work for TriGlobal, which has offices in Moscow and Kiev, Ukraine, is featured on the company’s website. In 2004, for instance, the company arranged to have Mr. Giuliani come to Moscow to meet with the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, as well as other prominent Russian politicians and business executives. That year, Mr. Giuliani visited Magnitogorsk, Russia, "for a series of meetings with Viktor Rashnikov," a Russian billionaire who is the chairman of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works.
