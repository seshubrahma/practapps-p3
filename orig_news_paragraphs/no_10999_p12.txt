I just hope and pray for the country and for the efforts to drain the swamp that Donald Trump has that conversation with the kids, and they set up a very, very high wall between the family’s business interests and the official business that he does as President of the United States," Schweizer declared. He saw many potential conflicts of interest for the Trump family, given how close the   is to his children and how he has relied on them as advisers and surrogates in the past. " I’m particularly sensitive, in light of what happened with the Clinton Foundation, that when the Trumps are doing business in real estate, which is a highly political business to begin with, and they go to places like Dubai or Russia or places in Latin America, you are de facto doing business with the governments in those countries, and they could make sweetheart deals with the Trumps to curry favor," he noted.
