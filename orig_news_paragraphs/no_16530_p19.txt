• To summarize, we know that wealthy people can use borrowing plus interest deductions to pay little or no taxes while living large that Trump is a major borrower, including of at least $160 million last year alone that Trump showed interest (small pun intended) in few details of his tax plan other than the child care deduction and the continued interest deductibility for business loans that Trump’s child care deduction would hugely benefit wealthy working parents like Ivanka that Trump’s ultimate tax plan diverges from the Republican   tax policy du jour, mainly in its continued deduction for business loan interest that this deviation alone has a whopping $1. 2 trillion dollar budgetary cost that his campaign seems not generally aware of this fact about Trump’s own tax plan that Trump’s disclosed tax returns from decades past show little or no tax and that Trump claims to be under autit now and won’t release his tax returns. These facts strongly suggest an impulsive leader who never strays too far from his personal   in making public policy decisions, who personally likes debt and uses it aggressively and hates paying taxes himself. Whatever else one thinks of Hillary Clinton, there is no doubt that her own taxes would rise under her own tax plan.
