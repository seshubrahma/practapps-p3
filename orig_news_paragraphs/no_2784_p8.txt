Trump and Cramer are two peas in the climate denial pod, who would make reckless attacks on the progress we have made in the fight against climate change," Seth Stein, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, said in response to news reports Thursday afternoon about Mr. Cramerâ€™s briefing paper. If Mr. Trump were to acknowledge the reality of climate change, that might provide some Republican politicians with political cover to do so as well. Since 2010, when a Republican member of Congress, Bob Inglis, lost his   bid after saying he would favor a carbon tax, many in the party have regarded any mention of climate change as the equivalent of political suicide. (Mr. Inglis has since focused on persuading conservatives to be "less averse" to addressing climate change, and started a nonprofit group, the Enterprise and Energy Initiative, focusing on conservative responses to the problem.)
