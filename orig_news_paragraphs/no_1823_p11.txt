Itâ€™s well served by the subway system (2, 3, B, Q) and was a great launching pad for getting into surrounding neighborhoods. While I shared a bathroom with a visiting couple, perks like the outdoor roof deck made this a great bargain. It was late when I checked into my Airbnb, and I needed to fill my stomach with either food or alcohol, preferably both. I ended up at a fun Bushwick night spot, Bossa Nova Civic Club, avoiding the $10 cover charge by entering before midnight.
