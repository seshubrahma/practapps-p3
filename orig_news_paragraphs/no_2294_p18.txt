Mr. Rybolovlev denied the claims, adding that the trusts were created years before the divorce. Last fall, the two reached a settlement and agreed to end all legal actions related to the divorce, including the claims over the Palm Beach property. In the eight years after the purchase, Mr. Rybolovlev quietly entertained offers on the home, according to local brokers, but none met his asking price of more than $125 million. In March, the Palm Beach Architectural Commission approved the demolition of the estate.
