A long immigration journey, The Assalis are Orthodox Christians, a group that has faced extreme persecution in Syria.   Their relatives, whom Sarmad and Sarah Assali did not want to identify for their protection, began their immigration process in 2003. In late 2015 they were finally approved to enter the United States on an   visa for brothers and sisters of US citizens. The relatives finalized their paperwork, immigration interviews and medical examinations during a   trip to Jordan in late December last year.
