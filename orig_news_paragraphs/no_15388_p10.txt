party may do stunningly well in next month’s parliamentary elections, giving him a chance of forming an effective government. French politics may realign with a modern   party, mildly   but socially liberal on one side and more socially conservative and zealously   on the other.   But I wouldn’t bet on it.   In particular, whatever happens on the left, it looks as though Le Pen is going to dominate the French political right for the foreseeable future.
