A spokesman for Mr. Soros, Michael Vachon, said he had no comment. Mr. Buffett has frequently criticized tax laws and loopholes for enabling him to pay a smaller share of his income in taxes than his secretary. The   Buffett rule, which has been endorsed by Mrs. Clinton, would require people who earn more than $5 million to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. Mr. Buffett did concede that his tax payments have, at times, been much smaller.
