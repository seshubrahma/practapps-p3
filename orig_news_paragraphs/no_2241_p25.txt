Jarrett Hill, a Twitter user whose biography describes him as an interior designer and journalist, apparently first noticed the resemblance between Ms. Trump’s speech and Mrs. Obama’s in 2008. Mr. Hill, a television journalist who was recently laid off, said that one of Ms. Trump’s lines  —   the words "strength of your dreams "  —   caught his attention as he was watching on his computer from a Starbucks in Los Angeles, juggling Facebook chats and browsing Twitter. He tracked down the clip of Mrs. Obama’s speech online and noticed that parts of the two speeches were nearly the same.
