For instance, we might point to World War II.   During that conflict, from 1941 to 1945, the population of the US was about 133 million.   And yet in 2010, less than 5. 5 million Americans were over the age of 85 that is, born in 1925 or earlier.   Which is to say, the number of Americans today who could have had any adult participation in the war is small —  and rapidly getting smaller, as old age takes its toll.
