The comments by Conway and Pence brought criticism from the Clinton campaign. " Donald Trump has stated very clearly throughout his campaign that he will deport everyone who is undocumented, something that was reinforced in his speech in Arizona last Wednesday," Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in statement Sunday afternoon.   "What we saw today is Mike Pence and Trumpâ€™s top campaign officials attempt to mislead voters about their mass deportation policy by using soft words to describe harsh tactics    one of the oldest tricks in the book," Mook added.
