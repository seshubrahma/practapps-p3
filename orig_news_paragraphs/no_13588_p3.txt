Mr. Neil challenged the new leader, remarking that now Britain had voted for Brexit UKIP was a party without purpose. Explaining that UKIP still had to stand for Brexit actually taking place and listing the divisions and weaknesses in Britain’s other political parties for UKIP to exploit, she said: "We are the only party 100 per cent committed to Brexit. We’ve got a Tory government that’s still split, a Labour party that has no idea which direction it is going in, you’ve got what’s left of the rump of the Liberal Democrats that are now relying on their single voice in Europe to get their message across. "
