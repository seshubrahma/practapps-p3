Then there’s Rodrigo Duterte, the thug President of the Philippines    our ally. Here’s a man who has bragged about committing murder, mused about missing out on raping a young female missionary, called Obama an S. O. B. threatened to pull out of the military alliance with the United States, and who just happens to be presiding over an   operation that by some estimates has involved the extrajudicial killing of some 7, 000 people. Did I mention he’s our ally? Well, he got a call this weekend from President Trump, which on the face of it isn’t a bad thing.
