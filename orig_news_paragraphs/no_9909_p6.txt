these   workers need to accept lower wages to obtain work in other sectors (such as landscaping or construction). Further, the competition provided by these workers helps to lower the wages of similar workers already employed in these sectors. In short, while it is impossible to replace a waitress (a job in the   restaurant sector) with imports, her wages are harmed by having to compete with apparel workers who have lost jobs due to increased trade flows. While the federal data reveals that manufacturing job loss since NAFTA has been substantial, economists note that much of U. S. job loss is a result of the United Stateâ€™s trading relationship with China.
