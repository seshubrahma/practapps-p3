A former Republican strategist and ad man who was friends with Mr. Trump long before his ouster, Mr. Ailes had reviewed some of the initial television commercials Mr. Manafort had overseen and told Mr. Trump in blunt terms that they were lackluster. Only on Tuesday was Mr. Manafort informed of the campaign’s impending   to be announced the next day: Ms. Conway would become campaign manager, and Mr. Bannon would become the campaign’s chief executive, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussion. At the same time, the new accounts of Mr. Manafort’s ties to Ukraine quickly eroded the support that he had from Mr. Trump’s family during his earlier battles with Mr. Lewandowski. According to people briefed on the matter, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    expressed increasing concern after a  Times article published on Sunday about allegations of cash payments made to Mr. Manafort’s firm for his work on behalf of his main client, Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukranian president, who is an ally of Mr. Putin.
