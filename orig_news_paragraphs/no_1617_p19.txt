A move to tone things down at this stage of the race could anger Mr. Trumpâ€™s base of supporters. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa and one of the most conservative voices on immigration in the Republican caucus, said that he was not concerned that Mr. Trump is changing his position, given the ambiguity of his comments and the close counsel he keeps from the likes of Mr. Sessions. But he conceded that he would be troubled if Mr. Trump did change his sentiment on mass deportations, or if he were to advocate a "touchback" system in which people would return to their home country and then apply for visas to return to the United States under an expedited process.
