—   Ohio newspaper gives Kasich’s rationale for staying in the race to become the favored establishment candidate. The Marco Rubio campaign touted big donors and endorsers including former presidential nominee Bob Dole and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. The John Kasich team touted fewer new endorsements and billionaire backers, but countered with polling that showed the Ohio governor locked with Rubio in some upcoming primary states. At stake: the title of the Republican establishment’s choice, tasked with taking on frontrunner Donald Trump.
