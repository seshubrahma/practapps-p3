Moreover, because farmers typically had heavy debt as they borrowed to pay for their land and to harvest their crops, many   agriculturalists found themselves slipping into debt peonage.   And yet because of deflation, they had an even harder time paying back their debts, because as the price level fell, they found themselves forced to pay back in "more expensive" money.   The result was a wave of bankruptcies and foreclosures across the Farm Belt in Kansas, for example, the banks ended up owning 45 percent of the land.    The populist policy prescription, therefore, included enough inflation to get the price level back at least to where it had been two decades earlier their preferred policy lever to raise prices was the additional coinage of silver as a way of getting more money into circulation.
