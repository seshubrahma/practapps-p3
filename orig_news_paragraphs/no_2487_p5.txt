As voting results were updated this week, Mr. Trumpâ€™s lead in Pennsylvania had shrunk by about 20, 000 votes. Mrs. Clinton would have needed to be declared the winner in all three recount states to overturn the Electoral College result. While the statewide effort was withdrawn, a related campaign to recount votes in targeted precincts in places like Philadelphia is continuing, but it would fall far short of the statewide recount Ms. Stein had sought. Ms. Stein has gained more traction pushing for recounts in the other two battleground states, where Mr. Trump leads by narrow margins.
