After Clinton’s event at an old train station, I was escorted up to an office where she was finishing an interview for "Good Luck America," a political news show on Snapchat. The waiting area was arrayed with cushioned chairs, tables and reception desks. It felt like a doctor’s office. I took a seat next to Dan Schwerin, Clinton’s speechwriter, and Brian Fallon, the campaign’s national spokesman.
