Mr. Comey has argued that the highly charged claim is false and must be corrected, they said, but the department has not released any such statement. Mr. Comey, who made the request on Saturday after Mr. Trump leveled his  allegation on Twitter, has been working to get the Justice Department to knock down the claim because it falsely insinuates that the F. B. I. broke the law, the officials said. A spokesman for the F. B. I. declined to comment. Sarah Isgur Flores, the spokeswoman for the Justice Department, also declined to comment.
