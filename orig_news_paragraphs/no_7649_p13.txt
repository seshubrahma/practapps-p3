She is voting for Donald Trump because he understands the existential threat to our way of life in America and will make the tough decisions to protect Americans from this threat. Hillary Clinton will go out of her way not to offend the very people who are here to kill us. My friend does not like the way that Donald Trump sometimes says things. She cares far less about how people say things than what they do.
