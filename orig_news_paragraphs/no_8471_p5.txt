You can draw a straight line from Anita Hill’s hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to "journalist" George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.

Trump’s policies include a   plan, a     declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with   abortion that tracks with the majority of the country.
