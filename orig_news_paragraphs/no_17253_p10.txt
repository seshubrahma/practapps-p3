Van der Bellen’s apparent win marks a significant change to Austria’s political landscape, which has been dominated by two centrist parties since the end of the war. The original presidential vote was held in May, with Van der Bellen, a former Green Party leader, defeating Hofer by little more than 30, 000 votes in a tightly fought contest decided by   ballots. But the results were challenged by Hofer and his party, and were eventually annulled over concerns about how some ballots were handled.   This time around, Van der Bellen’s margin was expected to have increased tenfold, to more than 300, 000 votes, he said in an address on Austrian state TV.
