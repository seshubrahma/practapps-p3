Spicer, appearing in a West Wing hallway after the President brushed off the questions about Flynn, said that Trump was "evaluating the situation" with input from Pence. Spicer was reading from a statement he had just composed in the Oval Office with Trump and chief of staff Reince Priebus, whose own standing in the administration recently emerged as a subject of speculation. As descriptions of Flynn’s standing evolved, Conway darted into Spicer’s office, leaving a few moments later. Just before 6 p. m. ET, the press secretary told reporters that Trump wanted to make known he was assessing Flynn’s actions.
