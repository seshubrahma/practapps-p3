In a sense, Mr. Cameron is as much in denial about Britain’s role in the European Union, and the European Union’s role in Britain  —   as the Democrat Party of the United States is about the role of radical Islam in global terror. In 2016, the biggest news story in the world should no doubt be Britain’s membership of the European Union. In fact it could be the biggest moment this decade, if the British public declares with one voice: "We will not go quietly into the night, we will not vanish without a fight". If we do vote to leave, as I hope we do, we should indeed publish a Declaration of Independence from the European Union, and we should absolutely declare the day of victory to be Britain’s very own Independence Day.
