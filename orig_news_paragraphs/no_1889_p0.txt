  Donald J. Trump will not be sworn in for two more months, but as of next week, the big gold letters spelling out his name will be removed from three large apartment buildings on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, tenants were told on Tuesday. Hundreds of tenants at the buildings at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard, which contain a total of 1, 325 apartments, signed a petition to "Dump the TRUMP name," last month after Mr. Trumpâ€™s provocative campaign statements had offended women, immigrants and liberals on the Upper West Side. The buildings, between 66th and 69th Streets, along Riverside Boulevard, are owned not by Mr. Trump but by Equity Residential, a publicly traded company based in Chicago, which bought them in 2005 for $809 million. Mr. Trump, a Republican, had been involved in the development known at various times as Riverside South and Trump Place.
