One of the arguments often made by border politicians deals with the use of outdated statistics by the FBI that do not take into account the types of crimes relevant to border cities.   Breitbart Texas has reported in the past as to how the FBI Uniform Crime Report focuses on some metrics such as murder, car theft, and rape but overlooks human trafficking, alien smuggling, drug trafficking, kidnapping, and other crimes relevant to drug cartels operating along the border. The UCR report also does not quantify crimes such as robberies under the current metric, there is no difference between a suspect using a knife to steal a wallet versus a team of cartel gunmen storming a house in south Texas. Unlike other criminal organizations, drug cartels have branched out their operations to include human smuggling, trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and other violent crimes.
