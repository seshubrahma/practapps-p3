In short order one of the suspects pointed a   pistol at the officers and was killed, according to CBS. In the hours after the shooting groups of residents in the mostly   neighborhood gathered near the crime scene and soon began taunting police officers investigating the incident. The taunting continued for some time and then turned violent, with police cars being swarmed and pelted with bricks and rocks as a   riot broke out. Some 100 protesters engaged in a standoff with police, some of whom had responded in riot gear.
