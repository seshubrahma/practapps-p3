The intelligence failures of   and Iraq WMD are still fresh and searing. But castigating intelligence officials because they don’t succeed every time is like saying Stephen Curry is a terrible NBA basketball player because he doesn’t make every   shot he takes. Intelligence agencies are paid to pierce the fog of the future as best they can. They tackle the toughest targets —  trying to divine the capabilities and intentions of adversaries who hide in caves, send children to be suicide bombers, enrich uranium in secret underground facilities, seek space weapons that could destroy GPS and every digital system people use, and would detonate a nuclear bomb in a New York minute to take out New York City if they ever got one.
