Washington (CNN) A West Virginia lawmaker said Saturday he regrets tweeting that Hillary Clinton should be "hung on the mall in Washington, D. C.," as punishment for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. But Michael Folk, a member of West Virginiaâ€™s House of Delegates, said he still believes Clinton should be tried for treason after an FBI investigation determined she handled classified information on the server. The FBI recommended earlier this month that charges not be brought against Clinton or her staffers.
