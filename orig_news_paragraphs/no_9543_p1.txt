If history repeats itself and those top issues are also the major concerns for North Carolina voters in the 2016 general election, it will bode well for Trump, according to several recent polls. A number of surveys in North Carolina suggest voters found the top issues for the 2016 election are education, jobs, and the economy. For example, a recent survey of 1, 530 voters conducted by Elon University found North Carolina voters are most concerned with education. Jobs and wages came in second, followed by the economy as the third top issue.
