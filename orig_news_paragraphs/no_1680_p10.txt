Have we really reached the point that it’s O. K. for The Times to refer to Clinton in bold type as "The Bitch America Needs"? Dry said she was unaware of a previous time when the word was used in a headline. What bothered me about the headline was that it seemed to come from the voice of The Times, at least when you come on it cold, as all readers do. It’s one thing for an author, under her own byline and in the context of her ideas, to write the type of opinion piece Zeisler did.
