Mr. Sandersâ€™s aides in the 1990 campaign said they would regularly taunt Mr. Smith about his positions on issues like the minimum wage, which the congressman would dispute, and then Mr. Sanders would come forward and accuse Mr. Smith of dishonesty.

" The tool he uses is his intensity and his belief that, on the major issues he cares about, there is only one right answer," Mr. Smith said.
