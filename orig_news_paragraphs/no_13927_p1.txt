It will likely mean questions over the role of FBI Director James Comey in the fading days of the election, which Democrats believe helped cost them the presidency, will linger on long into the administration of Donald Trump. Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said the decision to initiate a review was prompted by requests from numerous members of Congress and public inquiries. Horowitz’s office said the review will examine several allegations, including that DOJ or FBI policies were not followed when Comey publicly stated last July that his bureau would not pursue criminal charges against Clinton that DOJ and FBI employees improperly disclosed   information and that the timing of the FBI’s release of certain Freedom of Information Act requests right before the election was improper. The White House said Thursday it wasn’t involved in the decision to investigate.
