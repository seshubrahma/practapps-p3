Washington (CNN) Mitt Romney publicly backed   Donald Trump’s education secretary nominee in a Washington Post   published Saturday. Betsy DeVos was tapped to lead the Department of Education in Trump’s administration in November, but has been considered a controversial choice by the education community. But Romney    formerly one of Trump’s toughest critics who was later considered to be his secretary of state    pushed back against her opposition and voiced support for her effort to "challenge the conventional wisdom and the status quo."  "The interests opposing DeVos’s nomination charge that charter schools in Michigan    and particularly in Detroit    haven’t lived up to their promise," Romney said.
