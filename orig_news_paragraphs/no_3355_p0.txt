On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s "New Day," CNN Counterterrorism Analyst and former CIA counterterrorism official Phil Mudd stated that Representative Trey Gowdy ( ) "ought to have his ass kicked. "   After seeing a clip of an exchange between Gowdy and former CIA Director John Brennan over the existence of evidence showing a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia, Mudd said, "Trey Gowdy ought to have his ass kicked. He knows the difference between intelligence and evidence. Let me tell you something, Alisyn, if you’re an American citizen, and the National Security Agency collects intelligence, that is intercepts of Russians, who report what you’ve said, do you think it’s fair to go to a court and say that’s evidence that you did something wrong?
