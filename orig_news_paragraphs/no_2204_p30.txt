The family lives half a block from their mosque at the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, decorated on the outside this month with strings of colored lights. At 10 p. m. every night, Salwa and her friends go through the womenâ€™s entrance and, bypassing the hot, crowded third floor, climb to the roof. They stay there in the soft breeze as the last embers of sunset fade and the lights of the   Bridge twinkle in the background. Like most high school girls, they check their phones, compliment one another on their outfits and discuss their exam schedules, while younger children turn cartwheels nearby.
