Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, in a recent interview, brought up former White House aide Vincent Foster’s suspicious death, among other scandals surrounding Bill and Hillary Clinton in the 1990s. ["It’s the one thing with her, whether it’s Whitewater or whether it’s Vince Foster or whether it’s Benghazi. It’s always a mess with Hillary," Trump reportedly said in a recent interview, bringing up Foster’s suicide. Foster was a former White House aide and friend of Hillary Clinton.
