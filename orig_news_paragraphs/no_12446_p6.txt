The child alleged that Shoemaker held his cell phone over the top of the stall she was in and recorded her activities. Shoemaker consented to allowing police to look through the images on his cell phone whereupon they discovered nude photos of his girlfriend. But police also learned that the girlfriend is only 16 and now theyâ€™ve hit the suspect with a felony child pornography charge on top of the third degree misdemeanor invasion of privacy charge he was already facing. The suspect, who was free awaiting a hearing on the earlier charge, was taken back into custody and was lodged in the Lancaster County prison in lieu of a $250, 000 bail.
