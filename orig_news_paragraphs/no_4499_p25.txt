The constitution goes on to extend legal protection to Christian and Jewish religious affairs. The U. S. State Department notes that only Muslims, Christians, and Jews are explicitly granted the right to practice their religions freely. Some religious are outright banned under Egyptian law, including the Bahai and the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Egypt’s constitution also grants special status to   the main Islamic university in Cairo.
