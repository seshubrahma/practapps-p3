Nightly counts of the homeless people at Penn Station tally about 70 people, rising to 90 on particularly cold nights, said Muzzy Rosenblatt, the executive director of the Bowery Residentsâ€™ Committee, which is contracted by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to offer shelter placements and other services to homeless people at Penn Station and Grand Central. No census is taken at Grand Central, he said. Though Mr. Rosenblatt said his group was limited by the number of available beds, the number of homeless people in transit terminals who have been placed in shelters or rehabilitation, psychiatric and other programs has increased over the last two years. Last year, 357 people were placed out of Grand Central, Mr. Rosenblatt said, compared with 292 in 2014.
