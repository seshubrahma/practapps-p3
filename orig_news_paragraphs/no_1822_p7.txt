In Butler County, Ohio, Leah Edwards notified the authorities about voter fraud when she saw a man taking notes and photographing gravestones at a cemetery. " I can’t think of any other reason a person would be doing this," she wrote on the Facebook page of the Butler County Sheriff’s Office. A man who said that he was the one later detained at the cemetery, Frank Flack, posted a reply that assailed Ms. Edwards for being irresponsible.
