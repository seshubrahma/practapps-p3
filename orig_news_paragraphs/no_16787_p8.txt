In a conference call with surrogates Wednesday afternoon, Trump aides made clear the Republican nominee was upset that his allies publicly acknowledged they pushed him to change his preparation and tactics before the second debate. And he wanted them to stop it immediately. The message was "not subtle," a source familiar with the call said: Trump wants his supporters to make an energetic defense of his performance and refuse to concede that he didnâ€™t nail it. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller denied the account.
