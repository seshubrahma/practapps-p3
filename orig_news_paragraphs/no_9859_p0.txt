Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union," presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s convention manager Paul Manafort said that it is "middle America" that does not care about Trump’s tax returns.   Manafort said, "He said he will release taxes. He said once the audit is completed he will release the taxes. "
