Sessions was also near   responsible for leading the conservative movement’s opposition to globalist trade pacts, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership, which the   suggested would turn black Americans in the inner cities into "American refugee[s]" in their own communities.   Indeed, although it tends to go unreported by corporate media, Sessions has done —  and has risked more professionally —  than perhaps any lawmaker in Washington to advance the interests of American workers.
