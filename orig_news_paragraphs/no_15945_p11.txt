According to a December Gallup poll, 71% of Americans think banning gun sales to people on the "no fly" list would be effective way to combat terrorism. A majority of Americans also think that passing new laws to make it harder to buy   weapons would also be effective. " This issue has come to a tipping point over the last year, we have seen the American people engage and push back on this issue in a way we havenâ€™t seen before," said Brendan Kelly, a spokesman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.
