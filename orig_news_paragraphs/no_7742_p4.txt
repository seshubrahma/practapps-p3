These scholarships or "vouchers" would allow poor children to take the tuition that taxpayers already provide, and use it in a school, private or religious, that would actually teach them. Vouchers are absolutely vital to opening the doors of opportunity to millions of poor black and Hispanic children   —   and poor white children as well. Democrats are fiercely opposed to vouchers because giving parents the power to choose would break the Democrats’ monopoly, undermine the lock that teacher unions have on the public schools, and threaten the slush fund that the unions provide to the Democratic Party.
