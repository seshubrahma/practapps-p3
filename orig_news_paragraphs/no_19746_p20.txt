Those cases, however, might be called "Inigo Montoya cases" â€”   that is, they do not mean what Colorado thinks they mean. In most of them, the defendants had either (1) admitted guilt or (2) voluntarily chosen to pay a fine and plead guilty in order to avoid jail. Neither of those is true in this case the defendants have consistently pleaded not guilty, and neither agreed to the "fees" and restitution or received any leniency for paying them.
