Instead, our crises are more complex, somewhat systemic and often polarizing, eliciting a host of conflicting views    think immigration, entitlement reform, climate change and gun control, for example. In our current highly partisan political climate (itself a barrier to being elevated to greatness) the issues facing the country tend to divide Congress and the bases of both parties rather than offer opportunities for a president to build consensus and unite the country. Add to that the public’s increasing loss of faith in our institutions, and you have a situation where government is seen not as a remedy, but as an obstacle to change.   Finally, perhaps it’s not such a bad thing that Americans are coming to grips with a more realistic conception of the presidency, particularly as the magnitude of a president’s responsibilities at home and abroad has mushroomed.
