In a White House statement released Sunday, Spicer said: "With the missile impacting so close to Russian soil    in fact, closer to Russia than to Japan    the President cannot imagine that Russia is pleased. " The US and Russia also offered differing estimates for where the missile splashed down. The US said it terminated flight just 96 kilometers (60 miles) from the Russian port city of Vladivostock, whereas the Russian Defense Ministry said it landed 500 kilometers (311 miles) from its Pacific coast line.
