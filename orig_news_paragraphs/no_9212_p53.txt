Cruz says the silver lining to Obama’s executive actions is that everything that Obama has accomplished with executive actions can be undone with executive actions. He says he will strike down Obama’s executive actions on   control with the strike of a pen. On foreign policy, Cruz says it can change the fastest and it is worth remembering that Iran released its hostages right after Reagan got elected. Cruz says he is pushing to repeal Obamacare and adopt a flat tax through legislation.
