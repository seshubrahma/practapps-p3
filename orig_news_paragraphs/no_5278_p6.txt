That Article I provision does not include Graham’s proposed law. This has nothing to do with an election’s time (such as having federal elections on a Tuesday in November) place (polling locations) or manner (such as allowing   requirements to cast a ballot). This would instead add a requirement on who can be listed on the ballot.
