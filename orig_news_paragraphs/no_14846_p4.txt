The equipment has been observed near parade grounds, but the concern is it could quickly become part of an actual launch. The US does not believe a North Korean ICBM could currently reach the US, but any launch of a missile with that potential range would be very provocative, one US official said.   At the same time, there is movement of equipment in other areas associated with the potential of mobile launchers firing     missiles. The regime recently fired one of those missiles, renewing concerns that US satellites have a limited ability to track   mobile launchers.
