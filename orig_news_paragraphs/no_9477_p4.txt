Cruz trailing badly at 15 percent. But as a recent Monmouth University Poll suggests, Trump may already be below the magic 50 percent number in as many as five key Congressional Districts in Western New York (23 through 27) where he only pulled in 48 percent support compared to a statewide 52 percent.

The real estate billionaire and GOP front runner has a big rally scheduled in Albany, New York Monday night.
