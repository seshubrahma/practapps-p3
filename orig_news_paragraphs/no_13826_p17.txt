In a statement posted to Fergusonâ€™s Twitter account Monday night, she said the song "has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial.   A song that speaks to all the disregarded and downtrodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington. Best Rebecca X.
