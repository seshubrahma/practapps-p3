At the time of this attack, Ms. Pharis was gainfully employed at nearby Vandenberg Air Force Base where she worked the night shift as a Satellite Tracker Civilian Contractor since 1974. She is also a four year veteran of the U. S. Air Force. On the morning of July 24, 2015, at approximately 9:45 a. m. while Ms. Pharis was sleeping, two suspects broke into her home, sexually assaulted her, strangled her, and beat her about her head and face with a hammer. But despite the incredible beating, Marilyn would not give up.
