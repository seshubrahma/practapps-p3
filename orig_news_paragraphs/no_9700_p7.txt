Trump also flipped Clintonâ€™s allegation that he took advantage of vulnerable Americans to profit from Trump University. " Trump and his employees took advantage of vulnerable Americans, encouraging them to max out their credit cards, empty their retirement savings [and] destroy their financial futures, all while making promises they knew were false from the beginning," Clinton stated earlier this month, attacking her rival on Trump University. Trump countered her attack earlier during his speech, alleging she took advantage of her time at the State Department to get rich by making the average American poor.
