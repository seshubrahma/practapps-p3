The White House made the announcement alongside several other administration posts, including general counsel posts at the CIA and Department of Defense. Those named were Courtney Simmons Elwood for a top legal job at the CIA, Jeffrey Rosen for the number two position at the Department of Transportation, John Sullivan for general counsel at defense, Ajit Pai to the FCC and Tony Sayegh, Jr. for assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department. Both Rosen and Sullivan were named to administration posts in former President George W. Bushâ€™s administration, and the White House said Sayegh is a Fox News contributor who has worked in professional politics.   Elwood worked in government for the bulk of the Bush administration, including as deputy counsel under former Vice President Dick Cheney,  and clerked for former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, according to the biography page on the law firm she works at.
