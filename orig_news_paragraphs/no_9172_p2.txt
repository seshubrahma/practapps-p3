Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has not caused quite such a negative impact on his own side, with a marginally better 19 per cent of people more likely to vote Leave thanks to his contribution, compared to 13 per cent for the Remain side he supports. However, in what must be an embarrassment to the Leader of Her Majestyâ€™s Most Loyal Opposition, fully 68 per cent of the public say Mr. Corbyn has had no effect on them. Notably, both Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage have managed to bring about their intended impact on the campaign. Mr. Johnson has made 25 per cent of people more likely to vote Leave, compared to 20 per cent pushed towards Remain.
