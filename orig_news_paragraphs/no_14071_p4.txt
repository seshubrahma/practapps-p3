Arab and European diplomats said there have been signs Trump and his advisers could slow down implementing a formal relocation amid warnings from Arab and European officials to the incoming administration that the move could unleash violence, undermine the peace process, damage US standing in the Middle East, and endanger American personnel. They have urged the incoming administration to consult with allies about the move and put it in the context of a broader strategy toward addressing the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. White House press secretary Sean Spicer stressed Sunday the administration was in the beginning stages of discussions regarding Trumpâ€™s campaign pledge to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
