 (CNN) Crowds massed in the US capital and around the world Saturday to support science and   research    a protest partly fueled by opposition to President Donald Trump ’s threats of budget cuts to agencies funding scientists’ work. At the main March for Science, demonstrators gathered at Washington’s National Mall to hear speakers laud science as the force moving humanity forward, and rail against policymakers they say are ignoring fact and research in areas including climate change.
