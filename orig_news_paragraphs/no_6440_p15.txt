Reid executed a challenge to the rule for nominees in order to break the logjam of Obama appointments —  blocked by the Republican minority. With this maneuver, Reid was able to fill vacancies on federal benches, at the Federal Communications Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau   —   all of which led a torrent of new regulations as well as favorable rulings from newly appointed judges. With respect to presidential appointments, Reid shattered a   Senate protocol, which says that unlike the House of Representatives, the Senate works its will either through consensus or exhaustion.
