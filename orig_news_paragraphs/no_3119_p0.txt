U. S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Monday during an interview on Fox News’ America’s Newsroom that "there really isn’t any Common Core anymore" in the country’s schools. ["The Every Student Succeeds Act [ESSA] which is in the process of being implemented now, essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core," DeVos said, adding:  Each state can set the standards for their state. They may elect to adopt very high standards for their students to aspire to and work toward. That will be up to each state to be able to ascertain what is right for that state.
