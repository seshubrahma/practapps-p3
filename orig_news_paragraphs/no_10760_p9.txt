Their point was that women should be prejudiced against all men because a few of them are rapists. If I opposed that argument, some may ask, how can I support Donald Trump Jr’s? The difference, of course, is that only a tiny number of western men are rapists, while countless millions of Muslims want to kill or outlaw gays.   If you think I’m exaggerating, watch these nice refugees in Minnesota, and listen to their comments on gays.
