we need to find Mayor Claar. After a wait in the lobby of Bolingbrookâ€™s municipal building, Mr. Claar suddenly appears in the doorway.

For the record, he acknowledges that he has gotten our earlier phone messages and email requests for interviews, but says that he simply had not wished to talk to us.
