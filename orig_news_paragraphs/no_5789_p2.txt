It is the first major event by the Democrats since the election of Tom Perez to the role of DNC Chair. Perez called the summer "the starting point" for the Democrats plan to obstruct Trumpâ€™s agenda. The "Resistance Summer" will start on Saturday with "house parties" across the country. The event will feature a "kickoff livestream with Keith Ellison and some surprise guests!" according to the email.
