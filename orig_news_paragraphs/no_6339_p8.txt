When   activists hold up signs like "RESIST," they are egging each other on, not broadening their appeal. The Tea Party succeeded, at least initially, because it adopted the opposite approach, appealing to people who felt abandoned by both political parties. The whole concept of the   "Resistance" is also farcical. It implies that the United States is a dictatorship that cannot be opposed through ordinary politics.
