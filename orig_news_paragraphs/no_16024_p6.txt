Trump, looking to drive Clinton’s negative poll numbers higher, has started to attack Clinton’s trustworthiness. He has labeled her "Crooked Hillary" and used a speech last week to cast her as a craven politician who is only running to benefit herself.   The strategy is driven by a number of polls which show Clinton’s struggling with honesty and trustworthiness in the eyes of the voters. A New York   News poll earlier this year found that 64% of voters answered "no" when asked if they felt Clinton was "honest and trustworthy" though the same said that of Trump as well.
