Anita Goldfeld, 76, said she drove from Boca Raton to see Clinton and Kaine’s first event together. Goldfeld supported Bernie Sanders during the primaries but is enthusiastically supporting Clinton    and now Kaine    in the general election. " I think that he is a man who knows, who’s had a lot of experience, who would be an excellent asset to Hillary," Goldfeld said.
