For a start, it is too big, with room to accommodate all three memorials to Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson side by side. The Eisenhower Memorial would cost as much to build as the three of those monuments together, so it is also too expensive. The design also takes an attitude to honoring President Eisenhower that is unclear at best, depicting him as a seated child with a   statue, which is always too small where public sculpture is concerned. This sculpture will occupy a vast park its designer calls a "theater for cars" on account of a   metal screen that serves as its backdrop.
