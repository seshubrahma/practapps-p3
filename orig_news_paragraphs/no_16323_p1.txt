" America’s been humiliated in so many different ways," proclaimed Trump, who rallied his supporters as usual without a teleprompter, although he did appear to glance at notes on his podium. For several minutes more, he stayed on message, turning the report about the cash flight to Iran into a broader condemnation of Obama and Clinton’s foreign policies    from Clinton’s advocacy for the military intervention in Libya to the dangers of the nuclear deal with Iran. And then, Trump went back to being Trump    the same candidate who in recent days has set off a panic in his party’s highest ranks after he repeatedly knocked himself off message by unceremoniously escalating a feud with the family of a deceased   soldier and refusing to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan, the   elected Republican in Washington.
