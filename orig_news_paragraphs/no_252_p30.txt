Daniel Voytas, chief science officer of Calyxt who was one of the inventors of the Talen   technology, said the company had not checked the entire genomes of their plants, but did look for unintended changes within sections that were similar to the parts they were editing. " We didn’t find any," he said. Dr. Voytas said it would not be "a huge amount of work" to sequence the entire genome and that all of the data they presented was available on the U. S. D. A.’s website.
