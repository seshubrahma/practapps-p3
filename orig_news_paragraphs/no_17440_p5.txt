Krohn responded, "Keep yer eyes open!" Law enforcement, including the Secret Service and Pembroke Pines Police Department, contacted Krohn at his residence. Krohn, according to the Secret Service agent’s affidavit, acknowledged that he had been using Facebook earlier in the evening, but became confrontational when asked if he wrote the comments threatening Trump’s safety. Krohn said that any statements were an expression of his First Amendment rights.
