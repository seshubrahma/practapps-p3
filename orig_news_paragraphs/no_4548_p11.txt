That’s one of the problems with Obamacare —  including too many giveaways to insurance companies. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) in his own exclusive interview with Breitbart News a day earlier, is calling for Trump to support the 2015 bill in which both chambers of Congress voted successfully to repeal Obamacare —  and then do a separate replacement bill the same day. Cotton said he is open to Paul’s ideas, and other ideas on this front, but wants everyone to think about this and slow down and move off the Ryan bill. Cotton said when asked if he backs Sen. Paul’s idea for Obamacare repeal and replacement: I’m open to lots of legislative approaches except for ramming through major legislation in 36 hours in the dark of night.
