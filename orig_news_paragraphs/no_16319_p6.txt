Fast forward to today, and the overblown furor over Trump’s inartful counterpunch has obscured the candidate’s momentous comments about terrorism at the Republican National Convention. Although Trump’s   policy needs some work (like repudiating his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, which he has already watered down) he has been the first major American politician to seemingly reach the impolitic (but true) conclusion that the United States would have less blowback from terrorism if it refrained from trying to meddle in other nations’ affairs by a policy of regime change and nation building. Even setting aside   some of the recent homegrown attackers on American targets    the Orlando nightclub shooter and the Boston Marathon bombers, for example    have mentioned U. S. interventions in Islamic countries among their stated reasons for committing these heinous acts.   ISIS has had to resort to inspiring attacks because they have difficulty reaching the faraway United States, which in any event has fewer unintegrated and radicalized Muslims.
