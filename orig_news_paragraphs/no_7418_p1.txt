According to various sources on both sides of the border, the area where the crossing took place is under the control of the Los Zetas cartel.   The black and white images were taken using night vision equipment in order to record the smuggling operations. The images reveal that human smugglers appear to operate with little concern due to the lack of presence by U. S. law enforcement.   The human smugglers can be seen driving in SUVs to the Mexican side of the river before disembarking.
