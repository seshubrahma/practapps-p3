During a discussion of the attack in Manchester on Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s "Situation Room," Senator Chris Murphy stated that "many of us are worried about some of the rhetoric of the Trump administration, because we worry that that combined with robust online recruitment might end up in an attack like this happening in the United States. "  Murphy said that while there has been military success against ISIS in the Middle East, they’re still "lethal" and the approach to ISIS has to be "comprehensive" and can’t just be about the military. He continued, "The fact of the matter is, in many countries in Europe, England included, Muslims suffer a   segregation, which sometimes allows for these perversions of Islam, this radicalization, to take root, and we have to make sure that we don’t allow that to happen here. " Murphy further stated, "[W]e have got to compliment this military strategy with increased intelligence, increased intelligence sharing with Europe, and a commitment to try to stop giving isis recruiters recruitment fodder.
