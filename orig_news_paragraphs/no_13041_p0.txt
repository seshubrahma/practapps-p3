Moderators of Redditâ€™s   community, The_Donald, believed for weeks that their subreddit was going to be banned or severely restricted. [Breitbart has gained access to chat logs between moderators and site admins showing moderators attempting to work with site staff to address their complaints while Reddit CEO Steve Huffman paints them as uncooperative in public.   A leaked Slack chat also shows Huffman entertaining plans to ban   with other Reddit moderators, one of whom suggests he could be made temporary CEO to "take all the flak" from a decision to ban the   subreddit.   Huffman announced on Wednesday new measures the site would take against "toxic users and poorly behaving communities," singling out the   Trump community,   in his statements.
