But it was Democrats who moved fastest to exploit the Republican health care debacle: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced on Saturday that it was running online advertisements against more than a dozen Republicans, including Mr. Faso, who voted for versions of the health care bill when it was being drafted in committees. Democratic strategists said their private polling found the   health care bill to be extremely unpopular, a finding mirrored in public opinion surveys. A Quinnipiac University poll published this past week found that just 17 percent of voters approved of the legislation, compared with 56 percent who disapproved. Three in five independent voters said they were against it.
