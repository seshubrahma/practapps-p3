: The outgoing president gave his last speech to the nation from Chicago last night. In addition to thanking his family, staff, and voters, he looked back on America’s last eight years of economic progress —  and also warned against threats to democracy posed by intolerance and discrimination. That warning implied a strong criticism of Trump, and on that point it’s worth noting that Obama set a precedent for violations of civil liberties that his successor will now inherit. Still, the defining message of the speech was of faith in the enduring ideals of America —  a nation that’s flawed but filled with hope, empathy, and the ability to change for the better.
