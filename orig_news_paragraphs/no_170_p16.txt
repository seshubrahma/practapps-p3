Admiral Pybus said that Mr. Zinke was "embarrassed and humbled" when he left SEAL Team 6 and "did quite well" as his deputy at a command using   SEAL units in Europe. " I didnâ€™t see any fallback on poor judgment or indiscretions," Admiral Pybus said, adding that he had heard Mr. Zinke also did well in another Navy job, as the   officer (and briefly acting commander) of the main SEAL training center. Mr. Zinke attended the University of Oregon on a football scholarship and graduated in 1984 with a geology degree.
