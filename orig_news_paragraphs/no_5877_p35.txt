Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican candidate for U. S. Senate against Brown in next year â€™s midterm U. S. Senate elections, appeared on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot on Sunday evening as well. Mandel nearly defeated Brown in the 2012 U. S. Senate race, coming up just short of victory as now former President Barack Obama carried the state of Ohio and dragged Brown back into the Senate on his coattails.
