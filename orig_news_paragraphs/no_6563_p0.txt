Thursday after President Donald Trump’s press conference to announce Alexander Acosta as his pick for Secretary of Labor, CNN’s Jake Tapper castigated Trump for the manner in which he took on reporters.   After presenting a hypothetical about how one might react if Trump were a "boss" giving a speech, Tapper urged Trump to "get to work" and to "stop whining" about questions if he legitimately won the presidency. " I feel like everybody at home needs to ask themselves how would you react if that were your boss coming in and giving a speech to the employees where you work?"
