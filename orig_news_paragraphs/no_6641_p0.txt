TALLAHASSEE, FL   —    At an appearance on Tuesday night as the keynote speaker for the evening’s MLK week festivities, BET News host and CNN political contributor Marc Lamont Hill told an audience assembled at the Ruby Diamond Concert Hall what he perceived to be going on behind the scenes at the Fox News Channel during his time there, which was from 2007 to 2009.   Hill, who a day earlier had referred to member’s of Trump’s diversity coalition as "mediocre negros," was attempting to make a broader point about how the different groups within progressive movement should work together and referred to what he believed to be a meeting of certain constituencies within the conservative movement at the Fox News Channel and how it was reflected during policy discussions throughout the day’s broadcast.
