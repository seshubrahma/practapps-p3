Republicans, running   against Obama’s executive amnesty in 2014, recaptured the U. S. Senate in a historic   swing toward the GOP. And this year, the U. S. Supreme Court rejected Obama’s executive amnesty on a   basis —  essentially upholding a lower court’s opinion against it. That means that 2016 is shaping up to be an election about amnesty, a referendum on whether such an executive amnesty like Obama’s is acceptable. Hillary Clinton would undoubtedly appoint Justices to the U. S. Supreme Court —  including the seat vacated by the passing of Antonin Scalia —  who would uphold the executive amnesty move, whereas Donald Trump would appoint Justices who oppose it.
