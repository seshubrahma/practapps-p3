Schulz has previously insisted that "the people who are arriving [in Europe] are refugees who have been threatened [and] we should welcome them"  —    a statement which is at odds with the   of the European Commission’s admission that at least 60 per cent are economic migrants. As a leading figure in the European Union, Schulz was a strong supporter of the compulsory migrant quotas. These were forced through by the bloc despite strong opposition from central and eastern European   which did not agree with Germany’s unilateral decision to throw open the borders.
