twitter.    —   Christian Warrior (@gblair1987) February 11, 2017,  #ProtestPP says that, contrary to Planned Parenthood’s claims to be a provider of women’s health care, it is "not a general health care service provider. "   activists are urging Congress and Trump to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s funding and redirect it to other federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that provide more comprehensive care for women and families, without providing abortions. I believe they are saying "planned Parenthood tells lies" #ProtestPP #defundpp   —   Not sure pic.
