Hillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas than to give that job to unemployed   youth in cities like Detroit who have become refugees in their own country. It is time to get our country back to work, and that includes an   effort to help young   get the   jobs they deserve. Hillary Clinton’s plan would bring in an estimated 620, 000 refugees in her first term   —   at a lifetime benefit cost of some $400 billion dollars, according to the U. S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee.
