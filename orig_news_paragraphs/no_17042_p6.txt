She failed to make up that group with voters outside that core. Despite her prospect of being the first female president, her share of the female vote at 54% was no better than average. Her support among men    at 41%    fell nine points from 2008 and was the worst showing for a Democrat since her husband Bill Clinton ran for office in 1992, when he was able to win with the support of just 43% of voters because the general election was split three ways between him, Republican George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot. While it’s no surprise that   voters were more enthusiastic for Obama than for Democrats in other recent elections, even Al Gore in his failed 2000 bid garnered 90% of the black vote compared to Clinton’s 88%.
