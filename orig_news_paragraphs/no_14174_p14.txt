Trump rejected the criticism, insisting Saturday that the new policy did not amount to "a Muslim ban" like the one he called for in December 2015 in the heat of the Republican primary campaign. Trump’s actions on Friday, though, were consistent with his pledge during the campaign to stop immigration from many   countries, particularly those he loosely defined as historically prone to terrorism. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, where passengers can often spot the Statue of Liberty on their descent into New York, a dozen travelers who fit the ban’s criteria were detained and prevented from exiting the airport. Protesters and a handful of Democratic congressmen soon arrived to demand their release.
