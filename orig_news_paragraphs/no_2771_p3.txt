• In a show of defiance toward   Donald J. Trump, who has belittled the notion of global warming, California’s governor, Jerry Brown (above at his family ranch) and legislative leaders say they will work directly with nations and other U. S. states to fight climate change. Mr. Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 is shaping up to be a challenge, with security officials worried that protesters will flood the capital, along with what may be nearly a million supporters of Mr. Trump. Thomas P. Bossert, a top national security aide under President George W. Bush, will be Mr. Trump’s adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism.
