" So, we believe that this was an appropriate way for the United States to show our commitment to an ongoing   relationship with the Cuban people," Mr. Earnest said. Although he is not a diplomat, Mr. Rhodes was the central White House interlocutor during negotiations with the Cuban government over the recent opening of relations between the two countries, and he was scheduled to be in Cuba this week for more meetings anyway, Mr. Earnest said.    Donald J. Trump warned Monday that the push to build ties with Cuba after decades of animosity could be quickly wiped away, despite growing business and commercial ties between the countries.
