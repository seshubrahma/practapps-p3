The messaging of Trump’s campaign on this issue helped him crush the young Florida senator in the state’s primary election by a massive   margin —  making Rubio’s loss one of the most humiliating defeats in the history of U. S. electoral politics. Yet despite the role this issue played in Trump’s electoral success, new reports indicate that open borders corporatists want to convince Trump to abandon his winning message on   worker immigration controls. In a piece titled "How Cisco’s CEO plans to convince Trump to import more immigrants for US tech jobs," Business Insider reports that Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, whose company is reportedly one of the top 100 users of   visas in the country, believes he can make the case for importing more foreign graduates to compete with American graduates for U. S. jobs. Advocates for American wage earners have also expressed concern that Trump’s winning message on immigration controls may be   by those being installed in key positions of his administration, such as Andy Puzder, who was recently tapped to be Trump’s Secretary of Labor —   or by allowing mass migration enthusiast Congressman Paul Ryan to remain House Speaker.
