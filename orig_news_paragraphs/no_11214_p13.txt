Concerns in South Korea are similar to those in Japan, save for one key difference: Some in South Korea actively fear a nuclear Japan will herald in another imperial era, with Japan returning to its   militaristic instincts. Given Shinzo Abe’s moves to expand Japan’s military capabilities in the face of Chinese aggression, the editors of The Korea Times write that Trump’s "isolationism" could embolden Japan. " Making the equation more complicated is the tendency of the U. S. to take an isolationist policy, as is well illustrated by Donald Trump   …     who claims that Korea does not pay its fair share for its defense, indicating his willingness to withdraw U. S. troops," the column reads.
