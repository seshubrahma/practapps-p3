Even our campaign has an uphill battle in front of us but at least when we go to Washington to discuss California’s withdrawal from the Union we’ll have a mandate of the people of California behind us. That will give us the leverage we need to demand that the Americans come to the table to at least negotiate. The CNP on the other hand think they can just send a delegation to Washington and say "let’s talk about California independence" and that pitch is never going to work. They won’t be laughed out of the room because they’ll never make it in the room in the first place.
