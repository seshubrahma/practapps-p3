President Obama, on Friday at his final news conference of the year, acknowledged that the nearly    war in Syria had been among the hardest issues he has faced, and that the world was "united in horror" at the butchery in Aleppo. But Mr. Obama  —   who came into office committed to reducing America’s military entanglements in the Middle East  —   also defended his decision not to intervene more forcefully. To do otherwise, he said, would have required the United States to be "all in and willing to take over Syria. "
