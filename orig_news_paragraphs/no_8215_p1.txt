group of prominent academics  election lawyers held conference call   Podesta and Elias last week lobbying recounthttps:  .    â€”   Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) November 22, 2016,  Apparently a "group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers" met with Podesta to express their belief that they "found persuasive evidence that results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania may have been manipulated or hacked," according to New York magazine. The academics presented findings showing that in Wisconsin, Clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on   machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. Based on this statistical analysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30, 000 votes she lost Wisconsin by 27, 000.
