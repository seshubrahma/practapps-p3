A top Wall Street commodities trader was fined $1 million and ordered to pay another $1 million in restitution today after pleading guilty in federal court here to damaging ecologically sensitive wetlands on his   private hunting retreat on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. In what prosecutors called the largest financial penalty ever assessed against an individual in an environmental case, Paul Tudor Jones II, multimillionaire chief of Tudor Investment Corp. also was ordered to serve 18 months’ probation. And how much does this ostentatious liberal champion of the poor care about the little people? While the attendees at the TED Talk seemed at least mildly entertained with Jones’ speech, the protestors from Connecticut were less than impressed.
