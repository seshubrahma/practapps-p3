Malaysia: Malaysia is only about 60 percent Muslim, but Islam is the official state religion. (More specifically, Sunni Islam  â€”    the spread of Shia Islam is illegal.) The constitution deals extensively with the rules for determining who is the "head of the religion of Islam" in different provinces.
