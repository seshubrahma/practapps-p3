One of the things, and I have my working class root background that keeps reminding me that some of these individuals  —  not necessarily in Alaska   —   but many, many of these individuals are victimized when they come up here, in terms of what they’re paid and all the rest of it, so we’re working with Labor, Department of Labor, to come up with an answer to this, but we really do need a   solution, so we’ll work with the Senate and with Congress, within the industry, this year, and again, I’ll have my staff when they return from Labor and we get some protocols in place, we’ll likely increase the numbers for this year, perhaps not by the entire number that I’m authorized, but we really do need, I’m really looking forward to working with you Senator, and the whole Congress, to get a   solution to this. Each year, the federal government allows companies to import roughly 1 million   and   guest workers, ensuring a   resident population of at least 1 million foreign workers.
