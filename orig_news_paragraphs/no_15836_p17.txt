Two US service members killed in April, US and coalition casualties in Afghanistan have become rarer in recent years, falling dramatically since the Afghan government assumed responsibility for combat operations in 2014. But in late April, two US service members were killed and another wounded while conducting a joint raid in the Achin District, a Pentagon spokesman said. The operation was targeting   the terrorist groupâ€™s Afghanistan affiliate. Achin District is the primary base of operations for ISIS in Afghanistan and has been the site of multiple joint   counterterrorism missions.
