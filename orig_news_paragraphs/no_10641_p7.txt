What he did not include was the rest of the quote where Assange continues to explain that due to WikiLeaks being a native   organisation with few translators, it is easier for Russian whistleblowers to contact   publications: So my interpretation is that in Russia there are competitors to WikiLeaks, and no WikiLeaks staff speak Russian, so for a strong culture which has its own language, you have to be seen as a local player. WikiLeaks is a predominantly   organisation with a website predominantly in English. We have published more than 800, 000 documents about or referencing Russia and president Putin, so we do have quite a bit of coverage, but the majority of our publications come from Western sources, though not always. For example, we have published more than 2 million documents from Syria, including Bashar   personally.
