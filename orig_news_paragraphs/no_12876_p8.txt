Obamaâ€™s assessment of his own powers of persuasion may not be fully justified. For example, he has completely failed to persuade Americans that his vision of high immigration and low wages is preferable to   high wage alternative. He also failed to persuade Americans to support his government directed healthcare system or to support Hillary Clinton in 2016. Remnick is already on record complaining that his own elite publication was sidelined by Breitbart in the 2016 election.
