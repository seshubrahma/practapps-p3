’   ’ ’    I would like to express my gratitude to Jared Kushner for   reviving interest in my 2006 book, "" I   have never met or spoken with him, and it’s rare in this life to   find such a selfless benefactor. Of course, I doubt he became   Donald Trump’s    and  merely to boost my   lagging sales, but still, I’m thankful.
