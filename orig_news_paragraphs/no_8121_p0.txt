The Intercept, an online   news outlet founded by eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar and edited by, among others, Glenn Greenwald, has announced the firing of reporter Juan Thompson (pictured) for a series of known fabrications reminiscent of Stephen Glass, The New Republic reporter fired in 1998 for serial fabrications. According to the site’s    Betsy Reed, Thompson’s sins include both invented people and quotes.   The Intercept’s note on the firing informs readers: An investigation into Thompson’s reporting turned up three instances in which quotes were attributed to people who said they had not been interviewed.
