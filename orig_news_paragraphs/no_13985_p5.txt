Trump, however, seems to be doing exactly the opposite. He’s spent his transition tweaking Beijing over the status of Taiwan, warning against its territorial ventures in the South China Sea, and warning of a tough new initiative to wring a better deal on trade issues out of the Asian giant. Many foreign policy experts agree that Washington needs to adopt a more robust posture toward China and accuse the Obama administration of not doing enough to protect US interests in the region. But few would endorse Trump’s chosen strategy of sending volleys toward Beijing on Twitter.
