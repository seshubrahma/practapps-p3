Overall, 42 percent strongly or somewhat supported building a wall, while 32 percent strongly opposed a wall, said the poll.   But this response from the 1, 005 adult respondents is likely influenced by party solidarity because it was conducted Sept. 1 to Sept. 2, 2016, during the political campaign where Trump’s main theme was construction of a border wall. That party solidarity could explain why so many Democrats disagree with Trump’s main   promise to build a wall   —   but also support Trump’s   proposals to restrict the movement of illegal immigrants, such as a crackdown on employers that hire illegals.
