This is the most dangerous moment —   according to the former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever. Stein elaborated on this view during a Facebook Live interview with progressive Marc Lamont Hill, who has endorsed Stein over Clinton: "In this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward," Stein said, adding: Not only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record   …     of the most   military policy as possible, and she’s calling for a   zone in Syria, which means we’re essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets elected —  declaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2, 000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert. This is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. So it’s really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.
