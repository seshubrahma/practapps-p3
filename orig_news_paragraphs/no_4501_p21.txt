The ORR spent nearly a billion dollars in 2013, but a significant share went to help the resettlement of unaccompanied minors and their families from Central America. Expenditures on new refugees and other related groups such as   entrants and asylees were $613, 963, 000 in 2013. Asylees and   entrants are essentially eligible for the same programs as refugees. Dividing this amount by the 128, 000 individuals that ORR reports are covered by its programs (excluding unaccompanied minors) means that $4, 797 was spend per refugee by ORR in 2013.
