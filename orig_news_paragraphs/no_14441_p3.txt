The Senate’s   Republican and other GOP senators have called for an investigation into the episode, building on a string of investigations underway on Russian interference in the US elections. Sen. John Cornyn told reporters Tuesday that the Senate standing committees with oversight of intelligence needs to investigate. Asked by CNN if he wanted the Senate’s committees to investigate Flynn, Cornyn replied: "Yes." But Cornyn, the Senate majority whip, was not ready to say Flynn should testify before Congress.
