This was the last time that a terrorist who had been trained by a foreign terrorist organization attempted to carry out an attack in the United States, and since then we have seen attacks or attempted attacks in the States carried out only by "homegrown" terrorists. That was the case this past weekend when Dahir Adan stabbed 10 people in a Minnesota mall. According to an American counterterrorism official, Adan had also grown up in the States. Adan was quickly adopted by ISIS as a "soldier" of its   caliphate, the same nomenclature it used to describe Mateen after his attack in Orlando.
