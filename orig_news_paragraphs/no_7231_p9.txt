I am saying the problem with Hillary Clinton has nothing to do, as far as I’m concerned with marriage it’s her protection of Bill Clinton for 25 years against allegations of rape, taking advantage of an intern and going on the attack and trying to make those women appear to be insane in some cases. Also it’s her posing as a feminist and taking millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars from countries that kill women, stone women, don’t allow women to drive, don’t allow women to have rights, use women as property. . TAPPER: I just find it hard to believe that Mr. Trump would want to start leveling accusations about people’s marriages.
