U. S Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice are introducing measures to accelerate the deportation of imprisoned illegal aliens with the announcement of a new immigration program on Thursday. [The Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) will seek to reduce the bureaucratic processes involved in deportation by using   hearings to determine the fate of illegals once they have served their sentence.   The program includes giving more Bureau of Prisons contract facilities the power to undertake deportation proceedings, installing the required technology, and introducing new uniform intake policy between a DOJ office and U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "
