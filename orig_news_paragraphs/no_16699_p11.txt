Trump offered few details in his Pittsburgh speech of what would be included in his "national   agenda to make our cities safe again," beyond saying that he will "make reduction of crime a top priority" and appoint "the best" prosecutors and federal investigators to go after criminal gangs and cartels. Trump has previously said that he would look to increase the number of police officers in inner cities to bring down the crime rate and improve training, but has offered little other specifics on this policy front. " Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success," he said.
