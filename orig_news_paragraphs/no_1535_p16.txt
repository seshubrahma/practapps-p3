The first lady, Michelle Obama, was received with adoration and her speech on Monday was the most   moment of the first days of the convention. And even a quick flash of Mr. Obama’s face, amid a procession of past presidents on the convention screen Tuesday, brought a burst of applause. The president is also the strongest adhesive holding Democrats together after five months of bitterly fought primary and caucus contests between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders of Vermont. According to a New York   poll earlier this month, 82 percent of Sanders supporters approved of Mr. Obama’s job performance.
