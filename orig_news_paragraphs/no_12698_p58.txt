National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons: "  Trump has chosen an expert negotiator to run the business of American diplomacy. A great friend to the National Association of Manufacturers, Rex Tillerson has spent his life making deals and getting results now he can put his incomparable experience, talents and connections to work on behalf of our entire country. Manufacturers are encouraged to see a leader from the manufacturing economy take on the role of Americaâ€™s chief diplomat, and we are pleased that Rex will bring a business perspective to the State Department.
