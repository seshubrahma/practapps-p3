Interestingly enough, Ryan pledged to the American people —  and to House Republicans —  that he wouldn’t run for the House Speakership without an endorsement from the House Freedom Caucus, so his decision to run for the Speakership in the beginning was, like so many other things he’s done, built on an abject lie. Many House Republicans have given Ryan a pass in his first couple months as Speaker. They blame Boehner for a lot of the problems of the conference, and for the mess that currently exists. But again, if Ryan continues down the pathway that he’s been on so far, it’s hard to see enough of the Republican conference standing behind him and continuing to support him.
