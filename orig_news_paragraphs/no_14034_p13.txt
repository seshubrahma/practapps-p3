A   members of "Democracy Spring," a group that agitates against the influence of money in politics, obtained tickets that placed them within shouting distance of the   ceremony.   As Trump stepped forward to to take the oath of office, six protesters, each wearing a letter of the word "RESIST,"  stood up to chant the preamble to US Constitution. Their shouting made it difficult for those seated nearby    including former campaign staffers and volunteers, as well as Trump’s   Ivana Trump    to hear Trump utter the words that officially made him the 45th President of the United States. The disruption was compounded when, much as it happened at Trump’s campaign rallies, his supporters responded, erupting in shouts of "Trump, Trump, Trump!" as they tried to drown out the interlopers.
