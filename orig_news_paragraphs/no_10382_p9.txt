The crowd cried out in disbelief. After waiting till around 6:25 to cancel the event, people at first thought it was a joke   …    or that they would get the unruly protesters out of the building   …    and then continue the rally.   When I turned around while at the very front line by the stage now, I saw the guy rush for the stage and get  stopped.
