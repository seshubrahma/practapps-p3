Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called the decision "a slap in the face to the many Americans entrusted with classified information who play by the rules and those who have been punished for lesser offenses. "  "Those who have mishandled classified information have had their security clearances revoked, lost their jobs, faced fines, and even been sent to prison, yet Hillary Clinton is being allowed to play by a different set of rules," he said in a statement. " By so blatantly putting its political interests ahead of the rule of law, the Obama Administration is only further eroding the publicâ€™s faith in a government they no longer believe is on their side.
