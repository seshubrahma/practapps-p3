While there are many economists who don’t believe that this tax cut would have beneficial consequences over the long term, especially by bursting deficits that will strain the nation, politically this could be a winning proposal.   Coming at a time when many Republican legislators are itching to deliver an important victory, this would have great appeal to the traditional constituencies of the Republican Party. The corporate world, still uneasy with Trump’s populist rhetoric and attacks on free trade, might be a big more comfortable once they are delivered this benefit. And as Presidents Reagan and Bush realized, there are ways to package   tax cuts with rhetoric and targeted sweeteners so that working class conservatives believe they will be sharing a piece of this economic pie.
