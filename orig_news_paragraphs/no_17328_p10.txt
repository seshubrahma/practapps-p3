It’s a matter of record that Putin was hostile to a Clinton victory: He believes the Obama administration has favored and supported grassroots protests against him.   And while Republican leaders continue to deny it, if the Republican National Committee was hacked but the information not released, Putin can still use that information to discredit or embarrass our leadership.     Thus, what we don’t know, and what an investigation could show, is how we know he did it. It may be that the information simply came from our intelligence of conversations or activities     such as phone call tapping, intelligence assets that have infiltrated Moscow’s leadership, signal intelligence picking up email conversations in Russia    that prove Putin had a policy to disrupt the election.
