For weeks, Mayor Bill de Blasio has barely disguised his disgust for the coverage of his administration in The New York Post. He has referred to the newspaper as "propaganda" and suggested recently during his weekly radio   show that   New Yorkers would do well to ignore what he called The Post’s "fabricated"   stories. The mayor took his disdain to a new level on Thursday, blatantly and pointedly ignoring the paper’s City Hall bureau chief, Yoav Gonen, during a news conference, and belittling The Post while doing so. The conflict erupted in a petulant exchange, with Mr. Gonen furiously, and futilely, trying to attract the mayor’s attention.
