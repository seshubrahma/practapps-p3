[The Pope] actually said that maybe I’m not a good Christian, which is really not a nice thing to say. If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president, because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk no action politicians.   —    —
