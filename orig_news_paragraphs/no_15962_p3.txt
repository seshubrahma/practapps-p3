A group of Republican delegates, led by Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh, began organizing last week to change the convention rules so bound delegates could abstain from voting for Trump by citing a moral objection to him. The proposal could deny Trump the 1, 237 delegates needed to secure the nomination, but it appears to face long odds.   Trump mercilessly mocked the     Bush as "low energy" throughout the primary campaign. But after Bush ended his campaign, many of his supporters went to work on #NeverTrump efforts.
