Joe Kennedy screamed. Sinatra meekly fired the screenwriter and paid him $75, 000 for his troubles. And yet the mainstream media and the Democrat party of the Kennedys say, with no evidence, that Stephen K. Bannon is   and unfit to serve in government, and that it would be nepotism for Donald Trump to add his    Jared Kushner to his administration. Tell that to the Kennedys
