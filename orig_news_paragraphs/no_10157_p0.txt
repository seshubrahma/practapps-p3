A Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told reporters Tuesday that he is preparing a challenge to   Donald J. Trump’s choice for Secretary of State,   CEO Rex W. Tillerson. ["It is my expectation that we will have thorough hearings into questions that are already being raised by both Republican and Democratic senators," said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D. .) who is a graduate of Amherst College and both the Yale University law school and its school of divinity. The senator sat in a brown cushioned chair next to an unlit fireplace in the room just outside the Senate’s press gallery and took questions for 30 minutes in a format known as a "pen and pad. "   Although it has been the practice of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Robert P. Corker Jr. (R. .) with nominations from President Barack Obama to only move forward when the committee is unanimous, Coons said there is no way the committee will be unanimous in support of Tillerson.
