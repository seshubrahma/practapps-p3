During a private event Friday night in Park City, Biden called Romney a man of integrity and said he should mount a challenge next year, according to two people in the room.   " By the way, you should run for Senate," one attendee quoted Biden as saying. The comment was quick and   but the crowd of Romney loyalists appreciated it and applauded.
