On Friday’s broadcast of "PBS NewsHour," New York Times columnist David Brooks stated   Donald Trump seems "to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II," and doesn’t agree with US foreign policy "based on the   War II institutions, that believed in [a] democratic, global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. "   Brooks said, "[T]he thing that should most concern us is a shift in American foreign policy. We’ve had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy, based on the   War II institutions, that believed in [a] democratic, global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order.
