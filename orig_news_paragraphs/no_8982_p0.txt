Pope Francis honored American actors George Clooney and Richard Gere and actress Salma Hayek on Sunday, awarding them the "Olive Medal" for peace at a Vatican event. [The Vatican event was organized to promote the work of a foundation called Scholas Occurrentes (schools of encounter) which Clooney praised as "a wonderful program" that enables "many different religions to speak of inclusion, because we know that hatred and fundamentalist attitudes are learned and inculcated. "   It wasn’t clear from reports what the celebrities had actually done to merit the medals, although George Clooney is well known as a liberal activist and successful fundraiser for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, with attendees paying as much as $353, 400 per person at a recent event held at the actor ’s home.
