Even though there had been many high paying jobs just south in Pennsylvania, New Yorkers are denied the ability to provide for their families. I apologize to all the   and   and   amendment New Yorkers who were told by Governor Cuomo that they have no place in New York because thatâ€™s not who New Yorkers are. I apologize to all the small businesses who have been driven out of New York city by crushing taxes and regulations. I apologize to the millions of unborn children, many   and Hispanic, whose lives have been taken by politicians who relentlessly promote abortion on demand with no limitations.
