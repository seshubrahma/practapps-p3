As governor, Pence has cut taxes repeatedly, passing the largest tax cut in Indiana history. On spending, Pence took the ultimate hardline approach, as one of the original cosponsors of a House Joint Resolution to be offered with the Senate for a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the U. S. Constitution, to be sent to the states for ratification. The BBA would have permanently ended Americaâ€™s deficit spending, guaranteeing that America could start paying down its crippling $19 trillion debt. As governor, Pence has been pushing a balanced budget amendment to the Indiana Constitution, as well.
