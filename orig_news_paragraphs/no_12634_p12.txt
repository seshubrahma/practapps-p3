While some may find this to be a rather circuitous argument, it has been embraced by the establishment media. The argument from the Khan family and their media boosters seems to be that because their son died in Iraq, and also happened to be Muslim, that the U. S. is morally obligated to admit an unlimited number of Muslim immigrants in the future with no examination or scrutiny paid to their religious beliefs   â€”   even though it is precisely this lax policy that allowed 3, 000 Americans to die on   and many more to die in subsequent attacks. Interestingly, as Gateway Pundit has pointed out, the number of Muslim soldiers who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan is the same number of those who have been killed by Muslim soldiers in America
