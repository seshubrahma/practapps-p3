In a letter Paul sent to President Trump on April 10, he asked that the administration "promptly investigate" whether his name or the names of other members of Congress, individuals from their staffs or campaigns, were included in queries or searches of database of the intelligence community, or if their identities were unmasked in any intelligence reports or products. Paul said at a CATO Institute speech later that he was sending a new letter Friday morning. " We have several sources telling us that members of the Obama administration were looking at politicians, particularly who were running for office," he said.
