The deal Democrats were criticizing with Indiana is worth $700, 000 per year for 10 years. It includes $500, 000 annually in corporate income tax breaks and $200, 000 per year in training grants.   That dealâ€™s size is similar to other major offers Indiana economic officials have extended to businesses    and is similar to the tax abatements and credits states and municipalities run by Democrats and Republicans offer nationally.   Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also blasted the deal.
