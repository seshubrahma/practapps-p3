Born in Cuba, violinist Luis Haza was a child prodigy who began performing at the age of 11. His father was murdered by Fidel Castro when he was a child for the crime of supporting democracy and the mistake of thinking Castro would deliver it. He refused international scholarship offers to study with some of the worldâ€™s greatest violinists, telling a Cuban official: "No, but if you send me to the United States, I will go. "
