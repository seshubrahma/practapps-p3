Those who were open to this Marxist Communist ideology had to meet in secret, and their numbers grew they were the True Believers, revolutionaries, many of the elite in Hollywood. They met in the shadows  â€¦     and when the light shone upon them, some were punished, and some had careers ruined. But instead of being snuffed out, they went underground, morphed, and were able to continue to affect media, culture, religion, politics and education. Needless to say, because of this development, Hollywood and the rest of the nation have become indoctrinated to such a degree that we are now a nation entirely at odds with each other.
