Critics of the program say it reduces wages for both   and seasonal American workers, it reduces pressure on companies to find and recruit marginalized U. S. workers, and it reduces the political pressure on companies and schools to train young Americans for   skills, such as bricklaying. Critics of the program say it reduces nationwide wages for both   and seasonal American workers, it reduces pressure on companies to find and recruit marginalized U. S. workers, and it reduces the political pressure on companies and schools to train enough young Americans for   skills, such as bricklaying. Any expansion of the unpopular program would also contradict President Donald Trumpâ€™s inauguration day promise to "Buy American, Hire American," say critics. Just like the     visa program, the   program is unpopular with the public, but lobbyists constantly pressure legislators to increase the annual inflow of foreign workers.
