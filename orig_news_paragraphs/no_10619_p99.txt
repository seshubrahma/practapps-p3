Theyâ€™ve gotten used to beheadings in Indonesia, and I find that horrifying. Indonesia is a secular country, but a whole region is now ruled by Shariah law, resulting in a 60 year old Christian woman being caned this year for the crime of selling alcohol. Does that sound like the type of treatment any minority deserves, anywhere? I have no words.
