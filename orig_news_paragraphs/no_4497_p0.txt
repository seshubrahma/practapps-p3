Amid a New York Times report  —   denied by the White House  —   that President Trump tried during a private meeting to convince   Director Comey to drop an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn, it may be instructive to recall reports of Obama administration officials allegedly meddling in Comey’s FBI affairs. [In one case, White House officials, according to one source speaking to the news media, reportedly "shut it down," referring to a request by Comey to go public with FBI information regarding alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.   The reports come despite Obama administration attempts to portray Comey’s role as head of the FBI as independent of any influence from the executive branch. Indeed, when Obama first met with Comey to discuss the possibility of appointing him to lead the FBI, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN that the president made it a point not to meet with Comey    again for fear of creating the appearance of influence.
