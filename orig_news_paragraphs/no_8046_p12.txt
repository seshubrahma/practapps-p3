Because of TPA’s passage, Obama said, he is "confident" he will pass the TPP in the lame duck session of Congress after the election before the new president and new Congress takes office in January. " Having said all that, it was said that we couldn’t get the authority to even get a trade deal done and we got it done," Obama said.
