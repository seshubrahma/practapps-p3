In fact, it really takes just one individual to inflict enormous damage.   Just one person, with a grudge, a rage, an ideology and a weapon    which can be an everyday truck    can kill a statesman, an ambassador, or a crowd of holiday revelers. We have seen it over and over, in the seemingly endless series of attacks by radical Islamists, some of them mentally disturbed, all of them imbued with a dangerous, deadly ideology. Hundreds of people have been killed in terrorist attacks in Turkey alone this year, scores more in Europe and in other parts of the Middle East.
