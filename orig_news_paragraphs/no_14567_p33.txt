CRANE:   The idea is to build orbiting gas stations that harness the sun’s power, to split water into liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that would then be used for rocket fuel.   That way, spaceships wouldn’t have to carry all their fuel with them and could top off at that these cosmic filling stations, allowing them to go even deeper into space. (on camera):
