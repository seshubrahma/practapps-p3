So far, in Washington, Trump has visited a children ’s hospital and a couple of schools. She’s hosted one official "ball" (February’s Governors Ball) presided over her first White House Easter Egg Roll and given a speech on female heroes at the State Department, to name a handful of her most notable Washington experiences to date.   Last week, she and the President stepped out on the town for the first time, well, not counting a few steak dinners at the Trump International Hotel.
