Many people who are trying to change their sex also blame their exclusion on unfair social attitudes that need to be changed by civic pressure or government action. " We, as a society, have not created a space for men to openly express their desire to be with trans women," Allen said, echoing the progressive claim that heterosexual males’ sexual preferences can be swayed by civic endorsement of transsexuality. The demand that male and female heterosexuals learn to sexually desire transsexuals reflects a key demand of the "transgender ideology"  —   that government should pressure ordinary Americans to fully accept other people’s claim about their maleness or femaleness, regardless of biology.
