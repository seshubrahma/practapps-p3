The allegations are unverified, and the report contains errors," a BuzzFeed   cautioned. Contacted by Breitbart Jerusalem, Bergman said that according to his sources, the meeting between U. S. and Israeli officials took place before the publication of the dossier on Tuesday and that the dossier wasnâ€™t specifically mentioned to the Israelis, only the charge that Russian President Vladimir Putin has some sort of unspecified "leverage" over Trump. Bergman said that after the dossier was published, he contacted his sources again and they told him that they themselves were speculating that the "leverage" claim could have in part referred to the dossier.   Bergman is the author of a forthcoming book on the history of the Mossad set to be published later this year by Random House.
