We estimate that over the past 11 months, we’ve killed about 25, 000 enemy fighters. When you add that to the 20, 000 estimated killed (previously) that’s 45, 000 enemy (fighters) taken off the battlefield."   That’s an astonishing amount of attrition for a force MacFarland estimates has a remaining strength of 15, 000 to 30, 000 fighters now. U. S. intelligence estimates the   coalition has also killed at least 135 of ISIS leaders.
