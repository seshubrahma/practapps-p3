McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee who is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, had a troubled relationship with Trump, who early in his campaign criticized the senator for having been a prisoner of war during Vietnam. While McCain rose above those comments and for many months backed his party’s nominee    in part because McCain knew many of his base voters supported Trump    he ultimately withdrew that backing after the "Access Hollywood" video surfaced in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women.   Iowa, GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, appears set to win   to a seventh term after overcoming a challenge from Democrat Patty Judge, a former lieutenant governor who was considered a serious contender when she first entered the race.   Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, faced heavy criticism from Senate Democrats at the time for blocking President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.
