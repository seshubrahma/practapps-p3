The symptoms were different: They included the pinpoint pupils of victims that characterize nerve agents and other banned poisons. One doctor posted a video of a patientâ€™s eye, showing the pupil reduced to a dot. Several people were sickened simply by coming into contact with victims. The opposition minister of health, Mohamad Firas   said in a video that he had been in a field hospital at 7:30 a. m. when more than 100 people arrived wounded or sickened.
