It’s a sad irony in the fact that the Free Speech Movement was founded here and tonight, someone’s free speech got shut down. It might have been hateful speech, but it’s still his right to speak," said Shivam Patel, a freshmen who stood outside of Sproul Plaza.

Patel said he supported peaceful protests, but disagreed with the way things turned out on Wednesday.
