Like his speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump portrayed a dark vision of a nation in deep distress, ignoring traditional metrics like the dip to 4. 7% unemployment under Obama’s eight years in office. But he expressed hope and optimism about the change he could be able to bring to Washington, pronouncing that the time for "empty talk" from politicians was over and the "hour of action" had arrived.   While he did not go into great detail about his agenda, he promised to fix "decaying" infrastructure and outlined a marked turn inward to an "America First" policy that would govern all of his actions on trade and global affairs. In a preview of the retrenchment from the role of America’s policeman that was such a strong theme under President George W. Bush, Trump spoke of trillions of dollars "wasted overseas" while American roads and bridges fell into disrepair.
