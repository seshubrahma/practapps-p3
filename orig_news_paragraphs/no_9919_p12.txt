Ryan similarly has a long history of pushing open borders immigration policies, chosing to champion a refugee bill, which conservatives denounced as a "show vote," because even if it had passed, the bill would still have allowed Obama to bring in an unlimited number of refugees from an unlimited number of countries. As Congressman Walter Jones explained, Ryan’s bill would "do nothing to cut off the funding for President Barack Obama’s plan to import tens of thousands of Middle Eastern refugees into the U. S. " Moreover, as NumbersUSA’s Rosemary Jenks has explained, Ryan’s bill would not have in any way paused the Somali refugee program responsible for Monday’s attack. One month later, Ryan chose to champion an omnibus spending bill that   and even expanded President Obama’s refugee resettlement operation.
