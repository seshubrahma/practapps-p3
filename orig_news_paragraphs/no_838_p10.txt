The report described a matrix of North Korean companies with bogus identities used to accrue cash, technologies and materials for the government’s weapons development. In remarks to reporters on Monday morning, Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary to Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the missiles appeared to have fallen into the sea in an exclusive economic zone around Japan. Mr. Suga called the missile launch a "serious threat to our security" as well as "extremely problematic behavior from the viewpoint of security of aircraft and ships. "
