Billionaire Donald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential frontrunner, told Breitbart News exclusively in a phone interview that he believes that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is only "being nice to" President Barack Obama because she wants him to prevent the FBI from indicting her over her email scandal. [Trump’s comments came in response to a question about his thoughts on former President Bill Clinton, Hillary’s husband, calling President Obama’s administration an "awful legacy" in a Spokane, Washington, speech last week.   " If he said that, Hillary will be indicted," Trump said of Bill Clinton’s remarks on Obama’s administration.
