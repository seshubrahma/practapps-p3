It was the latest in a   series of Twitter posts and public statements over the last week in which Mr. Trump has weighed in on Israel, terrorism and nuclear proliferation  â€”   contradicting Mr. Obama and flouting the notion that the country can have only one president at a time. That longstanding principle has largely collapsed since the victory by Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a strategy of breaking all the rules and has continued to speak in unmodulated tones. " In some ways, Trump is neutering the Obama administration," said Douglas G. Brinkley, a professor of history and a presidential historian at Rice University in Houston.
