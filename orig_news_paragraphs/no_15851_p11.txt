Back home, Puerto Rico has its own governor and legislative body.   A definite plus to living on the island and one reason some might prefer things as they are: Puerto Ricans only have to pay federal income taxes on work theyâ€™ve done in the States, and not at home. As a commonwealth, Puerto Rico gets US military protection and receives federal funding from the government for highways and social programs, just not as much as an official state gets.   Citizens pay into Social Security and have access to Medicare and Medicaid, but instead of being eligible for Supplemental Security Income assistance,   elderly and blind or disabled people can get help from a similar program run by the US Department of Health and Human Services.
