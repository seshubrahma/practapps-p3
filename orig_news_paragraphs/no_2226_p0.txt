CHARLOTTE, N. C.  â€”    As Hillary Clinton braced for political fallout from her use of a private email server, President Obama delivered a stemwinder on her behalf on Tuesday, praising her "steady judgment" as his secretary of state and criticizing Donald J. Trump for his own lack of transparency. Sleeves rolled up and declaring himself "fired up" on her behalf, Mr. Obama heaped admiration on Mrs. Clinton and assailed Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, saying American voters face a critical choice between "some imaginary past, or whether we are going to reach for the future. " "I can tell you this, Hillary Clinton has been tested," Mr. Obama said as he interrupted repeatedly by the cheering crowd.
