In February 1980, Ronald Reagan was 29 points behind Jimmy Carter, whom he would crush   in a   landslide. Gov. Michael Dukakis left his Atlanta convention 17 points ahead of Vice President George H. W. Bush in 1988. Five weeks later, Labor Day, Bush had an   lead he never lost, and swept 40 states. What this suggests is extraordinary volatility of the electorate in the modern age.
