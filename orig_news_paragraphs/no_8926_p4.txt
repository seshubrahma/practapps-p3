Steve Kerr apparently got the   talking points memo, though, because his comments almost to the letter mirror what Stan Van Gundy said earlier in the day, specifically, the charges of insulting women and minorities. Even the Patriots Martellus Bennett did something similar when he wrote a letter to his daughter on Instagram in response to a hypothetical question about what the election would mean for her life. That Kerr and Van Gundy find Donald Trump so reprehensible implies they would have found a   Hillary Clinton much more palatable.
