Last weekend while promoting her new book, "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," Arianna Huffington told Yahoo Global News’ Katie Couric that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who says he averages about four hours of sleep a night, is sleep deprived to the point he is "operating legally drunk. "  Huffington said, "The symptoms of his behavior are identical to symptoms of sleep deprivation. He actually has said he only sleeps about four hours a night, and he sleeps with his phone because he doesn’t want to be disconnected with what’s happening. "
