If I lived in Ohio or a swing state, I might even be more worried. But I see this overwhelming PC culture, especially online. I get frustrated by the dialogue of letting immigrants into the country without control, letting Black Lives Matter protest without consequence, watching qualified Asian and White students lose places in universities and companies in the name of diversity. I worry about how companies are taking on the rallying cries of these causes, particularly the monopolies that Google and Facebook have.
