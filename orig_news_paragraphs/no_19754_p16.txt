The Ford Focus is the   selling car in the U. K. for example, while the Mustang being built in Flat Rock, Michigan, by contrast, started being produced in   drive for the first time this year, more than six decades after its U. S. debut. Why does this make Mexico more desirable to automakers? Because Mexico has free trade agreements with 45 countries, more than double the U. S. network of merely 20. In what Trump claimed earlier in the week as a victory of his own   Twitter campaign against Ford, the company decided to shift plans from building a   plant in Mexico to expanding facilities in Michigan.
