After all, Comey has a reputation to defend and even though now a civilian, he will feel bound by the FBI and Department of Justice rules of policy and ethics as well as the attorneysâ€™ Code of Professional Responsibility.

Given that powerful lesson, it is unlikely he will comment on a pending investigation again even in his new civilian role.
