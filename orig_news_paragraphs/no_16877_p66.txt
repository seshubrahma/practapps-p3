The reason the tape had such an impact was because of who Trump has been and the kind of campaign that he has run since entering the race. It is hard to see how this debate enables Trump to broaden his electoral base, which is essential if he wants to win.   While Trump was able to use this debate to shift attention away from the recording, he didn’t score a "win" in terms of the overall quality of the debate (his answers were filled with misstatements, vague references and scattershot statements on unrelated issues) and he didn’t erase the problems that he has created for his party. However, Clinton didn’t accomplish the kind of "knockout" punch that her supporters were hoping for.
