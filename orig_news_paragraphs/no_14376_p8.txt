Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, called her deportation a travesty.   " Rather than tracking down violent criminals and drug dealers, ICE is spending its energy deporting a woman with two American children who has lived here for more than two decades and poses a threat to nobody," he said.   Why she was deported, Garcia de Rayos has two children who were born in Arizona.
