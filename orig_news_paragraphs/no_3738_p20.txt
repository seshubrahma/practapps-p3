The Daily Caller reported: An internal Media Matters For America memo obtained by The Daily Caller reveals that the   media watchdog group employs an "opposition research team" to target its political enemies. Included in the list of targets are   websites, conservative think tanks, prominent financiers and donors, and more than a dozen specific Fox News Channel and News Corporation employees. " We will conduct extensive public records searches and compile opposition books on individuals," declares the memo, likely written in late 2009.
