Protesters, police scuffle, Protesters and Washington police scuffled Thursday night outside a meeting of   conservatives, the first of several demonstrations aimed at disrupting the new administration’s inaugural weekend. Protesters gathered on 14th Street outside the National Press Club to demonstrate against "DeploraBall," an event organized by some of Trump’s most fervent supporters. The name riffs off the campaign description of some Trump backers by his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, as a "basket of deplorables."   As attendees    some of whom were clad in suits and red hats, others dressed in gowns    entered the event, demonstrators chanted "Shame" and "Nazis go home" behind a phalanx of police.
