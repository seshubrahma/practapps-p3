Trump promised large tax cuts that would primarily benefit   taxpayers, ending the Affordable Care Act and curtailing government regulation. But he also broke with Republican orthodoxy, rejecting the   Partnership, proposing renegotiating NAFTA, and vowing to take a firmer stance on currency management and other issues with our trading partners. What would some of this mean in practice? The proposal for tax cuts would put in place a system with three tax brackets of 12% 25% and 33%.
