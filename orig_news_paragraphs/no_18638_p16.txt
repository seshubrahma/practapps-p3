Politically, this is hard to explain, but here’s a theory. ’ ’Bernie Sanders does not expect, and never did expect, to be president. He entered the race as a longshot  —   a protest candidate who wanted to get his message about income inequality and an economic system "rigged" to favor the rich onto a larger stage. Maybe he could push his party a little further to the left on issues important to him before he was forced out of the race.
