Reverend Al Sharpton thinks that in order to win elections, Democrats must stop trying to get the "Archie Bunker" vote and instead focus on maximizing the party’s minority vote.   During a Friday afternoon MSNBC appearance, Sharpton railed against elected officials and consultants who want Democrats to "try and become elephants with donkey skin on," emphasizing that it was pointless to appeal to "Archie Bunker" voters who support President Donald Trump. Sharpton insisted that these "Archie Bunker" voters will never cast their ballots for Democrats. He made his remarks a day after Republican Greg Gianforte won his special election for Montana’s open House seat by six points even after he allegedly   a reporter the day before the election.
