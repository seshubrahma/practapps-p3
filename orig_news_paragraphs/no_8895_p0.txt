Monday on his radio show, host Rush Limbaugh took a call from a Tennessee man who insisted Limbaugh was looking at the media incorrectly.   According to the caller, conservatives should be grateful for the media’s biased coverage because it is having the opposite impact of what was intended. In the case of Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton, the media’s slant for Clinton was a net positive for Trump, he argued. Limbaugh told the caller he wasn’t attempting to discourage the media from doing, because he argued it would matter anyway.
