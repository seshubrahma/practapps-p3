Both Mrs. Clinton and Gov. John Kasich visited the state on Saturday, Mr. Sanders held a rally in Providence on Sunday morning and Mr. Trump scheduled an event for Monday, delighting the politically minded in a state accustomed to observer status in presidential politics (and other things, too). " Usually the die has been cast, and it’s just really a formality," said Bob Durant, 51, a lawyer who was making phone calls at Mr. Kasich’s campaign headquarters here last week. But this year, with candidates still scrapping for delegates, "literally every vote will count," Mr. Durant said.
