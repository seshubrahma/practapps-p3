" We have millions of customers and investors who want clean energy," said Ignacio S. Galán, chief executive of Iberdrola, the Spanish company that operates the     portfolio in the United States after NextEra Energy. In an interview this month, he said that the contention by Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new administrator, that carbon dioxide may not be a prime cause of climate change was "just like a joke" and added that his company would continue to expand its wind and solar investments, whatever the fate of the Clean Power Plan. The company plans to increase its total United States renewable energy capacity by roughly a third by 2020.
