On Thursday,   firm PPP released a poll of Virginia voters showing Clinton leading Trump by 3 points in the Old Dominion. Last year, PPP showed Clinton leading Trump by 10 points in Virginia. Since then, Clinton’s favorablity has decreased, while Trump’s has improved. Trump is still slightly more unpopular than Clinton in Virginia, yet the      is within the margin of error.
