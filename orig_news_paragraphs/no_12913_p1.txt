The agents say that Senator Cruz only shows up to the border to hand out teddy bears on camera or to hear the Obama Administration political appointees’ glossy version of the realities on the ground. Senator Cruz’s spokesperson strongly refuted these assertions and told Breitbart Texas, "We had a positive and informative meeting where Customs and Border [Protection] leaders were present. "   Even the most ardent conservatives and border security fighters, both in elected positions and in the grassroots, have long recognized that the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) is the only mechanism Border Patrol agents have to speak out and to hold Obama’s Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) accountable. Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold, Arizona Senator John McCain, Texas Senator John Cornyn, Arkansas Rep. French Hill, and even Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump are all on the long list of leaders who recognize the importance of reaching to actual Border Patrol agents through the NBPC.
