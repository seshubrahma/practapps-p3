The Kushners bought 666 Fifth for $1. 8 billion on Jared’s birthday in January 2007, as part of a plan to reposition the family company as a major Manhattan developer. Until then, the Kushners were based in New Jersey, where they owned a huge portfolio of suburban garden apartments and donated heavily to the Democratic Party. But the deal at 666 Fifth came with a big price, $1, 200 per square foot. As the family struggled to make its mortgage payments amid the recession, it slowly sold segments to Vornado Realty Trust, which owns 49. 5 percent of the building’s office space and a slice of the retail, and others.
