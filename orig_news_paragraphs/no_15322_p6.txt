They targeted news crews, restaurant patrons and used slingshots and pepper spray against officers, police said. Olympia Police Chief Ronnie Roberts told reporters that a group of approximately 75 protesters split off from the larger, peaceful group around 6:30 p. m. local time near the downtown intersection of 4th Ave and Jefferson Street, and began to hurl projectiles at officers. Nine officers were hit with what Roberts described as rocks or marbles. He said many of those arrested were carrying pipes and slingshots inside backpacks and that five businesses were damaged during the protests.
