What happens to travelers in the short term if the Seattle ruling is halted or overturned? Several federal agencies began Saturday to unwind their implementation of the travel ban in order to comply with Robartâ€™s ruling. The Department of Homeland Security announced it had "suspended any and all" actions to implement the travel ban and would resume standard inspections of travelers, as it did prior to the signing of the executive order. A State Department official also told CNN that the agency has now reversed its earlier cancellation of visas last week.
