 (CNN) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that Iraqi forces have launched a major,   offensive on an ISIS stronghold to help his rival win the US presidency.   The claim, which Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said "amazed" her, came in the third and last presidential debate just 20 days before Americans head to the polls. During their fractious, occasionally raucous   in Las Vegas, Nevada, the candidates also touched on abortion, immigration, national debt and foreign policy.
