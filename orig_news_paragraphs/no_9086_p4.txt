The inherent corruption of the current tax system is that itâ€™s largely designed to compel behavior desirable to the government, through a massive system of rewards and penalties. A more honest tax system would be wholly focused on financing the essential operations of government with the minimum possible burden on American citizens, distributed as fairly as possible. The complexity of the tax system is pure corruption in practice, because powerful interests can buy enough political influence to rewrite the tax code in their favor, to say nothing of the social engineers who use taxation as a compulsive instrument against the people. Taxpayers with the resources to hire skilled accountants can exploit the tax system to minimize, and even largely eliminate, a burden which less wealthy taxpayers have no choice but to share.
