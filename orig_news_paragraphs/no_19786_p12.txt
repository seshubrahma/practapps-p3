And it is a good thing, not a bad thing, for powerful people handed a microphone to reinforce moral opprobrium against it. For David French, this part of the speech "eloquently stated the moral imperative that the strong not prey on the weak," but like many conservatives who commented online, this was not enough for him to praise Streep, partly because he conflates the individual actress with edverything he dislikes about the Hollywood left in general (a tactic with as much rigor as that displayed by Frenchâ€™s critics who impute to him every quality they dislike about the conservative movement) and also because of an old   clip. Director Roman Polanski, who once pled guilty to statutory rape, won an Oscar for The Pianist. The crowd was clapping, as they do after every award is announced, and the footage briefly cuts to Streep in the audience, who is standing and clapping.
