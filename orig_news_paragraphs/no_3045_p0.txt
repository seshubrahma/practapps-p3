Wednesday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," host Joe Scarborough blew up at his   Mika Brzezinski after he compared accusations of nepotism in the Trump White House regarding President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump to that of the Kennedy White House when   John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Robert Kennedy attorney general.   When Brzezinski asked if he was making such a comparison, Scarborough responded by objecting to Brzezinski’s question and said he wasn’t saying Robert Kennedy was Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Partial transcript as follows: SCARBOROUGH: As it was when my hero  —   my political hero was appointed attorney general for his brother, and Republicans didn’t like that back then.
