All remaining candidates are able to compete for these nine votes for support on a first ballot at the convention. It is also possible that the individuals winning these delegate slots could go to the convention unbound to any candidate.

Ted Cruz could actually come out of Nevada with more   votes than Trump, despite coming in third in the caucus.
