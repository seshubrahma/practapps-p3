The festivities kick off Thursday night. The Republican movers and shakers will reportedly discuss their plot to plant a Trump alternative candidate into the race. The effort has fizzled since Bill Kristol’s pick  —   obscure writer David French  —   decided not to run, and because the Republican National Committee publicly aligned behind Trump after the Indiana primary. But RNC chairman Reince Preibus, who is also joining Trump now in his Twitter exchanges Hillary Clinton, will be at Romney’s "E2" extravaganza, where speeches will be made and symposiums given.
