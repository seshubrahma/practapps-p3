But instead of settling in, Trump decamped for the Oval Office, where he met for national security discussions with his team about North Korea and an unraveling situation in the Arab Gulf. Sean Spicer, Trump’s press secretary, said the President did not watch much of Comey’s testimony, only catching clips between his meeting, which lasted almost until the president was on his way to the evangelical speech. He did not offer online commentary to the cable news coverage, and when he was questioned about the testimony during an infrastructure meeting with mayors and governors, he declined to answer. A White House aide said Trump’s advisers, including Kasowitz, convinced him that responding on Twitter could undercut their ability to defend him to the public.
