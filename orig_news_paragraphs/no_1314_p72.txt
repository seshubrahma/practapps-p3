So a cigar maker named George Hull thought it would be entertaining to fabricate a fossil of one of Noahâ€™s giants. He had a   man secretly sculpted, treated it to look old and then buried it in rural New York State, where he contrived to have it found. Instantly, massive crowds of astounded Christians started pouring into town, eager to see biblical proof in the petrified man with the    feet and the   nose and all the other proportionate appendages. Hull made lots of money charging 50 cents a viewing.
