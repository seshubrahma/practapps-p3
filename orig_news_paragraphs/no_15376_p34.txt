Presidents can talk about grabbing women "by the p***y" and get elected. Colbert’s vulgar insult that implied Trump was taking part in a sexual act with Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be Letterman’s "Stupid Human Tricks," but   television is just continuing to evolve, just like our expectations for the office of the presidency    and American culture itself. I just wonder what will shock the millennials in 20 years.
