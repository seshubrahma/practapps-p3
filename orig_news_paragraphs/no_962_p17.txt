Some analysts are far more worried about the French vote, because the   leader of the National Front, the presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, has a bloc of voters that is much more solidified behind her. " The bloc for Le Pen is very consistent, which is different than the other populists," said Mr. Funke of the Free University in Berlin. An even greater concern may be Italy, where the populist Five Star party and the Northern League could win if elections are held, in part on a platform proposing a referendum on whether Italy should continue to use the euro.
