David H. Petraeus, a former C. I. A. director and a retired   Army officer who served as the military’s top commander in Afghanistan and Iraq, has been under consideration for secretary of state. But the nomination of General Mattis could make Mr. Petraeus’s selection less likely, because Democrats will object to the prevalence of retired generals in jobs that normally go to civilians. While General Mattis is revered by Marines and enlisted soldiers, several military officials interviewed on Friday raised questions about whether his proven combat skills as a military leader will be the right tools to overcome the calcified bureaucracy that is the Defense Department. A defense secretary must navigate the politics of the White House and Congress while balancing and, in some cases, steering the views of his top military officers.
