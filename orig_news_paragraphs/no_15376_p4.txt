I find it ironic that these people would start a campaign to fire a public figure for what, in their assessment, were lewd comments, when citizens of the United States, and people all over the world, for that matter, just lived through the presidential campaign of one of the lewdest, most misogynistic, insulting, undignified men we’ve ever seen. Remember the debate over penis size between Trump and Marco Rubio? How about when Trump made comments about Carly Fiorina’s face? And check out this mashup of his profane pronouncements, made publicly and repeatedly and for the cameras for months as he tried to persuade voters that HE was the moral defender of right, standing on the high ground.
