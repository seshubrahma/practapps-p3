A choice and not an echo. A meaningful distinction. If we come to November and the American people are given a choice between two big government liberals, two Washington insiders enmeshed in the corruption of Washington, then we as a Republican Party will have failed the American people. And I tell you when you run for President, one of the most solemn choices you make is the choice of selecting a Vice Presidential candidate.
