It was a precursor to a series of programs that what would later be labeled "affirmative action" policies.   At its creation, the MBDA was tasked with the mobilization of federal and local resources for the promotion of minority business efforts in the United States with a focus on Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans.

The agency currently maintains approximately forty   centers across the US, designed to provide consultation to minority businesses.
