Republican presidential candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz stated that "no one should be surprised that Donald Trump is trying to stir up riots" in reaction to Trump’s prediction that there would be riots if he was denied the nomination after being just shy of the necessary 1, 237 delegates and challenged Trump to a debate when both are in Washington, DC for AIPAC’s conference on Wednesday’s "Kelly File" on the Fox News Channel.

But let’s talk about the math, because a lot of people get the math wrong, to be the Republican nominee takes 1, 237 delegates.
