Washington (CNN) Businessman Donald Trump continued his verbal attack against illegal immigrants on Wednesday, in an interview on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon.   He has stirred up controversy in recent days for claiming "rapists" and "killers" are migrating over the United States’ southern border. Univision and NBC Universal have cut ties with the businessman, refusing to air the "Miss Universe" pageant he partially owns as a result, and Macy’s announced Wednesday it was also discontinuing his clothing line.
