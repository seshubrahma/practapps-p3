Dreamers, Illegal aliens were prominently featured in Monday night’s lineup. Francisca, Carla, and Astrid all managed to get into the convention hall to speak, which was a reported violation of Section 8 U. S. Code 1324 on the part of the Democratic Party. The speakers all seemed to feel that they SHOULD be allowed to stay in the country, but they did not really make much of a case for WHY. Don’t worry, Hillary said to the illegals.
