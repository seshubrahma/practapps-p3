For the sake of you and your familyâ€™s safety, I implore you to take five minutes to listen to the sober, serious words of Professor Stephen Cohen, an acclaimed author and expert who teaches Russian history and politics at York University and Princeton. Professor Cohen has no connection to either the Clinton or Trump campaign, which is why his statement against Hillary and her lapdog media is so throughly blistering. Cohen says that Obama and Clinton have started a new Cold War with Russia. You can see it in places like Syria and the Ukraine.
