Some on Twitter mocked the "La La Landers" for having tears in their eyes, so it’s lovely that the filmmakers from both movies were so much more gracious. Jimmy Kimmel could pick up some tips on manners and crisis management from Mr. Horowitz. More to the point, it would be great if the academy finally solved its host problem. Among other things, it would be nice if it found a host who both was actually interested in the art and didn’t mock the movies.
