Rivello, who is from Salisbury, Maryland, was initially charged with cyberstalking and appeared in federal court Friday.   The Twitter account belonging to Rivello allegedly contained direct messages sent to other users regarding Eichenwald with statements like, "I hope this sends him into a seizure, " "Spammed this at (victim) let’s see if he dies," and "I know he has epilepsy," according to the allegations in an affidavit that was unsealed Friday. Investigators also found screen shots from an epilepsy website with a list of commonly reported epilepsy seizure triggers and a story from a Dallas news site about Eichenwald’s efforts to subpoena Twitter to track down the user who sent him the image, according to the affidavit.
