PERINO: So, when Trump goes after Hillary, a lot of people say, well, everyone knows everything about Hillary, but no one’s gone after Hillary in this way yet, it will make some people uncomfortable, it will probably be a very uncivil campaign from both sides and it will just be sort of race to the bottom. I would expect that they’re going to try to do everything to win.
