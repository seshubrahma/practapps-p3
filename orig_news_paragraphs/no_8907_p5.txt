A full chronicle of Hillary Clintonâ€™s crimes will someday fill a large shelf of books, if not a whole library. If she is elected President next week, a complete shelf of books will be needed to chronicle her impeachment in Congress, likely removal from office, and the resulting damage to our institutions. The Watergate scandal will look like a Sunday picnic by comparison. The Clinton Crime Syndicate nightmare can be brought to an end by a resounding "NO!" vote on Hillary Clinton on November 8.
