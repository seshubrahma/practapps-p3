In recent weeks, Republicans including Meg Whitman, a   executive and Republican   and Henry M. Paulson Jr. the former Treasury secretary, have broken ranks to back Hillary Clinton. In addition to Ms. Collins, multiple other Republican senators, including Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, have said that they will not vote for Mr. Trump under any circumstances. Several other lawmakers, including Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Mike Lee of Utah, have withheld their support from Mr. Trump without saying definitively that they will never cast their ballots for him. Ms. Collinsâ€™s opposition will probably make it far more difficult for Mr. Trump to compete in Maine, where he campaigned last week in an effort to scoop up at least one Electoral College vote.
