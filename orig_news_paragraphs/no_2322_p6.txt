Elevated white blood cell counts could indicate a bacterial infection, and a sputum sample and nasal swab can be taken to see what bacteria are present. But growing bacteria in culture can take days, "and in half of all pneumonia cases, even with tests, we arenâ€™t able to identify the cause," said Dr. Charles S. Dela Cruz, a lung specialist at Yale medical school. If a patient does not get better after taking antibiotics, more testing should begin, Dr. Schaffner said. Only then do doctors begin to worry about a more serious underlying cause, such as leukemia.
