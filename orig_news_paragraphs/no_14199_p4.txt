People who previously could have entered the United States without a visa were instead required to apply for one if they had traveled to one of the seven countries. Under the law, dual citizens of   countries and Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria could no longer travel to the U. S. without a visa. Dual citizens of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen could, however, still use the   program if they hadn’t traveled to any of the seven countries after March 2011.   Trump’s order is much broader.
