Indeed, Brooks himself seemed to suggest that if Ryan were elected Speaker, much of Trump’s efforts to enact his mandate on curbing immigration may have to be done against the wishes of Speaker Ryan. When asked about Ryan’s recent comments on CNN, in which Ryan indicated that the removing illegal aliens is not going to be a "focus" of a Trump administration, Brooks said: "The President of the United States can enforce our immigration laws without any help from the United States Congress. The laws are already on the books. So if Donald Trump wants to secure our border and enforce our immigration law, he has the power to do that regardless of what the Majority Leader of the Senate or the Speaker of the House may think, do, or say.
