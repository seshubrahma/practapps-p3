Guerin pours its bronze on Fridays at the top of the building, molding objects with liquid brass heated to 2, 000 degrees in sand blocks, or flasks. The hardware is finished and plated in the two floors of workshops below. Visiting the premises is like walking into an engraving. Because of its encyclopedic inventory of   and   models, Guerin works with projects like the Henry Ford estate Fair Lane, in Dearborn, Mich. presently being restored, and its clients have included Susan Gutfreund, whose apartment at 834 Fifth Avenue, decorated in the French style, is on the market for $96 million.
