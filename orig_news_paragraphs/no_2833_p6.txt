The demands of protesters, who have sometimes chanted for the release of the footage, gained traction Friday, even after the city made its public defense. When demonstrators took to Charlotteâ€™s streets on Friday for the fourth consecutive night of protests, they reiterated their plea. Protesters also marched in Atlanta. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, said on Twitter that the city should release its footage without delay.
