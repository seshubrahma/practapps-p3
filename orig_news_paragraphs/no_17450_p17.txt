bias at UN, In his last speech to the Security Council just this month, outgoing Secretary General Ban   admitted that there has been an   bias at the United Nations, noting that, "Decades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports and conferences criticizing Israel. " In her abstention statement Friday, US Ambassador Samantha Powers said that, "One need only look at the 18 resolutions against Israel adopted during the UN General Assembly in September or the 12   resolutions adopted this year in the Human Rights Council    more than those focused on Syria, North Korea, Iran, and South Sudan put together    to see that in 2016 Israel continues to be treated differently from other Member States.
