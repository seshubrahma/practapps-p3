It would be very unusual if they settled for her throwing them a bone with her   pick, especially since she’ll want to pivot to the center and make her ticket more appealing, the way young, charismatic, and Latino Julian Castro could. Castro clearly heard the sound of incoming fire from the far Left, because on Monday, Politico reported that he will announce changes to the HUD mortgage program: Among the changes, according to people with knowledge of what’s coming: The Federal Housing Authority will put out a new plan requiring investors to offer principal reduction for all occupied loans, start a new requirement that all loan modifications be fixed for at least five years and limit any subsequent increase to 1 percent per year, and create a "  prohibition" to block any purchaser of   mortgages from abandoning   properties in the hopes of preventing neighborhood blight. HUD claimed these changes weren’t specifically made in response to pressure from progressives, and doggedly continues to insist its critics are using incorrect information to judge the performance of the mortgage program.
