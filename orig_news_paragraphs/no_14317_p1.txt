Here are the next steps to watch as this legal war wages on: More court filings to come, First, the Justice Department might file an emergency motion in front of Robart asking that he "stay" his Friday night order and reverse himself. At the same time, DOJ lawyers could also file an emergency petition to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals called a "writ of mandamus"    essentially asking the higher court to press pause on Robart’s order. A   panel on the Ninth Circuit could ask the Washington Attorney General’s office (who filed the case) to submit legal briefs in response or the appellate court could simply schedule a hearing    most likely by phone    to hear this case on an expedited basis. Separately, another complaint against the travel ban was filed Friday in federal court in Washington, DC.
