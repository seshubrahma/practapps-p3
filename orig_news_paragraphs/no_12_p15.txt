Mr. Obama praised the Bush administrationâ€™s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. " This is a war that we have to win," he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10, 000 soldiers, to Afghanistan.
