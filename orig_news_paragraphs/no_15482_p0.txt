 (CNN) Republican strategist and CNN commentator Ana Navarro slammed GOP leaders for acting like members "of the Donald Trump cult," saying they must "step up and condemn" President Trump when circumstances demand it. Navarro criticized House Speaker Paul Ryan for refusing to comment this week on the President’s tweet suggesting he had tapes of conversations with fired FBI Director James Comey    a statement many interpreted as a threat.   When asked about the tweet on Friday, Ryan told reporters that he was "focusing on what’s in my control, and that is what is Congress doing to solve people’s problems."
