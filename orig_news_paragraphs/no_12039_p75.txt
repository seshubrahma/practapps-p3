About 600 people at a sold out luncheon are dining, drinking, and chatting waiting for Donald Trump to take the podium at the California GOP Convention at the Hyatt in Burlingame, outside of San Francisco, California. The real estate mogul entered the ballroom roughly an hour after he was set to speak. Apparently itâ€™s wild outside, police in riot gear. Peaceful inside, ppl dining  chatting @BreitbartNews #Burlingame pic.
