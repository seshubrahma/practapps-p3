The Obama administration had fought states on the bathroom issue, but let states experiment with marijuana legalization even though federal law supersedes state law under the supremacy clause of the Constitution.   Attorney General Jeff Sessions hit pause on a Justice Department challenge against Texas and several other states that had sued over the Obama administration’s guidance on bathrooms. It is not clear how forcefully Sessions will act against states on marijuana.   The White House’s potential reversal of the   stance on state laws legalizing marijuana puts the federal government at odds with public opinion.
