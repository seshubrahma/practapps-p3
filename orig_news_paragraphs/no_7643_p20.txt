Family Research Council Action President Tony Perkins said: Comments made by presidential candidate Donald Trump today that if abortion were outlawed there would have ‘to be some form of punishment’ for women seeking an abortion are troubling. Trump’s suggestion that he would support punishing women seeking abortions because there are ‘conservative Republicans’ advocating such a policy shows Mr. Trump is ill informed in this vital issue. " While Trump has since ‘clarified’ his position on punishing women, his statements suggest he should spend more time with   conservatives to gain a better appreciation of what their goals and objectives really are," Perkins added.
