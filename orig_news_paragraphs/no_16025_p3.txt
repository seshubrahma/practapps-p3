In fact, over the last few weeks we have seen a parade of   Republicans distancing themselves from Trump in various ways.   On Saturday, U. S. Rep. Mia Love of Utah, the first African American woman ever elected to Congress as a Republican, announced she would not attend the GOP convention and was actually giving up her place as a Republican delegate.    Love, who still will not commit to voting for Trump in November, joins other big name Republicans who have said they will not attend the July convention, including George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Mitt Romney and John McCain. Itâ€™s simply   that multiple former Republican presidents and presidential nominees all refuse to stand up as part of the coronation of Trump as the GOP  .
