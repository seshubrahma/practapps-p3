It takes a lot of bad economic news for Republicans to raise taxes on the folks who write the biggest checks to their campaigns, but even Jim Denning, a conservative Kansas   Republican, went so far as to admit that repealing those tax giveaways was the only fix to the mess he and his colleagues created.

The legislation passed last week provides an additional $293 million in school funding, dollars that will help make up for the neglect that forced four of the stateâ€™s poorest districts to sue their own state government. Leaders in Washington should take note: constituents notice when programs they rely on every day are targeted.
