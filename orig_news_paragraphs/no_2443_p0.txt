The stretch of Fifth Avenue in front of   Donald J. Trumpâ€™s home in Trump Tower will remain open to vehicle traffic for the foreseeable future, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said on Friday. Since the election, the   tower, on Fifth Avenue between East 56th and 57th Streets, has drawn thousands of protesters and gawkers, swelling congestion in that area of Midtown Manhattan. Officials from the New York Police Department and the Secret Service have been discussing how to balance the security of Mr. Trump with the need to keep pedestrian and vehicle traffic flowing, particularly as the holiday season brings crowds to nearby Rockefeller Center and Radio City Musical Hall. The mayor said that security planners were focused on the period between now and the inauguration on Jan. 20, but that they also were preparing for the prospect that Mr. Trump would be a regular presence in the city during his term.
