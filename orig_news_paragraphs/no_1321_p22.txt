The judges on the lower courts  —   a     judge, and two   Circuit Court judges who outvoted a   colleague  —   held that the president should have gone through the administrative procedure called     . If the Supreme Court upholds this ruling, it won’t shift the balance of the power back to Congress it will simply make it somewhat more   for the president to exert his or her will. Only if the Supreme Court announces broad and unprecedented restrictions on the president’s discretion to enforce the law could the ruling impose a meaningful constraint on future presidents   —   and the court won’t do that.
