Mr. Bharara was a highly public prosecutor who relished the spotlight throughout more than seven years in office. He pursued several   cases involving Wall Street, and he was in the midst of investigating   by Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, and preparing to try former top aides to the governor of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo, who are both Democrats. It was not immediately clear how his departure would affect those cases and others that were pending. Mr. Bharara stayed quiet until Saturday afternoon.
