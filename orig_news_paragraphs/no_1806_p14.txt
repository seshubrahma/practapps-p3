In a blog post on Saturday, Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG, noted that Time Warner recently acquired a 10 percent stake in the streaming television service Hulu, which "is one of the lightning rods that regulators have focused on as an example of Comcast’s bad behavior with NBC. " "In our view, regulators will fear that ATT will use its distribution footprint to favor Time Warner content vs. third parties," Mr. Greenfield wrote. Still, any concerns that ATT would treat Time Warner programs like HBO’s "Game of Thrones" or cable networks like CNN favorably, or that it would withhold them from competitors, could be addressed in conditions attached to an approval. Regulators may seek commitments from ATT and Time Warner to make content from HBO available through streaming or through apps, according to Amy Ray, an antitrust partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham  Taft.
