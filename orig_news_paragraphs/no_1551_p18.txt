That sort of comedy was a product of a less polarized political era, one with less niche programming and more swing voters, with liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, with some consensus on the basic functions of government.      comedy doesn’t work when the road no longer has a middle wide enough to ride a bicycle down. That’s why, where past "Tonight" hosts made light fun of politics, today Jimmy Fallon is most effective when he avoids politics altogether. He’s good at it, and the ratings are great.
