Holder had refused to provide documents for the House investigation into the Obama Administration Fast and Furious gun running scandal. As a result, Holder was held in contempt on June 28, 2012. The grand total of combined airtime between the three networks on Holder being held in contempt of Congress garnered just 10 minutes and 38 seconds, according to MRCâ€™s calculation. The morning of the vote to hold Holder in contempt, the three morning shows carried a combined 91 seconds of the story.
