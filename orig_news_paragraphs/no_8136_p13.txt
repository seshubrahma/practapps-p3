Last week, Bob Dole said he would prefer Trump over Cruz for the nomination. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who is the longest serving Governor in the country and has never been involved publicly in the Iowa Presidential caucuses, came out strongly last week against Cruz, specifically over the candidate’s opposition to ethanol and wind power mandates and subsidies. Caddell said Branstad’s comments against Cruz were a little disingenuous, since the Governor’s son works for the ethanol lobby in the state.
