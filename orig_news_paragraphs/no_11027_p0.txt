In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, Pat Buchanan declared that Trump’s rise represents a rejection of 25 years of Bush Republicanism —   an ideology which Buchanan says has destroyed America’s   manufacturing core, flooded the country with   workers, and drained the treasury with   foreign adventures in the Middle East. ["In the GOP nomination race, the chickens of a quarter century of Bush Republicanism have come home to roost," Buchanan told Breitbart. " Trump’s triumphs to date are due to his recognition of, and identification with, the Middle American revolt against Bush family ideology and policy, and what it has produced. "  Buchanan explained that "America is rejecting the Bush immigration policy," which has "proffered amnesty" to "12 million illegals  …     because it said the United States is helpless to do anything about their presence here. "
