Before 2009 and the creation of Article 50, there was no clear   way for member states to exit the EU. It was passed as part of   the Lisbon Treaty, an international agreement signed by all EU   member states. ’ ’    The key parts of the text state that any country wishing to leave   the EU must do so by their own "constitutional arrangements" and   that EU treaties will cease to apply to the exiting exactly two   years from notification.
