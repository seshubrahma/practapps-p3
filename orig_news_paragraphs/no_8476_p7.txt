In reality, fascism is a political theory with some specific attributes, not an   synonym for tyranny.   For example, fascism retains private ownership of capital, unlike communism, but (like with socialism) the fascist State controls this nominally private industry from behind the scenes.   The fascist State requires a firm grip of the public mind to nourish the power it needs to maintain total control. So the private owners of capital and property must be made to accept the absolute authority of the governmentâ€™s planners.
