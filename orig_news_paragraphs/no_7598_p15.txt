Ryan’s spokesman told Buzzfeed that the Republican House Speaker is "fully confident" the election will be carried out "with integrity. " The statement from Ryan’s office is remarkable given the fact that a 2014 report from the Washington Post documented how   foreign nationals illegally voting in U. S. elections "likely gave" Democrats the pivotal 60th vote necessary to pass Obamacare. This means that, despite the fact that the healthcare law Ryan claims to oppose may only have been enacted because foreign citizens illegally cast their ballots in U. S. elections, Ryan decided to directly contradict his nominee and preemptively sanction the results of the election.
