Hillary Clinton didnâ€™t attend the fundraiser, but she did address the crowd, asking for their continued support, via a taped message. " We are in the final stretch of this campaign and we need your help to reach as many people as possible between now and Election Day," Clinton said. Other celebrity performances and appearances came from Matthew Broderick, Emily Blunt, and Academy Award winner Helen Mirren.
