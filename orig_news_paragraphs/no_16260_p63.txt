, I was in the back of a San Diego high school library. With their teacher and school principal riding shotgun, a group of predominantly Latino eleventh graders were yielding their planned focus on "The Great Gatsby" to meet with myself and leaders in their community to discuss matters related to social inequity in America.   I noted that the girls outnumbered the boys three to one. (High demographic numbers do not necessarily result in power    think   South Africa).
