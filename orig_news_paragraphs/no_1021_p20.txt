In response to the fires, the department is planning on Tuesday to announce $6 million in aid to affected farmers and ranchers to help restore their land, water and fences. But at about $10, 000 per mile, Mr. Gardiner said, new fencing alone may cost his ranch about $2 million. His total losses could reach $5 million to $10 million. Like many ranchers out here, he had insurance on his home and equipment, but said insuring so many livestock and so much fence was impossibly expensive.
