NEW YORK CITY, New York   —   Republican nominee for president Donald J. Trump has taken the lead in Colorado and maintains his lead in Ohio, two new Breitbart News   Marketing polls released on Sunday show. The promising polls for Trump come just before the   debate an hour from here on Monday night, at Hofstra University on Long Island.   In Colorado, a swing state with 9 electoral votes, Trump leads Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton by 4 points —  outside the survey’s 3. 5 percent margin of error.
