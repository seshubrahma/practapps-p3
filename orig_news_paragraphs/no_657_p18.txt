Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey told voters who pressed for town halls that he was not scheduling them because they had been "hijacked" by groups hostile to Mr. Trump. The committee plans to run internet ads trying to shame lawmakers for not facing their constituents in public since voting last month on a procedural motion aimed at repealing the health law. Some of the most creative activity is coming from people who are new to political activism. In Plymouth, Minn. Kelly Guncheon, a financial planner who described himself as an independent, has organized a "With Him or Without Him" meeting for Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican who has not scheduled any of his own.
