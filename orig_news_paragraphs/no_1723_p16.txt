I don’t think this chief justice will accept being in a permanent minority on the court," he said. With two notable exceptions, Chief Justice Roberts’s voting record in major cases has been generally conservative since he joined the court in 2005, succeeding his old boss. He was in the   conservative majorities that decided District of Columbia v. Heller, which established an individual right to own guns Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which amplified the role of money in politics and Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted the core of the Voting Rights Act. And he dissented when a narrowly divided court’s rulings meant liberal victories on gay rights, abortion rights and affirmative action.
