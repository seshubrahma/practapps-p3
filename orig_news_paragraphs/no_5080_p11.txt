Adding insult to injury, your tax dollars support refugee families through the welfare system because wages are too low! You pay for the importation of the labor and for the laborers’ support once here! It is really quite a difficult obstacle for us (who wish to see the USRAP reformed) to overcome —  big businesses and global corporations pushing cheap labor in conjunction with   ‘religious’ charities (paid by taxpayers!) claiming this is all about humanitarianism while essentially acting as ‘head hunters’ for big business.
