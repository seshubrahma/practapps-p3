While the court did not dispute Pence’s assertion that Indiana had a "compelling interest in protecting its residents from the   threat of terrorists posing as refugees to gain entry into Western countries," it noted that as of this date, no evidence has been unearthed showing that such undercover operatives are among the Syrians sent to Indiana. Posner exploited the opportunity of being the opinion ’s author to take a couple cheap shots at the vice presidential nominee, such as referring to Pence’s concern for Hoosiers’ safety as "nightmare speculation" —  an opinion that terrorist victims in Paris and Nice might not dismiss so breezily. But in Exodus Refugee Immigration v. Pence, Posner also quoted the provision in the Refugee Act at 8 U. S. C. § 1157( a)(2) where Congress authorizes the president to decide on the basis of "humanitarian concerns or   …     the national interest" how many refugees the federal government will admit each year into the United States.
