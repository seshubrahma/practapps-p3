The suspected gunman, Omar Mateen, was an American who declared allegiance to the Islamic State and was the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan. Mr. Trump extended his opprobrium to that   heavily Muslim country by noting the wide support there for Shariah law. In a separate statement on Twitter, Mr. Trump said that the rampage in Orlando "is just the beginning" and noted that he "asked for the ban" on Muslim immigration to America. He has made his hard line against Muslims central to his campaign, and, even after becoming the presumptive nominee and turning to a broader electorate, refused to fully back off from his call to temporarily halt Muslims from traveling to America.
