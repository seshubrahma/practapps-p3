Law enforcement and intelligence officials say it doesn’t look like Flynn broke the law, but the White House says there was a trust issue.   Apparently, Flynn misled Trump administration officials by initially telling them that he had not discussed sanctions with Russia.   In his resignation, Flynn said he unintentionally gave incomplete information to Vice President Mike Pence. The job of national security adviser is not an official cabinet position, so the president doesn’t need Senate approval to replace Flynn.
