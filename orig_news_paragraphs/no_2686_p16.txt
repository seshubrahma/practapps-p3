If true, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s strength among less assimilated,   and   Hispanic voters in heavily Hispanic and urban areas might be missed in the polls. Mrs. Clinton had a lead of 60 to 26 percent among Hispanic voters in   Florida polls, which used English and Spanish interviews and had the right number of   voters and voters in heavily Democratic areas. Whether Hispanic turnout will be enough for Mrs. Clinton to win the presidency is hard to say. In the most contested states, Hispanic voters represent a larger than average share of the electorate only in Florida and Nevada.
