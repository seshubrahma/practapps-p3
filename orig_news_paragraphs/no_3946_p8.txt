The officials said Trump "did not reveal the specific intelligence gathering method, but described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. " "Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic Stateâ€™s territory where the U. S. intelligence partner detected the threat," it said. The officials then leaked the name of the city to the Post, which decided to withhold most of the plot details under the urging of current officials. The officials said the name of the city would be useful for Russia to help identify the U. S. ally or intelligence capability involved.
