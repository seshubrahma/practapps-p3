Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is considering making a legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily halting immigration from seven   countries amid the tide of   hysteria in reaction to the order. [In an email to Amazon’s employees, many of whom work in notoriously challenging conditions, Bezos said, "America is a nation of immigrants whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view have helped us build and invent as a nation for over 240 year. To our employees in the US and around the world who may be directly affected by this order, I want you to know that the full extent of Amazon’s resources are behind you. "
