The London production stoked controversy, with The Independent approvingly describing a "disturbing, balefully hilarious new play," while many other critics attacked its tone, pace and politics. More than a year later, in the wake of Brexit and the presidential election, that controversy is likely to resonate anew. On the morning of President Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Shawn, who also appears in the play, the director Scott Elliott and the other members of the cast  —   Matthew Broderick, Jill Eikenberry, John Epperson, Larry Pine, Claudia Shear, Annapurna Sriram and Michael Tucker   —   gathered at a rehearsal space to discuss drama as protest and whether or not to invite the president.
