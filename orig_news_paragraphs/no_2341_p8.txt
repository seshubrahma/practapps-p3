Still, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that President Obama, who has pushed for stricter gun control, "believes there’s more that we can and should do. " " And there’s no area where the president has been more outspoken than taking action on   gun safety measures that would make it harder for criminals and others who shouldn’t have them to buy a gun," Mr. Earnest said. James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, has suggested that the increase in violence in some urban centers may be the result of police officers’ being less aggressive in confronting potential crime as departments have been subjected to intense scrutiny over questionable shootings that have been captured on video and watched by millions on the internet.
