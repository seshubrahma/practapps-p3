no stranger to legal claims    in connection with the raucous March 2016 rally.    A federal judge earlier this month cleared the way for a lawsuit by three protesters against the Trump campaign, Bamberger and a white nationalist. US District Judge David Hale ruled out that the attackers were Trump agents but said itâ€™s plausible the   President incited a riot. He denied motions to dismiss or strike portions of the complaint.
