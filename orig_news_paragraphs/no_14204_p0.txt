Hong Kong (CNN) North Korea appears to be restarting a plutonium reactor just as US Secretary of Defense James Mattis prepares to visit neighboring South Korea and Japan.   An analysis of new satellite imagery from 38 North, a North Korea tracking project associated with the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, concludes that country is preparing to restart the reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear facility. The images show that most of a river near the reactor is frozen over, except for where water originating from a reactor outlet mixes with the river    indicating that the reactor is likely operational.
