The BLMâ€™s admission that it used incorrect methodology in these surveys and the decision to suspend the surveys is welcome news," U. S. Representative Mac Thornberry ( ) said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. " The portions of the river that the agency has surveyed strayed widely from the accepted gradient boundary survey method established by the Supreme Court in Oklahoma v. Texas. It is encouraging that the BLM has admitted their error and that all administrative action will be suspended until the matter is resolved.
