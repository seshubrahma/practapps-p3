Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation, formerly an attorney with the Department of Justice, said he expected "fireworks" at the confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily. ["What’s going on here is that, look, professionally, Jeff Sessions has the perfect background to be the U. S. Attorney General   —   from being a line prosecutor working for the Justice Department, to being a U. S. attorney, to being the state Attorney General in Alabama. Professionally, he’s got the perfect background for this," von Spakovsky said.
