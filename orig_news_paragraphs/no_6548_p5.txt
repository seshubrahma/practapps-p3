The first two of a series of three tweets containing Lukens’ comments merely offered condolences and support for the people affected in the London attacks, but the third included a commendation of the London Mayor despite the fact that the President had already made comments regarding Mayor Khan. I commend the strong leadership of the @MayorofLondon as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack.   —   LLukens   https:  .    —   U. S. Embassy London (@USAinUK) June 4, 2017,
