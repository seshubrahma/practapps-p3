On Tuesday morning, after the post had attracted national attention and it was reported that Mr. Flynn had a transition team email address, Vice   Mike Pence denied that Mr. Flynn had ever worked for the team, saying on MSNBCâ€™s "Morning Joe" that he had "no involvement in the transition whatsoever.
