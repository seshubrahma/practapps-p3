Morning Consult says that the poll carries a margin of error of two percentage points, but that seems low considering that each sample population carries its own margin of error and combining sample populations compounds margins of errors. In the poll conducted June 30 through July 4, Morning Consult found Clinton at 38 percent, Trump at 37 percent, and Johnson at 11 percent with 11 percent undecided. Stein was not part of that poll. The poll shows strong support for Trump among Independents, who prefer the GOP nominee over Clinton, 30 percent to her 23 percent and Johnson with 15 percent, Stein six percent.
