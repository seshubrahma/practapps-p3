There’s a short answer and a long answer. The short answer is that the Clinton campaign isn’t as confident that the state is "Hillary country" as it once was, and is trying to get its supporters to lower their expectations in advance by making it sound like New Hampshire. But the longer answer is that it’s worth taking these concerns somewhat seriously: Clinton staffers aren’t the only people in Nevada who think Latinos will punch below their weight on Saturday and might even make up a smaller share of the caucuses than they did in 2008. That’s not good for Nevada’s claim as the first diverse state to hold a Democratic nominating contest.
