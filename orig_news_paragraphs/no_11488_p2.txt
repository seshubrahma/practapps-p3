Mr. Trump has given us only one indication about the type of judges he would appoint, and it does not bode well for those who would like to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has said his sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who struck down the Partial Birth Abortion Ban in New Jersey, would be a "phenomenal" choice for the court. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump also said he thought   Senator Scott Brown would make a "very good" Vice President. If one truly believes, as we do, that abortion is the taking of an innocent human life and is committed to the   priorities of ending abortion after five months, and defunding the nationâ€™s largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood, it would be a disaster to have a vice president who disagrees.
