Several parents who went to the high school complained about the confusion over where to reunite with their children and said they had only heard about the shooting from friends who live in the area. One man said he had received a call from his daughter, a sixth grader, before the school notified him. " She was just in a panic, but what kid wouldnâ€™t be in a situation like that?" he said.
