Obama also rebuffed criticism that he had been slow to respond to allegations of Russian cybermeddling in the presidential election. " My primary concern was making sure that the integrity of the election process was not in any way damaged, at a time when anything that was said by me or anybody in the White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens," Obama explained. He also said curtly that when he met Putin in China in September he told him to "cut it out" and pledged to hit Russia in public and covert ways before he leaves office on January 20.
