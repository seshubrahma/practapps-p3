Utopian dreamers envision it as an emancipation from the meaninglessness of   work. People stuck in   jobs at   restaurants could abandon laboring over the fryolator in favor of growing organic vegetables and reading to their children. Labor advocates embrace basic income as a means of increasing bargaining power, enabling workers to eschew   wages while holding out for better. Libertarians see it as a means of shrinking government by consolidating social service programs.
