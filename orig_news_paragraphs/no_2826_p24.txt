Mr. Obama held a   percent lead among likely black voters (92 to 3 among registered voters). Most of the analysis that shows Mrs. Clinton faring better depends on a comparison with the exit polls, which showed Mr. Romney winning 6 percent of the black vote. My view is that the   polls were probably right, and that Mr. Obama won black voters by an even greater margin than the exit polls found. The exit polls are not good at measuring clustered groups, as the exit pollsters have long acknowledged.
