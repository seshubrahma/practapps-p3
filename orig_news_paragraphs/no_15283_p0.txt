 (CNN) In President Donald Trump’s book "The Art of the Deal," he writes about how important it is to know one’s market, to study hard. He wrote that he likes to gather as many disparate opinions and views about a potential real estate deal as he can before making any final decisions about how it will affect a given area or neighborhood.   So it was a bit surprising to hear him say in an interview Thursday night that he expects South Korea to reimburse the United States for the Terminal   Area Defense (THAAD) system we will soon be deploying to Seongju, a system that Trump said costs about a billion dollars.
