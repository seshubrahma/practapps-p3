After studying tax data from the IRS, the nonpartisan Chronicle of Philanthropy recently reported that states that vote Republican are now far more generous to charities than those voting Democratic. In 2008, the seven   states all voted for President Obama. My father, who kept a charity box for the poor in our house, would have frowned on this fact about modern Democrats. As a person who has risen from poverty and who has created jobs and benefits for tens of thousands of families, I feel obligated to support the American ideals I grew up with â€”  charity,   accountability.
