According to the Post: Marchers  —   mostly women and mostly white   —   said they came to take the most public possible stand against Trump, a candidate and now president whom they said routinely insults women and the issues they care about. But the gathering also provided therapy for many, the balm of immersing themselves in a   sea of citizens who had shared their anxiety and disappointment after Democrat Hillary Clinton’s historic bid for the presidency ended in defeat. The report notes some of the women are "sometimes sleeping on the couches of people they had never met before" due to the vast crowd participating in the march.
