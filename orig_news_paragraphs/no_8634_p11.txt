The Obama Administration sent U. S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns to Egypt for "U. S. mediation efforts" and met with Khairat   the deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was in jail at the time and sentenced for life in prison. Our State Department, under John Kerry, sent a representative to Egypt pressuring the Egyptian government to release terrorists from jail. The Obama Administration also sent Senators McCain and Graham to Egypt to ask the Egyptian government and military to find an agreement with the Muslim Brotherhood. They asked the Egyptian government to "sit down and talk" to the Muslim Brotherhood, who had waged war on the Egyptian people.
