The relocation of a presidentâ€™s body after death is not  . In 1858, the remains of James Monroe, the fifth president, were moved from New York to his native Virginia, at a time of rising sectional tension. And the coffin of President Abraham Lincoln has been moved around his burial spot in Springfield, Ill. at least 17 times, by one count, including a bizarre thwarted effort in 1876 to steal his body and hold it for ransom. Here, the prospect that the presidential remains could be moved yet again has prompted rare fits of passion on the topic of Polk, a man historians have called "priggish" and "colorless," and one whose legacy is often overshadowed by his    mentor, Andrew Jackson, who is buried at the Hermitage, his family plantation, a major tourist draw here.
