Tillerson, who is currently in Italy for the   G7 foreign ministers’ meeting, said Monday the US would take a stand against any government who committed atrocities on innocent people. " We will rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against innocents anywhere in the world," he said, speaking at an Italian war memorial. But he has stopped short of calling for Assad’s removal from office.
