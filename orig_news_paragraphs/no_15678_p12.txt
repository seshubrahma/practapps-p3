The NIH launched this consortium with the European Commission to deliver 200 new therapies for rare diseases and the means to diagnose more rare diseases by 2020.   But now millions of lives may be lost because people don’t have access to the kind of care they once did. In the battle against these kinds of diseases, access to care isn’t so much about the ins and outs of health insurance coverage, it is about the way doctors, patients and research scientists create knowledge together. Investing in medical research means investing in these relationships, and these investments could not only save millions in treatment and care in the long run, but also leave us with a stronger, healthier society.
