Linwood Michael Kaine, a son of former 2016 Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine, faces criminal charges for allegedly joining in an   riot to attack supporters of President Donald Trump in March in Minneapolis, Minnesota. [Authorities charged the    Kaine with "fleeing police on foot, concealing his identity in a public place, and obstructing legal process," according to a detailed Twin Cities Pioneer Press report. " When people seek to prevent others who are peacefully assembled from making their voices heard, it threatens the very foundation of our democracy," a local attorney said Friday after the charges against Kaine and seven others were announced.
