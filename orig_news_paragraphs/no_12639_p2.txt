The poll was conducted after the news that the FBI would revisit the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server. Clinton has campaigned furiously in North Carolina in recent weeks, trying to keep the state from going for Trump in 2016. The state went for Romney in 2012 but went for Obama in 2008. Both First Lady Michelle Obama and President Barack Obama have campaigned in the state’s more populated areas, urging supporters to back Hillary Clinton.
