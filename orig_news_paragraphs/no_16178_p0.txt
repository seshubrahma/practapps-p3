 (CNN) As the Republican convention kicks off in Cleveland, the status of the race for the presidency continues to be advantage Hillary Clinton. Little has changed in overall support for either candidate since the end of the primaries in   despite major moments in the campaign including Donald Trump’s announcement of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, Clinton’s endorsement by her main rival for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and the announcement by the FBI that Clinton would not face charges for her use of a personal email server while secretary of state. But one candidate has made gains since last month: Libertarian Gary Johnson.
