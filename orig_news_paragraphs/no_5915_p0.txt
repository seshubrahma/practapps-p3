A report generated by the State Department on the threat posed by leaks to the media was leaked to Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin, according to his commentary published on Friday. [Rogin, who does not provide the memo or a link to the February 20 memo in his commentary, did give a link to the State Department official who allegedly wrote the memo, Richard Visek, acting legal adviser at the agency.   " The State Department legal office prepared a   memo for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warning of the dangers of leaking by State Department employees," Rogin wrote.
