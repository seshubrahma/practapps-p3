St. Petersburg, Russia, Demonstrators focused their ire not on any labor issue but on a January decision to return a cathedral, one of the cityâ€™s most famous landmarks, to the Russian Orthodox Church, according to Radio Free Europe. Protesters say the church is gaining too much influence and want the cathedral to remain a museum.   Also, according to an Instagram user, anarchists and members of the Russian Socialist Movement marched, chanting, "Our movement is resistance. "
