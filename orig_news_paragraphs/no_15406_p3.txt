Jeffrey Wall, the acting solicitor general, argued Monday that Trump’s statements about Muslims prior to taking office should not be considered evidence of discrimination. Wall emphasized that the revised travel ban was written after the President listened to judges’ concerns that the original executive order discriminated against Muslims. " (Trump) made it clear he was not talking about Muslims all over the world, that’s why it’s not a Muslim ban," Wall told judges.
