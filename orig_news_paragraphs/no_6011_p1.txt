Wayne County GOP chairman Brent Heath said the person responsible "scratched out the word ‘Republican’" in the mural and replaced it with a misspelled slur used to describe gay people and also wrote, "(Expletive) Trump and da opps," a slang term used to describe the police. " It appears to me that their motive was to get in and deface that mural," Heath said, noting that nothing else was damaged in the office. North Carolina GOP executive director Dallas Woodhouse condemned the acts of vandalism in a statement Thursday.
