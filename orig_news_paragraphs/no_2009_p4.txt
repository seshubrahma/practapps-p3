An announcement of a selection for the post is not expected for at least several more days. In an audition of sorts, Mr. Petraeus appeared on "This Week" to highlight his foreign policy experience in the military and his work abroad in the private sector. He also sought to put behind him a potentially significant hurdle to his candidacy: his mishandling of classified material while he was a top general. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in 2015 and was forced to resign as C. I. A. director.
