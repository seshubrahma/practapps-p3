" This Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend the power and duty of the Executive Branch to protect the people of this country from danger, and will seek review of this case in the United States Supreme Court," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. The ban was announced in March, but never got off the ground because federal courts blocked it just hours before it was set to go into effect.
