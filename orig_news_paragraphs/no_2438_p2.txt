A sharp, pugnacious Kansas congressman and former Army tank officer with degrees from West Point and Harvard, Mr. Pompeo was often an unyielding critic of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   —   accusing her of orchestrating a     of the Benghazi attacks.

If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Pompeo would become one of the most overtly partisan figures to take over the C. I. A.  —   a spy agency that, at least publicly, is supposed to operate above politics and avoid a direct role in policy making.
