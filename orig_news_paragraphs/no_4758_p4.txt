Despite several years of historically high deficits, all indicators say that inflation will remain quite low for decades to come. During a meeting inside the Oval Office last week, President Donald Trump said that he wants massive tax cuts, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. He ordered them to prepare a plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 15% prioritizing tax cuts over attempts not to increase the deficit, according to "a person familiar with the directive" who spoke with WSJ. Top lawmakers are scheduled to meet with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn on Tuesday to discuss the administrationâ€™s tax proposals.
