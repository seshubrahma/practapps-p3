The idea of a "deep state," a murky coalition of mostly national security and intelligence officials who are attempting to subvert the President, has begun circulating.    Others suggest that Trumpâ€™s own actions have brought about this state of affairs. After all, the President compared the intelligence community to Nazis and reminded them of their mistake regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. So perhaps the CIA, NSA and others are just getting even, or maybe getting a little revenge against the new President.
