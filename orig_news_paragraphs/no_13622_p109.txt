Cole made some great points about players under the radar who step up big in Super Bowls. If I had to pick a player on the Panthers, I’d choose linebacker Shaq Thompson. He’s the Panthers’s version of Arizona’s Deone Buccannon (played safety in college and plays linebacker int he pros). Thompson also played running back at Washington and I saw plenty of explosive runs in addition to fumble recoveries returned for touchdowns from him while he was at Washington.
