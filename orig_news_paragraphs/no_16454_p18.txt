Despite the challenges in beating Bayh, Republicans believe they can seize on his baggage    namely how he spent his time over the past six years. While he maintains an Indiana drivers’ license, less than a month after leaving office in 2011, he changed his address with Indiana’s Bureau of Motor Vehicles to one of his properties in Washington. (A year later, his license was suspended after failing to appear in court following a speeding ticket in Maryland.) After Bayh stayed at a JW Marriott a short cab ride from his Indianapolis condo last summer, a reimbursement check from his campaign account was sent to his address in Washington, according to Federal Election Commission records.
