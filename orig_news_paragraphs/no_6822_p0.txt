Frank Gaffney, Center for Security Policy president, made a surprise appearance on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily to react to the news of National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s resignation. ["Is it as simple as ‘you lied to the vice president you have to go,’ or is there more to it than this?" asked SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.   " Obviously, the underlying issue was the relationship he had with this ambassador from Russia, but I think it’s much more than that," Gaffney said of Flynn.
