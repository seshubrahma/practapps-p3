Washington (CNN) Video was released Friday of Donald Trump acknowledging that his   comments calling Mexicans "rapists" harmed his business interests. A District of Columbia Superior Court released earlier this summer transcripts of Trumpâ€™s deposition and sworn testimony from his children over his loss of business following his comments on Mexico. CNN and a group of other news outlets petitioned successfully for the release of the actual video from the lawsuit involving two Washington restaurateurs.
