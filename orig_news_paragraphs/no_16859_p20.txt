Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk tweeted that Trump should drop out and that Republican Party leaders should engage rules for an emergency replacement. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard is backing Pence tweeting that "enough is enough" and "this election is too important" to keep backing Trump. Dan Sullivan, Alaska’s junior Republican senator, called on Trump to step aside for Pence as the billionaire "can’t lead on critical issue of ending domestic violence and sexual assault." "It would be wise for him to step aside and allow Mike Pence to serve as our party’s nominee," Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer tweeted.
