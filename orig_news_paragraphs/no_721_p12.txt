Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, a     Democrat up for   in 2018, cautioned that loathing Mr. Trump, on its own, was not a governing strategy. He said he still hoped for compromise with Republicans on infrastructure funding and perhaps on a plan to improve or "repair" the Affordable Care Act. " There is this vitriol and dislike for our new president," Mr. Carper said.
