’ ’    "The Fourth Turning" is the story of our country unifying against   internal struggles and an outside threat. The authors describe it   as the natural course of history, as something that just falls   into place. Instead, what we are seeing, with Trump’’s travel ban   and his threats against Mexico and China, is the creation of   enemies, enemies many Americans don’’t want to have.
