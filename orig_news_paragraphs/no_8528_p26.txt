During a July 27 radio interview with fellow Never Trump member Erick Erickson, Glenn Beck and his   articulated an ambitious scheme to run a third party candidate in red states that are not battleground states for Trump. The idea, which was explained by Beckâ€™s    Stu Burguiere, is to have this independent candidate siphon off enough votes from Trump to keep Trump and Hillary Clinton under the threshold of 270 electoral votes needed to win the race outright, thereby throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide the outcome, where they hope a Republican House will elect their independent candidate or another person who is not Trump.
