’  ’ ’   DUBAI (Reuters)    Iran said on Sunday it had negotiated to pay   only about half the announced price for 80 new Boeing airliners   in an order that the American planemaker had said was worth $16. 6   billion. ’ "   Boeing and its European rival Airbus have both signed huge   contracts this month to supply airliners to Iran, the first such   deals since international sanctions were lifted under a deal to   curb Tehran’s nuclear program. " "   Replacing Iran’s antiquated civil aviation fleet is one of the   biggest economic opportunities of the 2015 accord to lift   sanctions, which was negotiated by the outgoing administration of   U. S. President Barack Obama.
