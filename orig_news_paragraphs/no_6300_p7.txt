King, who is the chairman of the Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, said the only exception to the protection for the unborn in the bill is for those circumstances when the life of the mother is in physical danger. Abortionists who violate the law would face up to five years in prison, he said. The bill was filed Jan. 12 and was referred to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration. Porter, who is the founder and leader of Faith2Action, told Breitbart News she started fighting for the Ohio heartbeat bill on St. Valentineâ€™s Day 2011, and in December it passed the Ohio House and Senate, but it was vetoed by Gov. John Kasich.
