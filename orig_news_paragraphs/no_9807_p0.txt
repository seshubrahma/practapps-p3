In a confused and confusing article, Huffington Post writer Massimo Faggioli declares that a majority of Catholic Republicans support Donald Trump in spite of the Pope’s alleged opposition to the Republican candidate, because of their underlying racism. ["What’s most interesting," Faggioli writes, "is that the xenophobic and nationalist candidate has earned the vote of a majority of Catholic Republicans, either unaware or uninterested in the fact that Pope Francis said, just three weeks ago during his return flight from Mexico, that Trump’s message ‘is not Christian. ’ "  Faggioli seems to assume, at least for the sake of his argument, that the Pope’s offhand comment to a journalist aboard the papal plane returning from Mexico somehow constituted a reasoned opinion regarding Trump’s suitability for office.
