There would be evidence of widespread connectivity with devices," said L. Jean Camp, a computer scientist at Indiana University who has studied the data.    Cendyn has also provided another possible explanation, suggesting a highly technical case of mistaken identity.    Cendyn routinely repurposes computer servers    like the one used by the Trump Organization.     Cendynâ€™s software, like its event planning tool Metron, sends email and thus relies on the 20 different email servers rented by the company.
