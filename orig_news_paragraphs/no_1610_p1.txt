It has been all downhill since. Donald J. Trumpâ€™s   plummet in the polls has taken vulnerable Republican Senate candidates along for the ride, throwing the door open to the prospect of a Democratic majority under the leadership of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. On top of that, the Trump campaign brought on Stephen Bannon, the head of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News, which has savaged Republican congressional leaders like Mr. McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan as hypocritical quislings. The new campaign team is also promising to let Mr. Trump be Mr. Trump, a prospect that no doubt terrifies many Republican candidates who would prefer not to comment on more incendiary statements from the Republican nominee.
