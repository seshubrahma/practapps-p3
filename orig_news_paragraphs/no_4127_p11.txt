Trump has asked for roughly $1 billion to install or upgrade roughly 60 miles of border walls and fences this year.   GOP leaders are reluctant to fund the wall, in part, because they don’t want to trade some of their budget priorities to persuade the Democrats to compromise on their   opposition to Trump’s wall. Many Democrats fervently oppose the wall, which would literally and symbolically cement his 2016 victory and also block the migration of consumers, cheap workers, and future voters into   cities.   Also, GOP leaders know their business donors oppose the wall, which would reduce the inflow of   consumers and workers to the corporate members of the many Chambers of Commerce throughout the United States.
