A White House official, in remarks to reporters on the eve of President Trump’s meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday, said the Trump administration would not push the   solution, an apparent retreat from decades of American policy. In his news conference with Mr. Netanyahu in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Trump directly broke with diplomatic tradition on the issue by saying his concern was the "deal," not whether that included a state for Palestinians. " I’m looking at two states and one state," Mr. Trump said.
