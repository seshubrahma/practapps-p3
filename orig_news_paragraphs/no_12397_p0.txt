Rachael Bade writes in Politico.   Two prominent House allies of Paul Ryan broke with the speaker Friday over his decision to withhold support from Donald Trump, comments that point to a growing split among congressional Republicans over how to deal with the presumptive nominee. Reps. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia and Dennis Ross of Florida  —   who, as House whips, help Republican leaders muster support to pass legislation   —   told POLITICO in interviews on Friday that they disagreed with Ryan’s decision to break with Trump in a bombshell interview a day earlier.
