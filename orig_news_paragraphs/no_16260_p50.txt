What kind of president Hillary Clinton will be is more important to my friend than Clintonâ€™s gender, as would certainly be true for me if the shoe were on the other foot.

Donald Trump is deeply wrong to think that women would vote for Hillary Clinton just because she is playing "the woman card. "
