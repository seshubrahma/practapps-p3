Of all the money raised from the three committees, 80 percent came from small donors. The Republican National Committee said it raised $41. 3 million in the first three months of the year, but as of Saturday morning, it had not filed its final quarterly report with the FEC. The three committees spent a combined total of $4. 7 million on hats,   mugs, and stickers, according to the reports.
