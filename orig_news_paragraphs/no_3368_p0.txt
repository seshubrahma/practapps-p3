This week at a town hall event in her home state of Hawaii, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ( ) said she was "doing her homework" on the impeachment process of President Donald Trump but warned President Mike Pence would potentially push through a more conservative agenda.   Gabbard said, "On the issue of impeachment, I am doing my homework. I am studying more about the impeachment process. I will just say I understand the calls for impeachment, but what I am being cautious about and what I give you food for thought about is that if President Trump is impeached, the problems donâ€™t go away, because then you have a Vice President Pence who becomes President Pence.
