Adam Green, a   of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said that he was hopeful that Republicans would continue to block Judge Garland’s confirmation before the election and in the   period. With Mrs. Clinton’s improved prospects of winning, he said he hoped she would pick someone more liberal. " Garland was the most conservative pick a Democratic president could have made," Mr. Green said.
