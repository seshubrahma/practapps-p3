Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor who was then considered one of the   innovators of the party, warned after Romney’s defeat in 2012 that the G. O. P. must stop being "the stupid party" and urged fellow Republicans to talk "like adults" and swear off "offensive and bizarre" rhetoric.

" (Jindal dropped out in November Trump barely bothered to insult him.)
