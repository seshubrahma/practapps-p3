 (CNN) Former President Barack Obama   into public life on Monday in Chicago and, in the process, offered a potent reminder of what a radical change in direction the country took in the 2016 election. Obama sat in the middle of a group of young people    all of whom shared their own personal stories about their involvement in public life and why more people their age didnâ€™t follow their lead. He spoke, briefly, at the start of the event about what drew him into community service and politics    "this community taught me that ordinary people, when working together, can do extraordinary things"    but spent most of the rest of the event serving as the moderator of the panel.
