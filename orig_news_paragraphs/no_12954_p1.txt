Secretary Schedler denied the request but not for the reason that some would have imagined. The Louisiana Secretary of State told Zakharov he was denying the request was because of the impact of massive floods in the region which affected over 60, 000 homeowners. " I have approximately   of my employees personally affected, we are   and working day and night to prepare for this election along with the changes of precinct locations and other related processes," Schedler said to Kakharov.
