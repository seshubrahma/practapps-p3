After President Johnson announced he would not seek reelection, the Democrat Party was ripped apart by a bitter primary between activists opposed to the Vietnam War and allies of Humphrey, who supported continuing Johnsonâ€™s policies in Southeast Asia. The Democrat primary occured against a backdrop of   protests and the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. Kennedy, at the time of his murder, was a leading contender for the Democrat nomination. Vice President Humphrey did not campaign in any primaries, prefering to collect delegates at   caucuses.
