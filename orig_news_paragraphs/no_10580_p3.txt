35 million from a Russian uranium company headed by Ian Telfer, which was a violation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Obama administration. The New York Times confirmed that observation, reporting: As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium Oneâ€™s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2. 35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors.
