While what we saw looked like a scene from a disaster movie, the smell resembled nothing we had ever experienced in a first world country. In amongst all of that, residents and helpers continued to work to remove damaged items, strip out homes, and plan to rebuild their lives from the ground up. Around 70, 000 people have now applied for assistance, but most residents speaking to Breitbart News said they did not have flood cover or insurance because their homes were not deemed by local and national authorities to be in a flood zone. Many, concerned they would get "pennies on the dollar" for ruined possessions, were grateful for the assistance of local churches and the "Cajun Navy"  â€”   a volunteer flotilla force of locals with boats who saved thousands of people during the disaster.
