BRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST AND SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome back.   We are live from Hofstra University, the site of Monday nightâ€™s presidential debate.   We are here inside of the hall where the cameras are in place and the pretend   are actually practicing behind us.    What you may not know is that although you can watch the debate on CNN and pretty much other network and website, the debates are not produced or sponsored by any television network.
