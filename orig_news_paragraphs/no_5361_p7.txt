Or, at least, he served with a "Republican" administration. But what’s quite evident from his demands for a carbon tax is that he belongs to that shiftless    elite which couldn’t give two hoots whether it’s a Democrat or Republican in charge, just so long as the elite get to maintain their power base and their revenue stream. Note how, back in 2014 when he was calling for that carbon tax in the New York Times, he boasted about teaming up with Tom Steyer (  hedge funder, creator of the NextGen super PAC) and Michael Bloomberg. These men are not conservatives.
