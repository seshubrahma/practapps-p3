But Hitler has become mass murder’s symbol, and was responsible for the most   and   genocide of all time. Spicer is right to point out Assad’s relationship with Hitler, since the Syrian butcher is attempting a genocide of Sunni Muslims in Syria carried out by Alawite militias, Shia Iran, and Hezbollah (which is also Shia).
