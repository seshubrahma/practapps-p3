To walk Fifth Avenue north from 34th Street to Central Park this season is to discover a startling paucity of merchants making more than a token nod to the holidays in their window displays. Never mind elves or Santa or Rudolph the   Reindeer. Barely a snowflake is to be found at   retailers like Zara, the North Face, Urban Outfitters, Uniqlo, Fossil, Tommy Bahama, Oakley, Guess, Desigual, Sephora or HM. This stark absence underscores both a shift in consumer patterns and the precious anachronism of what few holiday windows remain.
