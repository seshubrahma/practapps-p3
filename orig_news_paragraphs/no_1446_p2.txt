A careful reading of the Moody’s report shows this: Its underlying assumptions about what Mr. Trump would do as president and how the effects of those policies would ripple through the economy are plausible, and squarely within the mainstream consensus view among economic forecasters about how the economy works. But the report also offers a big helping of false precision, giving exact numerical forecasts on effects that have vast amounts of uncertainty. It’s worth being skeptical about Moody’s projection that Trump’s policies would cause a 1. 5 percent contraction in gross domestic product in 2019. After all, forecasters aren’t even sure what G. D. P. growth will turn out to be in the second quarter of 2016, which ends in nine days.
