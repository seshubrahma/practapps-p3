The Democrat Presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is very close as well. The Democrats also have a   race for the nomination to challenge Sen. Rob Portman for one of the state’s U. S. Senate seats. These races will likely dampen the number of Democrat or   Independents who cross over into the Republican contest. Aside from polling, however, Kasich should be considered the favorite as the sitting Governor of the state.
