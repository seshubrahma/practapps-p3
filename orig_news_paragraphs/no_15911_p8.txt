" Troop levels in Syria are officially now around 500, though officials tell CNN the number on the ground is closer to 1, 000. Officials have explained that discrepancy by saying the difference is due to temporary forces not being counted as part of the official total. The same is true in Iraq, where the official number of US troops is a little over 5, 000, though officials have told CNN in the past that levels are actually closer to 7, 000.
