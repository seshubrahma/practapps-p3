Instead of   Americans get ObamaCare because of the recalcitrance of conservative members of Congress. The   people want their Republican colleagues to act like they control the House, Senate, and the presidency instead of capitulating to the people who no longer control the House, Senate, and presidency as they did when ObamaCare passed. Why settle for a   status quo when they could get the status quo ante? Seven years ago, all Republicans opposed ObamaCare.
