Their work is still one of the greatest achievements of string theory, the vaunted and yet unproved theory of everything. If this estimate of the content in a black hole matches one made from supertranslations, physicists would arrive at a fundamental, new understanding of how they work. But Dr. Strominger and Dr. Perry admit that they are not anywhere near doing that yet. In a new paper not yet released, Dr. Strominger said that they had been able to show that information could also be encoded in the twisting of light beams trying to escape from the black hole, not just their sliding back and forth.
