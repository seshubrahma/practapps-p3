Several American citizens figure among the tens of thousands of people jailed under Mr. Sisi, most notably Aya Hjazi, a humanitarian worker arrested in May 2014 on what have been widely viewed as   charges of trafficking and child abuse. Human rights groups say the charges are part of a wider crackdown on   aid groups in Egypt that has drawn sharp criticism from some quarters in Congress. In December, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans, said they would support new restrictions on aid to Egypt if a proposed new law there restricting aid groups is approved   —   a measure of the possible limits of Mr. Trump’s embrace of Mr. Sisi.
