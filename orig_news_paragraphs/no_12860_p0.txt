Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly died on Monday afternoon. [The "Sweetheart of the Silent Majority" passed away surrounded by family in her home in Ladue, Missouri just a short   drive from where she was born in St. Louis on August 15, 1924.   Her death marks a palpable loss for the conservative movement which, just last month, celebrated the grassroots heroineâ€™s 92nd birthday. An accomplished lawyer, activist, author, and mother of six, Phyllis Schlafly has been described as the embodiment of the ideal American woman.
