The existing platform, adopted in 2012, is replete with disapproval of homosexuality. It calls court decisions favoring   marriage "an assault on the foundations of our society" and accuses the Obama administration of trying to impose "the homosexual rights agenda" on foreign countries. Paul E. Singer, a billionaire Republican who has financed gay rights battles across the country, is now funding an effort to write into the platform language more inclusive of gays, lesbians and transgender people. The goal of his group, the American Unity Fund, is not to get the party to endorse   marriage but to add a more   statement that commits the party "to respect for all families," though there is still fierce resistance from the right.
