For the last eight summers, Mr. Reid has staged a festival of music, food, drinks and fashion in Florence, Ala. and on Monday, he gathered around him friends from many realms, including the musicians Winston Marshall and the Watson Twins. " Conceptually, it’s about people sharing their talents and inspiring each other," Mr. Reid said. He also brought in the blues musician Cedric Burnside to offer his rendition of "Love Her ’Til I Die," along with Karen Elson, the luminous British model turned Nashville singer, who took to a microphone with a tune from her new album, "Double Roses," as models of both sexes ambled through the crowd.
