President Barack Obama imposed a   lobbying ban for officials who left his administration, a policy instituted by executive order on his first day in office.

A common practice in Washington is for key power players not to register as a lobbyist, but instead work as a consultant or adviser    allowing them to take their experience and contacts to make hundreds of thousands of dollars on K Street.
