For much of its existence, the chamber acted as a trade association for American businesses, typically adopting   stances on deregulation of various industries, corporate tax rates and trade agreements. That changed when Mr. Donohue took over as the chamber president in 1997. The former chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, with his shock of white hair and   demeanor, Mr. Donohue, 77, morphed the chamber into a political lobbying machine with revenue topping $200 million, according to its 2014 tax filings. The chamber says it does not get involved in presidential elections, and that is mostly true.
