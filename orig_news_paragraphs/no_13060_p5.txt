So PolitiFact and Schwerin miss the fact that one does not have to "repeal," erase, or otherwise remove the words of the Second Amendment to "abolish" it. The most simple approach would be to let it stand but empty it of meaning. And that is exactly what Clinton tries to do when she wars against Heller and refuses to admit the existence of a constitutional right to keep and bear arms. It is a covert means of abolishing the Second Amendment.
