Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai plans a quick repeal of the controversial net neutrality order and wants to replace it with lighter regulations intended to preserve an open internet. [Chairman Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, met with telecommunications groups on Tuesday to discuss his plans .

Net neutrality prohibited telecommunications companies from creating internet "fast lanes" that would ensure consistent Skype video chat, and   Netflix streaming.
