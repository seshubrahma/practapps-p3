Cleveland (CNN) Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman whose outsider campaign has both galvanized millions of voters and divided the Republican Party, is the 2016 GOP presidential nominee. The New Yorkerâ€™s embrace by the Republican National Convention marks a remarkable moment in U. S. political history and validates a campaign that shattered precedent, defied pundits and usurped the GOP establishment. His son Donald Trump, Jr. cast the votes for the New York delegation that put the billionaire businessman over the top of the 1, 237 delegates he needed to clinch the nomination, as any talk of disruptive protest votes or walkouts dissipated.
