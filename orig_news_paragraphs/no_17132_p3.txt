The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 700 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation since the election.   A   hot line that Cuomo launched on November 15 to connect New Yorkers with the state Division of Human Rights to report incidents of bias and discrimination has received more than 400 calls since Friday, according to Cuomoâ€™s office. Calling this kind of prejudice a "social poison [in] the fabric of our nation," the governor cited a number of recent incidents, including a scourge of swastika graffiti and the case of black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania being sent pictures of lynchings and racial slurs. Cuomo also vowed to set up a legal defense fund for immigrants who fear prosecution under a Trump administration.
