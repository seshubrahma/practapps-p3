Born in Massachusetts, he attended the University of Notre Dame undergrad and then went to Georgetown University Law Center. His judicial paper trail includes a dissent in a case where the majority upheld a New Jersey law that prohibits handgun possession without a permit. To bolster his opinion, Hardiman cited Scalia’s landmark opinion in DC v. Heller. If Trump has questions about Hardiman’s personality, he can always ask his own sister who also sits on the 3rd Circuit.
