But the main story of this election remains that there were enough white voters in America who were tolerant enough of Donald Trump’s bigotry and misogyny to make him our next president, while an overwhelming majority of people of color rejected him. And it wasn’t just, or mostly, about economic angst. Clinton won the vote among those making less than $50, 000 while Trump did best where the jobless rate has improved the most since 2009. (Trump won white voters overall by 20 percentage points, the rich and poor.)
