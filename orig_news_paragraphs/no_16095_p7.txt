Two sources familiar with the vetting process told CNN earlier Wednesday that Corker was "very seriously" being vetted and had submitted a lot of information to Trumpâ€™s campaign. He was on a very short list, the sources added. But although he had received paperwork from the campaign, he had not turned it all over, a source familiar with the process told CNN. The campaign had yet to ask him for all of the paperwork, and Corker had not had his final interview with Trump regarding the position, the source added.
