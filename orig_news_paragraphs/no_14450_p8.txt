: There’s no evidence Flynn, as an adviser at the time to   Trump, had authority from Obama to speak with foreign officials. A US official confirms that Flynn and Kislyak did speak about sanctions. The exact context of Flynn’s side of the conversation was not clear, even to the FBI and intelligence groups that reviewed the content, a US official told CNN. Given that third point, it’s unclear whether Flynn’s conversations related to a "dispute or controversy," or whether he had an "intent to influence" a foreign government.
