The meeting lasted for about 10 minutes, the official added. Kushner’s involvement in a meeting was first reported by The New Yorker, and Flynn’s by The New York Times. The official disputed the idea that accepting a meeting with the Russian ambassador could be cause for concern in light of the discussion about Russian meddling in the US election, characterizing the meeting as merely an attempt to meet key international players during the transition to power. The official added that Kushner met with dozens of other ambassadors.
