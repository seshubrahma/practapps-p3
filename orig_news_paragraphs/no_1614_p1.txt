The burkini is a wonderful piece of clothing because it allows observant Muslim women to go swimming, to cool off, to have fun, like any other person. If the burkini is banned, the result won’t be for observant Muslim women to go swimming in a   women’s swimsuit. The result will be for such women to not go swimming at all, but to stay fully covered and on dry land. Is that a victory?
