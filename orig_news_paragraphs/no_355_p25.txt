Mr. Young apparently first came onto the F. B. I. ’s radar around 2010 because he knew a fellow student at George Mason University, Zachary A. Chesser, who, like him, was a white convert to Islam from Northern Virginia and attended the same mosque. The F. B. I. interviewed Mr. Young that year as part of an investigation into Mr. Chesser, who ultimately pleaded guilty to   charges after he was accused of threatening the creators of "South Park" over the show’s depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. Mr. Young does not appear to have been an F. B. I. target at the time, even as undercover informants began giving the bureau reports about the activities of him and some of his associates. He continued working as an armed officer patrolling   subways and bus lines.
