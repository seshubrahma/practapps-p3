Two months after Page’s trip, the FBI sought and received a warrant from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor Page’s communications. When he returned to Moscow in December 2016, after Trump won the election, Russian   media widely covered and promoted his trip, including RT and Sputnik, which have been identified by the US intelligence community as tools for the Kremlin’s propaganda. RT published stories on all three days of Page’s trip. Sputnik published an   roundup of the presentation and press conference he gave at the   news agency’s headquarters.
