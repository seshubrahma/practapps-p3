" No member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom," the lease says, referring to the Old Post Office building, which the Trump Organization converted into the hotel late last year. After the election, Mr. Trump resigned from his executive positions at the Trump Organization and turned over management of its enterprises to his two oldest sons, as well as to other executives who work at Trump Tower in New York. He also put his assets in a trust controlled by his sons, and made himself the ultimate beneficiary of the trust.
