The Golden Globes are great fun, and so is its red carpet. Among this year’s first arrivals were the Stallone sisters, this year’s Miss Golden Globes, shepherded about by their father Sylvester’s     publicist no buttering up of reporters.

Issa Rae and Donald Glover were among the luminaries who admitted to feeling slightly intimidated to being there.
