Many Republicans, even those whose contempt for Mr. Trump matches their ill will for President Obama, still view the choice between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. They believe that Mr. Trump, guided by a   Congress, will break their way more than Mrs. Clinton ever would. For others, the vacancy on the Supreme Court  —   and its potential to reshape the high court’s rulings for years   —   overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee’s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts.
