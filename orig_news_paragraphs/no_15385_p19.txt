Photos of President George W. Bush holding hands with   Prince Abdullah in 2005 led to accusations he was too close to the   kingdom. Obama faced claims he was overly deferential after he appeared to bow to Abdullah    who by then was King    during a summit meeting in London in 2009.   Trump’s maiden voyage overseas will look different than Obama’s international forays for other reasons as well. They aren’t likely to feature the types of sweeping addresses that Obama delivered regularly abroad.
