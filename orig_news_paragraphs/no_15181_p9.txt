Some estimate the changes could eventually cut as much as 30% to 40% from the    budget for Medicaid, while changes to food stamp programs and the health insurance rules might make it harder for families to afford groceries or visits to the doctor.   Medicaid covers 70 million   children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and people with disabilities, and SNAP helps 43 million people put food on the table.   But the GOP has signaled its intention to shift them from being   entitlements to   block, or per capita, grants. Entitlements are unlimited reimbursements to states that expand to cover anyone eligible for help during times of need, such as a recession or disaster.
