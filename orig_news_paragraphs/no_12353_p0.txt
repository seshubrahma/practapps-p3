Despite the inconvenient fact that a devout Muslim has been arrested for a Christmas Day arson that devastated a mosque in Houston Texas, the   propagandists at Salon have not bothered to update a wildly misleading headline that blames the fire on "  violence. "    Although the piece has been updated to include the news that the man charged with deliberately setting the fire, Gary Nathaniel Moore, is a devout Muslim who attended this mosque five times a day, seven days a week, the misleading headline stands without even so much as an "update" added to inform readers that there is new information. Once news of the identity of the alleged arsonist was released, the rest of the dishonest DC Media also lost interest in the story.
