Libertarian icon and Former Texas Representative Dr. Ron Paul appeared on Fox Business channel Friday, heralding a message that neither Sen. Ted Cruz nor any Republican or Democrat candidate for president should win the libertarian vote. [That vote would have gone to Paul’s son, Sen. Rand Paul, who this week suspended his campaign seeking the Republican presidential nomination.   " You’re not going to find anyone in the Republican or the Democratic primary that even comes slightly close to ever being able to claim themselves a libertarian," the senior Paul told Stuart Varney on Fox Business.
