McConnell noted that Rosenstein was confirmed in a bipartsian vote of 94 to 6. Schumer took the floor after McConnell and repeated many of he same lines he used yesterday: The president fired the Director of the FBI Jim Comey, who was leading an active investigation into the Trump campaignâ€™s possible collusion with Russia. The president offered no reasoning for the firing other than he had the recommendation of his attorney general who has already had to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. The question is, why did it happen last night?
