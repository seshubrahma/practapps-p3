House Speaker Paul Ryan says President Trump is right to make sure the U. S. is doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering the country.   This is the first time U. S. refugee admissions had been suspended.   Former President George W. Bush suspended them for three months after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. But President Trumpâ€™s plan is unique and that it bans from specific countries    Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
