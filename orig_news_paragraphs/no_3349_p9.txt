In addition to Republican office holders, administration officials and conservative thought leaders, Breitbart Technology Editor Milo Yiannopoulos is scheduled to deliver CPAC’s keynote address. Schlapp said with Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, the expectations are very high. Another highlight of the 2017 CPAC is the joint conversation with White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus and White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon facilitated by Schlapp. He said: "I think there are a lot of questions that people in the audience probably want me to ask —  like: Hey, how’s it all working up there?"
