There were no immediate indications that the rules of engagement had been loosened for the mission in Yemen, military officials said. The Central Commandâ€™s statement did not elaborate on details of the raid or identify the commando who was killed. A local resident who witnessed the raid, speaking by phone, said he had seen warplanes bombing several houses in the village around 2 a. m. Sunday. The man said he had seen at least three buildings being struck before he fled.
