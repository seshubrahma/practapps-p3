At a Republican presidential debate in November, Mr. Trump said that "wages are too high," and that American workers will need to "work really hard" if they want their incomes to rise. " I hate to say it, but we have to leave it where it is," he said. Interviewed on CNN in May, Mr. Trump said he was "open" to raising the minimum wage, though he remained concerned about the ability of American companies to compete globally.
