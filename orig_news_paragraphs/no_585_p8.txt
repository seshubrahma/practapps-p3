There’s no excuse for letting an international crisis play out in front of a bunch of country club members like dinner theater," Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House, wrote on Twitter. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Tom Udall of New Mexico, Democrats who have called for Mr. Trump’s club to release a list of its members, denounced the president on Monday for discussing the North Korean missile launch in the open. " This is America’s foreign policy, not this week’s episode of ‘Saturday Night Live,’" the senators said in a statement.
