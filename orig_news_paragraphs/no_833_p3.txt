If deep cuts to regulations and a tax overhaul are pushed off to next year, for instance, or if no clear plan emerges anytime soon to rebuild the nation’s physical structures, there is plenty of room for disappointment. " The stock market may be currently expecting a   scenario for policy implementation," Alan Fournier, the founder of the   hedge fund Pennant Capital Management in Summit, N. J. said in an interview shortly before the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 21, 000 for the first time, on Wednesday. A closer examination of what it would take to put into effect Mr. Trump’s initiatives, like a proposal to impose new import taxes, suggests that market participants might be overly excited, Mr. Fournier added.
