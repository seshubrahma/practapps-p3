In 2014, the Obama administration began setting up a program to offer refugee status or special entry for some Central American children, hoping to stanch the  tide of minors making the dangerous journey to the United States on their own. More than 11, 000 people have applied through the program, and just over 2, 400 had been admitted to the United States by Feb. 22, according to the State Department. In Mr. Trumpâ€™s first month in office, 316 people were admitted, the department said. The undertaking has always been slow.
