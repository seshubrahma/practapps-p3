I also think there’s less emphasis placed on line and accuracy and more freedom to dance with more energy and fullness and risk. I’ve done one piece with sneakers for L. A. Dance Project, and I really enjoyed working in that way and I wanted to explore it more at New York City Ballet. We have "[N. Y. Export:] Opus Jazz" and "West Side Story Suite," and I’ve danced both.
