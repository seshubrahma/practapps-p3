Democratic Judge McRae credited Sessions as being responsible for getting Hays sentenced to death. " [I] can assure you the State’s conviction of Henry Hays would not have been possible without Jeff Sessions’ assistance," McRae testified. This sentiment was echoed by Bobby Eddy, a Democrat and investigator from the Mobile district attorney’s office in the Michael Donald case, who has also been credited with having broken open and solved the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four girls.
