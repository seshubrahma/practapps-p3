The White House said Trump thinks Sessions "did a very good job" in his testimony. In the gaggle on Air Force One on Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said the President wasnâ€™t able to watch "much of it," but from "what he did see and what he heard, he thought that attorney general Sessions did a very good job and in particular was very strong on the point that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. " Sanders confirmed that the President did interview Robert Mueller as a candidate for FBI director the day before he was named special counsel of the federal investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia ties.
