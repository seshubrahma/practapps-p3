The J. J.   thriller followed its predecessor in revealing very few details of its plot during its marketing campaign, and audiences responded by heading to theaters to check it out. Meanwhile, according to Box Office Mojo, the "true flop" of the weekend was British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen’s raunchy actioner The Brothers Grimsby, which took in a paltry $3. 2 million from 2, 235 theaters. With a production budget of $35 million, that return makes Grimsby the comedian’s   opening weekend at the box office. The film earned a B+ CinemaScore and sits at just 38% on ratings aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.
