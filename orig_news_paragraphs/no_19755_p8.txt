Late last week, the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to senators that the Republican hearing schedule was "of great concern" and was causing "undue pressure" for the relatively small federal agency responsible for processing presidential appointees and nominees. Walter Schaub, director of the OGE, warned that the Senate would be breaking longstanding precedent by scheduling hearings nominees before some had signed financial disclosure forms and signed ethics agreements. " I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before thenominee had completed the ethics review process," Schaub wrote.
