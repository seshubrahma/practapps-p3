Portsmouth, New Hampshire (CNN) Donald Trump suggested Saturday that his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has been "getting pumped up" with   drugs and challenged Clinton to take a drug test before the final debate next week. Trump argued that Clinton was more energetic during the beginning of their debate last Sunday, but lost her steam by the end of the debate. He offered no evidence to back up his wild claim.
