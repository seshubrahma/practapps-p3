UNITED NATIONS  —    The American envoy to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, described the United States on Wednesday as the "moral conscience" of the world, and she dismissed the United Nations Human Rights Council as "so corrupt" without offering evidence. Ms. Haley said the United States would never close its doors to foreigners who flee persecution, even as she defended the Trump administration’s travel ban, which closed the door to refugees from six   mainly Muslim nations. She insisted that American taxpayers should get value for the money they contribute to the United Nations.
