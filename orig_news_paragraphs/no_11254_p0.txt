An ongoing FBI investigation is looking into the possibility that donations to Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s 2013 campaign may have come from foreign nationals. That is against the law. [Further, similar donations to McAuliffe’s unsuccessful 2009 campaign for governor may also end up causing problems for him, and possibly a greater political problem for Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a long time friend and ally of McAuliffe.   The focus of the investigation may be whether $120, 000 in contributions made to McAuliffe’s successful 2013 campaign for governor of Virginia by Chinese billionaire Wang Wenliang through a company he owns in America are legal.
