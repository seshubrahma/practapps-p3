Spicer "did not signal a change in administration policy," an official said, adding that it was Spicerâ€™s attempt to signal Trump is "never going to rule anything out" when it comes to responding in Syria. The attempted explanation was aimed at avoiding drawing a line in Syria that the Trump administration will have to follow, something the Obama administration dealt with after   Barack Obama drew a "red line" that Trump and other Republicans routinely exploited. The change would mark a significant shift in US policy toward Assad, whose regime is accused of near daily use of the bombs, which are banned by international law because of their propensity to aimlessly maim and kill.
