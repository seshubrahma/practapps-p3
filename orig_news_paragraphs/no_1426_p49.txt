His agreements with lenders and the two casino bankruptcies in those years still left Mr. Trump personally responsible for more than $100 million in debt, and his agreements had only delayed the day of reckoning to June 30, 1995.

More than half of the new money went to pay off Mr. Trumpâ€™s unrelated personal loans.
