The history of the property is filled with financial ups and downs. It was once owned by Robert Dun Douglass, a member of the Dun  Bradstreet family. The property was sold in 1930 to Harrison Williams, an electric utility tycoon said to be one of the richest men in America. After successive owners and building changes, the property was bought in 1988 for $12.
