Who would ever say something so nasty  dumb,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2016,   Trump had called this statement provided by a Fox News spokesperson on Tuesday to a media outlet a "wise guy" press release: We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   —    a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.
