By ending amnesty, securing the borders, ending sanctuary cities, and stopping welfare benefits for illegal aliens, we will see millions of new   jobs come back to America, manufacturing jobs coming back to America, wages rising. So, in three or four years, we’ll hear yet more talk about corporate inversions but this time it’s going to be other countries complaining that their businesses are leaving their countries to come to America because it’s such a good place to do business —  creating jobs here, driving up wages. That’s the proper approach.
