Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton face off in tonight’s presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis. The second presidential debate will be a town hall event where supposedly "undecided" voters selected by Gallup will ask the candidates half of the questions.   CNN ’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Martha Raddatz will moderate the debate and try to put the focus on Trump’s vulgar   talk that occurred nearly a decade ago and for which Trump has expressed regret and apologized.
