During her national address, Haley seemed to deliver the mantra of the   philosophy —   declaring that "No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country. " This argument means that any willing employer should be able to hire any willing worker regardless of the country in which they reside —  thus removing any right that American workers be entitled to get American jobs. Since that address, Haley has appeared on a media circuit tour to tout the virtues of   immigration —  a circuit which seems reminiscent of Paul Ryan’s press tour with Luis Gutierrez to stump for Rubio’s immigration expansion agenda in 2013.
