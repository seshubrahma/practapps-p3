Trump is asked what his "specific objections" are to Common Core. He says he wants local education and is against education from Washington, D. C. Trump says he was with Carson today. He mentions that Carson is endorsing him tomorrow morning and they talked for an hour about education. Great move by Trump to announce the Carson endorsement in primetime.
