Ms. Roginsky asserted in the suit that she faced retaliation for refusing Mr. Ailes’s advances. She said that she was denied a permanent position as a host on the program "The Five" and was rarely allowed to host her own segments on the show "Outnumbered," unlike other panelists. She also stated that she was punished for not joining "Team Roger" when Ms. Carlson filed suit last summer  —   a reference, presumably, to a group of Fox News employees who publicly supported Mr. Ailes.
