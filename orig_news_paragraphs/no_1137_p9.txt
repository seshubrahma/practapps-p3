The shift toward greater military involvement extends into one of Mr. Obamaâ€™s central legacies: the prolonged American presence in Afghanistan, where more than 8, 400 American soldiers and 5, 924 troops from NATO and other allies remain, and where the Taliban have been resurgent. Plans have been announced to send 300 United States Marines to Helmand Province, their first deployment there since 2014. And the American commander, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. told Congress in February that he would like another "few thousand" American and coalition troops. But the changes have also been notable in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, all home to overlapping conflicts in failed states where jihadist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have taken advantage of the chaos to step up operations.
