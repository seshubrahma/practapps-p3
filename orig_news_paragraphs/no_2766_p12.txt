Gregory Holmes, 32, who was visiting last week from Nashville, said he did not come to New York for serenity. " I love big crowds of people enjoying themselves that’s what New York is about, the hustle and bustle," said Mr. Holmes, who was power shopping   —   spending more than $1, 500 on clothes and shoes at stores including Macy’s, HM and Uniqlo
