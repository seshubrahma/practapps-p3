 (CNN) After about four months apart,    Dilbireen Muhsin soon may be reunited with his family. The Yazidi boy, whose name means "wounded heart" in Kurdish, was brought to the United States late last year to receive medical treatment for severe burns on his face. He was left in the care of a Michigan woman while his parents and newborn brother were in their native Iraq, trying to be by Dilbireen’s side and, mostly recently, facing President Donald Trump’s travel ban.
