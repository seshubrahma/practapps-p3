Few politicians ask why America needs unskilled, mass immigration when automation and globalization are already lowering wages, Cotton continues: [The] law of supply and demand is not magically suspended in the labor market. As immigrant labor has flooded the country,   wages have collapsed. Wages for Americans with only high school diplomas have declined by 2 percent since the late 1970s, and for those who didnâ€™t finish high school, they have declined by nearly 20 percent, according to Economic Policy Institute figures. No doubt automation and globalization have also affected wages, but mass immigration accelerates these trends with surplus labor, which of course decreases wages.
