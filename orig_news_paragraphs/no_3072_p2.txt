Most of Amazon’s U. S. growth has been at its 18 "Fulfilment by Amazon" service centers. Although the centers open with   employees, Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky recently stated that due to expansion factors, the company is converting more temporary employees to   positions. The next big phase for Amazon’s growth will be the   of 1, 800    "Amazon Go" grocery stores, which will feature clerkless shopping.
