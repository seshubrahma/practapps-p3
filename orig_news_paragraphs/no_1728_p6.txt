It’s getting to the time of year when I want to eat David’s recipe for pork chops with apples and cider. And who doesn’t want, as fall begins to cool off our evenings a little, to settle into a dinner of Jamie Oliver’s recipe for eggplant Parmesan? The Food for Tomorrow conference runs through Wednesday, so perhaps I’ll get to one of those toward the end of the week. If you beat me to the punch, take a photograph of what you cook and post it to social media, where we monitor the hashtag #NYTCooking on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
