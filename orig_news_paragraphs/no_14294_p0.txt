Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of the Army, Vincent Viola, is withdrawing, citing trouble disengaging with his business ties. " Mr. Viola has informed President Trump that he will be unable to accept his nomination to serve as secretary of the Army as the challenges of separating Mr. Viola from the organizations that he has built over the last   years have proven insurmountable," a statement from Viola’s team on Friday evening said.
