Alex Waldrop, the head of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, predicted the new rule could double the size of the   program this year. " It limits the total number of   workers that may enter the U. S. during fiscal year 2017 to 129, 547," Waldrop said told the website. In practice, companies will not be able to quickly recruit and import that maximum number of workers in 2017, partly because the DHS has yet to establish a process for handling the extra   visa requests.
