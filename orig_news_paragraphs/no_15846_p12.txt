’s scalpel’ For the President, building a team of qualified lawyers to go    against Mueller has gotten off to a slower start. Kasowitz    an aggressive civil litigator and longtime Trump attorney, has been seeking advice from influential DC lawyers on ways to round out the President’s defense team, according to one source, but so far has not recruited one of the more   lawyers with investigative experience to work with him. A source tells CNN that Jay Sekulow and Michael Bowe, another attorney at Kasowitz’s firm, have joined the defense team.
