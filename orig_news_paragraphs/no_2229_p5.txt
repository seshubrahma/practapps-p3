" Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when there was a lot of tension around policing and civil rights and the antiwar movement, weâ€™d never seen anything like what happened in Dallas," said Darrel W. Stephens, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association and an instructor at the Public Safety Leadership Program in the School of Education at Johns Hopkins University.
