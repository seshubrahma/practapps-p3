As for the ground game, Americans for Prosperity has three offices in the state, plans on opening a fourth and intends to marshal hundreds of volunteers to go door to door to reach out to voters identified as being open to opposing Ms. Cortez Masto. " Our No. 1 goal is to educate voters on her record," said Adam Jones, the state director of the group, as young volunteers bustled around the organizationâ€™s headquarters in a strip mall.
