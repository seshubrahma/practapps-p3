If that schedule shows several trips to Utah as well as Arizona over the next week, it will be a clear signal Trump intends to contest both states. Utah, where more than 55 percent of the residents are Mormons, is the only state that has a higher percentage of the population that is Mormon than Idaho. Governor Mitt Romney, a Mormon with strong ties to the state where he helped lead the 1998 Winter Olympics out of financial trouble, chose Utah as the venue to make his recent   pronouncement. While Romney campaigned with Kasich in Ohio, he did not endorse him, and it is unclear if he will choose to strategically campaign with Cruz, who was leading both Trump and Kasich in a February poll taken there prior to Sen. Marco Rubioâ€™s withdrawal from the race.
