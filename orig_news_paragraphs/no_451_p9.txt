A particular concern for Mr. Abe, who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump in Washington next week, is confirmation that the United States would defend Japan in any confrontation with China over a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu. Former President Barack Obama declared during a visit to Tokyo three years ago that the security treaty obligated the United States to do so, the first president to state that commitment publicly. Mr. Mattis did not explicitly mention the islands publicly Friday, but American officials said later that he had reiterated the United States "longstanding" position on the islands in his private meeting with Mr. Abe. Mr. Mattis made a point of saying on Friday that he had served on the Japanese island of Okinawa as a young Marine.
