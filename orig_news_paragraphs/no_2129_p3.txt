The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a coming speech, said Mr. Kerry would also argue that, with the notable exception of Israel, there was a "complete international consensus" against further settlements in areas that might ultimately be the subject of negotiations. At this late date, weeks ahead of the inauguration of Mr. Trump, who openly lobbied on Israelâ€™s side against the United Nations resolution, it is unclear what Mr. Kerry hopes to achieve from the speech, other than to leave a set of principles that he believes will one day emerge as the basis for talks, if and when they resume. Mr. Kerry, the official said, has long wanted to give a speech outlining an   peace deal but was held back by White House officials, who saw it as unnecessary pressure on Israel that would anger Mr. Netanyahu. But that objection was lifted last week as Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry agreed the time had come to abstain on the United Nations resolution.
