With China devaluing its currency, stocks crashing 3 percent and capital flight accelerating, China has cut back its bank reserve requirements to free up $100 billion in credit. [Facing pressure from huge capital flight, the Chinese allowed their yuan currency to devalue to 6. 6 yuan to the dollar on Feb. 29, causing local stock markets to crash by 3 to 5 percent   —   to levels not seen since late 2014.   To try to stop the rout, China’s central bank cut its deposit reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, to 17 percent, in an effort to free up about $100 billion in new credit for the world’s   economy.
