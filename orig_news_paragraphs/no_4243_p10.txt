Once you read this article, you will quickly understand why  â€¦     The U. S. Department of Justice and the U. S. Sentencing Commission reported that as of 2014, illegal immigrants were convicted and sentenced for over 13 percent of all crimes committed in the U. S. According to the FBI, 67, 642 murders were committed in the U. S. from 2005 through 2008, and 115, 717 from 2003 through 2009. The General Accounting Office documents that criminal immigrants committed 25, 064 of these murders. To extrapolate out these statistics, this means that a population of just over 3. 5 percent residing in the U. S. unlawfully committed 22 percent to 37 percent of all murders in the nation.
