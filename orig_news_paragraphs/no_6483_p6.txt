While UTLA called dibs on leading the tweetstorm, the national organizer, the Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools (AROS) disapproved of DeVos, too. The alliance declared it will not "cooperate" with Trumpâ€™s   choice agenda or with his alleged "hateful rhetoric and bullying of immigrant children, LGBT students, Muslims, and others. " AROS consists of progressive community organizations and unions that oppose charter schools, tax credits, and vouchers.   choice critics complain that charters undermine traditional public schools by diverting "billions" of public taxpayer dollars away from their coffers, are run by private entities, are not held to the same accountability standards and, are not unionized.
