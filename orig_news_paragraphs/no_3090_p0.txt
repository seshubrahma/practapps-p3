Over 100 students at the University of Notre Dame walked out of a commencement address given by Vice President Mike Pence, according to local reports. ["It’s deeply humbling for me to participate in the 172nd commencement in Notre Dame’s 175th year," Pence said, as students booed, turned their backs, and walked out of the ceremony.    The walkout was organized by the   student group WeStaNDFor, who began planning the protest after Pence was announced as the speaker in March. In a statement, the group said they opposed Pence’s positions on gay rights, his opposition to the Syrian refugee program, and the administration’s crack down on sanctuary cities.
