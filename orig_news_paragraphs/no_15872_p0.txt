Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) American college student Otto Warmbier has landed back in the United States after more than 17 months in detention in North Korea.   Warmbier has been in a coma for over a year, according to his parents, and will be rushed to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center late Tuesday, a hospital spokeswoman said.   His return to the US comes as questions swirl about his health and what happened to him while he was detained by the North Korean government.
