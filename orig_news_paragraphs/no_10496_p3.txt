If you believe, as Andrew Breitbart did, that "politics is downstream from culture " then it clearly matters very much what our movie and TV stars, pop idols, comics and so on think. Why do you think Hillary had so many of them surrounding her at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia recently? Because, duh, there’s a significant chunk of the voting populace which doesn’t give a damn whether or not their potential next president is a lying, cheating,         witch.
