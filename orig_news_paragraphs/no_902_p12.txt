" The president called Dana Boente and Rod Rosenstein tonight to inform them that he has declined to accept their resignation, and they will remain in their current positions," said Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. It remains possible that Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions could put others on that list later. It is not unusual for a new president to replace United States attorneys appointed by a predecessor, especially when there has been a change in which party controls the White House.
