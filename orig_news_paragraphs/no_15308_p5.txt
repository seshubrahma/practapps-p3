Trumpâ€™s demand for the border wall down payment was rejected by Democrats. They decried the controversial project    and key Trump campaign promise    as immoral and premature since Trump has not detailed plans for building the multibillion dollar wall he had vowed Mexico would pay for anyway.   Aides also agreed that the bill includes billions in new defense spending, including for the global war on terrorism, a major demand from Republicans. In the proposal, there are no cuts to funding for Planned Parenthood, a demand from Democrats.
