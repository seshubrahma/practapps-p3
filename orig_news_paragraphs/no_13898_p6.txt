Other than the striking juxtaposition of Sessions’ hearings and Obama’s farewell speech, the best evocation of the tension that produced Barack Obama and Jeff Sessions in the   rights era is found in the recent documentary, "Black American Since MLK: And Still I Rise," a   series from Henry Louis Gates Jr. that examines the almost Dickensian state of race relations since the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s 1968 assassination.    Both examples underscore the reality that contemporary American politics represents an unseemly mashup of several historical eras interwoven and unspooling right before our very eyes. Obama’s presidency partially fulfilled the ambitious hopes and civic dreams of both the Reconstruction era, a period that offered up the tantalizing possibility of racial equality and deep democracy, and the civil rights movement’s heroic period, when activists bled for democracy in the street of American cities and died in a quest to expand the meaning of citizenship.
