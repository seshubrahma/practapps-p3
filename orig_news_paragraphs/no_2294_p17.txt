Yet according to Mr. Rybolovlev’s   Elena, Mr. Rybolovlev may have had other reasons to pay a high price for the property and to use offshore trusts. When the limited liability company bought the property, the Rybolovlevs were in the midst of a bitter divorce. Mr. Rybolovlev’s   accused him in a lawsuit of "secreting and transferring assets in order to avoid his obligations," and she sought half of the Palm Beach house. Mr. Rybolovlev denied the claims, adding that the trusts were created years before the divorce.
