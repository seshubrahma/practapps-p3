The argument that Trump’s actions were as bad as Disney’s is silly. Trump didn’t hire Americans, then bring in foreigners for a cheaper rate on visas, have those Americans he originally hired train those foreigners to do their jobs, then fire the Americans. Trump simply hired foreigners over Americans. That doesn’t mean what Trump did is good.
