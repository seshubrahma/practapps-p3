The thought that Mitt Romney would ever join the Cabinet of Donald Trump    given their hostility, mutual contempt and venomous rhetorical exchanges    might be the most absurd notion yet of a crazy political year. But the possibility that Trump and the man he labeled a "choke artist" could find common cause in the new administration was nonetheless a hot topic ahead of their meeting Saturday at the  ’s Bedminster, New Jersey, golf retreat. The 2012 Republican nominee, who once warned in a CNN interview that a Trump presidency would mean "  racism" and "  bigotry" instead sat down with Trump and discussed the job of secretary of state, an appointment that would make Hillary Clinton’s decision to serve in the same post under her 2008 primary rival Barack Obama seem routine in comparison. After the meeting, Romney offered no hint as to whether he was offered or would accept a role in Trump’s administration.
