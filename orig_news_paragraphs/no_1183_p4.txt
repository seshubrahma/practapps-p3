This past weekend, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a technical change that could make it harder for   programmers to receive the visas, and on Monday, the Justice Department warned that it would investigate companies that it believed had overlooked qualified American workers. " The Justice Department will not tolerate employers’ misusing the   visa process to discriminate against U. S. workers," Thomas Wheeler, the head of the department’s civil rights division, said in a statement. Each year, 65, 000   visas are made available to workers with bachelor’s degrees, and 20, 000 more are earmarked for those with master’s degrees or higher.
