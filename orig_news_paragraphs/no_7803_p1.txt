The president assured reporters that most people probably still woke up in an America that wasn’t as frighting as Trump had indicated. " I hope people the next morning walked outside and birds were chirping and the sun was out, and this afternoon people will be watching their kids play in sports teams, and go to the swimming pool, and folks are going to work and getting ready for the weekend," Obama said. He argued that Trump’s   statistics on crime and immigration were misleading, citing a different set of statistics to support the notion that violent crime and illegal immigration were actually down in the last   years.
