In terms of strategy, my colleagues Fred Kagan and Kim Kagan and her team at the Institute for the Study of War have laid out a plan to shift the balance in Syria (and Iraq) wrest momentum away from terrorist groups, tamp down the likely confrontation between Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni forces over upcoming territorial victories in both Iraq and Syria, and do so without a massive US troop commitment. But this is a strategy for victory, not a pathway to slinking away, nor a bank shot that enables us to ultimately shift power back to Assad in the name of stability. And what none of us know, at least at this moment, is whether Donald Trump is looking for a strategy, or whether he is simply horrified by the sarin attack and took a tactical shot. Many in Washington and around the country profess to know Donald Trump and his mind.
