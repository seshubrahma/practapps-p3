His daughter, Tayla, posted a photo of him with the plate design to Twitter, which received over 97, 000 likes and has been retweeted over 20, 000 times. Cooper, who was with family when he saw Trump’s tweet and thought it would be funny to buy a "covfefe" vanity plate, said he has not decided whether he will attach the license plate to his car when it arrives in 12 weeks. Evan Milton, 26, of Nebraska, claimed his state’s "covfefe" vanity plate for $40 just five hours after Trump tweeted the word. Milton told the Lincoln   that he applied for the license plate through his state’s DMV website around 4 a. m. because he wanted a vanity plate on his car that came from a meme.
