" You watch, Mexico won’t pay either," said Mr. Milne, a health and safety consultant and   novelist, referring to Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to build a "beautiful, impenetrable wall" along the border and force the Mexicans to pay for it. The Milnes now fly a Mexican flag from their hilltop house, a former coast guard station that overlooks the clubhouse of Trump International Golf Links, whenever Mr. Trump visits. So do Susan and John Munro, who also refused to sell and now face an almost    earthen wall built by Mr. Trump’s people on two sides of their property.
