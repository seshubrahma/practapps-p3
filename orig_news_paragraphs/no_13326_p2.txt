Superintendent Chris Funk learned of the incident after it was reported by the students, which prompted the district to place the unnamed teacher on administrative leave. " No question that some of our students who are undocumented are concerned about deportation and whatâ€™s going to happen to their families," Funk said, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The Mercury News also notes that "[in] the aftermath of the election, the district has posted a letter on its homepage, saying that students deserve a secure environment to process the election results, and asking teachers to remain neutral, share information, listen to both sides of any issue and create a safe space in class and school for discussion.
