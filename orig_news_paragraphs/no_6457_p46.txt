In 2008, Sen. John McCain ( )  —   then the GOP nominee  —   won Sarasota county over   President Barack Obama, but only by 237 votes. In 2012,   GOP nominee Mitt Romney beat Obama by more than 15, 000 votes here, but that still was not enough to win the state of Florida. Trump beat Clinton here by more than 26, 000 votes, a much more substantial margin   —   something that helped him win statewide.
