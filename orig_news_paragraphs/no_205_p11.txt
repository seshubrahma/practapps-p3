That is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years, and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a   period in the NASA record, which begins in 1880. The findings about a   year were also confirmed by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments. That group, however, did not find that three records had been set in a row in its analysis, 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014. In addition to the surface measurements, satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface.
