Governments could anticipate and defend the targets, monitor or disrupt the groups, and ultimately defeat them by targeting their leaders and seizing their territory. But the threat has evolved into something much harder to counter. Insurgent groups in   Iraq, unable to defeat the   occupation force, instead targeted Iraqi civilians wherever they gathered, establishing a method that terror groups now deploy internationally. In 2008, Pakistani militants killed 166 people in Mumbai, India, attacking what experts call "soft" targets: places such as hotels and train stations that are populated but, because of their seeming randomness, rarely defended.
