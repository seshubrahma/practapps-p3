The visa lottery system makes this problem worse by rewarding visas randomly, instead of prioritizing foreign workers with greater experience, skill, and qualifications. I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Durbin to address these problems, and I’ve expressed to President Trump the need to take action to restore the integrity in the   Program.   I’m grateful that President Trump has taken my suggestions to heart by taking steps today to protect American workers and preserve limited   visas for truly qualified,   foreign workers. Industry officials rolled with the punch.
