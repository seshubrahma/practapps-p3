House Republican leaders said they would keep three popular provisions in the Affordable Care Act: the prohibition on denying coverage to people with   conditions, the ban on lifetime coverage caps and the rule allowing young people to remain on their parents’ health plans until age 26. Republicans hope to undo other major parts of President Barack Obama ’s signature domestic achievement, including   tax credits that help millions of Americans buy insurance, taxes on people with high incomes and the penalty for people who do not have health coverage. Medicaid recipients’   entitlement to health care would be replaced by a   allotment to the states.
