Catie Weimer, a record store employee in Salt Lake City who was given a diagnosis of narcolepsy after getting a subsidized marketplace plan last year, said she had joined a group called Utahns Speak Out, which she found on Facebook, as she grew increasingly anxious about the prospect of losing her insurance. Now Ms. Weimer, who is 30 and said she had voted for Hillary Clinton, is helping administer the group’s Facebook page and helped plan a "Utah Town Hall for All" last weekend. Every member of the Utah delegation was invited, but none attended. The health law is by no means perfect in Ms. Weimer’s mind even with a subsidy, her monthly premium jumped to $95 this year, from $47, and she has a $2, 500 deductible.
