Trumpâ€™s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, who reversed his pledge to   his campaign after securing the Republican presidential nomination, is trying to assemble a fundraising operation at an unprecedented speed. The candidate and his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee raised at least $11 million as of last week. As of the end of last month, his campaign had only $1. 3 million in its coffers, compared to $42 million for Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
