* * On a cloudless,   autumn day, I was picked up in an   Ford Interceptor driven by LAWA police officer Tia Moore. Sitting in back was Alicia Hernandez, our official escort for the day. Hernandez is a responsive and jovial veteran of the U. S. Army Reserves, where she spent eight years working airfield logistics and convoy tracking, including a year overseas in Kuwait. Anthony McGinty rode quietly beside her, phone in one hand, a small notebook out on his knee.
