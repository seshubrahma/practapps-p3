At least 10 other people were in custody throughout the day. A senior DHS official told reporters that the United States denied entry to 109 travelers who were in transit to the country at the time the executive order was signed.   The travelers were from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, Libya or Yemen, and were traveling on   visas. The official could not say how many had left the United States already and how many were still being detained.
