Mr. Cohn, president of the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs, is expected to be named director of Mr. Trump’s National Economic Council, joining the Treasury secretary pick Steven Mnuchin as Goldman voices on the economic team. Mr. Trump used Wall Street and "the global elites" as constant foils during the campaign, featuring Goldman’s chief executive and chairman, Lloyd Blankfein, in his dark closing argument. Since his victory, however, Mr. Trump has tapped Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, for Treasury secretary the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to be his commerce secretary Todd Ricketts, heir to the Ameritrade fortune, to be deputy commerce secretary and now Mr. Cohn. The National Economic Council was created by President Bill Clinton
