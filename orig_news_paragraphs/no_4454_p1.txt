Still many large businesses and most small ones are organized as limited liability corporations and pay taxes through the personal tax code â€”  after corporate tax reform they would be saddled with effective rates above 40 percent while their corporate rivals pay half that rate or less.

Also, Treasury   Steven Mnuchin has stated that upper income individuals will not see a reduction in their overall tax burden, but they pay more than 80 percent of the personal income taxes.
