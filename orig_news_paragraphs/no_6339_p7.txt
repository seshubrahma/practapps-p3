What the left has clearly failed to understand about the Tea Party movement, however, is that it was an authentic   effort in response to specific congressional legislation that had a broad effect on Americans in general. It was not a partisan effort to take down President Obama. Democrats have never been able to accept the Tea Partyâ€™s authenticity, which is why their   imitation of the Tea Party will struggle: it is not built on broad popular opposition to Trump policies, but on the energies of committed partisans whose basic grievance is that Trump was elected in the first place. When   activists hold up signs like "RESIST," they are egging each other on, not broadening their appeal.
