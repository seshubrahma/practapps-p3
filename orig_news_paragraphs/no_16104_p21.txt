" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a possible vice presidential pick for Trump, said that "normal white Americans" don’t understand "being black in America."   " It took me a long time, and a number of people talking to me through the years, to get a sense of this: If you are a normal white American, the truth is you don’t understand being black in America and you instinctively underestimate the level of discrimination and the level of additional risk," Gingrich said on CNN Political Commentator Van Jones’ Facebook Live stream.
