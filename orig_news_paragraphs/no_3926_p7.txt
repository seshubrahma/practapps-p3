that is what it means to have laws and to have a country," Trump said. The Trump transition team also requested that the Department of Homeland Security " assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction," and look into expanding detention capabilities for illegal aliens and aerial surveillance of the U. S.  border: In response to the transition team request, U. S. Customs and Border Protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the U. S.  border, and about the same distance along the U. S.  border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by Reuters   â€¦     One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was Operation Phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1, 200 Army National Guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration
