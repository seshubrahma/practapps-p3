Rep. Renee Ellmers, who is facing her second primary challenge in her North Carolina congressional seat, says she voted for Donald Trump in her stateâ€™s primary Tuesday. [Voters are excited about the primary, she claimed, adding, "I think they have a lot to say about the direction they want the country to go in. I think they want someone to go to Washington and shake things up," according to The News  Observer.   Ellmers is running for   against primary challenger state Rep. George Holding, in the Second Congressional District, whose boundaries were changed dramatically in February.
