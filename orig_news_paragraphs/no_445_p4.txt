Mr. Viola has a net worth of almost $1. 8 billion and is a   of Virtu. Virtu had planned to go public in 2014, but pulled the plug on the move because of choppy markets and lingering questions around how   trading firms like Virtu make money.

It is not known if this issue played a role in Mr. Violaâ€™s decision to withdraw his name for the Army secretary job, which is a post that requires Senate confirmation.
