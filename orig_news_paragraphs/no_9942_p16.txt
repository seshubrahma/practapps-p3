My precinct has twelve such positions. Maricopa County has 724 precincts, and in the 2014 primary election, only 54 of the precincts had contested elections. That is, in a given precinct, more Republicans were running than there were positions. Some precincts have as few as three precinct committeeman slots some have more than fifty.
