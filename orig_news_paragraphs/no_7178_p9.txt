Cruz is highly competitive in some of the upcoming southern states: he leads Trump in the most recent poll of Arkansas, for example, with Trump and Rubio four points back in Texas, he leads Trump by five as of late January.

His best shot here is to pound away at Trump for his   viewpoints and behaviors, as well as for his dismissal of conservatives. Fully 65 percent of voters in the South Carolina primary will be evangelicals, and Cruz dominates with such voters.
