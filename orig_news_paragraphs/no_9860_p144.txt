Eyewitnesses said people were trapped at the scene. The incident has brought back memories of the attack in Nice, France earlier this year, where Mohamed   killed 86 people by driving down a promenade on Bastille Day. The incident also resembles attacks from 2014 when a number of attempted motor vehicle attacks were launched on Christmas markets in France. +++ DEVELOPING
