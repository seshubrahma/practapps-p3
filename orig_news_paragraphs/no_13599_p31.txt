The report notes that Rubio’s chief negotiator for the bill was a corporate attorney who had previously represented the Carnival cruise line operator. According to Open Secrets, Carnival Corporation is one of the top 20 contributors to Rubio’s campaign committee since 2011. Rubio has also been a big supporter of expanding the controversial   foreign worker program favored by donors. Last year, scores of Rubio’s own constituents were laid off by Florida Disney and were forced to train their   foreign replacements brought in on   visas.
