Though landing on the lunar surface is not part of the current plan, cislunar space —  the 250, 000 miles between the Earth and the moon —  is essential. NASA calls it the "proving grounds," and intends to develop that part of deep space to test life support and propulsion systems for any Mars expedition. Moreover, the Space Launch System (the colossal "Mars rocket" able to lift heavy payloads into space) and the Orion spacecraft for carrying astronauts into deep space are essentially holdovers from the Constellation program, the Mars space exploration initiative begun by President Bush in 2004 and canceled in 2009 by President Obama.
