" Kelly is focused on the Senate race and talking to as many New Hampshire voters as she can, and we’ll see what happens," said Liz Johnson, a spokeswoman for Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. " We look forward to helping Republicans up and down the ticket to make sure career politicians from the past like Senator Feingold and Hillary Clinton aren’t elected," said Brian Reisinger, a spokesman for Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.
