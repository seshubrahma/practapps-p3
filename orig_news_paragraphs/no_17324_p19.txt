Trump has called climate change a "hoax" and suggested he could pull out of theinternational Paris agreement outlining individual emission limits for member countries. If nominated, Tillerson would also have to confront claims that his position atop the State Department would represent an unresolvable conflict of interest given his past business dealings.

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez laid out the terms of the brewing confirmation battle in a Facebook post on Saturday, calling reports of Tillersonâ€™s possible nomination "alarming and absurd."
