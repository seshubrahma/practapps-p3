In the three weeks since Tillerson’s confirmation as the top US diplomat, Americans learned of the secretary’s Tuesday phone call to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov from Moscow’s Foreign Ministry and of an earlier phone call to Saudi leaders from the Arab press. The State Department has refused to confirm many of the secretary’s calls and meetings. His public schedule has been much lighter on details than other recent secretaries. This retreat from public engagement coincides with the White House adopting an   approach to the press.
