We’re going to be spending the money in a very, very careful manner. Our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner, and more accountable. We must do a lot more with less, and we must stop the improper payments and the abuses, negotiate better prices and look for every last dollar of saving. We’ve already imposed hiring freezes on nonessential government workers, and part of our commitment is to continue to do that for the American taxpayer.
