Trumpâ€™s full speech, Inaugurations are generally intended to be   events that bring the country    and the capital    together, if only for a brief moment in time. A strong inaugural address includes memorable lines that outlive a presidency and a president, soaring rhetoric that even the most partisan politicians can admire. Think Franklin D. Roosevelt: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. " Think John F. Kennedy: "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."  High standards, to be sure.
