Officials met with the group several times and requested the new camp be dismantled and the protesters leave. The group was given time to start dismantling the camp, but showed no signs of leaving. Up to 74 people were arrested in southern Morton County, the Morton County Sheriffâ€™s Office said.   The recent arrests paled in comparison to the number of people arrested at the height of protests.
