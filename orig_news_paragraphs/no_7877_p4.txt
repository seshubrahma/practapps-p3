ANGEL MOMMILO, 2016Ceramic bathtub and pigâ€™s blood, In this installation, MILO pays tribute to the suffering of those who have lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens and Islamic terrorists. Many violent criminals have been deported multiple times only to return to the United States to commit more crime. Drenched in the blood of innocents, MILO urges the viewer to consider the suffering wrought by globalist,   immigration policies, lax policing and the obsessive pandering and mollycoddling of Islam by progressive social justice warriors.
