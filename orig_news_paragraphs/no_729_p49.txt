In New York, braiders are required to obtain a   license, which allows the stylists to perform the   techniques of styling black hair   —   for example, shampooing hair, applying extensions, making dreadlocks, braiding  —   and not much else. It costs about $70 and mandates schooling, which costs more. But many braiders operate without licenses.
