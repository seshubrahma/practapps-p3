So far, only four Democrats    Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado    have said they are planning to vote to advance Gorsuch’s nomination. Monday afternoon during the judiciary hearing, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware became the 41st senator to say he plans to filibuster, giving Democrats enough votes to sustain the debate. By Tuesday afternoon, 44 senators had said they would oppose cloture on Gorsuch’s nomination.    Republicans are preparing to launch the rule change, which is also known as the "nuclear option," a controversial move that Democrats took more than three years ago for all judicial nominees other than Supreme Court justices.
