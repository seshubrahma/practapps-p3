What the state CDOC data do not reveal is that local jails in Colorado also receive annual SCAAP reimbursement grants for partial reimbursement of the costs to county taxpayers. In 2015 that total was $1, 408, 900   —   more than the state prison system’s grant. In 2016 across the nation, the total number of criminal aliens in our jails and prisons is more than 300, 000.
