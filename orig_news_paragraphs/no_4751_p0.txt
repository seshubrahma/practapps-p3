[According to the New York Times,  the FBI director had dinner with Trump in January after the inauguration, citing private details of the meeting that portray Comey as a martyr.   Comey’s people, "who have heard his account of the dinner" and spoke anonymously, insist that Trump asked the director to pledge his personal loyalty to him, but he declined. They added that Comey was wary about dining with the president, but believed he couldn’t turn him down.
