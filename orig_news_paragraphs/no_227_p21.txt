Mr. Trump recited the 35 words mandated by the Constitution: He then delivered his inaugural address. After they officially review the armed services Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence will lead a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House. A tradition since Thomas Jefferson’s inauguration in 1801, the parade is one of the inauguration ’s highlights and typically draws large crowds and TV viewers around the country.
