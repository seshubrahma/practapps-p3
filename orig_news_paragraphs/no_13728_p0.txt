On a trip to New York City, London’s Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan has said terror attacks are "part and parcel" of urban life, just hours after an Islamic terrorist bombed the city. [Mr. Khan also seized the opportunity to launch an explicit attack on the Brexit vote and rise of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. He compared to two movements, claiming they are both driven by "scapegoating".   He said that he and Bill de Blasio, the Mayor of New York, "believe in building bridges rather than walls" and that there are leaders "who address people’s concerns" and others "who play on people’s fears".
