Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) January 26, 2017,   To emphasize how different this Republican President is from prior Republicans in the White House, Trump met with a group of union leaders only days after he took the oath of office. Many of the unions’ leaders are also progressive   in the Democratic Party’s political machine, and so it was not long before the IBEW’s   banner disappeared from the Philly construction site. Luntz noted that, too: The banner has now been taken down.
