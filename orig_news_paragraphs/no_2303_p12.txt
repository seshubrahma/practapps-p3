Politico was up not long after the Times article with a piece that said Trump squashed any speculation that he might soften on immigration, "delivering a hawkish, hardline, and     border platform and vowing that on Day One of his administration, the United States would launch a mammoth deportation program and begin construction of a wall. " The Washington Post, also posting around the same time, had updated its article to say that hours after leaving Mexico Trump returned to his aggressive tenor on immigration, yelling at the crowd in Arizona and promising to subject illegals to deportation. The Arizona Republic was up with a similar piece.
