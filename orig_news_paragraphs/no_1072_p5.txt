Since Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump has fired his national security adviser for lying, watched as courts twice blocked his travel bans on some   countries and fumed as the F. B. I. announced that it was investigating his associates for any ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. On his watch, the military conducted a botched raid in Yemen   —   which he approved over dinner days into his presidency   —   and the United States military is investigating reports that perhaps as many as 200 civilians have been killed in recent airstrikes in Mosul, Iraq.
