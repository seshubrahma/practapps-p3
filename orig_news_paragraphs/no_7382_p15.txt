However, we do know that Podesta was involved with a company called Joule Unlimited, which received funding from a Russian   company called Rusnano: Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta sat on the executive board of a small energy company called Joule Unlimited  …     Other Joule board members included senior Russian officials. According to the GAI report: "Two months after Podesta joined the board, Vladimir Putin’s Rusnano announced that it would invest up to one billion rubles into Joule Unlimited, which amounts to $35 million. That represents   of the entire amount of investment dollars Joule collected from 2007 to 2013. "
