The 2016 influx of illegal aliens from Central America exceeded 117, 000 by Oct. 1, hitting a new record, as Breitbart News reported earlier. One immigration officer told Breitbart News that the latest surge "is the worst we’ve ever seen," with illegal aliens released "into the wind never to be seen by us again. " "Immigration advocates want the president to either end the practice of detaining families altogether, as they’ve been requesting for years, or direct Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to release families with a notice to appear before a judge on their own recognizance," Bloomberg News reports. Of course, requesting illegal aliens to appear before an immigration judge is as good as giving them a free pass to enter the U. S.: Over 90 percent of illegal alien families and unaccompanied alien children (UACs) skip their removal hearings.
