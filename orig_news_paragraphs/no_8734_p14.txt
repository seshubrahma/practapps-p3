both the results in terms of a percentage, and also GOP turnout.   These numbers, while not consequential in terms of Trump’s taking the nomination, are basically a huge Republican opinion survey in a state with more Republicans than any other. It is also possible, though unlikely, that a few congressional districts might not go with Trump.   This happened to McCain in 2008, where he had sewn up the nomination but three House districts went with Romney, and thus a small group of Romney delegates went to that year’s convention in Minneapolis.
