In probably the most controversial portion of his testimony, Gates said that the shortage of trained scientists and engineers had grown so severe that it required a dramatic increase in the number of   immigrants permitted to enter the country. He charged that the current limit of 65, 000   visas per year "bears no relation to the U. S. economy’s demand for skilled professionals," and noted that all of the visas for fiscal year 2008 were snapped up on the first day they were available. As he has done before, Gates asked for a dramatic expansion of the   cap. Despite the Gates’s claims, there doesn’t appear to be any such labor shortage.
