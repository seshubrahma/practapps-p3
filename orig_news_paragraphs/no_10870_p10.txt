When we are able to end   and sexualization of Black people and end the poverty, control, and surveillance of Black people, every single person in this world has a better shot at getting and staying free. When Black people get free, everybody gets free. This is why we call on Black people and our allies to take up the call that Black lives matter. Weâ€™re not saying Black lives are more important than other lives, or that other lives are not criminalized and oppressed in various ways.
