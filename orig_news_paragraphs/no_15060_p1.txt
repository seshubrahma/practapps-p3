He has the biggest ratings, the biggest profile, and the longest track record of saying whatever he damn well wants and getting away with it. It is, still, a reasonable question whether any of that will change, even as O’Reilly faces the biggest challenge of his long career to his status as big dog: a burgeoning advertiser boycott of his show in reaction to the report in The New York Times that he and his employers have shelled out $13 million to five different women to settle allegations of sexual harassment or verbal abuse against him. After all, O’Reilly is still the most potent audience draw in cable news, with an average of almost 4 million viewers a night. That has    until now    resulted in the biggest pile of advertiser cash any cable news host has generated, well over $100 million every year.
