Choose the high road over low blows. But slogans only work if they are strategically deployed, so I recommend Melania meet with a couple of trusted leaders to advise her on how best to pursue this honorable agenda. At Enough Is Enough, we are making ourselves available to offer any help we can to advance her mission.    Bottom line, we need to check our differences at the door for the sake of the children and our nation, and constructively focus on what unites us.
