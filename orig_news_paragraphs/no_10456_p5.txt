In 1945, Democratic President Harry Truman used the atomic bomb against the Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ending WWII, killing over 150, 000 people. Truman stated that he did it to save lives and end the war. He argued that it wasnâ€™t an option to prolong the war resulting in more bloodshed. President Obama has done nothing in the Syrian conflict and little in the global war on Islamic State, which has resulted in over 400, 000 deaths in Syria alone and displacing millions under his Presidency.
