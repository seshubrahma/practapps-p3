The FBI did, however, obtain a warrant to monitor Page last summer on suspicions he knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow, The Washington Post reported. Page called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant "unjustified" in a statement to CNN. Page, who also claims the committee has not been responding to his repeated messages, said the Obama administration should already know about his contacts because of the surveillance conducted on him following his meeting with Podobnyy. In response to the committeeâ€™s questions, Page claims he had no financial or real estate holdings related to Russia from   other than selling off shares of Gazprom, a large Russian energy company, that he said resulted in a net loss of more than $5, 000.
