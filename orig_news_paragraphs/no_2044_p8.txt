Enter the Egyptian Wing from the Great Hall, on the first floor, and head straight back. Itâ€™s a hike, but sensationally scenic, taking you past wall reliefs, mummies and the fragmentary head of a New Kingdom queen cut from   jasper and glowing like a lantern, till you come to Gallery 115, devoted entirely to images of one person, the female pharaoh Hatshepsut. She ascended the throne around 1478 B. C. as regent for a   nephew, declared herself king and ruled, effectively solo, for more than 20 productive years. During that time, she kept the peace, revived Egyptian trade and commissioned major art and architectural projects, including countless sculptures of herself.
