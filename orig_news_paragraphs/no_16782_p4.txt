The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The ad is more proof that Democrats believe highlighting Trump’s attacks on New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whose arthrogryposis impairs the movements in his arms, is an effective character attack against the Republican nominee.   Trump mocked Kovaleski during a campaign event in South Carolina in 2015. Trump had cited Kovaleski’s story as proof that "thousands" of Muslims were celebrating in Jersey City, New Jersey, as the World Trade Center towers burned and fell during the   terror attack    but the reporter refuted Trump’s version of the account.
