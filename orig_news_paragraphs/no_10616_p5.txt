And Hillary Clinton made absolutely clear tonight she would not do so. It’s interesting that none of the issues Cruz mentions in the first part of his post were actually discussed in depth during the first debate, and most weren’t mentioned at all: ObamaCare Obama’s war on oil, gas, and coal Syrian refugees Obama’s executive amnesty Supreme Court justices protecting the Second Amendment religious liberty or federalism.   Trump touched on the     effects of statist policies, but there’s a lot more to be said about the absurdity of Clinton’s plan to encourage   job creation by taking more money away from the private sector.
