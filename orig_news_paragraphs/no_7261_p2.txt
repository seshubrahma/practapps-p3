The victim told police that the two men gave him the finger, he responded "same to you" and then the assault started. The two men were identified as    Wilson Echevarria and    Anthony Hobdy, both of Meriden. Police say Hobdy had 54 bags of heroin packaged for sale on him at the time of the arrest and was wanted on four separate warrants.
