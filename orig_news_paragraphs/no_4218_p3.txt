Following the attack on the two ICE agents, Breitbart News reported: Agent Zapataâ€™s partner Victor Avila spoke out about the attack that left Agent Zapata dead and him wounded. His twin sister Magdalena   spoke for him in the Univision special on Fast and Furious. Avila is so scared and hurt by the attack he did not speak out until he knew he was in a secure location. No one knows for sure why Agent Zapata and Agent Avila, assigned to the US Embassy, were asked to travel on road 57, a road controlled by the Zeta Cartel and extremely dangerous.
