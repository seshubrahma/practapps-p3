Do they slaughter moderate Muslims in their path because of this phrase? Islamic radicals did not massacre Christians in my home country of Lebanon because we labeled them radical Islamic terrorists. They did not want me dead as a young girl for offending them with my speech, they wanted me dead because I was an infidel. Furthermore, not only does the notion that our use of the term "Radical Islamic Terrorism" does more damage than good inaccurate, but to refrain from doing so is to surrender our most precious American commodity: freedom of expression.
