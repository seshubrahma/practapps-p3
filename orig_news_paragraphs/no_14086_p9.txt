Isolated   gusts of more than 75 mph were likely in parts of the Northeast, including Long Island, New York and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Ward said heavy showers were expected along the coast overnight Monday into Tuesday, with up to three inches of rain possible. Interior areas of the northeast into New England could see up to 10 inches of snow, Ward said. On Monday, the weather caused flight delays at airports from Washington to New York and flooding at the New Jersey Transit Hoboken train station, which also flooded during Superstorm Sandy.
