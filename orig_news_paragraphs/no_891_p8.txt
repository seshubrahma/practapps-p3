" Given the vital installations they guard and how many drugs and contraband they intercept along our maritime borders, cutting the Coast Guard to pay for a vacuous and expensive vanity project like a border wall would be dangerous and irrational," Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said in a statement on Wednesday. Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee on the Coast Guard and maritime transportation, was even more acerbic, calling the proposal "an insult" that would put the nation â€™s security at risk.
