One Bush donor pledged to donate a whopping $2 million to Hillary’s Latino outreach program to help her get elected in November. Texas Land Commissioner and Jeb’s son, George P. Bush, has also been cagy about whether or not he will support Donald Trump. Months ago he seemed to be saying Republicans should refuse to cast a ballot for Trump, but more recently he said it is important to stop Hillary, so Republicans should "swallow a bitter pill" and vote Trump. In addition, only days ago W’s daughter, Barbara, was caught attending a $   Hilary fundraiser in France, causing many to speculate that she is supporting Hillary for president this year.
