â€¦     Speaker Ryan proposes to eliminate the corporate income tax and replace it with a "    tax" (DBCFT) to make the U. S. an attractive location for international investor. The DBCFT is basically   tax (VAT) like every other advanced nation currently employs. But the big difference in the "Better Way" is that U. S. companies still be able to deduct the cost of labor costs, like the current corporate tax. U. S. companies are subject to a maximum 35 percent worldwide corporate income tax rate.
