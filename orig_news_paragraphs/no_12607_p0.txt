  Anthony Weiner has lost his job writing for The New York Daily News after it was revealed that he sexted with a woman while his young son was in bed with him. ["We won’t be running his columns in the future," said Daily News opinion editor Josh Greenman.   Weiner has written 23   for the liberal Daily News this year with headlines like "How Hil and Bernie can come to terms" and "Timely advice for our tardy mayor" de Blasio, who defeated Weiner in the 2013 mayoral race due to Weiner’s sexting. Weiner first went down in 2011, when he resigned from Congress after Andrew Breitbart forced mainstream journalists to acknowledge Weiner’s Twitter sexting habit.
