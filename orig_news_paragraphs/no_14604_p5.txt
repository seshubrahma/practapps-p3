The results brought a chaotic close to a race that stretched on for three months. In the waning days, former Vice President Joe Biden and several aides to former President Barack Obama    including Valerie Jarrett and David Simas    made calls to undecided members in an effort to sway them toward Perez. In Ellisonâ€™s camp, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and supportive members of Congress applied pressure on DNC members with phone calls.   The    calls underscored why the race was broadly seen as a proxy battle between the   progressive wing of the party, which supported Ellison, and those more closely connected with Hillary Clinton and Obama, who largely backed Perez.
