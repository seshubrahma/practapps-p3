"Robert C. Byrd: Child of the Appalachian Coalfields "  â€”   that will be published tomorrow by West Virginia University Press. The   book is the latest in a long series of attempts by the    Democratic patriarch to try to explain an event early in his life that threatens to define him nearly as much as his achievements in the Senate. In it, Byrd says he viewed the Klan as a useful platform from which to launch his political career.
