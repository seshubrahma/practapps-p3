But I sometimes think that the people we should despise most of all are the squishes who pretend to be on our side of the argument but forever betray our cause. Sometimes they do this by throwing the more outspoken among us to the wolves in order to signal how tolerant and virtuous they are sometimes they do this by endorsing some fatuous liberal position in order to show their willingness to compromise. I call the latter approach the "dogshit yogurt fallacy.
