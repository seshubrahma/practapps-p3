No one is wounded in the blast, and two other unexploded bombs are found nearby. Later in the evening, an explosion in New Yorkâ€™s Chelsea neighborhood injures 29 people. Law enforcement cordons off the area, and investigators find a pressure cooker four blocks away. On September 18, a backpack with five bombs inside is found in a wastebasket near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
