Multiple Twitter users have reported that the popular #GaysForTrump hashtag is being censored on the platform. [A GIF posted by Twitter user @PunishedSage has revealed that the Twitter hashtag does not appear in the site’s suggested searches. When you type "#GaysFor" or even "#GaysForTr" into the site’s search function, the hashtags does not appear as a recommendation, despite its popularity in the wake of the Orlando shootings.   Incredible.
