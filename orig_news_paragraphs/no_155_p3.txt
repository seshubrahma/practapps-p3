To prevent a recurrence, SpaceX adjusted its fueling procedures to avoid overcooling of the helium. Saturdayâ€™s countdown proceeded smoothly, with the liftoff occurring within a   window that would send the rocket on a trajectory to line up with the orbit of a group of current Iridium Communications satellites. The new satellites are more powerful than the original ones, which have been in orbit nearly two decades and have outlived their designed lifetimes. SpaceX also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, landing it on a floating platform named "Just Read the Instructions" in the Pacific.
