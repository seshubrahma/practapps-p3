Soros, through his Open Society Institute, provides support for the Aspen Institute, which runs various activities in support of its stated mission of "foster[ing] enlightened leadership and   dialogue. " Among these activities are its "Justice and Society Seminars," which often have federal judges as participants. The Aspen Institute has waived the steep seminar fee (currently up to $6, 950) for participating federal judges, and also has covered their expenses for travel, lodging, and meals.
