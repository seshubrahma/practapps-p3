A    Syrian refugee in Germany whose selfie with Angela Merkel ended up on fake news websites is suing Facebook. The fake news articles linked him to terrorism, and heâ€™s seeking to prevent Facebook from allowing users to repost the image. " Many people hate me, but all I did was take a selfie," he said.
