Economists, who estimate that the nation needs about 100, 000 new jobs every month to keep up with population growth, say it is natural for the jobs machine to slow as the pool of unemployed workers gradually dries up. Still, large numbers of   workers remain out of the labor market altogether, widening the gap between the haves and the   and depressing wage gains. " A lot of people are still on the bench that could come into the labor market," said Ken Esch, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC, an accounting and consulting network.
