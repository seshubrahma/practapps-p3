But there comes a time when you to look at the reality. In fact, in ’08, I was much closer, in both popular vote, and pledged delegates to Senator Obama than is the case right now. But, eventually, I just decided that I had to withdraw, and support Senator Obama because the goal was to make sure we had a Democrat in the White House. I’m going to be very aggressive in reaching out to Senator Sanders’ supporters.
