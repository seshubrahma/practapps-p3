But whatever the reasons, people simply fixate on, and in turn react to, terrorism to a degree unmatched by other violence. And a lot flows from that. Because of voters’ fears, terrorism can distort domestic politics    exactly as much of France, the rest of Europe, and the broader global community feared would occur after last month’s terrorist attack on the Champs Elysees, and indeed, as we fear might happen, goaded by President Trump, the next time an attack occurs here in the United States. And terrorism can distort foreign policy, too, dragging countries into conflicts abroad or providing an excuse for doing so.
