The organization broke from a history of never endorsing during a presidential primary, perhaps largely due to Trump’s stance that the actual Border Patrol agents who guard our nation ’s borders should sit at the head of the table for any discussion determining U.

The NBPC, though a union, poses a unique challenge to traditional conservative ideologues because it is the only legal mechanism for Border Patrol agents to advocate and defends themselves.
