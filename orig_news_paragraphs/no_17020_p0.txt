Washington (CNN) Just days ago, Paul Ryan was campaigning for the Republican ticket but barely mentioning Donald Trump’s name.    Now, he’s putting his differences behind them and embraced the   at a midday meeting on Capitol Hill to chart out plans to help him enact a sweeping conservative agenda. Trump, Ryan, Vice   Mike Pence and future First Lady Melania Trump ate lunch at the Capitol Hill Club and then headed to the speaker’s office for a meeting.
