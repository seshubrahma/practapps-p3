As the distribution shifts from our network to our retailers’ networks, so too will the work," Kellogg’s spokesman Kris Charles said, adding: We’ve been actively engaged in conversations with some of our biggest retail partners who have expressed strong interest in hiring these employees for   roles once the transition is complete. As a result, we are optimistic that our employees will find similar employment once this transition is complete. The new distribution model is already in use for many of Kellogg’s snack product lines, including Pringles,   crackers, its frozen foods products, and others. "
