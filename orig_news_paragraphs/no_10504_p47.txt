You are hateful, bigoted and —  for all your hypocritical pretences to the contrary —  fascistic. You are an intellectually spavined, moronic,   and disgusting losers who have been shown by the events of 2016 to be on the wrong side of history. There is nothing noble or worthy or decent about your ranting rage: it is the fury of a vampire stuck with a stake, realising as he shrieks his last that finally the good guys have ended his reign of terror. I leave you, as a treat, with the delicious words of Owen Jones in the Guardian —  as demented a case of psychological projection as it has ever been my amused privilege to witness.
