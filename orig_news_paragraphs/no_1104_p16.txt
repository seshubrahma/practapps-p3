Many American retailers, like Walmart, and even some manufacturers  —   including Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which make some car models in Mexico and Canada and import them into this country   —   have expressed their anxiety about how a border adjustment tax would affect their business. Given the squabbling within the Republican Party over the repeal of Obamacare, it’s hard to imagine that a congressman with constituents including big retailers  —   retail jobs outnumber manufacturing jobs in the United States by about four to one   —   would vote in favor of a border adjustment tax.
