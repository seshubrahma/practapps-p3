Of the 513 members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Brazilian Congress, 51 are women, placing the country 155th in the world in the percentage of women elected to the lower house of a national legislature, according to the   Union. It trails places like Saudi Arabia and Turkmenistan. The administration of Michel Temer, Ms. Rousseff’s successor  —   a former ally who emerged victorious in the power struggle to oust her   —   is doing little to assuage fears that women will be sidelined.
