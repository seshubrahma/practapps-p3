According to the statement accompanying the documents’ release, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said "the U. S. government will release additional declassified documents over the next 18 months as part of a comprehensive effort by over 14 government agencies and departments to search their records and declassify them for public access, consistent with the need to protect national security.
