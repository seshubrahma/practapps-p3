Given that the government offered no evidence as to the bases for other denials, it was not error―clear or otherwise―for the district court to conclude that DHS issued DACA denials under mechanical formulae.   The Friday statement from DHS said that DAPA’s elimination does not mean that DACA is accepted or on safe legal ground: The announcement made by the Department of Homeland Security on June 15, 2017 specifically referred to rescinding the memorandum signed on November 20, 2014 that created the program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents ("DAPA") which was never implemented.   The rescission only addressed DAPA based on the litigation posture and lack of a credible path forward in court.     DAPA and DACA are two different programs.
