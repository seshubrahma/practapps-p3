The US has traditionally taken no position on the territorial disputes in the South China Sea but has repeatedly asserted its right to freedom of navigation in the disputed waters, with the US military flying and sailing its assets close to the islands China controls.   Tillerson and Trump have not minced their words on the issue, suggesting that the State Department could take a more muscular approach.   "Building islands and then putting military assets on those islands is akin to Russiaâ€™s taking of Crimea. Its taking of territory that others lay claim to," Tillerson said in his confirmation hearing.
