Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, Rubio’s claim that what Crane said —  which in essence, as Cavuto detailed in his question to the senator, was that Rubio didn’t include changes to the Gang of Eight bill that law enforcement wanted —  is "not true" is also entirely inaccurate. Rubio did meet with Crane the night before the bill was introduced. And he didn’t change any of the things law enforcement said they were concerned about in that meeting with Rubio.
