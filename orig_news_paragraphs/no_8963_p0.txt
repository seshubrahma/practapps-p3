NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana  â€”    During a demonstration on the Tulane University campus, protesters largely from social justice organizations demanded white students be held accountable for perceived racism on campus. [With chants like "White silence is violence," social justice warriors marched across Tulane campus holding signs reading "White students: No one has to do everything, everyone has to do something," claiming their campus was full of racism, according to the Tulane Hullabaloo.   The student newspaper reported that the demonstration was "in response to a lack of action from Tulane" regarding racism on campus, but did not cite any specific incidents.
