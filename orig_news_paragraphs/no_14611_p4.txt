We were allowed to shoot many locations with our Virtual Reality camera, including Kim Il Sung Square, the Kimjongilia flower show, a secondary school for orphans, and a new eye hospital.   These VR pieces will be released in the coming weeks and will allow CNN viewers to experience what itâ€™s like to be in these places.   I also had total freedom to post photos and videos on social media, including Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. This was truly extraordinary    by North Korean standards.
