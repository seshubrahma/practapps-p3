S. citizen, his or her registration is treated as normal and placed on the voter rolls without any further verification, per the California Secretary of Stateâ€™s official website. Gonzalez also said that "state laws forbid police from discriminating based on a person showing an   license," but there is nothing to stop the U. S. Attorney General from subpoenaing the database to determine if votes were cast illegally in a federal election.
