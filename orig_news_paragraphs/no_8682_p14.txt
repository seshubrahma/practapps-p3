The   island, of course, was never going to become a staunch U. S. ally under dictator Raúl Castro, but Obama’s attempt to appease the dictatorship prompted Putin to mull the reopening of a Russian military base there and dig Russia’s economic talons deeper into Havana with a nuclear partnership. It is difficult to believe that when President Obama promised his appeasement of Castro would open Cuba up to the world, he meant a rekindling of close relations with Putin’s beloved former Soviet Union. There is little reason to believe Putin’s ambitions have an end point. Ironically, the Democrats’ concern of a new world order led by Russia is reasonable, given all they have done to empower Putin while in control of the White House.
