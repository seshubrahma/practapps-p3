 (CNN) President Donald Trump’s close circle of advisers met Thursday in Washington to discuss the hiring of a personal team of attorneys to represent him through the special counsel’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Michael Cohen, the President’s longtime personal lawyer, was summoned to the West Wing for meetings. Other advisers joined the discussion, with a goal of presenting the President with a plan for outside legal counsel as the Russia investigation enters a new and potentially perilous phase for the White House.
