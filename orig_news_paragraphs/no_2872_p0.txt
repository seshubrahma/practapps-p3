TEHRAN   —    President Hassan Rouhani of Iran is racing to sign as many oil deals with Western companies as he can before   at home and   Donald J. Trump have a chance to return the Mideast country to cultural and economic isolation. At the same time, Iran is in a battle with Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to reclaim its position as one of the world’s leading oil exporters, a spot it lost during the years of international sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear program.
