In a statement, State Department spokesman Mark Toner wrote that the United States was looking to Turkey "to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all its citizens    regardless of their vote on April 16. " European governments, meanwhile, acknowledged the result, but bristled at a suggestion by Erdogan that he would seek the restoration of the death penalty    a move that would sink Turkeyâ€™s   bid to join the European Union.   The results cement a yearslong effort by Erdogan to consolidate his position.
