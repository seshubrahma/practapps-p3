That is a    gap, according to a new online survey conducted March   2017, among 4, 151 U. S. adults who are members of Pew Research Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel," Pew reported. Pew noted that this gap is much different than opinions of the media at the start of the 2016 presidential election year, when both parties assessed the media’s job as holding politicians accountable   —   74 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans. Pew has been asking this question since 1985, noting "while Republicans have been more likely to support a watchdog role during Democratic presidencies and vice versa, the distance between the parties has never approached the   gap that exists today.
