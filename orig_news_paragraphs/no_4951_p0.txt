Former FBI Director James Comey revealed that former President Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch tried to influence his statements on Hillary Clinton’s email investigation during the election. ["At one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which concerned and confused me," Comey said.   Comey made his remarks during a Senate hearing, offering testimony about the ongoing investigation into Russia ’s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election and the decision by former President Donald Trump to fire him.
