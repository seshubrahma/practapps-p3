The State Department was unable to find any records showing that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton completed ethics training courses, as required by federal law. [Furthermore, no documentation was found for a bevy of top Clinton aides, including names familiar from the Clinton email scandal, such as Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan, Dennis Cheng, Anne Marie Slaughter, Phillippe Reines, Caitlin Klevorick, and Kris Bladerston.   The lack of ethics documentation was revealed by the Republican National Committee, which had to squeeze the admission out of the State Department with a lawsuit, after the department failed to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request. The RNC noted there is documentary evidence that Abedin was "notified by a State Department official in January 2013 that she had not completed her required annual ethics training," and after some confusion, she promised to go online to complete the training, but State could find no evidence she actually did so.
