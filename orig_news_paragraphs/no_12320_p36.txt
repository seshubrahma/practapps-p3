As an aside, I’ll note that in his first inaugural address, Lincoln offered an extended hymn to our sacred union.   It was a strictly conservative peroration, a celebration of   values it had nothing at all to do with market forces.   Have a listen:   The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
