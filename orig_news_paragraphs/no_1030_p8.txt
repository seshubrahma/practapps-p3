The American ban on electronics applies only to flights on foreign carriers. It does not affect   airlines, since they do not fly directly to the United States from 10 designated airports in eight countries  â€”   Amman, Jordan Cairo Istanbul Jidda and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia Kuwait City Casablanca, Morocco Doha, Qatar and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Officials did not say how long the ban would remain in place or if other airports would be added. In all, an estimated 50 flights each day into the United States would be affected.
