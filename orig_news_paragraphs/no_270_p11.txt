Mr. Trump said he would help with burdensome regulations, but offered no specifics. Mr. Trump could lift a moratorium instituted last year by Mr. Obama on new coal mining leases on public lands. As soon as next month, the   Congress may pass legislation undoing Mr. Obamaâ€™s regulations on the practice of   coal mining and on leaks of   methane emissions from oil and gas drilling rigs. In the meantime, the Keystone and Dakota pipelines provided Mr. Trump with visible ways to demonstrate action.
