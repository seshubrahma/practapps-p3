An economics professor at Yale University has reportedly made an upcoming midterm optional for students distraught over Donald Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election. [The message, which was sent to students before the election was called, was sent in response to outcries from students who claimed that they "feared for their families" as a result of Donald Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election.   Although it’s unclear which Yale professor is responsible for the email, it was published online by a staff member of The Yale Daily News, and circulated around the internet. BREAKING:
