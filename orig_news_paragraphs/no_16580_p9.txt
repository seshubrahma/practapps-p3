Let me be clear: It would be unfair and unrealistic to expect a president to singlehandedly heal America’s socioeconomic ills. But we should expect our president to have a plan to ensure everyone has a seat at America’s economic table. What minorities need is not more rhetoric and research, but policies that drive private investment to their communities to develop   enterprises and raise wages, in sectors such as energy, technology and manufacturing. Clinton gets that, and has proposed a thoughtful Economic Revitalization Initiative, which includes $50 billion to create jobs in struggling communities, $20 billion to support youth jobs, $5 billion for prison   programs, and $25 billion to support entrepreneurs and increase private investment in underserved communities.
