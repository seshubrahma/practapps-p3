Well, the God of Christianity, the God of the Old Testament and of the New, is a God of fire, consumed with love for his creatures. So much so that he enters them as he did Mary and Rupert of Deutz, a   Benedictine.   What does this have to do with Islam and its attitude toward women and gays? Islamic men cannot bear to think of submitting themselves in this way to God, they can only imagine themselves as dominating women, and they hate gays because gays submit in a way that they never can, which is why I think they find homosexuality so frightening.
