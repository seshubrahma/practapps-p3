The two women met privately on Friday morning in Washington to discuss the party’s path forward and how to beat Mr. Trump in November. Ms. Warren is a favorite of the progressive wing of the party and has become one of its most vocal and effective critics of Mr. Trump. She described Mr. Trump as a "racist bully" in a speech on Wednesday night and made a forceful case for Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. The meeting Friday could also fan speculation that Ms. Warren is on Mrs. Clinton’s shortlist of potential running mates.
