This comparison to Debs, Whitman and King, along with Clinton’s continued exchange of letters with Alinsky well into her law school years, suggests that Clinton had a deep respect for Alinsky. Indeed, Alinsky personally acknowledged Lucifer in his book, published in 1971. He wrote, "Lest we forget at least an    acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins    or which is which) the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom." Additionally, a Washington Post piece written in 2007 suggests Alinsky had great influence over Clinton’s political ideology, causing her to switch from a Republican to a Democrat.
