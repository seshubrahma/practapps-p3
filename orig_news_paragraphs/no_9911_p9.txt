She even cites a letter by women’s rights activists in Germany, writing: "In a letter to the German government, women’s rights activists described how some men in refugee camps "regard women as their inferior and treat unaccompanied women as "fair game"". Ms. Waters concludes with the stark warning: "Make no mistake, Westerners are about to be made to suffer, and the reason is that our leaders fully believe that we deserve to".
