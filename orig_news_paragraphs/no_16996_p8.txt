Feeding off the Clinton machine, the Democratic Party has become riddled with lobbyists, billionaires, and hustlers who pocket huge sums of money by running either nonprofit "think tanks" or   networks, and politicians who, indeed, are focused mostly on reelection. Surrounding the party are extremely     leaders, who end up defending the status quo. Chief component of the Clinton machine in recent years, the Clinton Foundation operated somewhat out of sight.   The big donations streaming from   powerhouses like   or big financial entities like Bank of America not only whitewashed the policies of interests directly opposed to what the Democratic Party should stand for, but they also clouded the deeper systemic crisis within the party.
