In a statement that echoed Mr. Trump’s fierce criticism of the Obama administration, Mrs. May chided Mr. Kerry for, among other things, describing the Israeli government as the "most   in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements. " Mrs. May does "not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically elected government of an ally," a spokesman for the prime minister said, using the department’s customary anonymity. Mr. Kerry’s speech was praised by other European nations, including France and Germany.
