Mitt, you didnâ€™t leave much wiggle room there did you? Why did you campaign harder againsts Donald Trump than you did Obama in 2012? I will give you my opinion, which I know you all cherish: Mitt Romney should be ambassador to Cuba, so he can hang out with all the people who hate Trump as much as he does.
