They’re hysterics, and they think President Tupac spent eight years turning the American Dream into nightmare on black street, and Hillary’s going to finish the job. The reason why Trump is so popular with a certain type of voter is because they’re kindred spirits, these white men sitting at the end of the bar, nursing a gin and tonic because their dick doesn’t work anymore, and life didn’t pan out the way they wanted. So they sit there crabbing about how the system’s rigged against them and America’s not winning anymore, and we’re getting pushed around by everybody, China and Mexico and women and blacks, who have so many advantages over white people. At the convention, Trump said I am your voice.
