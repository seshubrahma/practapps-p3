Since then, the United States has gone a record ten straight years ( ) without a year in which the growth in real GDP was at least 3. 0 percent. In October, the Bureau of Economic analysis reported, "Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2. 9 percent in the third quarter of 2016  …     In the second quarter, real GDP increased 1. 4 percent," and in the first quarter it increased less than one percent. All of Obama’s predecessors since John F. Kennedy, whose administration saw annual growth of real GDP peak "at 6. 1 percent in 1962," have seen far more robust economic growth.
