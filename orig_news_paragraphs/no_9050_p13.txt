Merino has yet to respond. AN EXECUTIVE DECISION   According to one member of Bucknellâ€™s student government who attended the meeting in which Ciccotta was removed, the decision was made without a vote of the student Executive Committee.   According to Ciccotta, he was initially told by Merino that there was no way to reverse the decision, despite the fact that the Student Government Constitution clearly outlines an appeals process.
