The office is normally a staid agency that rarely talks to reporters on the record, but Wednesday’s Twitter posts were oddly enthusiastic. The series of nine posts suggested that officials were celebrating what they thought was a decision by Mr. Trump to accept their legal advice. In their posts, officials at the ethics agency referred to a 1983 legal opinion in which the office urged presidents to "conduct themselves as if they were" bound by conflict of interest laws, even though such laws do not apply to occupants of the Oval Office. In a statement, Seth Jaffe, an agency spokesman, said that officials there were "excited" by Mr. Trump’s announcements on conflicts of interest and that the messages were not based on any information about the  ’s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed.
