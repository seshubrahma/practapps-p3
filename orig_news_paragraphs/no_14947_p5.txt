Clean Power Plan, This 2015 plan limits carbon pollution from power plants. It sets goals of reducing greenhouse emissions 32% from 2005 levels by 2030. It also requires states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption and offers states incentives for early deployment of renewable energy. The Clean Power Plan is not in effect pending a challenge in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
