Jobs created by greater access to   markets would likely be offset by jobs lost. Just behind inept negotiators on Trump’s list of those responsible for America’s trade problems are businesses that move operations abroad to capitalize on cheaper labor.

He also said he would demand that United Technologies reverse a decision to move two Indiana plants to Mexico, eliminating 2, 100 jobs.
