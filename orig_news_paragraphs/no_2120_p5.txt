Britain, which has generally taken a tough stance on Russia and its meddling abroad, has turned in on itself amid rancorous internal struggles over how to leave the European Union after a referendum in June. Even in Estonia, a Baltic nation deeply suspicious of Moscow, a party long reviled as a Russian tool recently took charge of a new government. Each country has its own particular and often very local reasons for its   turn. Mr. Putin did not engineer the shift   but he has been adept at making his own luck, deploying Orthodox priests,   news media outlets like RT, spies and computer hackers to ride and help create the wave of populist anger now battering the foundations of the   European order.
