The officials said that Mr. Mattis signed   memos to Mr. Trump asking for each authority, backed by about five pages of supporting material, within days of Mr. Trumpâ€™s becoming president in January. Several officials said Mr. Trump signed off on making parts of Yemen an   zone at the same dinner with Mr. Mattis five days after his inauguration where he approved the   raid on a Qaeda compound in Yemen. At the time, they said, the expectation was that the Somalia proposal would be swiftly signed, too, and that the larger 2013 rules could be jettisoned swiftly. On Jan. 28, Mr. Trump signed a presidential national security memorandum directing the military to give him a plan within 30 days to defeat the Islamic State.
