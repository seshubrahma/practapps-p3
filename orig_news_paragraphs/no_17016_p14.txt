The Republican Party that I voted for in the past, meanwhile, is now unrecognizable. Until it stops being the party of angry white men, there won’t be room for people like me. Holding on to outdated ideas about American values    and insisting on seeing American greatness through the prism of white men who resemble our Founding Fathers    will only lead to the disintegration of the fabric of our nation. Similarly, a vision of a   paradise backed primarily by minorities, also won’t work.
