Romney could be relief to US allies, For sure, a Romney appointment would come as a great relief to US allies who are deeply anxious about the direction of Trump’s foreign policy, and who see alternative names floated for secretary of state such as Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton with much greater apprehension. That’s because Romney is squarely within the parameters of accepted US foreign policy orthodoxy, is an internationalist, is   abroad and is committed to the notion of free trade, US alliances and a robust US posture in the world. Trump on the other hand has raised doubts about the bedrock pacts of the international system such as NATO and US alliances in Asia, is yet to define his "America First" creed and has spooked Eastern European allies with his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
