A new campaign ad features footage of Trump warning that anyone with a low opinion of its citizens is unfit to lead the nation    then uses a torrent of his inflammatory statements about Mexicans, women,   the disabled and Muslims, to condemn the GOP nominee out of his own mouth. With Clinton off the trail as she recovers from pneumonia, prolonging the "deplorable" meme also has the virtue of keeping campaign conversation away from controversies that the campaign has more trouble finessing    like her email server or its patchy disclosure about the state of her health. Both sides have solid reasons to want this controversy play out. The "deplorables" saga represents a passport for each campaign to reach the distinct coalition of voters they need most to win Novemberâ€™s election.
