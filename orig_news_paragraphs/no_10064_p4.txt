Trump vigorously attacked Hillary Clintonâ€™s plans to significantly increase the number of refugees admitted to the country, which the most recent   national poll shows is opposed by more than a two to one margin, 59 percent to 28 percent. " Hillary wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our country. And she wants virtually unlimited immigration and refugee admissions, from the most dangerous regions of the world, to come into our country and to come into Minnesota, and you know it better than anybody," Trump said.
