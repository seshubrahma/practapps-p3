That was a "very unusual" move, Miller said. But it may have been   necessary because in clarifying the scope of the investigation   into Russia’’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and   denying that it included a wiretap of Trump Tower ordered by   Obama, the FBI was "already in the business of explaining how the   investigation was being conducted," Miller said. ’ ’    "I believe it then became logical to just confirm what they were   looking at," Miller said.
