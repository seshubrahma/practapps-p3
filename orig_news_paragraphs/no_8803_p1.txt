The OPT outsourcing program is great for the foreign students because it gets them a U. S. job for three years, and puts them on a track to win extremely valuable Green Cards and citizenship. It is great for employers because many OPT employees work for low salaries in the hope of eventually getting Green Cards   â€”   and also because the OPT employees are exempt from Social Security and Medicare taxes, unlike American employees. The OPT system is also great for universities and colleges because it brings in more student customers from overseas, whose tuition fees greatly exceed the paperwork costs paid by universities to run the OPT program.
