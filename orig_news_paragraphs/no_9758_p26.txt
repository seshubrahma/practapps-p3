Donald Trump Jr. says his father didn’t hide behind a desk but spent time with workers and valued their opinions more than people from Harvard and Ivy League schools. He says his dad has promoted people based on work ethic and street smarts instead of paper credentials. He says some of the top executives in Trump’s organization are people who started out in   jobs but Trump saw potential in them.
