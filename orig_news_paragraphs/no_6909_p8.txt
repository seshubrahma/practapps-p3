The   ruling held that the law did not constitute a poll tax but ruled that the lower court must put an "interim remedy" in place to mitigate the "discriminatory effects" in time for the 2016 Election. The Fifth Circuit warned that the district judge should "ensure that any remedy acted ameliorates SB 14’s discriminatory effect while respecting the Legislature’s stated objective to safeguard the integrity of elections by requiring more secure forms of voter identification. " The appellate court remanded the case to the district court to later determine if the voter ID provisions were written to be intentionally discriminatory.
