It is wonderful to see how, in America as well as in Europe, the media pundits and the elites are taken by surprise. For years, they have stubbornly refused to recognize the harm done to ordinary people by mass immigration and Islamization. The elites are completely out of touch with the problems, the worries and the fears of ordinary people. They react with condescension to the election of Donald Trump, in exactly the same way that, in 1980, they reacted to the election of Ronald Reagan.
