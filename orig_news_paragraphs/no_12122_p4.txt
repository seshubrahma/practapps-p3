The real battle is for the limited number of candidates who can realistically continue their campaign beyond New Hampshire. Bush, Kasich and Christie has each staked much of their campaign on a strong showing in New Hampshire. Bush can likely continue his campaign, even if he finishes far behind the leader, because of his fundraising edge and perceived strong ties in South Carolina. If Kasich and Christie fail to finish in the top three, it is hard to imagine their campaigns will have the resources or momentum to continue.
