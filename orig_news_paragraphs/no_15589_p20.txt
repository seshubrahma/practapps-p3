Trump will deliver a major speech Sunday to the leaders of more than two dozen Muslim nations and is expected to urge countries to drive out extremists. An early draft of his speech does not contain the phrase "radical Islamic terror," a term which Trump has emphasized back home. The President edited the speech with his aides during the   journey from Washington, Spicer said.
