What Trump hasn’t mentioned on the campaign trail: He, too, has financial ties to some of the same countries. From licensing his name to a golf club in Dubai to leasing his suburban New York estate to former Libyan strongman Moammar Gaddafi, Trump has launched several new business ventures connected to Middle Eastern countries since 2000.   Those ties could complicate Trump’s effort to undercut Clinton’s support with the LGBT community and women by linking her to Middle Eastern countries that have contributed to the Clinton Foundation.   Trump insisted his business ties shouldn’t be compared to the Clinton Foundation’s acceptance of foreign donations.
