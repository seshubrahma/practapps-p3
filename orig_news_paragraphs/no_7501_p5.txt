Cruz also made a stop at North Dakota’s state GOP convention in Fargo on Saturday. North Dakota Republicans don’t head to polls or caucuses in the state, rather, as in Colorado, the RNC delegates are selected at party conventions. The state sends 25 delegates to the RNC convention. CBS News reported that the 25 are chosen by 11 state Republican Party leaders.
