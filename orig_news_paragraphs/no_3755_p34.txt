We have gotten a signal from the White House that the bill might be completely pulled and a more transparent and inclusive process could start as early as next week," one senior Republican Senate aide told Breitbart News on Friday. " House leadership misled the White House on how popular this bill would be with conservatives. " "That would be excellent news, and the best way to ensure we actually deliver on what we told the voters we would do," another senior congressional aide told Breitbart News when asked about the possibility Ryanâ€™s bill might be pulled altogether and a new renegotiated bill introduced afterwards.
