We don’t know what     if anything    was inside the canisters since North Korea hasn’t publicly shown off or tested any missile of that size before," analyst Ankit Panda wrote on The Diplomat. " We can infer given the size of the canister and the fact that it was paraded on Saturday that Pyongyang wants the world to know that it is actively working toward at least two types of   canisterized ICBMs," Panda wrote.
