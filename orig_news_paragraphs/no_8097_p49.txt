On MSNBC, renowned historian and preeminent Ronald Reagan biographer Craig Shirley tells Chuck Todd many who now say they will never vote for Trump are likely to come around in the fall. He also says we know from history that divided conventions lose in the fall but he adds that Trump can’t go too far like Nixon because he will look weak if voters perceive that Trump is kissing the establishment’s ring. Shirley also says that it may be better for Trump to pick a running mate who is an outsider like him instead of a more   candidate.
