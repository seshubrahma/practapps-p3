The White House said Thursday it wasn’t involved in the decision to investigate. " Decisions that are made by inspectors general across the administration are independent, and this administration has assiduously protected the independence of inspectors general," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said at a briefing. A message left with Clinton’s office was not immediately returned.
