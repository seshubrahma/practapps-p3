Pew writes, "Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support Sharia law as official law. " In the last five years, according to Department Homeland Security data, the U. S. issued 83, 000 green cards to Iraq, 83, 000 green cards to Pakistan, and 11, 000 to Afghanistan. If the current   pace of migration continues, within the next five years the U. S. will resettle a population of Muslim migrants that is larger than the population of Washington D. C. Donald Trump is the only presidential candidate to propose a temporary pause on Muslim migration.
