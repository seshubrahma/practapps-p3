Atlanta (CNN) Republican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in a   special election for a Georgia House seat on Tuesday, denying Democrats their first major victory of the Donald Trump era.   Handel bested Ossoff by 3. 8 percentage points in the most expensive House race in history.   It was a much closer margin than the   point wins typically posted by former Rep. Tom Price    whose departure to become Trumpâ€™s health and human services secretary created the vacancy.
