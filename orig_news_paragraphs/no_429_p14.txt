Many had received refugee visas to resettle in the United States with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration, but they were blocked by the travel ban this week. A    Iraqi father of two who worked seven years for a contractor that supplied American troops said he and his family had been granted visas for relocation to Charlotte, N. C. after passing extensive security checks. They were scheduled to fly from Iraq to the United States on Thursday, said the man, who asked to be identified as Ahmed A. He was told by the International Organization for Migration this week that his flight had been canceled because of the travel ban.
