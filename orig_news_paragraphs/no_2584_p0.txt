Donald J. Trump delivered a blistering attack on Wednesday against Hillary Clinton, calling her unreliable and more concerned with herself than with the American people as he sought to regain his footing after a tumultuous month that imperiled his candidacy. In a   speech seeking to build his case against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee by labeling her a "  liar," Mr. Trump moved to soothe concerns among Republicans alarmed by gaping   wounds after his racial attacks on a federal judge and his   boast after the terrorist shooting in Orlando, Fla. He said Mrs. Clinton would not create jobs, portraying her as a   former secretary of state who "may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. "
