The only reason Democrats have even an inkling it could be competitive is that Trump collapsed here, besting Hillary Clinton by just 1. 5 points last fall.   That all means there are many more people who typically vote Republican in the district than Democrats.   It’s created a rare scenario where the huge early vote turnout    140, 000 people have already cast their ballots, including 36, 000 who didn’t vote at all in the April primary    could actually benefit Republicans.   The question is whether these scores of what have historically been reliably GOP voters are separating this race from their distaste for Trump and sticking with Handel    or have been turned off more broadly by the Republican brand under Trump and are willing to back Ossoff.
