During Thursday nightâ€™s Republican primary debate, in order to attack and bloody both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Fox News used   video montages of both senators saying stuff. Video is the most powerful propaganda weapon ever conceived, and not only is the use of   in a presidential debate highly prejudicial and subjective, a debate setting is not the proper venue for any sort of gotcha question.   Save the cheap gotchas for interviews. Debates are about issues, the differences between the candidates, and the differences with one another that they wish to highlight.
