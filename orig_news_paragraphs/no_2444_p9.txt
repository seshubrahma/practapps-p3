At a hearing last week, Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, expressed interest in moving toward a settlement. Meanwhile, Mr. Trumpâ€™s lawyers were seeking to delay the trial in one of the California cases until after his inauguration on Jan. 20, while also requesting that he be allowed to testify on video. At a hearing on the case in San Diego on Friday, Mr. Petrocelli said Mr. Trump had settled the case "without an acknowledgment of fault or liability. "
