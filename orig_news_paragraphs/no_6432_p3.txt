PolitiFact has repeatedly attempted to rewrite the facts surrounding the Uranium    State Department story first reported by The New York Times (NYT) and based on research from the NYT bestseller Clinton Cash. In July and in September 2016, PolitiFact published stories that   ignored several key facts and conflicts of interest that ultimately proved damaging to Clinton as it related to her involvement in the Russian uranium deal. DiChristopher notes that "Clinton did not represent the State Department on the panel of agency officials who approve deals such as the Uranium One transaction," and rightly states: "The representative at the time, former Assistant Secretary Jose Fernandez, told the Times, ‘Mrs. Clinton never intervened with me on any C. F. I. U. S. matter,’ referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
