Among them is Aaron Klein, Jerusalem Bureau Chief for Breitbart News. Klein told CBN News by phone that Bannon recruited him about a year ago to start Breitbart Jerusalem for the specific purpose of "shining a light of accuracy on the Middle East and specifically on Israel and the   conflict because the news media has been distorting so many news stories and spinning them against the Jewish state.
