Tuesday on Newsmax TV’s "The Steve Malzberg Show," while discussing presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski being fired, former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields, who was involved in a grabbing incident with Lewandowski, abruptly cut off her interview with host Steve Malzberg. [Fields began to smile uncomfortably when Malzberg first challenged Fields’ assertion that the Florida prosecutor had agreed to not charge Lewandowski, but simply investigate the incident, in hopes of an apology from Lewandowski for Fields.   Malzberg then questioned Fields on her assertion during an appearance on CNN earlier in the day that Trump supporting his sister as a judge publicly while not ever appointing her to any position is nepotism. Fields then declared they would have to agree to disagree on the definition of nepotism.
