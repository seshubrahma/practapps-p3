But I know that if I vote for Donald Trump, or if I donâ€™t vote for anyone, that I will perhaps be contributing to the possibility of increasing oppression over the next decade. And let me tell you I know what oppression is all about. Early in my career as a political activist I was charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy, and faced the death penalty 3 times. And it was only because of the development of a mass movement all over the world, that my life was saved, and that I can be with you this afternoon, reflecting on the possibilities of building a movement that is building a movement to   our future.
