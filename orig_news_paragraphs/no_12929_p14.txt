four caucus states —  Iowa, Nevada, Maine, and Washington —  where Democrats don’t report final vote totals for turnout or official total votes per candidate, but only report percentages per candidate and delegate totals. In those states, Breitbart News calculated an estimate of Clinton’s vote totals based off the percentages the parties report and the reported or estimated voter turnout as contained in a previous Breitbart News data analysis. In addition, the state of Utah switched from holding a Democratic primary in 2008 to holding a caucus in 2016 —   so that likely affected the turnout for Clinton as much as it affected the state’s Democratic turnout overall.
