Mr. Flynn was forced to resign after misrepresenting his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Mr. Comey said Russia used a murky network of government officials, oligarchs, business leaders and others close to Mr. Putin to gather intelligence. But he repeatedly sidestepped specific questions about Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers, and acknowledged that American citizens sometimes did not realize they were talking to foreign agents. He said the existence of an investigation did not mean the F. B. I. would ever prove wrongdoing.
