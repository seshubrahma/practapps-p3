For example, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in the historic case of Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in our public schools was unconstitutional, it took   Dwight Eisenhower to implement that decision. Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus had refused to follow the Court’s decision and instead surrounded an   high school in his state with National Guard troops to prevent its integration. Eisenhower responded by federalizing the Arkansas National Guard to enforce the Supreme Court’s seminal decision and allow black students to attend the school.   Would Trump do the same if he had passionately disagreed with the Court’s decision or would he simply ignore it while attacking the legitimacy of our judiciary, sparking a constitutional crisis?
