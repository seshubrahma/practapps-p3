The US is working on a $1 trillion modernization of its submarines, bombers, ballistic and   missiles over the next 30 years. Current US nuclear forces consist of submarines that launch ballistic missiles,   intercontinental ballistic missiles,   bomber aircraft,   tactical aircraft, and the nuclear weapons that those delivery systems carry, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the   research arm of Congress. Those weapons are getting obsolete, according to CBO, and will have to be refurbished or replaced over the next two decades to keep operating. The CBO estimated the cost of operating, maintaining and modernizing US nuclear forces at an average of $40 billion a year over the next decade.
