Congress, caught up in an election year in which the number of refugees to be resettled, as well as their vetting and countries of origin, were key issues in the Presidential campaign, did not pass a budget for the full fiscal year prior to the beginning of FY 2017. Instead, Congress passed a temporary continuing resolution that extended the FY 2016 budget through the first ten weeks of FY 2017, then renewed an additional continuing resolution in December that runs out at the end of April. That budget funds refugee resettlement at the FY 2016 level of 84, 995 annually for a little more than a month more. Come April 28, there will be no budget authority for any discretionary budget activities —  including refugee resettlement —  unless Congress passes funding authority for the balance of FY 2017.
