From Francis Wilkinson writing at Bloomberg :  It’s just a twist of fate, of course, that "the Greatest" should die in the middle of Donald Trump’s misbegotten campaign to Make America Great Again. But humans get a kick out of coincidence, and History indulges us time and again. Muhammad Ali, once America’s most famous braggart, embodied much of what the Trump campaign has been organized to denigrate, delegitimize and contest.
