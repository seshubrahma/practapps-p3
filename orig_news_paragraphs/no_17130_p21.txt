Even if the two men put personal animosity aside, the starchy Romney would be an incongruous figure in a team that includes firebrands such as new White House adviser Stephen Bannon and the next national security adviser Michael Flynn. And even if Trump gave him broad latitude to dictate US foreign policy, Romney would be taking a risk that the 45th President’s intemperate public comments and volatile personality would undo painstaking diplomatic work. There is nothing more debilitating for a secretary of state than the view around the world that he or she does not speak for the President or is on a different page. Similarly, Romney might also face having his own words turned against him in talks with a foreign power since he said this year that the  ’s promises were "as worthless as a degree from Trump University."
