Delivering a speech the next day in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump again talked about banning people from the U. S.    but this time didnâ€™t specifically mention banning Muslims. " I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats," Trump said. He did not say whether he intended to ban individuals from those countries in addition to banning all foreign Muslims, or whether the policy was a replacement for his blanket Muslim ban.
