In the last year, the number increased by 6, 000 and authorities say the driving force behind the increase is mass migration, predominantly from Middle Eastern nations, Sydsvenskan reports.   5, 920 individuals settled in Malmö last year and according to the statistics around 3, 892 of these people were immigrants from either Iraq or Syria. In addition to the new arrivals, the city also experienced significant emigration. Around 1, 510 Danes moved away from Malmö in 2016 while only 1, 040 arrived in the city, shrinking the total number of Danes living in the city which is just across the border from Denmark.
