Donald J. Trump warned Monday that the push to build ties with Cuba after decades of animosity could be quickly wiped away, despite growing business and commercial ties between the countries. " If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the   people and the U. S. as a whole, I will terminate deal," he said on Twitter. Mr. Trump’s message threatened to end one of Mr. Obama’s signature foreign policy initiatives, an effort to overturn decades of enmity.
