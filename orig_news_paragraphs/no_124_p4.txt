Mr. Steeleâ€™s profile on LinkedIn gives no specifics about his career. He is known in British intelligence circles for his knowledge of the intricate web of   companies and associates that control Russia. Mr. Steele, as a known former MI6 agent, was thought not to have gone to Russia in his investigations but to have used contacts inside and outside the country to prepare the dossier, which United States intelligence agencies have said they cannot substantiate. But the file was used to prepare a   appendix to the intelligence presentation American officials gave to Mr. Trump last Friday.
