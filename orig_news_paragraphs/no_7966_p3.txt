—   Carrier (@Carrier) November 30, 2016,   The New York Times reported on Tuesday as well that Trump and Vice   Mike Pence, Indiana’s governor, will appear at the Carrier facilities in Indianapolis on Thursday to announce the deal. The Times’ Nelson Schwartz wrote: From the earliest days of his campaign, Donald J. Trump made keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States his signature economic issue, and the decision by Carrier, the big   company, to move 2, 000 of them from Indiana to Mexico was a   talking point for him on the stump. On Thursday, Mr. Trump and Mike Pence, Indiana’s governor and the   elect, plan to appear at Carrier’s Indianapolis plant to announce they’ve struck a deal with the company to keep roughly half of the jobs in the state, according to officials with the transition team as well as Carrier.
