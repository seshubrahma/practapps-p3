Bermudez said the regime has "repeatedly stated that if Libya or Iraq had nuclear weapons the US would not have attacked them."   North Korea will mark the "Day of the Sun" on April 15, to mark the 105th anniversary of the birth of the country’s founder Kim Il Sung. The date has typically been a key one for weapons tests and other displays of strength.   However, none of the five previous nuclear tests have been conducted around the anniversary, and while Bermudez said the evidence suggests there is "probably a sixth coming up," ultimately preparations did not mean much without a final say so from the country’s supreme leader.
