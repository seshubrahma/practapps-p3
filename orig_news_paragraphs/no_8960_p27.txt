In fact, as Townhall reported last year in an article entitled, "Jeff Flake Aides Democrat Efforts To Rubber Stamp Obama’s Amnesty": "Sen. Jeff Flake sided with Senate Democrats Wednesday, pleading with Senate Republicans to abandon their effort to check President Obama’s constitutional overreach, and instead rubber stamp his executive amnesty. " The article notes that in a Senate speech, Flake said that Republicans should not "poke the president in the eye" by using Congress’ power of the purse to stop Obama’s executive overreach. Flake eventually went on to vote for executive amnesty by opposing efforts to deny funding for President Obama’s unconstitutional amnesty in DHS appropriations, and supporting a proposal that would provide full and unrestricted funding for the unconstitutional amnesty.
