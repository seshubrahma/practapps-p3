The annual inflow of legal immigrants and contract workers adds roughly 2 million   workers to the labor supply each year, even though 4 million young Americans also begin looking for work each year. In contrast, illegal immigration adds only several hundred thousand workers to the estimated population of at least 11 million illegal aliens each year. The overall inflow of legal and illegal foreign workers transfers roughly $500 billion from employeeâ€™s pockets each year to employers and investors. The new memos do not include any proposal to use National Guard troops to enforce immigration law, as claimed by the Associated Press on Thursday.
