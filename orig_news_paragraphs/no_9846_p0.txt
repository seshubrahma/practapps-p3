Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( ) took to the Senate floor this week to attack Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon as a "a champion of white supremacists," recycling false accusations against him and demanding that   Donald J. Trump rescind Bannonâ€™s Sunday appointment as Chief Strategist and Special Counselor in the new administration. [(Bannon remains on a leave of absence from Breitbart after joining the Trump campaign as CEO in August.)   Reid has a long history of making false accusations from the floor of the Senate, using the parliamentary privilege he enjoys to slander political opponents. In 2012,   Leader Reid infamously attacked Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney from the floor of the Senate, claiming that he had paid no taxes for ten years, and citing an unnamed source.
