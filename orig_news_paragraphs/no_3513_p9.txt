@CubanetNoticias,  January 2016 : Cuban dissidents from a number of prominent groups on the island regularly suffer actos de repudio, "acts of rejection," in which the government sends angry mobs to their homes to intimidate and insult them. In a particularly brazen rejection of international human rights norms, one acto de repudio featured a bonfire made up of copies of the United Nationsâ€™ Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
