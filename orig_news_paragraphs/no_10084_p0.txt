An October 5 Humane Society ad warns that a Donald Trump presidency would be bad for animals because Trump’s sons hunt and his agricultural advisers allegedly support confining pigs to close quarters when raised for slaughter. [The ad opens with a photo of Trump’s sons holding a big cat while a narrator says, "Trump’s sons, they’re trophy hunters of elephants and rare species. Don Jr. is floated to be Interior Secretary. "   The camera then shows photos of Trump’s agricultural advisers intermingled with photos of pigs in metal stalls, a dirty puppy, and a horse.
