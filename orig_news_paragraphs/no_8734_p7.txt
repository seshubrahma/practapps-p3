The blue state blues of the California GOP may sink to a new level soon, thanks to the 2010 passage by voters of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s "top two" election system, replacing the old traditional primary process. Except for the office of President, in every other partisan race in California every candidate appears on the June ballot   —   and the top two   then advance to the November general election.   This is regardless of the political party of the candidates.
