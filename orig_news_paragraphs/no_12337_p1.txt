Chuck Corry has decided to put down a nail board and put other things on his Trump sign in order to protect it from being run over by cars and vandalized, KXRM reported. Corry had put up his Trump sign near the road but found that it kept getting run over by cars. " This, I think it’s the fifth sign that I’ve had to put up," Corry said to KXRM.
