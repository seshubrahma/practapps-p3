This was truly extraordinary    by North Korean standards. Perhaps the most enlightening interview of the trip was my conversation with North Korean economist, Professor Ri Gi Song.   We spoke about North Korea’s trade relationship with China, the underground marketplace that supplements what the state distribution system can’t provide, and even the highest paying jobs in North Korea     coal miners and other manual laborers.   Ri says physically demanding jobs tend to pay twice as much as office jobs, though he couldn’t disclose actual salaries.
