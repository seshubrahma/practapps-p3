A   at Jeff Sessions’ office ended with arrests. Six members of the NAACP, including its president, arrived at the Alabama senator’s office in Mobile and announced they weren’t leaving until Sessions was no longer Trump’s nominee for attorney general. But they were arrested instead and charged with trespassing. Sessions has been accused of making racist remarks in the past.
