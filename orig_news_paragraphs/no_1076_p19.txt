The 6 p. m. and 11 p. m. editions of the news show "Special Report," hosted by Bret Baier, along with "The Oâ€™Reilly Factor" and "Hannity," spent significant portions of their broadcasts discussing the bill and its fate. But with the bill in trouble, there were several conspicuous stretches when health care, seemingly the top news story of the day, disappeared from the Fox News airwaves. The vote on the bill, which had been scheduled for Thursday, was postponed around 3:30 p. m. Still, it took Tucker Carlson, whose show comes on at 9 p. m. 45 minutes to address it.
