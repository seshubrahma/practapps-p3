These are the   accomplishments Trump is touting, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump had thrown a "monkey wrench" into the sensitive budget talks when the White House demanded last week that border money be included in the government spending bill. Schumer said if Trump left congressional negotiators to cut a deal they could meet the Friday deadline.    "In my view if the President stepped out of it, we could get a budget done Friday," Schumer said. Schumer urged Republicans to push the debate on the wall to a future bill even though he doesnâ€™t think it will pass then.
