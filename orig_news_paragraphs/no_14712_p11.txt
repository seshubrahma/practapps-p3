North Korea has denied any involvement in his death.   The US State Department said it remained "prepared to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against this growing threat. " "The DPRK’s provocations only serve to increase the international community’s resolve to counter the DPRK’s prohibited weapons of mass destruction programs," acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. Speaking at his regular daily press briefing, Geng Shuang, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, said they opposed the North Korean launch, adding it was in violation of UN resolutions.
