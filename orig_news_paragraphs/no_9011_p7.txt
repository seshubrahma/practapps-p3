Stone was also, like Manafort, a veteran of that 1980 Reagan campaign. Stone worked for Reagan in 1976, as well, while Manafort worked against them that year to secure the nomination for then President Gerald Ford, who ascended to the presidency without being elected due to Spiro Agnew’s and then Richard Nixon’s resignations as a result of the Watergate scandal. A Nov. 5, 1979, article in the Washington Post, written by Martin Schram, detailed what Manafort did for the Reagan campaign, working secretly with George H. W. Bush to crush Howard Baker. The article doesn’t name Manafort, but Stone —  who along with Charlie Black, who would go on with Stone and Manafort to later found their own political consulting firm —  worked for the Reagan campaign, and confirmed Manafort was pulling the strings.
