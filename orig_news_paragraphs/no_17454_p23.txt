Is this the first time an American president has declined to use his veto at the Security Council? No, other presidents have either declined to use their veto power or voted in favor of Security Council resolutions related to the   conflict. But it is the first time President Barack Obama has declined to use his veto. Obama has exercised the veto power of the United States at the Security Council on every other resolution relating to the   conflict.
