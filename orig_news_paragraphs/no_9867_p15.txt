Earlier this month, Nehlen held a press conference in front of Ryan’s personal border wall in which he criticized Ryan for protecting his family with a border wall while denying the American people that same protection. Nehlen also criticized Ryan for repeatedly ignoring the pleas of the American mothers and fathers, who have been forced to bury their children as a result of open borders. When asked about Nehlen’s press conference, Ryan suggested that it was "petty" to stand outside his personal border wall and discuss protecting the interests of American families. Nehlen has also launched a series of   billboards, which vividly portray the implications Ryan’s policies have for American families and workers.
