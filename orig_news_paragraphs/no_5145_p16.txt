Not only that, Kaepernick has never thrown for more than 3, 369 yards in any season. To put in perspective just how awful that stat is, Carson Wentz and Dak Prescott, two rookie quarterbacks, both went well over the 3, 369 yard mark in their first seasons in the league. Cam Newton, who had one of the worst   seasons to an MVP award in NFL history, threw for over 3, 500 yards this year. Even Alex Smith, the aging and declining quarterback whom Kaepernick replaced in San Francisco, threw for more yards this year than Kaepernick ever has.
