In the Old Dominion, Clinton’s 45 percent is just 6 points ahead of Trump’s 39 percent —  with Johnson pulling 8 percent and Stein pulling 1 percent. That survey of 659 likely Virginia voters was also conducted from Sept. 13 to Sept. 21 with a margin of error of 3. 8 percent. Down in Georgia, a red state that Hillary Clinton had been hoping to peel off from Trump, the billionaire businessman has zoomed ahead to a sizable and perhaps unstoppable lead of 7 points. Trump is at 47 percent to Clinton’s 40 percent, with Johnson at 7 percent.
