So while candidates like Hillary Clinton might feel Fox News is stacked up against them, it’s only true in some precincts. I go out of my way to keep it about issues unless a politician strays into dubious areas like the email deal. That being said, I have sometimes defended Hillary Clinton from cheap shots and stayed away from any and all personal attacks. But it’s easy for politicians to dodge tough interviews by saying they’ll be treated unfairly, and that’s what often happens in these cases.
