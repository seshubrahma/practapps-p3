To evade sanctions, the North’s   trading companies opened offices in China, hired more capable Chinese middlemen and paid higher fees to employ more sophisticated brokers, according to the scholars Jim Walsh of M. I. T. and John Park of Harvard. The sanctions, Mr. Cha noted, "are supposed to inflict enough pain so the regime comes back to the negotiation table, and that’s clearly not working or it’s supposed to collapse the regime until it starves, and that’s not working either. " " Unless China is willing to cut off everything, which they don’t appear willing to do, the sanctions may be politically the right thing to do and a requisite response, but they are not the answer to the problem," he said.
