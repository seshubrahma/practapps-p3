According to local news station KHOU, the Texas Department of Transportation has launched an investigation into how the signs were hacked. In a statement released to the press, Tony Hartzel, of the Texas Department of Transportation, said "TxDOT takes this matter very seriously. These signs were secured and turned off until someone broke into them to enter these messages. Such actions endanger the safety of themselves and motorists, and the messages could also become a distraction to motorists driving on the highway. "
