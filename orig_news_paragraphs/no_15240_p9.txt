The judge did leave the government some wiggle room, saying that his order does not block the government from enforcing conditions on federal grants nor does it block the government from creating a definition of sanctuary jurisdictions    but the government will not be able to block federal funds from going to those cities as Trump ordered.    Orrick wrote that the jurisdictions successfully showed they "are currently suffering irreparable harm" because the order violates rights granted to states by the Constitution and because, even if the order hasnâ€™t been carried out, it has "caused budget uncertainty" simply by threatening to take away hundreds of millions in federal funds.   " The Counties have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to Section 9( a) of the Executive Order, that they will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction, and that the balance of harms and public interest weigh in their favor," Orrick wrote.
