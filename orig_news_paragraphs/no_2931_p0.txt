SEOUL, South Korea  —    For her nearly four years in office, President Park   of South Korea cooperated closely with the United States, particularly when it came to dealing with her volatile neighbor, North Korea. A vote on Friday to impeach her now throws both her country and American policy in the region into deep uncertainty, as the North’s nuclear program advances and the incoming administration of Donald J. Trump deliberates over whether to adjust Washington’s stance on how to best contain North Korean aggression. Ms. Park, a conservative, had adopted a tough approach toward the North, focusing on stronger sanctions.
