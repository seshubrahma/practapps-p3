Then in 2008, the Court in District of Columbia v. Heller struck down Washington, D. C.â€™s ban on handguns in the home, holding that the Second Amendment secures an individual right for American citizens who are   and peaceable to own personal firearms and keep them ready for use in their homes. In 2010, the Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that this individual right is also a fundamental right, and as such applies with full force through the Fourteenth Amendment as a right that Americans can assert against state and local governments. In doing so, the Court struck down a Chicago ordinance that banned handguns in the home in the same manner as the Washington, D. C. ban struck down in Heller. But both of those cases were   decisions from the Supreme Court.
