Cleveland (CNN) A Virginia Republican delegate fighting to vote against Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention next week won a critical court battle Monday, but still faces a series of obstacles. The decision is a win for   delegates, but it only removes one hurdle in their attempt to break free from voting for Trump.   The decision strikes down Virginia’s ability to fine any delegates that don’t vote with the primary’s results, but it says nothing about whether the Republican Convention delegates will adopt rules mandating delegates adhere to primary results    the biggest challenge in their path.
