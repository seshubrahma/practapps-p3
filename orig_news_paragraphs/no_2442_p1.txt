Donald J. Trump’s promises to revive the practice of sending terrorism suspects to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and interrogate them using banned techniques such as waterboarding. For three years, Mr. Comey has helped carry out President Obama’s counterterrorism vision, in which F. B. I. agents have interrogated suspected terrorists and turned them over to the Justice Department for prosecution in criminal courts. During his confirmation hearing in 2013, Mr. Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he believed waterboarding was torture. Mr. Trump’s nominee to serve as attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, has been a fierce critic of the Obama administration’s approach.
