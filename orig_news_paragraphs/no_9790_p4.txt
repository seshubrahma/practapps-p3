Never has there been a more   Administration, and today’s United Nations vote is the culmination of their systemic agenda to weaken Israel and strengthen its enemies.    …      I also emphatically second the call of my colleague Sen. Lindsey Graham that the consequences of this disgraceful UN resolution should be severe. I look forward to working with Sen. Graham, and with the incoming Administration of   Trump, to significantly reduce or even eliminate U. S. funding of the United Nations, and also to seriously reconsider financial support for the nations that supported this resolution.
