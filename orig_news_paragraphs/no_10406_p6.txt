As Secretary of Labor, I will fiercely defend American workers and implement my piece of the ten point plan the   laid out.    Trumpâ€™s plan to establish new immigration controls will boost wages and ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. Hire American and Buy American is our policy, and the one supported by voters in both parties. I will not provide guest worker visas to companies that break the rules, and will support reforms to raise wages for Americans
