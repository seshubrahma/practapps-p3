Furthermore, the legislation includes almost $600 billion in tax cuts over the next ten years by repealing many of Obamacare’s taxes. Finally, the AHCA is expected, after an initial increase in premiums in 2018 and 2019, to lower premiums in the individual market beginning in 2020, and to contribute to a more stable marketplace for health insurance. This is because of the legislation’s "Patient and State Stability Fund," which gives states assistance and flexibility to help cover those with higher health expenses and   conditions, in particular.     All in all, these facts should help counter the narrative that the bill is insufficiently conservative.
