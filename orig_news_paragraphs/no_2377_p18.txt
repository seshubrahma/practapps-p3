In a phone interview on Tuesday night, a highly agitated Mr. Trump denied every one of the womenâ€™s claims. " None of this ever took place," said Mr. Trump, who began shouting at the Times reporter who was questioning him. He said that The Times was making up the allegations to hurt him and that he would sue the news organization if it reported them.
