While it’s no surprise that   voters were more enthusiastic for Obama than for Democrats in other recent elections, even Al Gore in his failed 2000 bid garnered 90% of the black vote compared to Clinton’s 88%. Among younger voters, Clinton’s appeal was closer to John Kerry’s 54% than Obama’s 66% in 2008. And union voters, long a bastion of the Democratic base, broke for Clinton by a 51% to 44% margin, the worst for a Democrat since Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980. Her support among white voters    at 37%    was the lowest for any Democrat in the past seven elections.
