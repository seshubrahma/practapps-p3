The political genealogy of Jeff Sessions can be traced back to both the Redeemer South, where Reconstruction’s aftermath gave rise to the "strange fruit" of black bodies swinging on trees from organized racial terror and the Massive Resistance (in a term coined by Sen. Harry Byrd of Virginia) of   whites on citizens’ councils and elsewhere, who colluded with local, state, and at times federal officials to deny black folk good jobs, schools, neighborhoods, voting rights and citizenship. Jeff Sessions and his nomination represent one element in America’s neoconfederacy, which encompasses diverse strands of political and ideological thought united by overt and passive advocacy of institutional racism and the corresponding benefits of white privilege and power. Three decades ago, Sessions’ history of racial intolerance denied him a federal judgeship after witnesses testified that he privately expressed admiration for the Klan and characterized the NAACP as a   organization.   Today, Sessions exemplifies the fact that racial progress in America is not linear.
