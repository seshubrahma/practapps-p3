Donald Trump has been   on what specifically he would do, but he said as recently as last month that he would be open to a pathway to citizenship for some, saying, "We try and work something out" with a   system.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee told The Washington Post in 2010 that a pathway to citizenship was "the rational approach," and he also was supportive of the Gang of Eight’s immigration push. It’s not clear that Ben Carson ever explicitly supported a pathway, though he did imply in his 2013 book, "America the Beautiful," that it was immoral to deny citizenship to immigrants who provide cheap labor.
