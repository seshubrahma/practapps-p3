Both Russia and China have portrayed the tumultuous American election as a validation of their own authoritarian approaches. Vladimir V. Putin expressed hope for a "constructive dialogue" with Mr. Trump, whose lack of foreign policy experience and friendly positions toward Russia could play into the Kremlin’s hands. Asia greeted the election cautiously. China sent a short congratulatory note, but made no mention of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to confront it on trade and currency issues.
