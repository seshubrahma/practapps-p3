In this formulaic "cop who won’t play by the book" setup, the book doesn’t stand a chance. Kyle decides to work with Frank rather than turn him in, and "Training Day" loses its nerve in the process, turning Frank into a raffish renegade who just says what everybody’s thinking. (His name is "Frank," after all.) This "Training Day" is a   version of the movie, which paired Mr. Washington with Ethan Hawke as the   rookie.
