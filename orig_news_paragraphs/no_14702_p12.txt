When asked if the White House is seeking any possible Foreign Surveillance Cout documentation to back up the President’s claims, White House Counsel Donald McGahn "is reviewing what options if any are available to us," White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told CNN.   But White House officials could not say whether any such documentation exists. There is no evidence such a document on surveillance of Trump himself exists, according to sources with knowledge of the situation whom CNN spoke to Saturday. The intelligence court’s records are some of the most secretive intelligence documents.
