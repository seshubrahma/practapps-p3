BAGHDAD   —    The   military coalition in Iraq said Friday that it was investigating reports that scores of civilians  —   perhaps as many as 200, residents said  —   had been killed in recent American airstrikes in Mosul, the northern Iraqi city at the center of an offensive to drive out the Islamic State. If confirmed, the series of airstrikes would rank among the highest civilian death tolls in an American air mission since the United States went to war in Iraq in 2003.
