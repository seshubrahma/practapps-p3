On Wednesday, Meredith McIver, an   staff writer at the Trump Organization, issued a statement taking responsibility for drafting Mrs. Trumpâ€™s speech, which included the passage inadvertently copied from Michelle Obama. McIver wrote, "Yesterday, I offered my resignation to Mr. Trump and the Trump family, but they rejected it. Mr. Trump told me that people make innocent mistakes and that we learn and grow from these experiences. "
