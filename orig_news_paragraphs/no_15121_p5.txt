Secretary of Defense James Mattis once held one of the   military commands in the alliance and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the US commitment to the collective defense of fellow alliance members "inviolable" during his confirmation hearings. Lt. Gen. HR McMaster, Trump’s new national security adviser, is similarly thought to embrace the alliance.   And it’s fitting that Trump made his comments alongside Stoltenberg following an   meeting in the Oval Office. Stoltenberg has long professed NATO priorities similar to Trumps, in particular boosting defense spending among the member states and fighting terrorism.
