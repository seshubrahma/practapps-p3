In its brief, the Justice Department urged the appeals court to await the new order and then vacate last Thursday â€™s decision. It is not clear that the issuance of a new and narrower executive order will make the case before the Ninth Circuit moot or that the court will agree to vacate the decision even if it did. The Supreme Court has said the "voluntary cessation" of a government action does not usually make a case moot if the government remains free to resume the conduct after the case is dismissed.
