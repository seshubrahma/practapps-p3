According to F. A. A. records, the Boeing has flown about 333 hours between Mr. Trumpâ€™s announcement of his intention to run for president last June and March 16, 2016. During the same stretch, F. A. A. records show, the Cessna has flown roughly 216 hours. A review by The Times shows most of the hours logged were for campaign travel.
