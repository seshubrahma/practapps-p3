For the Democrats, the process is less mysterious: Primary voters select 127 delegates who are affiliated on the ballot with either former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The rest of the 210 Democratic convention delegates are picked by the party and most must support the winner of the stateâ€™s presidential primary vote. Republican Party officials and political operatives say they expect an onslaught of delegate persuasion to begin in earnest after the election. A    persuasion effort began last week, with Trump and Cruz loyalists telephoning delegate candidates to try to secure pledges of support.
