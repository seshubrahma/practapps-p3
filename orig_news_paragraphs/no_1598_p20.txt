Five days before its start, a campaign official emailed to say that Mr. Trump had a scheduling conflict. In early May, a representative from the National Association of Black Journalists invited Mr. Trump to speak at a convention it was hosting with the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. After several phone calls and a round of emails back and forth, the Trump campaign told the groups on the day before the convention began that he could not attend. Even among   black groups that may have members open to the candidacy of a business executive, Mr. Trump has shown little interest.
