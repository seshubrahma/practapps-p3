President Vladimir Putin said  the airstrike on a Syrian air base, in retaliation for this week’s lethal chemical attack, was "a significant blow" to the relationship. He suspended an agreement to coordinate air operations to avoid accidental conflict. U. S. officials faulted Russia for not enforcing a 2013 agreement to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is to meet Mr. Putin in Moscow on Tuesday.
