While President Obama and the Democrat Congress increased U. S. corporate tax rates to a developed nation high of 39. 1 percent, his Administration’s Treasury Departments did not oppose Silicon Valley tech corporations outsourcing their tax rate to Ireland, which has a corporate tax rate to 12. 5 percent and an effective tax rate with deductions of as low as 2. 5 percent. As a result, Apple, Facebook, Google, and most large Silicon Valley tech companies pay an average of 25 percent less in taxes on earnings than their   Standard   Poor’s 100 peers, such as Boeing or Johnson  Johnson.
