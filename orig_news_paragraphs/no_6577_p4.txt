Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, chided Jonathan Greenblatt of the   League for making a similar complaint to Kaine’s   —   though even Greenblatt did not use Kaine’s extreme language. Lauder said: "It does no honor to the millions of Jews murdered in the Holocaust to play politics with their memory. "
