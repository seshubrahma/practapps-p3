Mr. Trumpâ€™s aides held their first scheduled daily conference call with reporters while transition officials whose work had been stalled by   in Trump Tower began work with their Obama administration counterparts on a handover. But the prospect that Mr. Kushner might end up in the West Wing remained a concern to some people close to the   who said he would instantly become a target for media and legal attacks if he took the unorthodox step. Mr. Kushner has consulted with at least one lawyer and believes that by forgoing a salary and putting his investment fund, his real estate holdings and The New York Observer into a blind trust, he would not be bound by federal nepotism rules, according to one of the people briefed. Ethics lawyers in both parties said that such an arrangement would violate a federal statute designed to prevent family ties from influencing the functioning of the United States government.
