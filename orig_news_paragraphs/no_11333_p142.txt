Cruz weighs in on Trump’s abortion comments: "Once again Donald Trump has demonstrated that he hasn’t seriously thought through the issues, and he’ll say anything just to get attention. On the important issue of the sanctity of life, what’s far too often neglected is that being   is not simply about the unborn child it’s also about the mother   —   and creating a culture that respects her and embraces life. Of course we shouldn’t be talking about punishing women we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the world.
