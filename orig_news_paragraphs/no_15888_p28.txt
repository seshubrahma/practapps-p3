To his credit after the shooter was taken down he went into the right field where Steve Scalise was lying on the ground to help tend to him.    And the other law enforcement officer, capital police or Secret Service, I don’t know which it is, he was lying next to the security vehicle. And I’m looking at it now, and it appears that one of the tires had been shot out. That gives you an idea of what the shooter was doing as he was trying to take out our security detail before he could get to the rest of us.
