Republican leaders have for years failed to think about much of anything beyond winning the next election. Year after year, the party’s candidates promised help for   people who lost their homes, jobs and savings to recession, who lost limbs and   to war, and then did next to nothing. That Mr. Trump was able to enthrall voters by promising simply to "Make America Great Again"  —   but offering only xenophobic, isolationist or fantastical ideas   —   is testimony to how thoroughly they reject the politicians who betrayed them.
