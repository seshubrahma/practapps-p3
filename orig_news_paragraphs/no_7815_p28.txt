You talked earlier about the veterans event you held during the debate and that youâ€™re proud of it, and understandably so. You raised $6 million, including $1 million out of your own pocket. But, sir, "Forbes" magazine took a look at your record of supporting veterans groups over the years and what they found is that from 2009 to 2013, the Trump Foundation donated $57, 000 to groups helping veterans. But over the years, they say that you gave at least twice that, somewhere between $100, 000 and $250, 000 to, of all things, the Clinton Foundation.
