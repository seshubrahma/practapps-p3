So it will be interesting to see if Clinton is grilled on today’s report.   Sanders, who tried his Ben   Jerry’s ice cream flavor on The View and ate boiled peanuts and drank beer with Stephen Colbert, has been getting better at using popular culture to get his message out. One can only wonder if Sanders will make a Scandal reference to reach young voters, particularly those on "Black Twitter," who may be receptive to his message and may be watching the program as it returns (while monitoring their Twitter feeds) instead of the debate.
