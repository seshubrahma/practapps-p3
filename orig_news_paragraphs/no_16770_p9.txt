One of the great dividends of our   policing is that it shows us the vast majority of crimes are committed by a tiny number of people in a small number of places.   As Bill Bratton once said,    is like chemotherapy.   Too high a dose can be fatal, but the right amount can save a person’s life. We’re combining just enough    with precision policing to fight crime effectively and allow police and communities to envision a better future    together.
