Why? Because under the terms of most TV contracts, talent is forbidden to entertain any discussion of other employment, except for a narrowly defined window of time â€”   typically a month before the contract expires. From a business point of view, this "window" provision makes good sense otherwise, poaching would be a nonstop subject of discussion and gossip, thereby distracting both performers and viewers.
