Seeking election as mayor of Baltimore in 1999, Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, pledged "zero tolerance" for petty crime, or any crime —   and he meant it. During his   tenure in city hall, the arrest rate went up, and the crime rate went down. (Unfortunately for O’Malley, his    record came back to haunt him liberals excoriated the former mayor during his   presidential bid.)
