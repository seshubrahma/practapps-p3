The tally of ISIS terrorists killed by the MOAB bomb dropped Thursday by the U. S. military in Afghanistan is up to 94, Afghan officials say. [Initial reports had the death toll at 36 Islamic State (ISIS) operatives, but a new assessment by the government has scaled that number upward as more information of the aftermath of the bomb drop comes in.   " The number of Daesh [ISIS] fighters killed in the US bomb in Achin district jumped to 94, including four commanders," a Nangarhar Province spokesman told the media on Saturday.
