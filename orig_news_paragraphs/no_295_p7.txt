One was Mr. Obama’s directive to close the Guantánamo prison and the other was his directive to end C. I. A. prisons, grant Red Cross access to all detainees and limit interrogators to the Army Field Manual techniques. In their place, Mr. Trump’s draft order would resurrect a 2007 executive order issued by President Bush. It responded to a 2006 Supreme Court ruling about the Geneva Conventions that had put C. I. A. interrogators at risk of prosecution for war crimes, leading to a temporary halt of the agency’s "enhanced" interrogations program. Mr. Bush’s 2007 order enabled the agency to resume a form of the program by specifically listing what sorts of prisoner abuses counted as war crimes.
