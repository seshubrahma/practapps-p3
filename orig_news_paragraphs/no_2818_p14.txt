William H. Frey, a demographics expert with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank, conducted several simulations that tried to determine how much the turnout among white men without college educations would have to increase for Mr. Trump to win. He used the most recent ABC   Post poll of registered voters that had Mrs. Clinton beating Mr. Trump in a nationwide   race, 50 percent to 42 percent. It was among the better polls for Mr. Trump lately. Mr. Frey tested different turnout assumptions, including improbably optimistic ones, like if 99 percent of white,    men turned out to vote.
