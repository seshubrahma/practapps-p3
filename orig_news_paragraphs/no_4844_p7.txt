America also makes clear to its friends, allies, and partners that the treasured and historic Christian Communities of the Middle East must be defended and protected. The bloodletting of Christians must end, and all who aid their killers must be punished. America stands with President Al Sisi and all the Egyptian people today, and always, as we fight to defeat this common enemy. Civilization is at a precipice â€”  and whether we climb or fall will be decided by our ability to join together to protect all faiths, all religions, and all innocent life.
