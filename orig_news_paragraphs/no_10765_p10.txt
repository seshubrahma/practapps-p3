It has been extremely disappointing to see this and in the future they have lost the moral authority to challenge the establishment elitists when they use the same tactics. Sen. Cruz is extremely delusional in believing that if he is successful in knocking Donald Trump out at a contested Republican Convention, Trump supporters would get behind him. I hope to be elected a Trump delegate at the Georgia GOP State Convention and I will tell you, I would never, under any circumstances, support Sen. Cruz in a contested convention. Many Trump supporters view Sen. Cruz in a very negative light.
