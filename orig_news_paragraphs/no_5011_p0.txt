Wednesday for his show’s "Opening Monologue," Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity took aim at NBC News a day after Rachel Maddow, host of MSNBC’s "The Rachel Maddow Show," released President Donald Trump’s 2005 taxes.   Hannity categorized Maddow’s effort as being part of what he called "the   propaganda media" and offered other examples in addition to Maddow of attacks on Trump. Partial transcript as follows: NBC’s corporate jihad against President Donald Trump continues. Plus, a new report from Circa News shows the investigation into a server connected to Donald Trump was, in fact, a politically motivated hit job pushed by a   Hillary Clinton donor.
