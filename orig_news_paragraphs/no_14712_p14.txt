Foal Eagle drills, South Korea and United States’ annual military exercises, known as Foal Eagle and which both countries say are defensive in nature, began March 1 and are expected to last until April 30.    North Korea has already denounced this year’s exercises through state media service KCNA. " Now that the US imperialists and the South Korean puppet forces again kicked off the dangerous nuclear war drills against the DPRK at its doorstep, our army will counter them with the toughest counteractions," it said.
