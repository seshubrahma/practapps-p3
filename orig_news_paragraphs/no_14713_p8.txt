But other than an opinion piece on the conservative website Breitbart, it was not clear what reports it was referring to. On ABC News "This Week," White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders appeared to suggest that the BBC and The New York Times had reported on charges that Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower phones. On Sunday, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on NBC’s "Meet the Press" that no intelligence agencies he supervised wiretapped Trump, nor did the FBI obtain a court order through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor Trump’s phones. Still, Trump’s claims, delivered via Twitter early Saturday morning, appear to have given the Russia controversy new legs.
