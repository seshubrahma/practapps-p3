The leanings of GOP voters may be even harder to predict this year because of the diminished importance of the August Straw Poll, once viewed as the key test of each campaignâ€™s organization.   The longstanding event, which serves mainly as a fundraiser for the Republican Party of Iowa, might not happen this year, particularly if Walker    who has not yet declared his intentions    skips the nonbinding contest.   Two major presidential hopefuls, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, have already opted out of what has become widely viewed as an exorbitant expense for campaigns that has carried little   benefit for its recent winners.   And because Iowans pride themselves on giving all of the candidates a fresh look each cycle, even past winners of the Iowa Caucus such as Santorum and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee may not have much of an edge.
