The leaders of Syria’s local churches have generally looked to President Bashar   as their protector and their feeling that only Mr Assad guarantees their lives has deepened as the conflict has polarized, with fundamentalist Sunni fighters, murderously hostile to all other faiths, on one side and government forces backed by Shia militias and Russian air power on the other. In this state of affairs, only the latter coalition seems to offer Christian churches any chance of prolonging their precarious existence. Many would say Mr Assad is to blame for bringing about that polarization but to a bishop on Syria’s   survival probably matters more than political analysis. To defend Mr. Assad seems morally outrageous, but calls for his removal risk sounding like a   for fellow Christians.
