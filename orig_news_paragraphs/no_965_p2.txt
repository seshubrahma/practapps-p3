America’s entry into World War I, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the Balfour Declaration. The war and the revolution resulted in strict limits on immigration to the United States, reflecting a fear among Americans that unrest in Europe would spread to their country.

The Balfour Declaration, meanwhile, expressed Britain’s support for a Jewish home in Palestine.
