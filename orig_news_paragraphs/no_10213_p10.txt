—   that when the Ninth Circuit takes the rare step of rehearing a case en banc, it means the case is assigned to an   panel, displacing the original   panel. One year ago, those eleven judges reheard the case. With this week’s decision, those judges cast aside Judge O’Scannlain’s opinion for the initial panel, replacing it with a decision taking a very different view of the Constitution. The Ninth Circuit avoided clashing completely with the Seventh Circuit’s Moore decision.
