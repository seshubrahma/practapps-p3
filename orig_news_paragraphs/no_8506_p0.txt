Stephen Miller, the senior policy adviser for the Trump campaign, minced no words in stating that Border Patrol agents will have a "direct line" to the White House if Donald Trump becomes President of the United States. Miller stated, "I am here today to say that we are going to work closely, directly, and intimately with the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) to develop a border policy for this nation. " He continued, "The NBPC will never again have a back seat in our nation’s border policy. "   The comments were made today, March 23, on Sirius XM’s Breitbart News Daily.
