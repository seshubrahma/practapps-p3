Last week, both The Huffington Post and World Net Daily reported that officials at the State Department have stated that, in response to judicial decisions, the State Department will be increasing the number of refugees resettled in the United States to 900 per week. The move confounded critics of the refugee resettlement program who supported President Trump through the campaign and his issuance of the two Executive Orders that have been halted by the decisions by federal judges in Washington, Hawaii, and Maryland," Breitbart News reported this month: Despite the recent statements from the State Department, it is not entirely clear if ORR currently has enough funding to pay for the resettlement of refugees at a rate of 900 per week for the balance of the fiscal year, which ends on September 30. Congress has funded the federal budget for FY 2017 only partially until April 28, when the current continuing resolution expires. Breitbart News previously estimated that current funding from that continuing resolution would cover only about 48, 000 refugees for resettlement for the balance of the FY 2017, which is about 14, 000 below the estimated   that would be reached at the State Departmentâ€™s recently announced 900 per week for the rest of the fiscal year.
