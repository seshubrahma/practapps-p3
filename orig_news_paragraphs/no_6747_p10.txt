In 2014, TellMAMA lost its case with the Press Complaints Commission, when it objected to the original Telegraph reporting which revealed its dodgy figures. The Telegraph reported that many of their hate crime claims were exaggerations at best, and that out of the 212 "Islamophobic incidents" reported by Tell Mama, 57 per cent happened only online, with a further 16 per cent of incidents not being verified. Only eight per cent of incidents involved physical targeting, and no attacks were serious enough to require medical treatment. The group maintains a blog frequently criticising President Donald Trump,   campaigners such as the Center for Security Policyâ€™s Frank Gaffney, and Breitbart.
