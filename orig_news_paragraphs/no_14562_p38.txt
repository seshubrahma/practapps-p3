Before I dive, I’ll go through a whole preparation and that will include stretching of the body, stretching of the lungs, the diaphragm, intercostal muscles.   Packing is adding extra air to your already full lungs while using the mouth as a pump. I would estimate that I would pack at least an extra liter into my lungs.   And then I’ll come down to the beach.
