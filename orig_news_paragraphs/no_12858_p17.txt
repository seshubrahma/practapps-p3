I supported you here in Texas and voted for you for Senate. And while I believe Trump is the leader this country needs, I’ve been saying I’d continue to support you for the Senate, even after the shenanigans in Iowa, but after you comments tonight in response to what happened at the Trump rally in Chicago I can assure you that I will not only not support you again for Senate in Texas, but I will actively campaign against you. Our country simply cannot afford divisive selfish people like you in positions of power. Abigail Mccamick: At least Rubio had the integrity to admit and say that many of the protesters were paid to be there and cause chaos.
