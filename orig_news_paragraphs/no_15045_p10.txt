Wouldn’t it be wonderful if Congress, which is supposed to authorize military action, actually did its job and had a real debate about what to do in Syria? Paging three Republican senators with the most serious cred on national security    John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake    to bring some legislation to the floor on this important issue. Already McCain and Graham are calling for the United States to lead a coalition to ground Assad’s air force.
