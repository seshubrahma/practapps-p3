Washington (CNN) The Senate judiciary committee announced Wednesday that it has scheduled a hearing for May 3 with testimony from FBI Director James Comey. The hearing was announced for FBI oversight purposes, and is not necessarily related to congressional investigations into alleged Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election. In a March hearing before the House intelligence committee, Comey publicly confirmed that the FBI and the Department of Justice had an open investigation into potential collusion between Russia and President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign.
