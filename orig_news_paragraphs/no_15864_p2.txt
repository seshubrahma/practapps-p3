Three of the five lawyers have donations in FEC records. They gave overwhelmingly to Democrats, totaling more than $53, 000 since 1988. More than half of the donations came from just one of the lawyers, James Quarles, whom Mueller brought over from his old firm, WilmerHale. Quarles has given nearly $33, 000 to political campaigns over the years.
