My question is: Why would anyone pay to see a speech given by her?! It would be as perverse as paying Trump to give a lecture on university governance.

Her party needs a period in which to separate from her memory    to rebuild, find new candidates, reestablish its identity and delink itself from the entire Clinton philosophy.
