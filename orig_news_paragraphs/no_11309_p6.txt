After first denying any relationship with Flowers during a 1992 60 Minutes interview, Clinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with her in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit. On Sunday, both Broaddrick and Jones stated they would attend tomorrowâ€™s presidential debate if they were invited. Meanwhile, the issue of the number of alleged Clinton mistresses and victims has been in the media in recent months. Former Dallas lawyer Dolly Kyle, who says she had a   affair with Clinton, claimed in a recent interview with this reporter that "Billy" Clinton, as she called him, once boasted to her that he had had sex with about 2, 000 women.
