Brownsville, Texas (CNN) Before Donald Trump can build his promised wall between the US and Mexico, he will have to take private property from thousands of US citizens   a land grab that is expected to prompt years of legal battles, cost tens of millions in taxpayer dollars and delay construction. A CNN analysis of lawsuits filed the last time the government seized land to build a border fence in 2006 found that property owners who fought to keep their land always lost and that the government often offered them thousands of dollars less than the land was worth.   Many court battles dragged on for years, stalling construction at times, according to the review of more than 400 federal lawsuits.
