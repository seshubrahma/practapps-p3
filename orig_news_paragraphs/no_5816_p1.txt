Sources close to the Freedom Caucus confirmed on Monday that Meadows met with the Senate steering committee on health care over the past month to discuss the Senate’s overhaul package. " He believes there’s a grand compromise to be made if negotiating partners are willing to come to the table," the source said of Meadows. Freedom Caucus sources said that Sens. Mike Lee ( ) and Ted Cruz ( ) two conservative members of the upper chamber, have been "heavily involved" in meetings between the moderate and the conservative wings of the Senate.
