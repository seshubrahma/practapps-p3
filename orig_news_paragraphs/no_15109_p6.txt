Ughhhhh. Spicer is arguing a technicality    that Hitler didn’t specifically "drop" chemical weapons on Germans    in an attempt to put Syrian President Bashar  ’s action on the same level as what Hitler did. But, in   he’s eliding some facts and getting others totally wrong. This is a blatant violation of Godwin’s Law    the idea that by invoking Hitler comparisons in any way, shape or form you are immediately putting an end to any discussion.
