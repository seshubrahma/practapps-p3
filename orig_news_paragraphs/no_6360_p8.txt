Earlier this week, North Korea released a video showing a simulated attack on the Vinson as well as a U. S.   Lancer, accompanied by bellicose language. North Korea also recently announced it had tested a new rocket engine. U. S. defense officials told CNN the engine could be used for a   intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea had launched at least four ballistic missiles in tests earlier this month, which prompted the Trump administration to announce it had begun deploying the first elements of the THAAD missile defense system to South Korea, a move opposed by China.
