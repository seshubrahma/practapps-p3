At the American University in Sulaimani, female students wear a wide range of garb, from simple headscarves to   dresses paired with high heels. At the annual Suli Forum that was held at the American University this month, students didnâ€™t hesitate to pepper Lt. Gen. Shaghati, with pointed questions about the use of force against civilians, a level of free speech that is almost entirely absent in the rest of the region. A little exposure to a city like Sulaimani will help Trump understand that the Middle East is a much more complex place than he seems to believe. Perhaps Trump could even give a speech at the American University in Sulaimani, just as President Obama did at Cairo University early in his first term.
