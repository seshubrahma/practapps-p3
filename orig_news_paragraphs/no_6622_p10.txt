The president has been very clear on the type of justices that he would appoint: textualists who will not issue rulings based on the shadows of the Constitution. Judge Gorsuch’s record over the last 14 years, especially on religious liberty, gives Americans every reason to believe he will make a fine Supreme Court justice. His reputation as a judge with integrity and dedication to the Constitution should be an encouragement to all Americans. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, the nation’s largest   youth organization, said: We are thrilled with Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the US Supreme Court by President Trump, who is continuing to fulfill campaign promises at a breakneck speed.
