Trump said Friday that the recent killing of a young woman in San Francisco by a suspect who police say is an undocumented immigrant is further proof of his argument.   Asked about the slaying, Bush agreed that the border needs to be secure and that anyone who commits a crime "should be deported," chiding what he called "sanctuary cities that encourage this. "  Sticking to his message about maintaining an optimistic tune, Bush said Republicans will do best "when weâ€™re hopeful" rather than "angry all the time. "
