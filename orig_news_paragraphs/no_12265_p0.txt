Actress Lena Dunham will apparently remain in the United States following Donald Trump’s historic presidential election victory this week. [In April, the    Girls actress said that there was a "100 percent" chance that she would move to Canada if Trump were elected president: "I love Canada. I think that it’s a great place, and there’s an area in Vancouver that I find beautiful and appealing, and I can conduct business from there," she told Andy Cohen at the 2016 Matrix Awards, joining numerous other celebrities who have made similar pledges in recent months.   Dunham has apparently faced calls from social media users to keep her promise, as the actress responded in a fiery post to her Instagram account on Friday morning.
