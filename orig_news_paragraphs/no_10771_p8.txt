Colorado Republicans chose 30   and four unpledged delegates to vote at the July Republican National convention. Those delegates that have pledged to Cruz are required to vote for Cruz only on a first round vote, according to state party chairman Steve House. The four unpledged delegates are expected, but not bound, to vote for Cruz as well. One of the officially unpledged delegates was listed on a Cruz Colorado leadership team release.
