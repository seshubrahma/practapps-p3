As the new president said on Friday:   We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.   A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. We can note the happy absence of the usual litany of grievances against America and, also, the happy presence of a new Trumpian theme: curing disease.
