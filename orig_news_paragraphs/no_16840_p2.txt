Itâ€™s truly jaw dropping that Hannity would publicly call Kelly a Clinton supporter since that is akin to accusing a person of treason in the eyes of Fox News viewers.    Putting aside my personal enjoyment at watching Fox News anchors fight over and with Trump, Kelly is 100% correct.   Trump is trailing Clinton in the RCP average of polls by more than 3 points, the biggest gap in over a month. And polls released in the last few days show Trump not only trailing in most battleground states    including Ohio, where Trump had recently been leading    but shockingly a new poll published Thursday also shows him trailing Clinton by 2 points in the traditionally red state of Arizona.
