Two Kurdish fighters were killed in northern Iraq this month when a drone that they shot down blew up. The terror group had been known to use drones for surveillance, but that was believed to be the first time it successfully used one as a weapon to kill troops. American advisers fear the group will expand its use of drones in the fight for Mosul, and they say the Pentagon needs to do more to counter the threat. _
