MADISON, Alabama  —    At Donald Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison City Stadium, Sen. Marco Rubio’s own constituents —  two displaced Disney workers —  publicly denounced Rubio for prioritizing the interests of his big business donors over the interests of his own constituents. The two endorsed GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for President.   Dena Moore and Leo Perrero were two Disney workers who were informed that they were going to be laid off during the holiday season of 2014.
