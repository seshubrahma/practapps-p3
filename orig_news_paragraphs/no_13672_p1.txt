As the weeks progressed, I continued to write not only here but in other places like Newsmax and the Orange County Register, but mostly at my home here, given to me by Andrew Breitbart himself. Through the ensuing primaries I was steadfast for the Donald, as you can see from my articles or appearances on Neil Cavuto, Lou Dobbs, Chris Matthews or other shows on Fox Business. I expressed my point of view with a deep understanding of the message and power Mr. Trump held as the voice for those forgotten, ignored citizens who inherently knew our Nation was infected by elites and globalists. I had many conversations with folks in and out of politics and even known celebrities who asked me why I was such an intense supporter.
