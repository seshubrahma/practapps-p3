In most cases, local police forces or governments decided not to assist federal agents because they were concerned that cooperation would erode trust with immigrant communities they considered vital to police efforts to fight crime. Among those places are Denver, New Haven, New York and many counties in California. Mr. Trump pointed to several instances in which the failure of the local police to detain an immigrant who was a criminal had tragic results. He mentioned the case of Kathryn Steinle, who was shot to death on a pier in San Francisco by a Mexican man who had been deported several times but returned to the country and was released by the sheriff.
