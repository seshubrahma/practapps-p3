Comey had been unpopular on both ends of the political spectrum prior to Trumpâ€™s decision. Last July, he roiled Republicans after he announced that although Hillary Clinton was "careless" with her emails, there was no evidence of criminal intent and the FBI would not pursue charges. Democrats celebrated Comey then. But when Comey announced in October the FBI was reopening the investigation into Clinton, less than two weeks before the elections, Democrats were furious and later blamed him for her loss.
