Judge Amon will be presiding over the case and deciding on the legal issues underlying the executive order, while at the same time overseeing nine cases in which plaintiffs say they were improperly deported. The Thursday hearing before Judge Amon was largely procedural and was held to set out the schedule for arguments and motions in coming weeks. But in a separate action the day before, Judge Amon ordered the government to explain in writing by   why she should not allow Dr. Abushamma to return to the United States, where the doctor is engaged to be married to a fellow physician. Lawyers for the plaintiffs described Dr. Abushamma’s detention and deportation during Thursday’s hearing.
