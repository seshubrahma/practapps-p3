Set in the 1950s, "Fences" centers on Troy Maxson (Mr. Washington) a     baseball great and garbage collector, and his homemaker wife, Rose, played by Ms. Davis. Onscreen, Mr. Washington and Ms. Davis share a rich, affectionate familiarity, for good reason: They starred in the play’s 2010 revival, a Broadway smash that landed each of them a Tony Award. " Fences" is the sixth of Mr. Wilson’s   "Pittsburgh Cycle," which explores   lives in each decade of the 20th century.
