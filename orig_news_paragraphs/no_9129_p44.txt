Upon arrival in the United States, refugees are eligible to apply for all public assistance program including Medicaid, food stamps, public housing, SSI and cash welfare. Within a week to 10 days after arrival, VOLAGs are required to assist refugees in applying for a social security number, food stamps, cash and medical assistance which can be cash welfare and Medicaid, or the special Refugee Cash and Medical Assistance subsidies," an attorney familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News. " Even if a refugee receives the   special subsidies, if they become eligible for cash welfare   Medicaid after the 8 months, they may reapply for these publicly funded benefits," the attorney adds.
