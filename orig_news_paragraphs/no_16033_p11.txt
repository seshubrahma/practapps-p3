Throughout this campaign, Trump’s statements on trade, like everything else he says, have been erratic and irresponsible, full of bluster and the promise of a reckless trade strategy that would put American jobs at risk," Clinton’s statement said.   Trump has broken from Republican orthodoxy and embraced a protectionist trade stance that more closely mirrors liberals such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.   The real estate mogul has opposed the   Partnership, and on Tuesday said he’d seek to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement    a move that would result in the upheaval of economies across the continent.   Trump argued that by doing so, he’d create more manufacturing jobs in the United States    a key element of his appeal to white,   communities in swing states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
