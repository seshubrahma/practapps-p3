Warren Beatty and Ms. Dunaway had presented the best picture award. When Mr. Beatty opened the envelope, he took an extended pause before showing the card to Ms. Dunaway, who then announced "La La Land" as the winner. " I want to tell you what happened," Mr. Beatty said in the chaotic moments after "Moonlight" was announced as the winner.
