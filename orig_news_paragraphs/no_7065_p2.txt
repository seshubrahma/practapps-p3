The original executive order did not list the affected nations it merely referred to   legislation that named them as nations of particular concern. The revised version of the order does name the affected nations because it explains why each of them is on the list. The first version of the order did not mention Islam at all. The revised version does, but only to explain why the first order did not because this is not a "Muslim ban": Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion.
