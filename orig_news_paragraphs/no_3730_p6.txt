In this case in particular, every precaution was taken to execute these strikes with minimal risk to personnel at the airfield," Davis said. The strike was aimed at deterring another chemical weapons attack by the regime. The airbase was the same one the regime used to carry out the chemical weapons attack, Davis said. The U. S. military said it tracked the two aircraft that the regime used to conduct the attacks.
