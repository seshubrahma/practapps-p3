Another, a former "Apprentice" contestant, said Trump grabbed her breast and kissed her aggressively in 2007. Kristin Anderson and Summer Zervos told their accounts separately. Anderson, now a    photographer living in California, told CNNâ€™s Anderson Cooper that she was sitting with friends at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s when suddenly a man put his hand up her skirt. Moments afterward, she said she recognized the man to be Trump.
