For weeks, Trump and his aides have been claiming he enjoyed "one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history," which is close to the opposite of true. (He actually ranked 46th out of 58 elections). Trump falsely claimed that intelligence agencies had no idea who tampered with the November election, at a time when American intelligence already knew that Russia was the culprit.   The White House staff, too cowed to break their boss of the habit of making things up, is stuck cleaning up the Presidentâ€™s misstatements, plugging leaks, and picking pointless, unwinnable fights with media organizations.
