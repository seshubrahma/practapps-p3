Hundreds of people have protested Scottâ€™s shooting each of the past four nights in Charlotte.   Though Thursday and Friday were relatively peaceful, violence rocked the first two nights, with businesses vandalized and one protester shot dead in front of a hotel. Police arrested Rayquan Borum on Friday in connection with the fatal shooting of Justin Carr. No arrests, injuries or property damage were reported from protests Friday night into Saturday morning, police said.
