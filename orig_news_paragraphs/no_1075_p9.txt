In one video, Basma Basim, the head of Mosul’s provincial council, stood in front of destroyed buildings where the strikes occurred and said that dozens "of innocent women, men, old men and children’s bodies, are in these homes and shops behind me  —   we couldn’t save them. " She added, "All the men I met had a wife, sister or children buried under the rubble, at least 20 persons died for each. "
