This is   pretty much what happened in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s. That’s   what happened in the US in the second half of the 19th century   when you had booms and busts on railways and canals. That’s what   happened to Brazil in the 1960s, 70s, leading into the early   1980s. That’s what happened to Thailand and Malaysia in the 1980s   and 1990s leading to the   crisis.
