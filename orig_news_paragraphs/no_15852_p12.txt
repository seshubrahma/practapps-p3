Trump and his lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, have denied Comey is telling the truth about his    conversations with Trump. Collins said she believed Comey did tell the truth in his testimony, in which he recounted his conversation with Trump about Flynn, but she also allowed for the possibility "there was a misinterpretation. " Regardless, she said, Trump was "certainly wrong" to say what Comey said he had about the Flynn investigation.
