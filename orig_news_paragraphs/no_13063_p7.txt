When President Obama enacted his first executive amnesty in 2012, Crane and nine of his fellow immigration officers sued the President to try to stop the lawless amnesty. Jeff Sessions has described Crane as an "American hero" for his whistle blowing on the immigration corruption. Crane was also a vocal opponent of Rubio’s signature Gang of Eight bill. Crane’s primary criticism of Rubio’s immigration plan was that it gutted interior enforcement and would give amnesty to illegal aliens who were sex offenders, gang members and criminal convicts.
