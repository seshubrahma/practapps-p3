U. S. officials say it’s like trying to hit a bullet with another bullet.   The U. S. military attempted an exceptionally difficult missile interception, its first ever to shoot down a model of a long range intercontinental ballistic missile.    In a test taking place over the Pacific Ocean, a mock enemy ICBM fired from the Marshall Islands was targeted by an interceptor fired from an underground silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Santa Barbara.   U. S. officials say the interceptor hit its target, the stakes couldn’t be higher.
