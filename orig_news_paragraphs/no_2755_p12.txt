Mr. Vuong  —   who was born on a rice farm outside Saigon in 1988 and was the first in his immediate family to learn to read   —   writes with a musical appreciation for the sound and rhythm of words. He has a talent for capturing stories and memories (like those of his grandmother, who remembers the fall of Saigon) in unexpected and searing images, and uses the magic of language here to turn "bones to sonatas" and by pressing pen to paper, to touch his family "back from extinction.
