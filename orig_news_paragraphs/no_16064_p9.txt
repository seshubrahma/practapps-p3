Tuesday won’t be the first time Obama has given Hillary Clinton a lift on Air Force One. In 2013, the pair flew to Nelson Mandela’s funeral in South Africa together (along with former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura). Before that, Clinton flew with Obama occasionally as Secretary of State, including to Myanmar in 2012. While former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush largely stayed off the campaign trail in their final years in office, Obama is expected to stump heavily in support of the presumptive Democratic nominee, meaning Democrats will be on the hook for at least some of his travel in the coming months.
