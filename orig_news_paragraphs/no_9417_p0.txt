NEW YORK CITY, New York   —    The New York Times "illegally obtained" tax documents of GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump from 1995 just weeks after the newspaper’s executive editor pledged he would go to prison to get such documents, the Trump campaign says. ["The only news here is that the more than    alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that the New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests," the Trump campaign said in a statement about the publishing of the documents.
