Near the window of Mr. Trump’s   office is a framed American flag signed by members of SEAL Team Six, the elite Navy unit that brought down Osama bin Laden. On his desk he displays a bronze statue of Theodore Roosevelt, the Republican president and hunter, and a bobblehead doll depicting his father. If he does not have his father’s gift for theatrics, he does share the president ’s unwillingness to back down from comments and Twitter posts that roil liberals.
