Officials declined to confirm whether the two sets of information are the same. But Democrats cast doubts on the timing, and questioned White Houseâ€™s intentions in making the information available to a broader set of lawmakers. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, said he was invited to the White House to view the intelligence documents, but in a written reply said expressed "profound concern" with the way the materials were being made available to the committee. The developments came the same hour the New York Times reported that two White House officials played a role in providing Nunes the intelligence he received at the White House last week, a report Spicer would neither confirm nor deny Thursday.
