 (CNN) France is taunting the US on the Paris Agreement    again. This time, French officials remade a White House video by editing captions that explain why the Paris climate accord was a "bad deal" for the US. The video, posted on Twitter by the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, is France’s latest challenge of President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the United   deal, which seeks to limit global temperature rises by 2100 to 2 degrees Celsius above levels recorded before industrialization.
