The photo of Griffin holding up Trump’s severed head   —   taken during a photo shoot with L. A.  artist Tyler Shields   —   was first published Tuesday morning by TMZ and sparked a firestorm online, with backlash coming from both sides of the political aisle and thousands of people calling for a boycott of Griffin’s national comedy tour. The president responded Wednesday morning, saying the photograph had been particularly difficult for his children, including Barron.
