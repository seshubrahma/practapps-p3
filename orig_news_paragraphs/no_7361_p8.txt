Funny, the Sanders voters don’t seem to think they were donating their time and money to a vanity candidacy solely intended to move Hillary Clinton left on a couple of issues.   A lot of Sanders supporters claim to loathe Clinton. Are they going to fall into line and stop grumbling about her $300, 000 speeches to Big Money interests because she pays them a little lip service, and maybe gives Bernie a nice pat on the head when he finally surrenders? Probably, yeah.   RealClearPolitics summed up Sanders’ campaign on the cusp of Super Tuesday: Sanders said he wants to reclaim some of the momentum he experienced with his decisive victory in New Hampshire and inspire higher turnout for his White House bid, especially among younger voters who flock to his rallies but are less reliable when it comes to casting ballots for the Democratic socialist.
