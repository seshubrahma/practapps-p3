Scalia was a reliable   vote, which made the court one of the most conservative in modern times. With Scalia, it curtailed the protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other racial remedies for discrimination allowed more prayer in public places and restricted   lawsuits brought by aggrieved workers and consumers against big corporations. Yet, because of Kennedyâ€™s centrist tendencies, conservatives were unable to roll back significantly abortion rights, as established by the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, or   policies intended to enhance student diversity at universities, as allowed under the 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. Kennedy, who cast the deciding votes to affirm abortion rights and campus affirmative action in 2016, was also the crucial fifth vote to declare a constitutional right to   marriage in 2015.
