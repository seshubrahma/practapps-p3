The group surveyed the area, which was for the most part restored, with headstones turned upright. The Missouri governor had organized the volunteer event, posting it on his Facebook page the day before. About 100 volunteers participated in Wednesday’s event. Brandishing a bullhorn at the cemetery, Pence thanked the governor and the workers who are repairing the headstones.
