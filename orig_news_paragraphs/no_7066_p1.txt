Returning back from their Camp David weekend, Melania showed off her fashion muscles, as she clutched a $3, 400 Celine bag paired with $795 Manolo Blahnik Lauratopri stilettos. Melania paired down the luxury items with a white blouse, tucked into a pair of $188 J Brand jeans. Dark brown, reflectant aviator sunglasses topped off the First Ladyâ€™s look. Melania kept her   attire going into official White House business, donning a rich     crepe midi dress by Michael Kors to meet the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela.
