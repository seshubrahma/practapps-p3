Decisions from the lower courts should come late in 2016 or even in 2017, leaving any new arguments before the High Court unlikely to occur before fall 2017. One thing that is unlikely to come from this case is an ultimate Supreme Court victory for the religious challengers to Obamacare. If Donald Trump wins the White House, it would likely not even matter in this case if he makes good on his pledge to appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court. Even if Trump doesnâ€™t have the votes in Congress to repeal the Obamacare law, this abortion rule and the "accommodation" were created by administrative rules, and can be abolished by President Trump without congressional action.
