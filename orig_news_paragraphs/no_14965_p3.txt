The most egregious example of late was President Trump’s fantastical claim that the British signals intelligence agency, GCHQ ( London’s NSA equivalent) had agreed to a request from   Obama to monitor the electronic communications of the Trump campaign during last year’s presidential election.   A clearly angry GCHQ and the British government immediately denied and dismissed the ridiculous and obviously political claim.    There are yellow caution lights blinking on the consoles at the headquarters of our key foreign intelligence liaison partners, and most relate to the positions taken by the new Trump administration.
