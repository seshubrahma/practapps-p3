The chief usher is in charge of briefing the kitchen staff of any such requests in advance so the pantry on the ground floor of the White House can be appropriately stocked. Mr. Trump’s team declined to comment on what requests he has made for stocking the kitchen or redecorating the house for his first days there, and it is not clear how much time the incoming president  —   who is most comfortable in the familiar confines of his lavish penthouse apartment at Trump Tower, with its   accents   —   plans to spend there. His wife, Melania, who met Jan. 3 at the White House with the usher and curator, plans to live in New York for the first months of Mr. Trump’s presidency so the couple’s elementary   son, Barron, can finish the year at his private school in Manhattan.
