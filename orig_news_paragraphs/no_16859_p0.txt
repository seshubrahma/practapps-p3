Washington (CNN) Republican elected officials and party elders lined up Saturday to denounce Donald Trumpâ€™s incendiary remarks about women that he made in 2005. Some sitting members of Congress pulled their support entirely, while others blasted the remarks but continued supporting the GOP  . Some said they wanted Trump to step aside so that his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, can lead the ticket.
