The 2015 form showed that Mr. Trump donated a total of $616, 000 that year to his nonprofit foundation, his first contribution to it since 2008 and his largest donation in a decade. The payments were made through two Trump businesses: the Trump Corporation ($566, 000) and Trump Productions LLC ($50, 000). The next largest contribution that year was $150, 000 from a foundation connected to Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian steel magnate. Mr. Pinchuk has been a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, a relationship that drew scrutiny during the presidential campaign as an example of Hillary Clintonâ€™s complex ties to foreign business interests.
