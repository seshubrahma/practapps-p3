• Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, ended a   visit with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines in which he promised the country about $8. 7 billion worth of business deals, investments and equipment. Mr. Abe is on   diplomatic push that will continue with stops in Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Separately, Mr. Duterte ordered government agencies to provide free contraception to women, especially the poor, in a move that is likely to face strong resistance from Catholic leadership in the country.
