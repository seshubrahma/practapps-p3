Earlier this month, Trump accused Obama of wiretapping him in Trump Tower prior to the November election. Neither Trump nor his administration has produced any evidence to support the claim. On Monday, in a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director James Comey said that he had "no information" to support Trump’s wiretapping claim. Flake said earlier in the radio interview that Comey’s testimony further confirmed his belief that Trump’s allegation was false.
