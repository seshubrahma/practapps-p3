And while Ryan is attempting to browbeat 20 or so of the House Freedom Caucus members into submission on this legislation using his affiliated outside groups to run ads against them in their districts —  while not spending anything on targeting Democrats —  House GOP sources in   Caucus offices tell Breitbart News that there are as many as perhaps 70 House Republicans against this bill at this time, and that number is not getting any smaller as time goes by. So if Ryan is able to muscle it through the House in the next few weeks —  sources close to the process expect a battle to come on the rule vote, which may happen next week or the week after —   it will be on life support headed to a Senate that does not support it since conservatives are not warming up to it by any stretch. Now, on top of all of this, this new audio file raises questions as to how loyal Ryan is to Trump politically —  and is asking the new president to use precious political capital to push through legislation that seems arithmetically destined for congressional failure.
