But Johnson’s support outpaces that of a typical third party candidate and may prove to have more staying power.   One hint that it could fade: Support for both Johnson and Stein appears concentrated among those less enthusiastic about voting this year, suggesting their supporters may be less apt to turn out in the end. Nearly    voters who say they are "not at all enthusiastic" about voting this year say they back either Johnson or Stein, but among those who are extremely enthusiastic, that figure falls to just 6%. And the growing support for third party candidates also seems centered among younger voters, which could prove harmful to Clinton’s campaign.
