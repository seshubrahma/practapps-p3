The USC  . A. Times Presidential Election "Daybreak" Poll asks more than 400 people each day about their voting intentions. The poll is part of the Understanding America Study (UAS) at the University of Southern California’s Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research. Each day’s poll respondents are a subset of the UAS election panel, roughly 3000 U. S. citizens who were randomly recruited from among all households in the United States.
