Trump has gone through a series of campaign   in the past week, bringing on Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon —  who is taking a leave of absence from this news organization until election day —  as his campaign’s CEO. He also hired pollster KellyAnne Conway as his new campaign manager, and his campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned last week. Trump seems to have rediscovered the groove that earned him the nickname "Teflon Don" from early in the primaries, as his trip to   Louisiana on Friday with vice presidential running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has sent both Clinton and President Barack Obama for a loop. Trump forced the sitting president of the United States, Obama, to —  after leaving Louisiana underwater for days while vacationing and golfing on Martha’s Vineyard off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts —  finally visit Louisiana this week.
