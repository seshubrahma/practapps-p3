 (CNN) Republicans are acting as if they are in a state of shock about their nominee.   From the moment that the tape of Donald Trump and Billy Bush discussing women in vulgar terms surfaced on Friday, Republicans have been coming out of the woodwork to denounce his words, trying to separate themselves from his campaign. The Republican National Committee sent out an email to vendors saying they should put a "hold on all projects" in a mailing program devoted to electing Trump.
