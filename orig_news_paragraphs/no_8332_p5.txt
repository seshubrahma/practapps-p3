The AP reported on French’s efforts: Roughly 200 Romney backers camped out at the Marriott hotel in Memphis, and some had all their expenses paid for. One of the financiers was John Kingston, general counsel of AMG Inc. of the Beverly, Mass.  investment management firm. AMG is run by Sean Healey, the husband of Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey, Romney’s most prominent ally.
