The press event is being organized by both the Remembrance Project —  a   that represents the victims of illegal alien crime and advocates for border security —   and Wisconsin businessman, Paul Nehlen, who is running to unseat Ryan in Wisconsin ’s August 9th primary. Nehlen, who has been endorsed by several of the victims, has made Ryan’s support for open borders immigration policies a central focus of his campaign. Nehlen has said that while Ryan protects his family and his home with a border wall, Ryan has denied the American people those same protections.
