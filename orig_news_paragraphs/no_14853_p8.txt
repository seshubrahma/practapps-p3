The album, released Friday, includes songs like "Dead Presidents," featuring Jeezy, Yo Gotti and Future, "Powers that Be," featuring New York rapper Nas and "Maybach Music V," featuring DeJ Loaf, which Ross described as "a really airy type of feeling record."   The   star got political at the Woodie Awards, which recognizes the music voted best by college students, telling the audience during the live broadcast on MTV that in this divided time, it’s good to get together and be united by music. " The Woodies always been cool to me because it was a spot you can see artists while they’re still underground, before they’ve achieved mainstream success," he told CNN.
