Mr. Trump’s advisers fanned out on television Wednesday to make the most of Mr. Pence’s moment Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, called the debate proof of Mr. Trump’s "great judgment and leadership. " It is doubtful that Mr. Pence’s performance in his debate with Senator Tim Kaine, Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, will do much to move voters toward Mr. Trump. Mr. Kaine mounted an insistent and prodding attack on Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence at the   debate, frequently interrupting Mr. Pence to demand that he defend Mr. Trump’s divisive statements.
