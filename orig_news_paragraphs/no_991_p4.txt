The Supreme Court needs to be an institution that helps to undergird limited constitutional government," said Mr. Leo, 51, whose cerebral, unassuming demeanor belies the enormous clout he has developed in Washington. It is a worldview that has brought Mr. Leo and his allies together with a range of conservative players. In addition to major corporate backers such as Google and Chevron, the Federalist Society’s supporters include     and   business leaders like Charles G. and David H. Koch the family foundation of Richard Mellon Scaife and the  Mercer family, which gave significantly to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and helped start Breitbart News. This judicial reformation is being coordinated from Washington by a relatively small team closely aligned around Mr. Leo, who is on leave from the Federalist Society while he helps the White House shepherd the Gorsuch nomination.
