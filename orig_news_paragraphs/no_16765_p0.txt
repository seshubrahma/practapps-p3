 (CNN) President Barack Obama came face to face with the human cost borne by the military’s   generation on Wednesday during a CNN presidential town hall moderated by Jake Tapper. Appearing before a military audience in Fort Lee, Virginia, Obama also confronted the limits of his own power as he fielded probing questions about terrorist groups and health care delays for veterans. It all played out against the backdrop of the first congressional override of a veto during Obama’s nearly eight years in office.
