Thanks Joe. This case has sparked a lot of controversy about refugees in the Magic Valley, which means anger from both sides of the spectrum. Against a video backdrop of Julie Ruf, a spokesperson for We the People Magic Valley speaking at the press conference, KMVT ran this audio from Nancy Taylor, a   activist who may not have even attended the event: I believe there is a very small group in Twin Falls, very small, and vocal, who, for lack of a better word are racist. The video then shifts to Taylor seated, apparently in a studio or residence as she delivers her pronouncement.
