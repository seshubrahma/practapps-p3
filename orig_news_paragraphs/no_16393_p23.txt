Expo Center in Warren, a venue just miles from where Clinton spokes on Thursday. As Clinton rolled into Warren before her speech,   protesters, some holding signs that read "Hillary for Prison," marched up and down the street in front of the machining and manufacturing plant in swing Macomb County. Clinton’s speech came at the same time that her campaign is mounting a concerted effort to win over Republicans disaffected by Trump’s candidacy. On Wednesday, the Clinton campaign launched "Together for America," a group of Republican politicians, strategists and academics who have come out for Clinton.
