In their federal lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Washington, they provide little evidence that they are on the United States kill list, which is classified, and current and former American counterterrorism officials expressed skepticism that their activities would get them marked for death by a program meant to eliminate terrorists actively plotting violence against America. Mr. Abdul Kareem, a former standup comedian who grew up in Mount Vernon, N. Y. has been reporting from   areas in northern Syria, where he has filmed uncritical interviews with Qaeda members. Mr. Zaidan is a former bureau chief for Al Jazeera in Pakistan and one of the few journalists to interview Osama bin Laden before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The men’s lawyers and Reprieve, a human rights group in Britain that filed the lawsuit, hope that it will force the government to not only to clarify the men’s status, but to divulge information about a highly secretive program that has killed many militants, including Anwar   an American cleric who died in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.
