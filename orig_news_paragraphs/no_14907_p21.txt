Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, said he still wants to work to repeal Obamacare. " I promised the people of North Carolinaâ€™s 11th District that I would fight for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement with a   approach that brings down costs and provides more choices for the American people," Meadows said in a statement. Vice President Mike Pence met Friday afternoon with members of the Freedom Caucus at the Capitol Hill Club, a source familiar with the meeting said.
