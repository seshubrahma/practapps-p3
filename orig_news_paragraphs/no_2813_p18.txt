The theory is that real estate loses value over time and is eventually worthless. As everyone surely knows, most real estate has historically appreciated in value. How much Mr. Trump’s property investments might throw off in depreciation depends on what he paid for them, how much he’s spent on capital improvements and how the assets are categorized (some assets qualify for accelerated depreciation). But the   depreciation schedule for commercial property, and purchases and capital investments of $2 billion (a modest estimate, given that Mr. Trump values his assets at $10 billion) would generate depreciation deductions of $50 million a year.
