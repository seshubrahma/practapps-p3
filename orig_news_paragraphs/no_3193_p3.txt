For example, one   advocacy group declared in March 2017 that: The Partnership for a New American Economy (PNAE) for instance, estimates that undocumented [illegal] immigrants wielded $157. 3 billion in purchasing power as of 2014 —  which is money spent in numerous U. S. businesses. The PNAE is a   group run by major business leaders who stand to gain from more imported consumers. That demand for imported consumers is also echoed by Wall Street advisors, such as Mark Zandi, at Moody’s Analytics, who predicted that reduced immigration would lower housing prices.
