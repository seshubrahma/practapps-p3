Mediaset stations devoted the same fraction of airtime to   advertising regardless of who was in office. Rather, companies   paid consistently higher prices for Mediaset ads when Berlusconi   was in office. ’ ’   RAI, meanwhile, was forced to cut prices when Berlusconi was in   power, so the net effect on ad spending was to shift revenues   from the public coffers (recall that RAI is a     broadcaster) into Berlusconi’s pockets. And Mediaset couldn’t   justify the higher prices because consumers switched their   television allegiances —  audience shares of Mediaset and RAI held   steady across the whole 1993 —  2009 period.
