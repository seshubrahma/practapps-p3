Rory is two under for the round but could easily be four or five under with the way heâ€™s striking the ball. As the crowd walks to the tenth hole, U. S. Open and Olympic gold medalist Justin Rose tries to walk the other way to the range. Pretty funny to see Rose fight the crowd while carrying a bucket of range balls. One guy nonchalantly says, "Hey Justin" and Rose, to his credit, was nice enough to smile and "Hey" back.
