That meant figuring out a tax change that would put an extra $2, 889 in the pockets of a family of three that in 2013 made $20, 420. An increase in benefits also helps families with somewhat higher incomes. For example, a family of four making $40, 000 would receive about $6, 000 a year in this expanded E. I. T. C. compared with the $2, 142 they get now. The benefits wouldnâ€™t completely phase out for a family of four until they hit nearly $70, 000 of income.
