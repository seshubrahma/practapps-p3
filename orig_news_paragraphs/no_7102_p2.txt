In the newly   Congress, legislation has been put forward that would give individual governors the authority to stop refugee resettlement. When Trump began speaking about the refugee influx, many governors said they were not notified of ongoing resettlement, which alarmed local residents. In Nebraska and Kentucky, refugee resettlement is booming, but not with the state governmentâ€™s approval. In Kentucky, as the Courier Journal notes, the Obama Administration resettled refugees at double the rate of the national average last year.
