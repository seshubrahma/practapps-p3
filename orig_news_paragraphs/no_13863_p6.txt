Hill took the teen to a   apartment in Chicago, where he was bound and gagged, beaten over several days by the two male and two female suspects and forced to drink toilet water, with some of the attacks broadcast on Facebook Live, she said. " During the course of the attack, defendant Hill communicated with the victim’s mother and demanded $300 ransom in exchange for getting her son back," Antonetti said. The youth finally escaped Tuesday when police came to the apartment because the suspects argued with   residents who’d complained about the noise, she said.
