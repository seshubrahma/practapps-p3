There’s growing consensus that evidence points to Russian actors in the hacks, although there is less public proof that they were intended to aid Trump. In any case, there’s no good argument to make against asking for stronger evidence, even if Trump’s allies keep trying to make one. Not every critique is quite so carefully thought out: For those who criticize WikiLeaks for not publishing RNC emails or more Putin docs: why don’t you just publish them yourselves? This rather seems to be begging the question if WikiLeaks did as alleged receive the DNC documents thanks to Russian state actors, then it has a unique source.
