The state committeemen then attend the mass meetings of the state Republican committee, at which they elect the state chairman and other state committee officers. The precinct committeemen in every county and every legislative district elect the officers of those committees. And, most importantly, under our state Bylaws, which have to comply with the Republican National Committee’s Rules of the Republican Party, the precinct committeemen  —   and only the precinct committeemen   —   elect the delegates to our state convention, who in turn, at our state presidential nominating convention, elect our national convention delegates (the 55 that have not yet been elected, three for each congressional district elected by the state convention delegates residing in each district and 27 "at large" elected by the whole body).
