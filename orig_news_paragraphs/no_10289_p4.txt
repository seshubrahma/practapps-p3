Paragraph five of the endorsement focuses on the shortcomings of other Republican candidates, such as Jeb Bush and his failure to "ignite much support," Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and his "embracing of alarmist views," Dr. Ben Carson’s "inability to grasp the world," and Gov. Chris Christie’s pledge to "bar refugees" from Syria. Not until paragraph six does the endorsement even discuss Governor Kasich, who the editorial board says is "no moderate" because of his views on unions, abortion, and   marriage. Kasich, "though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race," the piece reads.
