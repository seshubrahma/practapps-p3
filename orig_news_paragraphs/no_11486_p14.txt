In short, the   Axis is having conniptions because the American people have now chosen to lead them a president and an administration that will not just be sensible about this threat. It is also determined to do the job Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and their minions have adamantly shirked: protecting us against, rather than accommodating, Sharia. So the Big Lie and "other techniques of shaming and peer pressure" are now being applied with abandon to outstanding public servants in the hope of reducing their effectiveness and that of the presidency they will serve. The transparent falsity and political agenda being served by such lies should, instead, discredit their perpetrators.
