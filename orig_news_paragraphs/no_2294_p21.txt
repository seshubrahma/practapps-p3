The largest parcel would have 173 linear feet on the water, while the other two would have about 150. To receive the expected asking price, the parcels would have to sell for more than $215, 000 a linear foot of ocean frontage. Brokers say most recent sales of Palm Beach oceanfront went for about $100, 000 to $120, 000 a linear foot. Kenneth Griffin, the hedge fund manager, has spent more than $120 million in Palm Beach to buy and combine four parcels of land, which brokers say worked out to be more than $200, 000 a linear foot.
