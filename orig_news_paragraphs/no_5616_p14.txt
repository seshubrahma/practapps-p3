That goal is to meet history’s great test —  to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, and innocent of hatred. And young Muslim men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity for themselves and their peoples. With God’s help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed.
