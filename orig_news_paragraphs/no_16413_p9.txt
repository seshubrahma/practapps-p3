Also, Trump didn’t specify what countries would be affected by this new test. But France has a serious domestic terrorism problem    would French citizens be subjected to this kind of test? Or is he concerned about Syrian refugees, which the United States has taken only 10, 000 of the millions who have fled the civil war in their country (and only 2% of whom are single,   males, according to the U. S. State Department). In short, Trump didn’t say who would be targeted for these ideological tests, saying only that he would consult the State Department about how to approach this issue.
