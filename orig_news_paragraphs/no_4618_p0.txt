A new Mexican beer has a label depicting a   gloomy, mariachi President Donald Trump with a swastika belt buckle. [The "Amigous Cerveza" beer  has the word "amigo" misspelled to allegedly make fun of a mispronunciation of the word by Americans, reported Reuters.   The back label of the brew says the Republican president should be "in a mad house, not the White House. "
