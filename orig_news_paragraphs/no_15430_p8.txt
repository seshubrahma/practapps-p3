It is "old news" that Yates met with White House Counsel Don McGahn on January 26 to discuss Flynn’s problem. But what’s new is that she told McGahn on that day    and in a   meeting the next day    that not only was Flynn lying to members of the presidential transition about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak but also that she had reason to believe he had been compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target. Yates also offered McGahn the chance to go through the evidence the Justice Department had that led them to that conclusion. (It’s not clear if he actually did so.)
