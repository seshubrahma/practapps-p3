 (CNN) Tom Brady has opened up on his friendship with Donald Trump, but it’s not a subject he appears to want to delve into much further. Brady, a day after leading the Patriots back to another Super Bowl, spoke about his relationship with Trump on his weekly appearance on WEEI’s Kirk and Callahan show. According to Trump, who made the remarks at a   dinner that included Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Brady called the new president to offer his congratulations before the inauguration.
