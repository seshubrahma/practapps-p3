—   suggest that about 8% of Trump primary and caucus voters also voted for Barack Obama in 2012. That is a striking finding, even if, as RAND’s Michael Pollard suggests, some of those voters return to the Democrats by November. So it is wrong to declare that "it’s just not true" that Trump is attracting new voters and crossover voters to the GOP. Indeed, given that Trump has won millions more votes than Mitt Romney did in the 2012 primary, it would be wise to give him the benefit of the doubt.
