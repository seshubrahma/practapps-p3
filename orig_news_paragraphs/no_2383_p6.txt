Yet Mr. Sabin has been a generous donor to the Republican Party for years, contributing more than $500, 000 to Republican candidates, committees and other political groups this election cycle. Even within his party, Mr. Sabin is an outlier: Many other Republicans who believe in climate change have declined to support Mr. Trump.

He recently donated $100, 000 to Trump Victory, the candidateâ€™s joint   venture with the Republican Party.
