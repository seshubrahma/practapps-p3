Under the current system, companies submitting applications for   visas for potential employees can pay extra for expedited processing, which is referred to as premium processing. Premium processing costs an additional $1, 225 and ensures a response from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services in 15 days or the fee is refunded.   Processing of standard   applications    those that are not premium    takes between three and six months. The suspension on expedited visas becomes effective April 3 and could last up to six months, according to the agency.
