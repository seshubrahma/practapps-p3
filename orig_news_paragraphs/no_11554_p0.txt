Breitbart contributor Matthew Tyrmand is taking one of Poland’s biggest newspapers, Gazeta Wyborcza, to court over alleged defamation. [Recently propped up by a capital group affiliated with the mass migration, liberal   George Soros, the case against the newspaper is now looking to be one of the highest profile in recent Polish legal history.   Tyrmand, who has written at length about Mr. Soros’s attempts at destabilising the rightward shifting democratic Poland, has been accused of "mafia membership" and "sympathy for [Vladimir] Putin "  —   particularly heinous charges in Poland, a country that still wrestles with its historic relationship with the former Soviet Union.
