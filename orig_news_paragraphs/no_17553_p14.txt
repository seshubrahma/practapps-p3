The Cubans I met seemed to recognize the developments, while also   remaining skeptical that after nearly 60 years of Communist rule,   any significant change would occur. A   street sweeper   said to me that all the government does is talk, and that he’d   sooner believe "the sun, the moon, or the ocean" if it told him   something than Raul Castro and the Communist Party. ’ ’    Change in a place like Cuba is almost imperceptibly slow.
