 (CNN) The Senate voted Thursday to roll back the Stream Protection Rule, an Obama administration regulation aimed at curbing waste from coal mines from entering waterways but that Republicans complained was an onerous job killer in coal country.   The    vote was largely along party lines though four red state Democrats supported it and one moderate Republican voted against it.   The vote came out one day after the measure passed the House   sending the bill to President Donald Trumpâ€™s desk.
