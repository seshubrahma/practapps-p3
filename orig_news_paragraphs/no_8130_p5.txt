The female ringleader also claimed that she had been silenced "for 200 years" prompting Yiannopoulos to question how the supposed 200   protester looked so young.   After an extended period of time, the crowd started to chant "Do your job" at security, who remained at the back of the venue for the entire event. When security refused to intervene, Yiannopoulos posed for pictures with fans in the audience, and ordered the crowd to follow him to the college presidentâ€™s office.
