White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon —  the former executive chairman of Breitbart News —  both popped into the Oval Office during the interview. Vice President Mike Pence, a former leader in Congress of the House GOP conference before his election to the governorship of Indiana, also came into the Oval Office, just before the president. When Breitbart News asked President Trump to detail a few specific things that he inherited that were a mess, he replied that the Middle East, North Korea, the border, and Obamacare were at the top of the list.
