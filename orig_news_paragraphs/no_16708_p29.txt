A black object near the bottom of the photo is a gun that police found at the scene, the source said.   North Carolina recently passed a law that blocks the release of police recordings from body or dashboard cameras with limited exceptions. That law is set to take effect in October.   The mayor said an attorney for the city told her the law will not affect decisions about whether to release the videos in Scottâ€™s killing, because it was not in effect at the time of the shooting.
