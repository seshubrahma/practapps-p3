In March, the Supreme Cour this expected to hear a case in which gay advocates want the judges to redefine the meaning of "sex" in a 1972 sexual discrimination law from biological sex to "gender identity. " That’s a revolutionary demand, because if individuals can freely flip their sex from male to female or vice versa, then the nation’s many   institutions will face enormous legal pressure to admit people of the opposite biological sex. For example, shelters for battered women may be forced to open their doors to men who claim battery, women’s sports leagues will be forced to admit bigger and stronger men who claim to be women, and schoolbooks and parenting guides used by government grantees would be forced to define "women" merely as people who say they are women, effectively discarding the nation’s cultural history of women, girls and feminists.
