Trump is also expected to say that "any country that works with the U. S to defeat Islamic terrorism" will be considered an ally by his administration. The AP says the proposed immigration screening test will include a mix of questionnaires, social media searches, and interviewing friends and relatives of prospective U. S. citizens. A Trump administration would reportedly stop issuing visas  in cases were sufficient screening cannot be applied. Trumpâ€™s proposed screening is conspicuously at odds with the   refugee policy instituted by German chancellor Angela Merkel.
