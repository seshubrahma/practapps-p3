The larger number of white   voters implies that Democrats are far more dependent on winning white   voters, and therefore more vulnerable to a populist candidate like Mr. Trump. Over all, 34 percent of Mr. Obamaâ€™s supporters were white voters without a college degree, compared with 25 percent in the exit polls, according to an Upshot statistical model that integrated census data, actual results and 15, 000 interviews from various   surveys. The model yields a full alternative to the exit polls that assume an older, whiter electorate like the one depicted by the census.
