Officials say the shift from taxis to Uber and other apps has cost the authority about $28 million since 2014. The Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog, has also questioned whether New York can still count on the $1. 2 billion in revenue it expects to collect from the future sale of taxi medallions, because their value has sunk. Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said   apps were able to lure riders with artificially low prices because they were subsidized by an influx of cash by investors. The apps have made it easier for people to travel by the "most inefficient mode of transportation possible," she said.
