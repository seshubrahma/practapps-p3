In looking for someone to follow through on his campaign vow to dismantle one of the Obama administration’s signature climate change policies,   Donald J. Trump probably could not have found a better candidate for the job than Mr. Ebell. Mr. Ebell, who revels in taking on the scientific consensus on global warming, will be Mr. Trump’s lead agent in choosing personnel and setting the direction of the federal agencies that address climate change and environmental policy more broadly. Mr. Ebell, whose organization is financed in part by the coal industry, has been one of the most vocal opponents of the linchpin of that policy, the Clean Power Plan. Developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the plan is a   set of regulations that, by seeking to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation, could result in the closing of many   power plants, among other effects.
