Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI director James Comey did not create the social media firestorm Democrats and the mainstream media hoped it would, according to data from SocialFlow. [An evaluation by the social media research company found that Facebook postings pertaining to Comey’s firing reached an average of 37, 000 users, well below that of other moments in the Trump presidency.   Meanwhile, other events such as the passing of the American Healthcare Act created an average of 112, 000 impressions, while Donald Trump’s executive order suspending immigration from seven terror prone countries had an average reach of 108, 000. Even Rachel Maddow’s partial release of Trump’s tax returns generated an average of 43, 000, well above that of Comey’s firing.
