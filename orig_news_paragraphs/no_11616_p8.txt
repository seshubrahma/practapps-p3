Seated nearby is another familiar face: Al Gore. Once Bill Clinton’s Vice President, he’s returning now as Secretary of Energy. The man who made a career out of scolding Americans for their use of evil fossil fuels —  while keeping his motorcade idling outside during his speeches —  will finally be able to make his environmentalist dreams into reality. Another Al isn’t far away: Al Sharpton, longtime activist for "social justice" and failed MSNBC TV host.
