This February, I am so proud to be part of a team that launched a campaign called #OurBlackisBeautiful to celebrate our beauty and our unity for Black History Month and beyond.   We are working with some great influencers to support a threefold concept: #BuyBlack, #BankBlack, and #GiveBlack.    These three pillars remind us of the importance of supporting each other.
