Sessions has spoken on numerous occasions on his support for a return to "broken windows" policing and taking local law enforcement’s side in their effort to wrestle their crime rates back down to the historic lows seen only a few years ago. Some of the violence is fueled by what the justice department calls "transnational criminal organizations," brutal gangs like   and   networks like the Mexican drug cartels. At a meeting of the Attorney General’s Organized Crime Council, Sessions made clear his department would have "zero tolerence" for gang violence as it brings an executive order targeting these organizations for deportation and dismantling into reality. On several occasions, Sessions has highlighted his continued support for the type of rigorous policing that came under intense fire in the last administration.
