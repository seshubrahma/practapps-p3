" The average American may have a hard time seeing how shifts in enforcement priorities within the Justice Department affect their daily lives, but the impact can be substantial," said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. " Whether itâ€™s in how much (or how little) to enforce   laws against local governments or private employers, how aggressively to enforce (or not enforce) drug laws, or taking a different position on the relationship between the federal government and the states with respect to immigration, the environment and other   topics, how resources are allocated has potentially monumental substantive policy implications," Vladeck added.
