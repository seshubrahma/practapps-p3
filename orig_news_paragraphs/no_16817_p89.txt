Early on, I got the sense that Mike Pence laughed to keep from crying the entire night. I also thought his smug appearance, constant head shaking, and outcry that Tim Kaine’s mere repetition of Trump’s words were "nonsense," was condescension and arrogance.   Pence is probably wondering how he got here (until he realizes he was not likely to win a gubernatorial   anyway). He kept saying Kaine’s statements were nonsense.
