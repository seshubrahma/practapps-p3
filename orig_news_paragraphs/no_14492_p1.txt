Ramirez had twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, his lawyers said. The program, meant for "Dreamers"    undocumented immigrants younger than 30 who were brought to the United States as children and pass background checks    temporarily allows recipients to live and work in the country. The government alleges Ramirez told immigration agents he is a gang member, an affiliation that generally disqualifies undocumented immigrants from gaining DACA protection. But Ramirezâ€™s lawyers filed a lawsuit in federal court, saying he is not a gang member and that immigration agents never had any legal cause to take him to a holding facility where was alleged to have made the disputed confession.
