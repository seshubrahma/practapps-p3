Should additional Republican officeholders follow Mr. Rigell in backing the   ticket, it could help Mr. Johnson gain credibility as an alternative choice. A former car dealer who represents a moderate district on the Virginia coast, Mr. Rigell said he expected more congressional Republicans and local Republican officials to break openly with the party’s presidential candidate as the election draws nearer. Many Republican candidates have asked him for advice, Mr. Rigell said, about separating themselves from Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Rigell has been saying since the winter that he could not support Mr. Trump.
