Advisers to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign said it was remaining focused on primary dollars in part because that money  —   up to $2, 700 from each supporter   —   could be used during the general election, too, while general election contributions could not be spent until after the party’s convention in July. The shift in focus has been apparent in Mrs. Clinton’s messaging. In her advertisements, particularly in New York, Mrs. Clinton has started to turn her attention toward Donald J. Trump, who is leading the Republican field in delegates.
