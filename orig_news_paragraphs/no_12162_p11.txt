The Hungarian government has been the most engaged in Europe on tackling the migrant Crisis over the past two years, with Viktor Orban’s   administration erecting fences on their southern borders to prevent the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants using the Balkan route continuing north into Western Europe. Mr. Orban has also been at the forefront of campaigning within the European Union, as part of the Visegrad group of nations including Poland, the Czechia and Slovakia, to control Europe’s external borders and to prevent the mandatory redistribution of migrants to EU member states.
