"Fox  Friends, " network prime time host Tucker Carlson criticized the hysteria generated by the   deportation forces and raids that some have claimed to be underway since President Donald Trump was sworn into office.   According to Carlson, the number of illegal immigrants deported since Trump took office is minuscule compared to number President Barack Obama had deported during his eight years as president.
