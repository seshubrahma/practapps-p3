The engine that drives the anger is the mainstream media, which has done nothing to seriously vet the Black Lives Matter movement. Much of the anger is caused by the inaccurate reporting that consistently vilifies the police and leaves out key details about the shooting victims. This has led to fables such as "Hands Up, Don’t Shoot," which have continued to be amplified and repeated by Black Lives Matter protesters long after they have been debunked. In fact, one of the key characteristics of the Black Lives Matter movement and the mainstream media’s reporting on it is a naked antipathy for facts.
