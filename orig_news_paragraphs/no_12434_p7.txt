Hillary Clinton helped run the foundation prior to her appointment to run the Department of State in 2009.   She formally rejoined the foundation’s board in 2013, but quit again in April 2015 to run for president.

Trump is making opposition to the   program a leading element in his campaign, despite his practice of hiring at least 1, 000   guest workers via the similar   visa program.
