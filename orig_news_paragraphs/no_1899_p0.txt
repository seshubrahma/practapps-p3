Interesting juxtaposition of the week: The AE show "Duck Dynasty" announces that the current season will be its last, and Paul Horner, who creates fake news stories on the internet, tells The Washington Post: "My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. " "Duck Dynasty," the reality show about the Robertson family of Louisiana and its   business, became a spectacular hit for AE after its debut in March 2012, then a spectacular headache in late 2013 when Phil Robertson, the patriarch, made remarks in a GQ interview that were widely seen as offensive to gay people. At that point the show was averaging nine million viewers a week, an amazing number for a   reality series, but the controversy cost it cachet among some viewers, and ratings have fallen considerably since.
