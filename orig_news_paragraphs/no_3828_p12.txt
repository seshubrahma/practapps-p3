Talking about how she was heckled at an international womenâ€™s conference in April, she argued that "those who accuse the U. S. of heartlessness in the face of this crisis are wrong. " "No country has invested more in protecting, housing, feeding and caring for Syrian refugees than the U. S. We have provided nearly $6. 5 billion in emergency assistance for Syria since the start of the crisis. Inside Syria, some four million people benefit from U. S. assistance for essentials like food and shelter every month," Haley wrote. Haley said she would bring attention to U. S.  food programs on her trip to Turkey and Jordan, including programs that deliver aid to Syrians still trapped in the country.
