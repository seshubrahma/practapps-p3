The House Democrats, led by Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked the General Services Administration to explain what action, if any, it plans to take regarding the hotel lease, given the provision that appears to bar a federal elected official from holding it. The agency has so far made no public statement on how it will respond to this apparent breach. The Democrats also released a chart showing the corporate ownership arrangement behind the Trump Post Office LLC, the corporate entity set up by the Trump family to run the hotel. It shows that Mr. Trump, at least at the time he submitted the filing to the General Services Administration, controlled 76 percent of the company, while three of his children each had about 7. 5 percent.
