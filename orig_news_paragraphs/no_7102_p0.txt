President Donald Trumpâ€™s promise to halt all refugee resettlement from nations that have been compromised by Islamic terrorism may be coming sooner than expected. [Migration expert Randy Capps with the Migration Policy Institute told the Courier Journal that although Trump could potentially have to fight to send refugees already living in the U. S. back to their native countries, he could halt refugee resettlement with the stroke of a pen.   Additionally, Capps said the National Security   Registration System (NSEERS) could also be reinstated without any   from Congress. The NSEERS program tracks foreign residents who have come from countries where terrorism is a major threat.
