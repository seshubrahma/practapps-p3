Washington (CNN) FBI Director James Comey will testify before Congress Thursday to answer "important questions" about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and his recommendation that the Justice Department not prosecute the former Secretary of State even though classified information was found on her private email server. While he criticized her conduct and called her handling of sensitive information "extremely careless," Comey’s decision not to recommend charges against Clinton or her aides has been roundly criticized by Republicans. Why Comey made the announcement alone, "The FBI’s recommendation is surprising and confusing," Rep. Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday in a statement.
