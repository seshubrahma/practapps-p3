We have not relaxed the rules of engagement. I have authorized Lt. Gen. [Stephen] Townsend to delegate the employment of rules of engagement to the appropriate level due to the tough urban fight that we knew was coming in Mosul. To be clear, there were no changes  â€¦     to the rules of engagement that allows us to engage. Gen. Townsend is the top commander of U. S. ground troops in Iraq.
