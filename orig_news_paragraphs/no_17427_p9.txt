Obama held back from meetings in 2008, During Obama’s own transition to power in 2008, he withheld extensive public comment about flashes of violence in the Middle East and terror attacks in India that occurred as President George W. Bush was concluding his term. Bush’s aides even invited Obama to participate in a Group of 20 meeting held in Washington shortly after he was elected President. Obama’s team    which at the time was developing an economic recovery plan that differed from Bush’s proposals    concluded his presence at the summit could send contradictory signals to global allies. Trump, meanwhile, has shown little signs of concern about sending mixed signals about US policy to overseas allies.
