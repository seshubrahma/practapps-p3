Palin included a photo of herself embracing Bannon’s daughter, an active duty Army officer, during a book signing at Fort Campbell during Palin’s Good Tidings and Great Joy book tour in 2013. Bannon wrote, produced, and directed the documentary film "The Undefeated" in 2011 to chronicle the story of Palin’s conservative populist roots. The film charts her rise as a corruption fighting mayor and governor in Alaska, her entrance on the national stage as Senator John McCain’s running mate in 2008, and her leadership in the grassroots Tea Party movement that ushered in historic electoral victories for the GOP. The film opened on a montage of leftwing hate and smears directed at Palin as a result of her energizing the Republican base in 2008.
