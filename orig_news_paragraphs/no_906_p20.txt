On Friday, another senior administration official who did not want to be identified conceded that point, saying that any new trade deal with Germany would have to be negotiated with the European Union. But that official also said Mr. Trump would raise Germanyâ€™s persistent trade surplus with Ms. Merkel. The chancellor is likely to make a fervent case for the European Union, not just as an economic bloc but also as a political project that has brought peace and prosperity to Europe. White House officials said Friday that Mr. Trump would not be shy about his views of Brussels, but that the United States wanted to keep a strong partnership with it.
