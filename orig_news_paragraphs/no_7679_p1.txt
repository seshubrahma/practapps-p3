Ellmers is running for   against primary challenger state Rep. George Holding, in the Second Congressional District, whose boundaries were changed dramatically in February. Ellmers was a member of the 2010 Tea Party wave of Republicans who were going to "shake things up," but she has been widely criticized for consistently voting with Washington "establishment" Republicans. In January of 2015, Ellmers led a group of House Republicans in a maneuver that torpedoed the   abortion   bill on the eve of the March for Life. She then took to her blog to defend herself against an angry   base of the GOP, referring to the grassroots as "abhorrent" and "childish" in response to their criticism of her.
