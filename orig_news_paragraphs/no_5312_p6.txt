We cannot achieve the goal of ‘hiring American’ while maintaining a policy that allows them to bypass Americans in favor of foreign guest workers. GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate’s judiciary committee, praised the directive, saying: The   program was designed to fill gaps in America’s workforce with   foreign workers, but as we’ve seen in recent years, the program has been abused and exploited at the expense of American workers and   foreign workers.   We’ve seen companies use the program to fire American workers and replace them with   foreign counterparts. The visa lottery system makes this problem worse by rewarding visas randomly, instead of prioritizing foreign workers with greater experience, skill, and qualifications.
