Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a statement Thursday on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit decision to block President Donald Trump’s travel ban executive order, vowing to take the defense of that order to the United States Supreme Court. ["President Trump’s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the Nation safe," Sessions wrote in the statement:   The Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the decision of the divided court, which blocks the President’s efforts to strengthen this country’s national security. As the dissenting judges explained, the executive order is a constitutional exercise of the President’s duty to protect our communities from terrorism.
