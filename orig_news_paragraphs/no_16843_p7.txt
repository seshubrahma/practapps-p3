Shocking remarks, Trump is heard discussing women in vulgar terms during   banter during the taping of a segment for "Access Hollywood," footage which was obtained by The Washington Post. During the lewd conversation captured by a microphone Trump was wearing on his lapel, Trump recounts how he tried to "fuck" an unidentified married woman before bragging that he is "automatically attracted to beautiful (women)" and just starts "kissing them." "Access Hollywood" later identified the unidentified woman as Nancy O’Dell, who used to work for the show. CNN has attempted to contact O’Dell’s manager but has not heard back.
