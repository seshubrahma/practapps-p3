Trump noticed the latter sign, and praised it from the stage. Trump attacked Obamacare, as well as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which he called the "worst" trade deal ever negotiated, and which he laid at the feet of Bill and Hillary Clinton. He also criticized the Syrian refugee program, and Obamaâ€™s foreign policy in Syria, where he had announced his intention to attack Islamic   Mosul long before doing do. (U. S.  forces attacked the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa this weekend, but without similar fanfare, perhaps in reaction to such criticism.)
