U. S. President Donald Trump is pushing Britain behind the European Union in the queue to strike new trade deal, unnamed sources have told The Times. [The sources, who are described as being "close to both sides" say that German Chancellor Angela Merkel last month convinced Mr Trump that talks on a trade deal between the EU and U. S. would be simpler than he thought.   This in turn led to a "realisation" in the White House that an EU trade deal would be more important than a deal with Britain. The claims come after House Speaker Paul Ryan hinted earlier this week that the infamous TTIP deal could be resurrected.
