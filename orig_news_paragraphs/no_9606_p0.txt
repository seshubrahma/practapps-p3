Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne commented Saturday on MSNBC on GOP   Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign, saying Southerners hear "racial overtones" to his immigration statements.   " I think in the case of Donald Trump, a lot of people in the South hear a kind of candidate that they have related to in the past, his attacks on political correctness, racial overtones to what he says about immigration on other issues and his general attack on the establishment. I think you have a lot of conservatives who are disappointed that conservative politicians have made promises to the   that they never kept," Dionne said.
