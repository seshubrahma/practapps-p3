" To be able to identify passengers who need to go through a waiver process and to do so quickly is a demonstration of the skill and professionalism of those at CBP and those at the State Department," he said. The official noted that the purpose of the order was to block the "ever present threat of domestic terrorism," by building a vetting and screening process for immigrants and travelers from dangerous countries.
