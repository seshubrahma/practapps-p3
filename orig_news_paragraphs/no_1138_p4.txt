In a statement issued several hours after The New York Times first published news of the directive, Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, acknowledged that Mr. Trump had approved the Pentagonâ€™s proposal to expand its targeting authority "to defeat Al Shabab in Somalia" in partnership with African Union and Somali forces. " The additional support provided by this authority will help deny Al Shabab safe havens from which it could attack U. S. citizens or U. S. interests in the region," he said.
