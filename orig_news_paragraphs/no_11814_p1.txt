Schlafly was one of Trumpâ€™s earliest and most influential endorsements. With her backing, the populist billionaire went on to win more votes in a Republican primary than any GOP nominee in U. S. history. Schlafly devoted herself fully to her effort to inspire conservatives to unite and propel Trump to victory on November 8th. Her final book, released the day after she passed away, was titled The Conservative Case for Trump and was penned as a final rallying cry from the woman who spent more than one quarter of all American history leading the conservative grassroots into battle.
