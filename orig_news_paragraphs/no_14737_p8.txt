China anxious over THAAD, Wangâ€™s press conference came a day after the US military revealed the controversial missile defense system had arrived in South Korea. Pictures released by the United States showed the first pieces of the ballistic missile defense technology being unloaded at Osan Air Base in South Korea Monday night. The missile defense system is intended to counter North Korean aggression, according to the US military, but China is strongly opposing its deployment. Beijing believes the missile system could be used to spy on their activities, rather than monitoring incoming North Korean missiles, Mark Tokola of the Korean Economic Institute of America said.
