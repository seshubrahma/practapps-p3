The Times includes a comment from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who does not dispute that Trump made the comment, but attempts to explain the context: "By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russiaâ€™s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. " The Times does not report what else may have been in the document, which would appear to have been classified. The Times used the same dubious methods in reporting Tuesday that President Trump had "asked" Comey to end the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
