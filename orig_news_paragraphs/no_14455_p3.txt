Pruitt is currently the Oklahoma attorney general, and in that office, he has led lawsuits against the agency he stands to lead.

Environmentalists have staunchly opposed his nomination, while many Republicans have praised him for combating what they view as regulatory overreach. A vote to break the filibuster is scheduled for Thursday, and a final confirmation vote is expected Friday afternoon, assuming Democrats do not yield back time.
