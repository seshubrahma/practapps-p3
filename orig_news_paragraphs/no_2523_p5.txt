Mr. Friedman represented Mr. Trumpâ€™s personal interests in the bankruptcies of the casinos in 2004, 2009 and 2014. Their relationship was cemented in 2005, friends said, when Mr. Trump traveled three hours in a snowstorm to pay a condolence call on Mr. Friedman after the death of his father, a prominent Long Island rabbi. " He was very taken by Trump spending almost all day just to pay the shiva," said Yossi Kahana, one of the two friends who described the visit, using the Hebrew term for the week of mourning.
