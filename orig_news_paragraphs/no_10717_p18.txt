Cruz said his next step is heading back to Washington to go back to the U. S. Senate and fight for the jobs, freedom and security platform he ran on during his presidential campaign. When asked about the possibility of a third party run for those that "think like" him, Cruz said, "I don’t think that’s very likely. " He said he does think that it’s imperative to get the burden of Washington off of the back of small businesses. "
