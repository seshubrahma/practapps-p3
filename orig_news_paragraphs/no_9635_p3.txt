—    Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) September 5, 2016,  Video of the presser on Hillary Clinton’s plane shot by Fox News shows that she literally walked away from the press when she burst out into the coughing fit.   Later, Clinton came back to the press area of the plane —  which is distinct and separate from the rest of the plane, which has four separate cabins for press, Secret Service, Clinton herself, and for her staff —  to "finish" the press gaggle. She didn’t make it back until the plane landed, and when she came back she had a bottle of water in hand.
