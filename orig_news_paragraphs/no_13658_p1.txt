Gov. Mike Pence’s efforts to protect Indiana families from Syrian refugees who had not been vetted before being brought into this country, but, in fact, a federal appeals court bolstered Donald Trump’s argument that if Americans want to change the nation’s refugee policy, they need to vote  . [As it became clear that President Barack Obama was importing thousands of Syrians who had not been vetted to ensure they were peaceful refugees who would assimilate into U. S. society and embrace American values, Governor Mike Pence issued an order declining to work with federal contractors to resettle those Syrians into parts of Indiana, in neighborhoods surrounded by Hoosier families.   In the Refugee Act of 1980, Congress established a program for the federal government to work with the states to resettle refugees in the United States, under which companies performing the resettlement work can be reimbursed by the government. Exodus Refugee Immigration is one such organization, and sued Pence, alleging that only Congress and the president can make those decisions, not states and governors.
