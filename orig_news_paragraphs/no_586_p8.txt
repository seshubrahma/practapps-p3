Just one Democrat, Senator of Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broke with his party and supported Mr. Mnuchin. In a sign of the backlash that Democrats will face for siding with any part of Mr. Trump’s agenda, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee warned that Mr. Manchin’s vote would not go unnoticed. " We will ensure that Joe Manchin hears from his West Virginia constituents who disapprove of his voting with Wall Street against working families," the group said in a statement after the vote.
