While Washington will be glued to their TV sets and computers on Thursday, Trump will be speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalitionâ€™s Road to Majority Conference and participating in an infrastructure summit with governors and mayors. The event will highlight his push to modernize American infrastructure, its highways, waterways, electrical and airway systems. This week, the administration stayed focused on other key items in its domestic agenda. On Monday, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin announced the VA would adopt the same medical records system as the Defense Department, to enable streamlining between the two, and speed up the process of veterans receiving care.
