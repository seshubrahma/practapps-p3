Eugenicist Sanger, who began the Negro Project in 1939 and worked to bring birth control to blacks in an effort to reduce their population, joined with elite and well known   Mary McLeod Bethune, W. E. B. DuBois, and Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Sr. The Negro Project was sold as a solution to poverty and high birth rates among the black community. At the same time Sanger promoted her theory of "eliminating the unfit," she also condemned charitable organizations that she believed were elevating the very population that needed to be weeded out.
