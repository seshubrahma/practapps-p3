The group says it’s expecting more than $60 million in commitments, including a roughly $20 million gift from an unidentified donor.   But the numbers should be viewed with skepticism: The group’s founder has previously said that he collected $32 million in commitments    though $30 million of that has yet to arrive six weeks after the flashy announcement was made. The most recent financial documents showed the PAC had only raised $2. 1 million so far.   The group is expecting to receive a $3 million donation early this week, along with two matching $3 million donations.
