We are preparing a path to the presidency for one of the best among us to stand up and give this country what it desperately wants  —   a better choice for president.   No ’lesser of two evils’ It may seem strange for someone like me    a longtime and devoted member of the GOP and a former Republican delegate from my home state    to be taking a leadership role in a movement like this one. But I am even more disillusioned by GOP leadership than by our candidate.
