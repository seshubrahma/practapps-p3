Just minutes after a federal judge blocked part of President Trump’s immigration order on Saturday night, ruling that no one with a valid visa should be deported, someone was, according to court papers filed on Thursday. Her name is Suha Amin Abdullah Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor with a valid     visa who was working at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, in a residency program. " She left for vacation thinking she’d be gone for a short time, and then she couldn’t come back to her home," Dr. Abushamma’s lawyer, Jennifer Kroman, said on Thursday evening.
