A slight majority said Trump needed to do more to prevent conflicts between his business interests and the nation’s   and almost 62% said the incoming government should investigate Russian meddling in the presidential election. Six weeks out from the election and just two days after the Electoral College certified Trump’s victory despite losing the popular vote, the poll found a deep split on overhauling the electoral process. Just under 50% of respondents said the system should stay in place, with almost 42% saying the Constitution should be amended to use the popular vote instead and just over 8% responding undecided. The poll of 1, 000 voters was taken December   and has a margin of error ±3% points.
