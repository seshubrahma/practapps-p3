The census did post a "User Note" on Friday, after the center’s report was released, directing people to use the A. C. S. for comparisons between metro and nonmetro areas. It’s not clear why the census even included those numbers in the initial big income report in the first place. To be fair to the census researchers, this number was not labeled statistically significant in the report   —   meaning that the researchers couldn’t be sure if they were actually detecting a real change in income for rural households in 2015.
