Days after the appointment, Mr. Christie cut Mr. Stepien loose, when documents from a legislative subpoena revealed that a deputy chief of staff to the governor, Bridget Anne Kelly, had sent an email calling for "some traffic problems in Fort Lee," the town gridlocked by the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge between the borough and Manhattan in September 2013. Prosecutors, who indicted Ms. Kelly and two other Christie allies in the lane closings, have said the   were retaliation against the Fort Lee mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Mr. Christie for   in 2013. The governor gave little reason for why he dropped Mr. Stepien other than to say he had "lost confidence in Bill’s judgment" after other emails showed Mr. Stepien referring to the mayor of Fort Lee as "an idiot "  —   the kind of language Mr. Christie has been known to employ publicly.
