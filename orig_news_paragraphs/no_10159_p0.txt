The richest man in Mexico has lost quite a bit of his net worth since   Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential victory. [   Carlos Slim lost $4. 7 billion from his fortune Wednesday as it went down to $49 billion from "$53. 7 billion the day before," the New York Daily News reported.   Experts say the reason Slim lost so much from his fortune is because the peso fell 12 percent and because of poorly performing stocks, Bloomberg News reported.
