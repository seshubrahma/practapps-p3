Vice President Joe Biden is joining the media and Hillary Clinton in spinning out a lie about Donald Trump’s comments about PTSD soldiers. [During a rally in Sarasota, Florida, Biden admitted that he hadn’t seen Trump’s comments but said he was told about them by a CNN anchor.   " I didn’t see this, but I was told this by Chris Cuomo, who interviewed me at the last stop," he said, quoting only a portion of Trump’s remarks.
