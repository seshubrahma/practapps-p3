Many Palestinians and peace activists argue that the line has already been crossed  —   that any annexation of Ma’ale Adumim, after so many years, would be a technicality. " We are living in one state now," said Ziad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian lawyer and writer. Mr. Zayyad, a former Palestinian minister, said that unlike most Palestinians he supported Donald J. Trump for president, in part because he felt his apparently greater sympathy for Israel would begin to provide a clarity to a   conflict.
