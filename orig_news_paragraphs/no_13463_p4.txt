Terrorism expert Patrick Poole writes that the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker ( ) has not even held hearings on the bill, much less arranged for it to be voted on. Corker is reportedly being vetted as a potential running mate for Donald Trump. The story is even more discouraging in the House, where support for the bill was proven when it passed the Judiciary Committee. Yet, Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy have not given any public indication that heâ€™ll have the House vote on it.
