A lone man’s climb up the side of Trump Tower became a New York City spectacle on Wednesday afternoon after thousands watched his ascent in real time on television, through social media and in person. The man was pulled off the building’s facade and apprehended by police officers who had removed a glass panel on the 21st floor about three hours into his climb. By then, he had become a social media sensation, as people watched live videos posted on Facebook and Periscope, a live   app. A stream on Facebook from   in New York received more than four million views, and people commented along with the action.
