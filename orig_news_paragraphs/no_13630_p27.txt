Ted Cruz: Cruz has been crystal clear that he is opposed to the Common Core reform and federal intervention in education in general. The senator supported Sen. Chuck Grassley’s effort to defund Common Core in both 2013 and 2014. " I’ll tell you this, as President, I will instruct the Department of Education to end Common Core on day one," Cruz said last week at the South Carolina Tea Party convention.
