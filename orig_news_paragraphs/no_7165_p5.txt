Ironically, it may have been Governor Jeb Bush who was the most conservative, the most affable and the most temperamentally suited to be president and had he won in 1994, things might have been radically different. Somehow, I doubt Jeb will run again in four years if the Republicans fail to wrest the White House from the Democrats although he will still be younger than Ronald Reagan was in 1980 if he chooses to do so. Meanwhile, Politico has been running the same old tired clichés about Bush’s now lifeless campaign such as "running on fumes" and other unimaginative phrases. They don’t see the historical significance in Bush’s unsuccessful effort.
