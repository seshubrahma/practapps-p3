The University of Texas at Arlington president told students they cannot become a sanctuary campus â€”  for now. ["The answer right now is no," said   President Vistasp Karbhari on Wednesday during "Pizza with the President," a regularly scheduled lunchtime gathering where the top admin serves free pizza and the student body tackle issues.   Karbhari explained their campus is a public institution and fueled by state and federal dollars. He said it stands to risk losing its funding if the university does not follow all laws, according to student newspaper The Shorthorn.
