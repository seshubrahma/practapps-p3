Referring to the American secretary of state, Mr. Netanyahu added, "As I told John Kerry on Thursday, friends don’t take friends to the Security Council," and he said he was looking forward to working with   Donald J. Trump’’s administration when it takes office next month. The Foreign Ministry summoned ambassadors of countries that had voted in favor of the resolution for personal meetings with ministry officials in Jerusalem, despite the Christmas holiday, which some of those countries celebrate.
