In 1985, his wife of 23 years was having an adulterous affair. She ran off with the other man and took all of Cliffordâ€™s money with her. His daughters found him so upset and depressed, banging his head on the floor, that they called the authorities, fearing he might harm himself.   Tyler was taken before a Michigan judge, who ruled there was sufficient reason to be concerned about the distraught man to commit him to a facility for psychiatric evaluation.
