Before joining Congress, Pompeo graduated first in his class from the US Military Academy at West Point. Pompeo was a classmate of Sen. Ted Cruzâ€™s at Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review    although he declined to support Cruz in the Republican primaries. The selection of Pompeo rounds out a trio of national security picks Trump has made    including Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn for national security advisor that were announced Friday.   Pompeo had considered running against Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran in the Senate Republican primary this year, but the Senate Republicans scrambled to prevent that.
