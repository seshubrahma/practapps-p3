Commentary from Mel Robbins, This debate wonâ€™t change a thing. ..there are two types of voters in this election those that vote on facts and those that vote on feel.   I highly doubt this debate is going to sway anyone from the feel to the fact or the fact to the feel camp. Mel Robbins is a CNN legal analyst.
