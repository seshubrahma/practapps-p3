Under the 2012 program, roughly 750, 000 illegal aliens have been given work permits to compete against young Americans for jobs, and also to force down Americans’ wages. During the campaign, Trump promised he would stop that program immediately. The new memos also do not reduce the annual inflow of one million legal immigrants. The new rules also do not address Obama’s expansion of the   programs which have increased the annual inflow of   and   contract workers to roughly one million per year.
