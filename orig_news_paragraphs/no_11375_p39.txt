Pay the landlord, pay the shop, Keep on working as long as you’re able, Keep on working till you drop, Or it’s back to the crumbs off the table, You’ve got to pay your way, At the end of the day! And they continue, There’s a hunger in the land, There’s a reckoning still to be reckoned and, There’s gonna be hell to pay,
