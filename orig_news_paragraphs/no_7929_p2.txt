The musical has attracted many politicians to the show, including President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Vice   Mike Pence. The cast in a recent performance of the show gave Pence an   lecture about how a "diverse America" is "alarmed and anxious" about the upcoming Trump administration. Pence said that he was not offended by the castâ€™s message, but   Donald Trump called on the cast to apologize to Pence after the lecture and Trump supporters immediately called for a boycott of the show on social media.
