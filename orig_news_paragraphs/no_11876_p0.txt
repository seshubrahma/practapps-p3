After a mob of protesters assaulted a woman wearing a Trump campaign jersey as police stood by doing nothing at a Donald Trump rally in San Jose, the makers of the jersey she wore during the attack are looking to contact her. [The company is teaming up with the two members of a famed security team that Obama officials prevented from responding to the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, to honor the woman assaulted by Mexican activists and   protesters.   The young woman, identified as San Jose resident Rachel Casey, was physically attacked by liberal   forces outside a Trump rally early in June. Video of the harrowing incident shows the lone Trump supporter surrounded by a sea of   prone,   rioters and Mexican activists who threw food and eggs at the frightened woman.
