I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election. " We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election," the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American "political processes" or public opinion.
