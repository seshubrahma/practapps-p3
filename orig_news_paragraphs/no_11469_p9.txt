His best targets are in the Los Angeles and Inland Empire regions, where he has been polling well. To win a large enough majority to secure the nomination outright, Trump will have to win all of the "Safe Trump," "Leans Trump," and " " seats, and win several of the "Leans Cruz" seats, while denying Kasich victories in the Bay Area.

A. and Orange County, where he might hope to slip past the frontrunners by presenting himself as an alternative.
