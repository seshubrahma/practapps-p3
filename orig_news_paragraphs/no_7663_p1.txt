The bulk of Clinton’s speech was a confused, incoherent muddle of talking points, at times contradictory. For example, she mocked Trump for calling the military a "disaster"  —    by which he meant the poor condition of the armed forces  —   and then called for the U. S. to "modernize" the military, effectively conceding Trump’s point. At times, Clinton seemed to be arguing for a third term for President Barack Obama, touting his supposed accomplishments in foreign policy, including the Iran deal.
