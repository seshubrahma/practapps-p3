US lawmakers want to ban American tourists from North Korea, Critical of Obama administration, Fred Warmbier appeared critical of the Obama administration’s handling of Otto’s detention, saying the family heeded the US government’s initial advice to take a low profile "without result."   They kept quiet "on the false premise that (North Korea) would treat Otto fairly and let him go," he said. He said he and his wife, Cindy, decided this year that the "time for strategic patience was over," and so they did media interviews and traveled to Washington to meet the State Department’s special representative for North Korean policy, Joseph Yun. Yun met in May with North Korean representatives in Norway, and the North Koreans agreed that Swedish representatives would be allowed to visit Otto Warmbier and three other US detainees, a senior State Department official said on condition of anonymity this week.
