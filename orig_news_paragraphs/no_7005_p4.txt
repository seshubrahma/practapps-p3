DOJ leads legal investigations, not the FBI. Only DOJ can empanel a grand jury, ask a court for discovery, or initiate a prosecution. FBI investigators answer to the prosecutors at DOJ. Comey was never in charge of any investigation in the absence of the attorney general, his role is filled by the acting attorney general: first Boente, now Rosenstein.
