This is one of the strongest distinctions between me and the other candidates in this race.   The Congress, apparently under the magical spell of donors, gave massive new powers to a President who has repeatedly abused his authority.   The other candidates in this race actually fought on Obamaâ€™s side to give him more power to abuse. As for creating a new international commission with authority over United States trade policy I am, again, steadfastly opposed.
