Mr. Trump has vowed to speed up growth, and to cut regulations to stimulate job growth. He headed to Detroit to announce a rollback of fuel economy standards that he says hurt the U. S. auto industry. The presidentâ€™s first budget will be released Thursday. A blueprint to be released by the White House calls for deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and popular domestic programs.
