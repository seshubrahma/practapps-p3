The Goldman report understates the total number of     contract workers in the United States by downplaying several additional visa programs that are similar to the   program. In contrast, the EPI report shows that these additional visa programs keep an extra population of roughly 450, 000 skilled   workers in the United States. For example, the EPI study says the J visa delivers roughly 56, 000 professionals, the Optional Practical Training program employs almost 140, 000 graduates, the   visas supply another 50, 000 professionals, and the L visas allow 350, 000   or   foreign company employees to work in the United States. The Goldman report also shows —  but does not count —  the annual inflow of   workers via the L, B and O visa programs.
