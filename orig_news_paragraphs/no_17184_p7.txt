Perhaps soon thereafter Trump can hold a press conference    something he has not done since July    and offer a heartfelt apology to the disabled community for mocking the physical appearance of journalist Serge Kovaleski, a man who suffers from a chronic condition that limits the movement of his arms.

And if Trump really wants to try to build goodwill, he should make a speech apologizing to the women of America. After all Trump not only bragged about sexually assaulting women in the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape, he mocked Carly Fiorina’s face and, worse, he publicly shamed the 11 women who accused him of sexual misconduct by calling them all liars.
