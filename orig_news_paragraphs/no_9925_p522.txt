Cruz Is Like a ‘Soft, Weak Little Baby’ Via Breitbart TV. 6:05: Per AP, Cruz is pushing the Reagan comparison very hard: Republican Ted Cruz says he’s facing the same sort of opposition from the Washington establishment that tried to take Ronald Reagan out before he unseated Jimmy Carter. Cruz is campaigning on Nevada’s caucus day Tuesday with Texas Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the grandson of Sen. Paul Laxalt, one of Reagan’s best friends. Laxalt introduced Cruz to a crowd of about 400 at an outdoor park in rural Minden during the second of four campaign stops hours before Republicans start to cast their votes.
