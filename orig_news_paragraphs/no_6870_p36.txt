Those predictions turned out to be very far off the mark. Prices paid for food purchased for American households declined in 2016, falling 1. 3 percent below 2015 levels. It was the first annual decline in supermarket prices since 1967, according to the Department of Agriculture. The price of fresh fruit, arguably the most affected by temporary farm labor, rose 2. 2 percent, just about equal to the 2. 1 rise recorded in the Consumer Price Index.
