In September the College Republicans struck back with another Trump wall message.   Of course it was quickly covered over, but free speech isnâ€™t that easy to shut down anymore. My personal response to President McDavis, and the liberal professors and administrations of every university in America is simple: Donald Trump won, bitches!   And young conservatives are ready to fight AND WIN the culture war for free speech on campus.
