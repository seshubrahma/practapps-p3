I’m going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, which affects   of the women, who are the ones receiving the minimum wage, protecting a woman’s right to make the most personal health care decisions. That’s why I’m so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I’m going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports. So, there are very clear distinctions. He can say whatever he wants to about me.
