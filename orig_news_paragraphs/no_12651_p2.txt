To further stress how important each vote is, Obama highlighted how, in 2008, her husband won by only an average of two votes per precincts in North Carolina. In addition to warning people not to stay home because they are frustrated, Obama relentlessly pounded the young audience to make sure they are registered to vote.   Throughout her speech, Obama never mentioned Trump by name, but made it abundantly clear who her jabs were directed at. She repeatedly attacked Trumpâ€™s ability to lead due to his lack of experience, maturity, temperament, and consistency, stating that the long election process is a way for voters to get to know the candidates.
