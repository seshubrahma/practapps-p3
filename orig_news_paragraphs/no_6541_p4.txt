Superintendent Dyer later confirmed that the teacher, Susan Parsons, a   veteran of the school district, was put on suspension with pay while the district decided what else it might do about the incident. On Monday, parent Joseph Berardo was very critical of the school’s act of censorship and demanded that Wall High School pay to have all the books reprinted at the district’s expense as a "teaching moment" about students’ First Amendment rights. " I want a letter from the administration explaining why the yearbooks are being reissued, and it should be used as a teaching moment related to the First Amendment in civil discourse," Mr. Berardo said, according to the New York Post.
