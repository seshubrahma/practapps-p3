Chicago (CNN) Mark Kirk, one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans in the country, is betting that he can survive a tough election season by taking on Donald Trump. The Illinois senator became the first Republican last month to release an   television ad, which said his party’s presumptive nominee "is not fit to be commander in chief."    The   spot, running in the Chicago market, outlines Kirk’s efforts to present himself to voters in his   state as more moderate than his fellow Republicans in Washington.
