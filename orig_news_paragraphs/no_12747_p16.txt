Gone is the nude Britney being closely gyrated on for a full three seconds she has been replaced by men debasing themselves for her and her friends ’ amusement. (It’s unlikely to be a coincidence that so many of her "friends" in the video aren’t white.) Rumours are floating around now that RCA pulled the original for being "too racy," as though that has ever before been a problem for the music executives who put out Britney Spears records.
