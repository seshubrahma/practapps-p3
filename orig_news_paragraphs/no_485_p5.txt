But some Republicans are worried about a political backlash if they repeal the law without an adequate replacement  —   potentially throwing millions of people off their insurance   —   and have urged a more methodical approach. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, recently proposed repairing parts of the health care law ahead of scrapping the whole package. Mr. Trump said last month that he wanted to present a replacement soon after the Senate confirmed his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia.
