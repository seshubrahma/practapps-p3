The poll, conducted Saturday through Tuesday with a 3. 5 percent margin of error, is the first to show Kasich with a lead since August. While it is the only recent poll to show Kasich leading in Ohio, it is   with current polling in the race. The RealClearPolitics average of polls currently shows Trump with a very slim 2. 5 point edge in the Buckeye State. Given Trump’s tendency to generally underperform his polling, and the   advantages that Kasich has as the state’s governor, a tight race for Ohio’s delegates is to be expected.
