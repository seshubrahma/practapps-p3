In a Twitter spat in February, Trump said that Cuban "was not smart enough to run for president" after Cuban urged business leaders to be an "American citizen first" when negotiating with Trump as well saying he did not think that Donald Trump would last all four years of his presidential term. I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me   but I wasn’t interested in taking all of his calls. He’s not smart enough to run for president!
