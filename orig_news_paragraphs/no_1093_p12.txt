Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the announcement an effort to "bully" immigrant families. " It’s simply outrageous that the Trump administration and their ICE agents are putting politics and scapegoating of immigrants ahead of public safety and the ability of local communities to decide how best to keep their communities safe," said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice Education Fund. Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, called Mr. Trump’s approach "draconian. "
