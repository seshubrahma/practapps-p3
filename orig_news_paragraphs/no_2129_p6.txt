Mr. Trump has said he will nominate an American ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, who has rejected the idea of a   solution   —   a key to the plan Mr. Kerry will define on Wednesday and a concept that President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton also embraced   —   and who has helped finance the new settlements that the United Nations condemned. Mr. Clinton gave a similar speech at the end of his presidency, just after the collapse of negotiations at Camp David.
