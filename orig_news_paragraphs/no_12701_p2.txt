Liz Garbus (What Happened, Miss Simone?) Marshall Curry (Point and Shoot) and Roger Ross Williams (God Loves Uganda) have partnered with the Local Voices super PAC to produce   campaign ads, with the first spot set to air Wednesday in Butler County, Ohio, according to Variety.   The effort by Local Voices  —   a Democratic PAC that ran a similar advertising campaign supporting President Obama in the 2012 race   —   comes as Trump and Clinton prepare to flood airwaves across the country with ads just two months out from Election Day.
