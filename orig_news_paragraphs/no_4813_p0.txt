German cities held their annual Rose Monday float parades today, with many mocking U. S. President Donald Trump, Brexit, and European populist leaders. [The carnival celebrations in Germany are one of the biggest holidays of the year and a part of the celebrations are a float parade on Rosenmontag or Rose Monday.   From Cologne to Dusseldorf the major theme of the float parades this year was U. S. President Trump, whom they depicted performing sex acts with the Statue of Liberty, and being decapitated by a guillotine. In Dusseldorf, President Trump was shown performing a sex act on the statue of liberty, a criticism by the satirist that he was "screwing liberty" because of his travel ban against countries know to either sponsor terrorism or harbour large radical Islamic extremist elements.
