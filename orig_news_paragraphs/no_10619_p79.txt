For many Muslims, the nonsense that is "Islamic science," which holds that the earth is   and that the stars are missiles created by Allah to throw at devils, is the only science they need.   Or consider the ascendant art of "Islamic creationism," a batty spin on creationist theories forged in Turkey but funded by Saudi Arabia. Scientific inquiry is virtually dead in the Islamic world. Arab nations stand near the bottom of every measure of human development.
