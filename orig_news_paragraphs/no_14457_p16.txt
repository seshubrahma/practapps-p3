Latin American Montessori Bilingual Public Charter School in Northwest DC will be closed Thursday for students and teachers participating in the protest, the school confirmed.   DC Public Schools Chief John Davis emailed principals expressing respect for protests but insisting teachers and students were expected to be in class.   " DCPS schools are and will continue to be safe places for all students and all people in our communities, regardless of immigration status, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression," Davis wrote.
