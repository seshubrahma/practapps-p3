Trumpâ€™s value to conservatism is not what he believes, but what his election would do, regardless of his own policies. For one thing, as I have argued before, the fact that there is such strong conservative opposition to Trump, as well as a fervent desire among establishment Republicans to be seen opposing him (even if they do say they prefer him to Cruz) means that if he won, Congress might finally stand up to the executive branch. That is why the possible excesses of a Trump presidency are less fearsome than many think. Much of what he says he wants to do may be unwise (e. g. 45% tariffs on China) or unconstitutional (e. g. broad surveillance of mosques).
