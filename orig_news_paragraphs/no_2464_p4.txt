Some analysts say the economic impact of a collapse in the waterfront property market could surpass that of the bursting   and real estate bubbles of 2000 and 2008. The fallout would be felt by property owners, developers, real estate lenders and the financial institutions that bundle and resell mortgages. Over the past five years, home sales in   areas grew about 25 percent less quickly than in counties that do not typically flood, according to    data from Attom Data Solutions, the parent company of RealtyTrac. Many coastal residents are rethinking their investments and heading for safer ground.
