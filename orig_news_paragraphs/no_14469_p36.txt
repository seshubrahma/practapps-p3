Immigration must be better managed, Sean Linnane, 48, who said he’s a security consultant who lives near Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, tweeted that he is an immigrant who went to work on Thursday. Linnane, who said he’s an American citizen who was born in Australia and raised in Southeast Asia, said he understands Thursday ’s actions were part of a larger political statement. He said he has "no problem with all the people coming across the southern border" but believes immigrants should be more stringently vetted at the border.
