The MIT Technology Review believes the system is designed to detect particular words and phrases in a sentence that may be deemed offensive but does not account for the meaning behind these words. In an example, the word "rape" scored a toxicity rating as high as 77 percent when detected by the program, but a statement such as "rape is a horrible crime" actually rated higher at 81 percent. Curse words receive similar treatment: "I fucking love this" was rated at a 94 percent on the toxicity scale, which is supposed to indicate if a comment is "rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable. "
