Trump chose the governor to lead the transition team months ago, and he’s been a key political adviser for the billionaire businessman.. Aides say they talk regularly on the phone and Christie has acted as a liaison between fellow Republican governors and Trump, both on the trail and at Trump Tower in New York.
