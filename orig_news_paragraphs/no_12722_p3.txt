The main group organizing the protest was the Puente Human Rights Movement, an Arizona group which has spent years protesting Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Joining Puente in the Arizona   protests were representatives from the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, aka MALDEF, in addition to groups La Raza and LULAC. Black Lives Matter cofounder Opal Tometi is a board member of Puente. Tometi is also the executive director of a group called Black Alliance for Just Immigration.
