Hawaii is a living reminder that they are dead wrong. Hawaii    the Aloha state    is built on the strength of its multicultural society, from our indigenous Native Hawaiian people to the many immigrants that followed. It is the home to the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion, segregated   units that fought prejudice at home and served the United States during World War II.   Hawaii was the first state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, and itâ€™s the birthplace of my friend Patsy Mink who authored Title IX, which brought equal education opportunities to girls and women nationwide.
