Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Wednesday that he saw no contradiction there. The two objectives  —   ensuring the solvency of Social Security and increasing benefits   —   are "not at all inconsistent" if they are discussed in the context of "a broader conversation" about taxes and benefits, he said. The report predicts that Social Security will provide a modest    adjustment, increasing benefits by   of 1 percent next year.
