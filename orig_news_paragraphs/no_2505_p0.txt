WASHINGTON   â€”   Thirty years as a union boss in Indiana have given Chuck Jones a thick skin. But even threats to shoot him or burn his house down did not quite prepare him for becoming the target of a verbal takedown by the next president of the United States. In what one Republican strategist described as "cyberbullying,"   Donald J. Trump derided Mr. Jones on Twitter, accusing him of doing "a terrible job representing workers" and blaming him for the decisions by companies that ship American jobs overseas.
