A couple of notes before we move on. You may be wondering why I exempted the SCAQMD in my offer of a wager. The SCAQMD encompasses the Los Angeles area, which is basically the metropolitan area that God Created to Make Ozone. Ozone, aka "smog," is a criteria air pollutant that is primarily generated in urban areas during hot, relatively windless days.
