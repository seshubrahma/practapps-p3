Ground was broken in February 2012.   The Smithsonian says the museum is the only one in the US exclusively focused on   life, history and culture, but organizers say it is also meant to capture the story of all Americans. One of those who have worked for years to see this museum come to life is educator and historian Lonnie Bunch, founding director for the museum.   Asked what does it mean to him to see it finally open, he said, "It means that finally the   story on the National Mall is accessible to everybody, and in many ways it means that my ancestors are smiling," he told CNN.
