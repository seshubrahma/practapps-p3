" I think Trump and Brexit were a kind of electric shock, and something changed," said Cécile Daumas, the editor of the Ideas section of the French   daily Libération. She pointed to "A World History of France," by the medieval historian Patrick Boucheron, which seeks to put French history in a broader context and argues that the country has absorbed immigrants for centuries. The challenge is that "the partisans of decline have formed a vocabulary, a way of speaking that’s accessible to the broader public," Ms. Daumas said.
