A white board in one of the government offices has #MAGA —  the Twitter hashtag for the "Make America Great Again" campaign slogan —  scribbled on it, while the official inaugural seal of the incoming president and vice president is on each of the doors. Make America Great hats line desks inside the communications office, as well.       In addition to the Trump rally photo spreads showing thousands of his supporters, the hallway is adorned with a giant ceramic   elephant —  complete with red legs and white stars inside its blue body.
