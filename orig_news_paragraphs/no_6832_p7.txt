Plants and factories are starting to move back into the United States and bigly Ford, General Motors, so many. I make this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit, a little bit different and get along better if that’s possible.
