There are obvious parallels between the    meeting and the 2013 summit meeting at Sunnylands in California, Walter Annenbergâ€™s   estate, where President Barack Obama and Mr. Xi got acquainted over long walks in the desert landscape and a dinner of grilled porterhouse steaks and cherry pie. But there are important differences, too. By the time Mr. Obama met with Mr. Xi in California, they had already met once before, when Mr. Xi was vice president. Mr. Xi held extensive meetings with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. traveling with him around the United States.
