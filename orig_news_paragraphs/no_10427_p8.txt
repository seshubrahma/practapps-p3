Firefighters, police officers and port authority workers rushed into danger, into smoke, into fire to save the lives of people they had never met   â€”  performing their sacred duties until their last moments on Earth. Heroes like Father Mychal Judge who tended to the dead and dying until he too joined them in Heaven. These were the finest and bravest and toughest people that could ever grace a city.
