The arrest is the latest security incident to take place near the White House in recent days. On Saturday, a man jumped over a bicycle rack in front of the presidential mansion, briefly putting the complex into an escalated security posture, two law enforcement officials told CNN. And on March 10, an intruder carrying a backpack with mace and a letter for the President jumped the White House fence and was able to stay on the grounds for more than 15 minutes.
