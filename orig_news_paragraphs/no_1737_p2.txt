The Democratic National Committee  —   in debt and underfinanced a year ago   —   has poured nearly $30 million into these key states through the beginning of September. The funding was powered by a surge of   contributions raised by Mrs. Clinton from the likes of James Cameron, the Hollywood director, and George Soros, the retired hedge fund manager, as well as several members of the billionaire Pritzker family. The Republican National Committee has provided the states with just $11 million, limited by Donald J. Trump’s difficulties in persuading the traditional Republican   base to invest in his campaign.
