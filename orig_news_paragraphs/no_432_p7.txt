Farmworker wages "have gone up significantly," Mr. Martin said, and some workers have the benefit of voluntary agreements that growers sometimes enter with their suppliers. The average hourly wage of farmworkers in California is around $12, he said, above the state â€™s current minimum wage of $10. Mr. Martin, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Davis, says estimates on unionization rates among farmworkers in California are not very reliable because there are no government requirements to report them.
