Look, Donald Trump is a demagogue. He is a bigot, and he has nothing to say about the important issues facing our country. The fact that you have a candidate for president of the United States of America in 2016 who scapegoats and insults Mexicans and Latinos and Muslims and women and veterans and    this is not somebody who should be president of the United States.
