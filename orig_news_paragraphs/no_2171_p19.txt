If you put "don’t know" or "other" as an option, a lot of people are going to take it. But if you don’t include it, you have a problem: What will the truly undecided voters do? They could provide an unreliable answer or leave the survey. If you provide them the option to "skip," they might skip through the whole questionnaire.
