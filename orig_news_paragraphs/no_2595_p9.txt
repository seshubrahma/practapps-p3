Mr. Trump also used his speech Monday to outline his   plan to provide what he described as quality, timely care for military veterans. He promised to increase the number of mental health workers available to veterans and to provide veterans with more treatment options, either through the Department of Veterans Affairs or through the private sector, paid for by the government. With Mr. Christie’s performance on Monday appearing like a   audition for the   slot, Mr. Trump was set to appear on Tuesday with another, more likely contender: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a conservative former congressman who has risen quickly in the estimation of the Trump campaign. Republicans in Washington were initially skeptical that Mr. Pence, a former talk radio host, would sign on as Mr. Trump’s running mate.
