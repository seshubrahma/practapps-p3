 (CNN) Ukrainian prosecutors want to question Paul Manafort in connection with a corruption investigation and have made repeated requests for assistance from US authorities, CNN has learned. Prosecutors in Kiev said they have made seven separate appeals over the past two years for help in questioning President Donald Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager, including letters to FBI Director James Comey and US Justice Department officials. Ukrainian officials said the US has not responded to those requests.
