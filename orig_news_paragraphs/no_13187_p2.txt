It has been widely reported that the $400 million was part of a dispute that arose after Iran in the late 1970s had purchased U. S. fighter jets while Tehran was still an American ally. After the country turned into an enemy in 1979, the U. S. halted delivery of the military equipment, thus triggering an international case in which Iran was asking The Hague arbitrators for $10 billion. Following years of negotiations, the Obama administration finally agreed to settle the case for $1. 7 billion   â€”   the initial $400 million plus another $1. 3 billion in interest.
