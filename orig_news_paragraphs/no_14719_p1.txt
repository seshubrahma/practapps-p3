Both parties made clear that Trump’s allegation    which the White House has not offered any evidence to support, and which Obama administration officials emphatically deny    won’t be dropped anytime soon, as even GOP lawmakers who have backed Trump said they’d investigate.

Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said his committee would look into whether the federal government was conducting wiretapping of campaign officials as part of the panel ’s investigation into Russian meddling in the US election.
