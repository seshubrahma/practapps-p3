Washington (CNN) Rep. Mike Bost said Thursday he regretted invoking a racially insensitive term and reference to explain why he would not hold   town hall events. The Illinois Republicanâ€™s comments were reported by The Southern Illinoisan, whose editorial board met with him last week. They discussed his lack of   town hall events, and he said such events would be an unproductive use of his time and used the derogatory term "Orientals" in the process.
