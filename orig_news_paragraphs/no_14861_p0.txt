 (CNN) The Russian bank that had an "odd" internet link to the Trump Organization during the presidential campaign is now claiming that U. S.  hackers have recently launched cyberattacks to try to frame the bank. Cybersecurity experts say this hack is a common type of prank. And itâ€™s not directly related to activity discovered last year between the computer servers of Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization.
