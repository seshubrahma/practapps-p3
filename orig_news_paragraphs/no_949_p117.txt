The April 6 organizer, a skinny    with square   glasses, a white Tour de France shirt, a thin beard and a mop of curly black hair, was smoking furiously at a round table in the center of the large room. He insisted on being quoted anonymously, only to change his mind, saying, "I don’t want anyone who reads this to feel it’s a fabrication," before anxiously changing his mind again. He recounted how plainclothes security men had jumped out of five cars at the April demonstration, punched and   him, then pushed him inside one of the vehicles and blindfolded him on the way to the security headquarters. He spent the next five months in pretrial detention, before a judge ordered his strictly supervised release.
