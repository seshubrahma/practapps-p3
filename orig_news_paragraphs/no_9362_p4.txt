As expected, a greater number of Trump supporters thought that Mexicans are a threat ( ~71% vs. 41% of Clinton supporters). But, then I asked if respondents believe that Americans who immigrate to Mexico threaten Mexican values. That is, if Trump supporters are "racist," a similar percent should believe that Americans enhance Mexico as believe Mexicans threaten American values, since racism presumes that some cultures are better than others. Yet, 85% of our small sample of Trump supporters said that Americans threaten Mexican values (compared to 58% of Clinton supporters).
