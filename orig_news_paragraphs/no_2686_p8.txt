The   polls in Florida appear to have assumed a lower level of Hispanic turnout. The final   poll  in Florida suggested that the state’s electorate would be 67 percent white, by registration, and 14 percent Hispanic   —   just two percentage points higher than the 12 percent of 2012. A new Quinnipiac poll today had Mrs. Clinton ahead by one point in the state, and put Hispanic voters at 16 percent of the electorate.
