Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, the researchers found that 14 percent of noncitizens who responded to the survey in 2008 and 2010 said they were registered to vote. The problem is that the study relied on flawed data and was roundly criticized by political scientists who said that a more careful examination of the data revealed no evidence that noncitizens had voted in recent elections. The second study, conducted in 2012 by the Pew Center on the States, found that 24 million voter registrations were no longer valid or "significantly inaccurate" that more than 1. 8 million dead people were still listed on the voter rolls and that almost three million were registered in multiple states, probably because they had moved from one state to another. The study did not find evidence that those errors led to voter fraud, however, simply that they presented avoidable costs and inefficiencies in the electoral process.
