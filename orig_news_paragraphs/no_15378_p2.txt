When The New York Times published a   analysis of the people outside the White House whom Trump contacts for advice, Murdoch was the first one listed. He and Trump speak by phone almost every day, according to the Times.    "The president’s relationship with Mr. Murdoch is deeper and more enduring than most in his life, and the two commiserate and plot strategy in their phone calls, according to people close to both," the paper said.   The connections extend to family: Until recently, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, was one of five people overseeing a nearly  $  trust fund for Murdoch’s daughters from a previous marriage.
