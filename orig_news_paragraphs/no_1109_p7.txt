In addition to the investment in the Wayne assembly plant, Ford said Tuesday that it would spend $150 million to add or retain 130 jobs at a Michigan engine plant, and invest $200 million on an advanced data center to support the development of autonomous and electrified vehicles. He said the investments were not discussed with Mr. Trump when he met with auto executives on March 15 in the Detroit area, vowing to reduce government regulations to promote job growth. " It wasnâ€™t part of that conversation," Mr. Hinrichs said, noting that Ford has been steadily expanding its domestic manufacturing operations since the last recession.
