Only days before the American presidential election, Pemex’s chief executive, José Antonio González Anaya, presented a timetable of projects he expected to offer to potential partners and promised to begin returning the national oil company to solvency. He and the finance minister met with investors in New York this month to argue that Mexico’s economy was solid and that "the oil sector will continue to be an engine of national economic growth," according to a joint statement from Pemex and the Finance Ministry. The pair followed up with a visit to London. Mr. Peña Nieto has pushed through other overhauls, including changes in education, telecommunications, taxes, electricity and finance, but they have yet to generate significant economic growth.
