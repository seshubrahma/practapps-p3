Each of the warring factions quickly threw themselves into the drama.   Just about three hours after talks started on Monday, during a tea break, the head of the Syrian government delegation suddenly marched into the lobby. Dozens of media crews immediately swarmed Bashar   who also is Syriaâ€™s UN ambassador. Jaafari called the opposition "the delegation that represents the armed terrorist groups," and accused them of of using water as a weapon of war in the fight for the strategic area of Wadi Bardi, west of Damascus.
