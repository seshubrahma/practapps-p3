Flynn submitted the initial disclosures in   just days before he resigned from his post after it became public that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. His resignation came amid federal probes into allegations that Trump associates colluded with Russian operatives to interfere in the US election. The initial disclosures left out that Flynn received money from Russia’s   television network, RT, for a speech in Moscow in December 2015 and from air cargo company   Airlines and cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc. for speaking engagements in the United States.
