Donald Trump and Mike Pence have stopped at a Baptist church in a heavily damaged portion of East Baton Rouge Parish. The Republican candidates met a group of volunteers who have been cooking meals for flood victims and helping the elderly gut their homes. Trump asked questions about the extent of the damage and thanked volunteers for their efforts. The candidate also met with Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.
