 (CNN) The Supreme Court on Monday sent a case involving a transgender high school student back to a lower court, a temporary setback for the student. Monday’s announcement vacates a lower court’s decision in the case of Gavin Grimm, a Virginia student who is seeking to use school bathrooms that align with his gender identity. Monday’s decision means the case will go back to a court of appeals and likely removes the possibility that the Supreme Court will hear it this term.
