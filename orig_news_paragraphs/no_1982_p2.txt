"   advocates consider   housing the latest major front in the   campaign to curb exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. The rule covering public housing forbids cigarettes, cigars, pipes and hookahs (or water pipes)  —   but not electronic cigarettes   —   from being smoked in all living units, indoor common areas, administrative offices and all outdoor areas within 25 feet of housing and office buildings. Housing agencies that already ban smoking said they enforced their policies through warnings and fines coupled with education, including counseling and   aids like nicotine patches.
