In the   since that Monday evening just after Thanksgiving, countless other parties have evoked, interpreted or outright copied Capoteâ€™s ball. " There are probably more Black and White Balls at this point than Civil War " Ms. Davis said. Most memorably, perhaps, the   mogul Sean Combs used the party as a template for a   wingding he tossed for himself in 1998, reportedly spending more than $500, 000 to furnish Cipriani with a translucent monogrammed dance floor and Plexiglas   booths for the amusement of a collection of celebrities, among them Martha Stewart, Ronald Perelman, Sarah Ferguson and Donald J. Trump.
