Apparently a lot of people who know nothing about Islam are now experts on Islam and sharia, telling Muslims what their religion actually says," tweeted Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.   While Sharia is often defined as "Islamic law," there is no single book of jurisprudence followed by all 1. 6 billion Muslims. In fact, there are varying interpretations and legal opinions    called fatwas    most of which concern rituals, family matters and personal spirituality. In that way, Sharia is similar to Jewish law, and Israel is among the countries that allow Sharia courts, noted The Atlanticâ€™s Jeffrey Goldberg.
