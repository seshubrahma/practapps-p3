has Trump’s team emboldened and Clinton’s team rushing to the upper midwest to play defense. Trump’s team also sees a potential opportunity in Minnesota, where Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook went this weekend to the Minnesota State Fair to play defense in a state Republicans haven’t won since Richard Nixon’s reelection in 1972. That Mook would spend valuable time in Minnesota is telling about how the Clinton campaign, while publicly bold and strengthened by a permanent political class backing media establishment that has essentially written Trump off, is telling. Michigan’s 16 electoral votes, and Pennsylvania’s 20 would be huge pickups for Trump over Clinton if he can get them.
