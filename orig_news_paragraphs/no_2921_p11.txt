Mr. Trump, who has proposed changing libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations, could abandon the   internal restraints and invoke the   court precedent to adopt more aggressive policies in leak investigations. Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor who is a friend and adviser to Mr. Obama, defended the presidentâ€™s approach. He said that after 2010, when Republicans took over the House, internal executive branch restraints were the only option because Congress was not going to enact legislation limiting national security powers. He also said that even if Mr. Obama had gotten rid of indefinite detention or military tribunals, Mr. Trump could have brought them back.
