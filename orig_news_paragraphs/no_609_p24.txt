What many Democrats on the Hill  —   "probably more than half of our caucus," McDermott says  —   preferred was a   system, in which health care costs are borne not by insurers but instead by a single fund, typically originating from taxpayers, as Medicare does. But half of the Democratic caucus wasn’t enough for a bill to pass the House, much less the Senate. When a congressional majority failed to materialize for a hybrid measure, known as the "public option," in which consumers would be allowed to choose among   insurance plans as well as private ones, Democrats were left with the individual mandate. The final   legislative package would aim to "increase the quality, availability and affordability of private and public health insurance to over 44 million uninsured Americans," as the administration put it.
