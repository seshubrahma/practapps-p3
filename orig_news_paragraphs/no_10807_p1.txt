And it’s leaving the door open to possibly supporting Hillary Clinton. [Breitbart News has learned that the Kochs’ "secret bank" Freedom Partners is staying out of the 2016 election, just four years after it spent big, including for the   cause. Freedom Partners, based in Arlington, Virginia, would not rule out supporting Clinton, though the group made clear that they are not currently supporting her and have seen "no indication" that she would qualify for their support, absent a massive repudiation of her past support for the   Bank and runaway government spending.   Billionaire   benefactor Charles Koch said in an ABC News interview that Hillary Clinton could "possibly" be a better candidate for his interests than either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz.
