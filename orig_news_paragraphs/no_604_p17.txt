I have never encountered any gun violence personally in Chicago, where I live. But I have read articles about someone living in my neighborhood, driving a route that I drive all the time and seeing someone get shot in the head. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage?   I have yet to see realistic violence rendered onstage that didnâ€™t take me out of the experience
