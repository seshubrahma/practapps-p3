In 1927, he was hired as a motorman for the Chicago Surface Lines, a streetcar service later absorbed by the Chicago Transit Authority, which still has Mr. Cawleyâ€™s insurance card on file. He held that job, eventually driving a bus, for more than 40 years. By 1931, records show, he had married Mary Elizabeth Maloney, a teacher and   American whose family hailed from Doonbeg, County Clare. (In 2014, Mr. Trump bought a golf course there.)
