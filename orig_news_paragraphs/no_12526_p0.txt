Thursday on ABC’s "Good Morning America," Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump accused the media of attempting to "poison" the mind of the American voter.   Trump said, "I could just speak for myself that I don’t want to mention a specific act, but so often they’ll say, ‘Oh, Donald Trump said this or he said that, and what I said was fine. If a Democrat had said it, if Hillary had said it, they wouldn’t have even thought about it, but I’ll say something that’s perfect and next day it’s headlines. Donald Trump said this or that.
