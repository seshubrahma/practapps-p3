That is why ACT for America is having a March against Sharia and for Human Rights in cities across the nation on Saturday, June 10, 2017. ACT for America is committed to protecting women and children from Sharia law and its impact on Muslim women and children, including honor killing and Female Genital Mutilation. We are putting faces on the victims of these crimes and exposing aspects of Sharia law which run contrary to basic human rights and are incompatible with our Constitution, and Western values. The choice is clear, stand with victims of this type of barbarism, or stand with true hate groups like the SPLC, who work tirelessly to enable such murders as Tinaâ€™s, by smearing those speaking out, in the name of the   hatred that consumes them.
