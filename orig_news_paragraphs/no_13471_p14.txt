THE PERRY COUNTY VOTER FRAUD CASE, To this day, one of the left’s central allegations against Sessions stems from his involvement in prosecuting a 1985 voter fraud case in which three black defendants were accused of having altered the absentee ballots of black voters in order to thwart the election of black Democratic candidates, whom the defendants opposed, and instead to help hand the election over to candidates the defendants favored.

S. attorney’s office   —   and Sessions, by extension   —   was accused of having prosecuted the case out of racial motivations.
