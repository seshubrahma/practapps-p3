I come not to bury Jack Hunter, for clearly he’s already six feet under. Nor am I here to suggest that his original ideas and persona had any particular merit or appeal to me. Rather, I’m here to explain why his current ideas aren’t worth serious consideration, and to warn future "Southern Avengers" against following his example. Because while it may be okay to admit you got it wrong, that’s not the same as prostrating yourself before the powers that be in a desperate attempt to curry favour with your oppressors, in defiance of the facts and your conscience.
