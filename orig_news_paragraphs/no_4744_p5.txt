This, according to ICE, is why there was no alert to the NOPD back in 2015 that   was an illegal immigrant when he was arrested and charged for the rape and strangulation of his alleged previous victim. ICE does have a detainer on   now. If for any reason the illegal immigrant is let out of New Orleans officialsâ€™ custody, he will be handed over to ICE for deportation.
