ATLANTIC CITY  —    The Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel is now closed, its windows clouded over by sea salt. Only a faint outline of the gold letters spelling out      remains visible on the exterior of what was once this city’s premier casino. Not far away, the   Trump Marina Hotel Casino was sold at a major loss five years ago and is now known as the Golden Nugget.
