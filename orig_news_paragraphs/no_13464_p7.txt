#PoliceBrutality #AltonSterling #PhilandoCastile https:  .    —   Rev. Jarrett Maupin (@ReverendMaupin) July 9, 2016,   UPDATE 2:06 A. M. ET, Local reporters say that the progressives who organized the Phoenix rally steered the protesters off of the planned protest route, which created this altercation. So it is the protesters who, at their organizers’ behest, agitated the situation.
