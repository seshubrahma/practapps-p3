Because people approaching retirement age are more prone to illness and high health care costs,   insurance is particularly valuable to older workers   â€”   so much so that many studies document that it influences retirement decisions. One study found that workers whose employers offered retiree health benefits were 68 percent more likely to retire early than those who lack   retiree coverage. Another study found a smaller effect, 47 percent.
