The thank you tour begins as Trump puts together his Cabinet, after naming nominees to head the Treasury, Commerce and Transportation departments, part of the huge task of standing up his administration before the inauguration in January. Trump also rebuked critics who have criticized him for nominating billionaire businessman Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary. " The guy knows how to make money, folks," Trump said, before musing on the rest of his cabinet "Greatest killers you’ve ever seen    it’s time."  The rally also provided a preview of the way that Trump will seek to keep his supporters motivated throughout his presidency, in case his agenda is stalled or challenged by establishment Republicans in Washington.
