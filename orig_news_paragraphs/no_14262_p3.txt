Gen. Malcolm Frost said the easement has not yet been approved.   " The assistant secretary for the Army Civil Works will make a decision on the easement once a full review and analysis is completed in accordance with the directive," Frost said in a statement.   That directive refers to President Donald Trumpâ€™s January 24 order, "which directs the acting secretary of the Army to expeditiously review requests for approvals to construct and operate the Dakota Access Pipeline in compliance with the law," Frost said.
