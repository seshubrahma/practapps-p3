" "Until you get the top positions filled, it’s customary not to nominate subordinate positions in those respective departments," he explained.   " But I’d say also this is important: you can’t come into the government with no philosophy and expect to understand immediately the direction you need to take on key issues like the Iran nuclear deal," he continued.
