And by Monday, as partial results of a recount of more than 90, 000 votes that Republicans had demanded in Durham County showed no significant change in the results, Mr. McCrory  —   whose one term was buffeted by nationwide anger over a law he signed that curbed   protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people   —   had little choice but to admit defeat. "Despite continued questions that should be answered regarding the voting process, I personally believe that the majority of our citizens have spoken and we now should do everything we can to support the 75th governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper," Mr. McCrory said in a video statement released on Monday. Mr. Cooper issued a written statement moments after.
