New York (CNN) One month after his upset victory, Donald Trump described the emotional roller coaster ride he experienced on Election Night    and confessed he was prepared to accept defeat    in a lengthy speech Wednesday morning at a private fundraiser in New York City. Two attendees who were in the room described to CNN the  â€™s mood as   as he reveled in his unexpected win. But these sources also said Trump extended olive branches to his past critics, including President Barack Obama, his former rival Hillary Clinton, as well as the "Never Trump" crowd.
