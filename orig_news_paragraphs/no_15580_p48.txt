By Wednesday night, the most significant actor in the potential unraveling of Trump’s presidency would be hired and set to work. At 6 p. m. news broke that Robert Mueller, the respected (and in many quarters, feared) former FBI director under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, had been appointed as special counsel in charge of the investigation into Trump associates and Russia. The man who gave him the job: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. By Rosenstein’s pen, Mueller is now authorized to pick up where Comey, his friend and former colleague, left off.
