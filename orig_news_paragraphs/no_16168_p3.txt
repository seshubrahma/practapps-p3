As the   of the American Competitiveness Alliance    an organization that advocates for modern immigration policy     Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how   workers come to the United States and help our manufacturing and technology fields flourish.

There is overwhelming demand from American companies    both large and small    for educated, skilled foreign workers to fill jobs in computer programming, coding, medicine and information technology.
