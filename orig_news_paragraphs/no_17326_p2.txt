Even before the election, the US intelligence community was "close" to assessing that Russia’s intention was to aid Trump, rather than simply to disrupt the election process, the former senior law enforcement official said. However, there was disagreement    particularly between the intelligence agencies and the FBI    as to how certain this assessment was, multiple officials told CNN. The former senior law enforcement official made clear Monday that assessing the intentions of a foreign power is imprecise by its nature. Moreover, a separate US official explained that the FBI is very conservative in its conclusions and typically doesn’t give any definitive assessment if a conclusion can’t be proven without a doubt.
