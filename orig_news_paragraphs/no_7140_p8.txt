But every piece of evidence could be made up or distorted, and there would be no way to know. In the "nut job" case, the White House has not disputed that Trump made the comment, but it may not be able to explain the context, because doing so would mean releasing more details of a classified conversation that touched on "highly classified" national security matters (as the Post reported on Monday.) In their effort to impugn Trump, the Times and the Post violate the most basic journalistic standards. Publishing parts of a document that you do not possess and cannot verify, and timing the release to cause maximum political damage (right after the president leaves the country) is not investigative journalism.
