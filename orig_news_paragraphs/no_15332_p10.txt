After his uncle’s death, Gaspari said the nursing home contacted him and told him the funeral home "adamantly" refused to provide services after learning through the paperwork that Huskey’s spouse was male, according to the lawsuit. The nursing home told Gaspari the funeral said it did not "deal with their kind," the lawsuit says. Furthermore, the nursing home representative said the body needed to be moved immediately because it did not have a morgue on site.   The news prompted a frantic search for another funeral home with an   crematorium that led the family to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, some 90 miles away.
