National organizers of the March for Life said that while they were hopeful of a large turnout on Friday, they did not have any way to gauge how many would attend. This year’s event will have two major draws: Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, who managed Mr. Trump’s campaign and is now a White House counselor, are scheduled to speak. No president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. Last year, many marchers were deterred by a snowstorm that trapped some buses en route and stranded some marchers in town for days afterward.
