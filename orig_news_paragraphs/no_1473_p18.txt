On the night of the March 1 primaries, Mr. Christie became the subject of internet memes featuring his seemingly vacant expression as he stood at Mr. Trump’s shoulder during his victory speech. In June, Mr. Christie’s staff flatly denied an account in The New Yorker that Mr. Christie had been captured on video fetching fast food for Mr. Trump. Mr. Christie has shrugged off any hard feelings about the mockery he draws on the campaign trail, but he has also recently stepped away from the stump and opted for a more discreet role. Thomas H. Kean, a former New Jersey governor, said Mr. Christie had described himself as deeply involved in Mr. Trump’s activities.
