Though the musical has become a rarer genre for Hollywood, La La Land is still a   film about creativity in L. A. featuring two hugely recognizable stars, while the triumph of a   independent work like Moonlight is a genuinely rare phenomenon come awards season, especially as it focuses on themes of black and queer identity. Still, the balance was somewhat redressed as Moonlight won Best Picture (Drama) with   Barry Jenkins shouting out the    campaign that has helped make the film an unlikely box office success. On the TV side, the Globes largely spread the love between various new shows of 2016. The Crown won Best Drama Series and Best Actress for its star Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth II at the time of her coronation Best Actor in a Drama went to Billy Bob Thornton, who plays a lawyer in the Amazon series Goliath.
