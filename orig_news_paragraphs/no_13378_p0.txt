From Katie Glueck writing in Politico:  Donald Trump invoked the September 11th, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center to tear into Jeb Bush at Saturday night’s debate, saying they were in part a result of George W. Bush’s national security failures. " The World Trade Center came down during your brother’s reign. Remember that," Trump said to the former Florida governor.
