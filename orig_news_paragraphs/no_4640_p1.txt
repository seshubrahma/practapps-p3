After a solid month of insisting that Bannon and his brand of economic nationalism were on the way out of the White House, he remains in place, and the president continues to emphasize the themes that won him the election in November   —   much to the consternation of the Washington   set whose reputation depends upon the presumption that they have an inside line to the inner workings of power in the nation’s capital. The mainstream media spin on Bannon’s loss of influence and relevance has been achieved primarily by glossing over inconsistencies in their own narrative about his role and influence in the White House, and, more insidiously, by introducing into their narrative a total caricature of the "America First" themes whose political resonance they have so badly underestimated.
