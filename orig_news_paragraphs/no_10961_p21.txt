The left is obsessed by white supremacy, which in reality makes up an infinitesimally small number of people. I see two primary motivating factors behind the rise of the alt right. The first is a millennial generation thatâ€™s fed up with identity politics and its hypocrisies. I see   conservatives who have had enough of mainstream politicians ignoring their concerns about immigration and cultural politics.
