The poll finds Clinton widely viewed as having the better temperament for the presidency (56% say so vs. 32% who feel Trump is temperamentally   for the White House) while Trump has picked up some ground over Clinton when voters are asked who is more honest and trustworthy (45% say Trump, 37% Clinton, a near reversal since March). But still, 17% say they see neither candidate as honest and trustworthy.   On the issues that have been the focus of those questions, majorities see flaws in each candidate. More than    voters say Trump’s comments about a Mexican American judge’s handling of a lawsuit against Trump University were inappropriate, and about    say it was inappropriate for him to revoke the press access of news organizations with whose coverage he disagreed.
