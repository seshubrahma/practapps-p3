Instead of the Obamacare subsidies that are tied to income and premiums, the GOP plan provides Americans with refundable tax credits based mainly on age to purchase health insurance. The bill also significantly curtails federal support for Medicaid and allows states to require   adults to work. After 2020, states that expanded Medicaid would no longer receive enhanced federal funding to cover   adults like they did under Obamacare, and states that haven’t expanded would be immediately barred from doing so. However, the GOP bill doesn’t touch some of the most popular pieces of Obamacare, including letting children stay on their parents’ insurance plans until the age of 26 and including protections for people with   conditions.
