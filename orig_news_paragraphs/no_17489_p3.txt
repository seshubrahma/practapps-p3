In this year’s poll, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz just barely edged retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, taking 11. 5 percent to Carson’s 11. 4 percent support, largely unchanged from last year, when Cruz also took 11 percent and Carson took 9 percent support. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush drew 8 percent for a   finish, a respectable showing that indicates conservatives are open to the establishment pick, and willing to overlook his moderate views on education and immigration reform.   Indeed, last year Bush declined to participate in the straw poll, and his aides downplayed his chances in this year’s poll.
