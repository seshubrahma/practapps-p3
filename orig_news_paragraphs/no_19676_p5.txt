As of Friday, that will change, when   a final rule by DHS is announced in the Federal Register. ’ ’    A draft version of the rule,  says, "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is   removing outdated regulations relating to an obsolete special   registration program for certain nonimmigrants. DHS ceased use of   the National Security   Registration system (NSEERS)   program in 2011 after finding that the program was redundant,   captured data manually that was already captured through   automated systems, and no longer provided an increase in security   in light of DHS’s evolving assessment of the threat posed to the   United States by international terrorism.
