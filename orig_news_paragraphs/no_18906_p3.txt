The polling industry will be one victim of the Brexit vote. A few   days before the vote, I met with a pollster who had departed from   the cheap and dirty methods of his peers to perform a much more   costly survey for a major financial firm. His results showed a   comfortable margin for Remain. Ten days later, anyone who heeded   his expensive advice suffered the biggest percentage losses since   the 2008 financial crisis.
