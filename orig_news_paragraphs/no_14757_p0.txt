Washington (CNN) Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle signaled Wednesday theyâ€™ve had enough with a visa program as it currently stands    a program that has been key to at least one Trump family business venture.   At issue is the   immigrant investment program, which allows foreign investors to pump money into US projects that create jobs and then apply for visas to immigrate to the US.   In a rare issue that unites lawmakers on the left and right, members of Congress have decried the program for essentially selling citizenship to wealthy foreigners    many of whom are based in China    although they acknowledge it does have value as a way to spur investment in the US and job growth.
