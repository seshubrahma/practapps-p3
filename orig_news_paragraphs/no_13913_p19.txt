The moment: Both Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights hero, and Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, testified against Sessions on the second day of his confirmation hearings. As their colleagues came under fire for offering what liberals saw as an overabundance of senatorial courtesy, Lewis, Booker and Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond zeroed in on Sessions’ history with a sharper edge. " Those who are committed to equal justice in our society wonder whether Sen. Sessions’ call for ’law and order’ will mean today what it meant in Alabama when I was coming up back then," Lewis said during his testimony.
