’ ’      Here is what the AHCA, deemed "Trumpcare," would do : Allow states to waive coverage for "essential     health benefits" like hospitalization, maternity care, and     mental health coverage; allow discrimination against people     with   conditions like asthma, cancer, and other     ailments without a safety net for Americans priced out of the     individual market; allow employers to hollow out health     benefits for their employees,  for the     millions of Americans who receive it through their jobs;      that helps give care to children in special     education classes; and not least, it would cut Medicaid     spending and end the Medicaid expansion, taking $880 billion     from the program.    ’ ’      The AHCA isn’t a health care bill as much as it is a vehicle     for upward redistribution, taking from the bottom to give to     the very top.
