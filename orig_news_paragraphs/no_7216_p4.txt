Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu last year angered the French authorities by making the same suggestion following the targeting of Jews in Islamic terror attacks, including the four Jews killed in a Paris kosher supermarket during the Charlie Hebdo attack. " To the Jews of Europe and to the Jews of the world I say that Israel is waiting for you with open arms," Netanyahu said in a statement, to which the then French Prime Minister Manuel Valls responded: "France is wounded with you and France does not want you to leave. "
