I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process," Trump said of Manafort’s decision.   But after a series of negative headlines, and with his poll numbers flagging, the Trump campaign clearly needed a fresh strategy    and a different tone. The question is whether the new additions, including conservative news website Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon in the role of CEO and veteran conservative pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager, will do the trick. Judging by the tone and tenor of the last 48 hours, at least, Conway appears to be making an impact    and Bannon’s aggressive style seems for now to be taking a back seat.
