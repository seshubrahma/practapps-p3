Spokeswoman Laurie Nilsen said the two men placed each other under citizen’s arrest and were released at the scene.

Horowitz suggested it’s unlikely his client was the aggressor, given that he’s 5 feet 6 inches tall and 75 years old. According to Horowitz, the incident started after Savage had finished dinner and was leaving the restaurant.
