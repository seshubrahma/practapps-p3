The American Health Care Act, as the bill is officially known, has yet to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, but many, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have said they think the CBO estimate, expected as soon as Monday, will show that the plan would reduce the number of insured, although Ryan argued that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing because it reflected economic freedom. However, Price said he felt otherwise about the actual number of people who would have health coverage if the plan goes in effect. " In fact, I believe, again, that we’ll have more individuals covered," Price said.
