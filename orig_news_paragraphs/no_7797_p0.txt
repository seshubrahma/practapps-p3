President Barack Obama admitted that some of the people who had voted for him voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, rather than his chosen successor Hillary Clinton. ["We know that there are a substantial number of voters out there who not only voted for me twice, but currently support me, who also voted for Donald Trump," he acknowledged in an interview with National Public Radio.   Obama also acknowledged that Trump had "scrambled" the political map, creating structural problems for the Democrats. He admitted that some of his administrationâ€™s decisions on social issues like gun control and transgender bathrooms might have angered voters in swing states: They may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules.
