Before becoming president at the end of 1999, Mr. Putin played a prominent role in a particularly spectacular example of this Russian specialty. As head of the Federal Security Agency, or F. S. B. in 1997, Mr. Putin won the trust of Mr. Yeltsin by helping to destroy the career of Russiaâ€™s prosecutor general, Yury Skuratov, who, after starting an investigation into Kremlin corruption, was disgraced on national television by the broadcast of a video that showed a man who looked like him in bed with two young women. Mr. Putin certified in public that the man in the video, widely believed to have been arranged and then filmed by the F. S. B. was indeed the prosecutor general. Mr. Skuratov resigned.
