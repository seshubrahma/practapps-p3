Valls who has also previously served as interior minister, said on Monday that he wanted an independent France "inflexible on its values, when facing Xi Jinping’s China, Putin’s Russia, Donald Trump’s America, Erdogan’s Turkey," referring to the leaders of those countries.    Fillon, 62, was elected the Republican Party candidate in primary elections. He has been dubbed a "French Thatcher" for his apparent admiration for Britain’s "Iron Lady," Margaret Thatcher.
