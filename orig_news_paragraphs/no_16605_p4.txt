Morell’s comments come the day after The Washington Post published a letter to Trump from Morell and Mike Vickers, the former undersecretary of Defense for intelligence , that was critical of Trump’s comments about Putin.   The two wrote to Trump that "you cannot credibly serve as commander in chief if you embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin." "Demand that Putin stop his aggressive behavior overseas," Morell and Vickers wrote.
