It does not mean —  and has never meant —  that both parents had to be U. S. citizens, or that a person had to be born on U. S. soil. There are no federal records of Cruz being made a citizen under the process established by the Immigration and Nationality Act. The only other possibility under the law is that he was an American citizen at the moment he was born. Since he was born on foreign soil and his father was not an American citizen (born in Cuba, resided in America legally, then later became a Canadian citizen) the only possible explanation is that he acquired American citizenship at birth because his mother was an American citizen.
