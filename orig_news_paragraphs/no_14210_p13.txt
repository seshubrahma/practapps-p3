A federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night.   What that did would say citizens from the affected countries whoâ€™ve already arrived in the U. S. or who were on the way legally, before the order, cannot be removed from America.   The judge said that removal would violate the immigrants due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Constitution. Across the U. S. protesters gathered to speak out against the restrictions.
