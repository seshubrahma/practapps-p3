Tom Schedler, the Louisiana Secretary of State, sent a letter to DiMarco about the voting machine after he received a complaint about the issue. " Action is necessary to preserve the integrity of early voting and to promote confidence within the general public regarding the voting process," Schedler said in the letter to DiMarco upon seizing the voting machine, along with the list of signatures of individuals who had voted using it. DiMarco insists the private voting machine is "not a big issue" because his office has handed the machine over to the Secretary of Stateâ€™s office.
