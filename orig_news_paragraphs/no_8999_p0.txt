President Barack Obama is making a last minute stop to Michigan to whip up support for Hillary Clinton in order to save the state from supporting Donald Trump. [According to CNNâ€™s Jeff Zelany, campaign sources said that President Obama wanted to go back into Iowa but was told that it was "out of reach" and to go to Michigan instead.   The Clinton campaign appears worried about upper   states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota that are traditionally safe Democratic states. Clinton also made a last minute stop in Detroit on Friday to encourage voters to go to the polls.
