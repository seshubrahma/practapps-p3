Podcasts are personal. Unlike the wide public broadcast of radio, a podcast begins whenever you touch "play," then courses through your headphones and directly into your ears. Listening to a great podcast can feel like falling into conversation with a new best friend or eavesdropping on an infatuating crush. A bad one is like sitting next to the wrong stranger on the subway.
