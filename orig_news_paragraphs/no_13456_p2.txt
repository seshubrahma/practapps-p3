Trump official Tyner confirms the authenticity of the text messages he received. Tyner said that when he met with Nosef recently, Nosef referred to using the Highway Patrol to monitor Saturdayâ€™s caucuses. The Highway Patrol was deployed four years ago to monitor a congressional district caucus in which now former Rep. Ron Paul was poised to defeat Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. The Highway Patrol serves at the will of Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who endorsed Ted Cruz.
