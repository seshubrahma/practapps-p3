They knew that the Ivy League politicians who continued to live off credit by running up trillions of huge national debt would face a day of reckoning. They knew that having open borders so that we looked the other way as masses of people poured into the country illegally would lower wages and strain the budgets of states trying to educate, medicate, and incarcerate the hordes of new arrivals. They knew that losing a sense of pride and nationalism for America first and creeping into the multicultural, politically correct, and globalist "one world order" would turn America into a wussy, wobbly, and weak country where people showed up illegally, waved flags of their home country, burned ours, and demanded that we give them instructions and education in their native language, drivers licenses, healthcare and maybe even the right to vote.
