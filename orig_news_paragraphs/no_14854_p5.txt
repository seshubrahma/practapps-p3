" After a 3 month investigation, the FBI this morning arrested the man who assaulted me using a strobe on twitter that triggered a seizure," Eichenwald tweeted last Friday. The FBI and police in Maryland and Dallas, where Eichenwald resides, investigated the case and arrested Rivello.   Rivello, who is from Salisbury, Maryland, was initially charged with cyberstalking and appeared in federal court Friday.
