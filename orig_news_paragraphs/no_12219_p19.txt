There are millions of people who go under the label "Muslim" but who may not agree with, or follow, all Islamic mandates, or who may want to reform them, or who may not even know anything about them   â€”   or who may have simply been born into the religion and were never even given a choice as to who they wanted to be. We have no problem with these people. And as a matter of fact, our standing up to Islamic Supremacism is a defense of these Muslims because they are, like millions of Muslims around the world, also victims of Islamic Supremacism.
