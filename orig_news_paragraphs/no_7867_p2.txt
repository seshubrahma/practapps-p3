On Friday, Breitbart News published an exclusive interview with Chris Crane, an ICE officer of 13 years and a U. S. Marine, in which Crane said Sen. Rubio treated law enforcement "like absolute trash" during his push to pass his 2013 amnesty bill. On Saturday, Rubio appeared on Fox News and implicitly denounced Crane and his service to the country. " He’s not an ICE official, he’s head of a union," Rubio said angrily.
