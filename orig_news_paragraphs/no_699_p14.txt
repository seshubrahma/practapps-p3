The proliferation of   acts in the United States and the president’s failure to address them publicly were frequent topics of conversation in Jerusalem over the weekend, where the leaders of American Jewish groups gathered for meetings, according to attendees who described the private discussions on the condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, several organizations issued statements praising Mr. Trump’s comments. " We appreciate that President Trump spoke directly to this matter," said Nathan J. Diament, the executive director for public policy at the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.
