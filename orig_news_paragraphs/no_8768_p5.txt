Cruz will be held to no more than 14 of the state’s 53 congressional districts, and Kasich will be a   losing to Trump in liberal metropolitan districts. This scenario assumes that Cruz’s   ground game will be unable to counter Trump’s dominance in earned media, and that Cruz’s early choice of Carly Fiorina as his running mate will have little impact in a state she lost badly in her 2010 Senate race. It also presumes no major gaffes or organizational snafus by Trump over the 40 days until Election Day. Scenario #2: Cruz wins.
