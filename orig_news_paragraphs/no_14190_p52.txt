" I was absolutely distraught and offended that my party, the party of Reagan, the party of Lincoln, the true big tent that aspired for a great America, has today nominated a candidate who is a bigot, racist, demagogue," Ramadan says in an interview at his home in Dulles, Virginia. Born and raised in Lebanon and a   supporter of the GOP, Ramadan doesnâ€™t yet know what he will do after the election. He predicts that the political views that take hold among ethnic minorities this year will far outlast the 2016 election.
