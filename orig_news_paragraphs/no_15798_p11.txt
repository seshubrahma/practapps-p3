In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine    conversations with President Trump in four months    three in person and six on the phone. January 27 Dinner, The President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time.
