Legal dream team in white shirts and dark suits , Right out of the gate, Mueller brought on three partners from his former law firm, WilmerHale, with significant litigating experience in high stakes cases: Aaron Zebley, who previously served as Mueller’s chief of staff at the FBI Jeannie Rhee, a former federal prosecutor and top official at the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and James Quarles, who worked on the Watergate investigation as a young prosecutor. Rhee’s past work on behalf of the Clinton Foundation is unlikely to go ignored by Trump supporters    though others at WilmerHale, such as Jamie Gorelick, currently represent Trump’s immediate family members. Mueller has also reportedly recruited skillful prosecutors from within the highest levels at DOJ    including Andrew Weissmann, chief of the Criminal Division’s fraud section, who served as former director of the Enron Task Force and general counsel under Mueller at the FBI.
