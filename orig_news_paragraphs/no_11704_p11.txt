Trump also visited flooded homes and victims in Ascension Parish, one of the most devastated regions in the state, as Breitbart Texas reported. Almost a third of all homes in the area flooded after the levee system failed to keep water out. Control systems proved unreliable, with the Laurel Ridge Levee toppled. Despite the levee structure being overcome with floodwaters, the Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security said in a Facebook post that the levee had not suffered any breaks, breaches or even structural damage.
