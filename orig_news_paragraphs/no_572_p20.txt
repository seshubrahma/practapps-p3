Mr. Trump had a   telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China last week and promised to stick by America’s longstanding "One China" policy, reportedly at Mr. Tillerson’s urging. But the president has been an unrelenting critic of China on trade and currency matters, and some of his top advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, view China as a   adversary. " We will learn an enormous amount about his policy and his administration by how he deals with North Korea," said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at the Eurasia Group and a former Obama adviser.
