Donald Trump is the president of the United States, the head of the US military and, arguably, the single most powerful person in the world. O’Donnell and Trump have a loooooong history    dating all the way back to 2006.

O’Donnell, at the time a   of "The View," blasted Trump the following day    calling him "a   salesman on Little House On The Prairie" among many other things.
