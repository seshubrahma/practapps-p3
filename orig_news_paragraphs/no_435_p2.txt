Ms. Shalala, in an interview on Thursday, acknowledged the difficulties. " Last year was a tough year," she said, "because people were beating on us with nonsense," a reference to bruising political attacks claiming that donors were using the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons. Revenues were down for 2016, Ms. Shalala acknowledged, in part because of voluntary restrictions and the fact that the charity’s major    —   the former president and his daughter, Chelsea  —   were campaigning for Mrs. Clinton.
