The president is only one of the performers on their theatre, if he wants to be a leader, he cannot, because as some say he wanted to be a leader, Trump wanted to be a leader, but every president there, if he wants to be a real leader, later heâ€™s going to eat his words, swallow his pride if he has pride at all, and make a 180 degree   otherwise he would pay the price politically," said Assad. Asked if he anticipated another U. S. attack, Assad replied: As long as the United States is being governed by this   complex, the financial companies, banks, and what you call deep regime, and works for the vested interest of those groups, of course. It could happen anytime, anywhere, not only in Syria. Assad lamented that his military could not retaliate against the American ships that fired cruise missiles at Syria but expressed hope the Russians might do it for him.
