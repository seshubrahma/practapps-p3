Chaffetz was elected to great populist conservative fanfare in 2008, running an insurgent primary campaign against   George W.   Republican incumbent Chris Cannon, who once told a crowd, "We love immigrants in Utah. And we don’t oftentimes make the distinction between legal and illegal. " Cannon’s ties to radical Latino advocacy group the National Council of La Raza ("the race") and an award from the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, made immigration the wedge issue of the campaign, with a nascent populist movement seeing Chaffetz’s candidacy as a turning point in the battle against amnesty.
