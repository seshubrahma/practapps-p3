The number of extremist groups active in the United States rose for the second year in a row last year, propelled in part by the mainstreaming of   rhetoric by the Trump campaign, particularly on topics like immigration and Islam, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism in the United States. The number of   groups grew the most, almost tripling to 101 in 2016 from 34 in 2015, in part because of President Trumpâ€™s 2015 proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States in response to the Syrian refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. There were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the United States in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014, the center said in its annual report. The number of organized   groups, like armed militias, dropped by almost 40 percent, however, to 623 in 2016 from 998 in 2015.
