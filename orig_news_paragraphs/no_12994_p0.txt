Former congressman Robert Walker of Pennsylvania, a supporter of Governor John Kasich’s presidential campaign, appeared on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM with host Stephen K. Bannon to discuss Kasich’s "strong" chances in the Keystone State and his alliance he formed with fellow candidate Ted Cruz. [Walker cited Kasich’s "experience both having a balanced budget in Washington, and then having a very successful gubernatorial time in Ohio, winning 86 of 88 counties in his  " as reasons for Pennsylvania voters to choose him.   " That’s the kind of experience that I think should be carried into the fall election, and gives us the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton," said Walker.
