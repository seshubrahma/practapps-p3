Modertor Matt Schlapp, in acknowledgment of the unique nature of their joint appearance, asked the Honorable Gentlemen what they appreciated about one another. Priebus lauded Bannon for being "very dogged in ensuring that every day, the promises that President Trump has made are the promises that we’re working on," for being "incredibly loyal," and for being "extremely consistent. " "As you can imagine, there are many things hitting the president’s ear and desk every day, different things that come to the president that want to move him off his agenda, and Steve is very consistent and very loyal to the agenda, and is a presence that I think is very important to have in the White House," he said. He added that he thought of Bannon as a dear and cherished friend.
