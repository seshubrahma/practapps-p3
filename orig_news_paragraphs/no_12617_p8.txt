Reports note that Rios also allegedly "broke into a home, took the keys to a Lexus, and drove it to Georgetown, Texas, where it was found abandoned. He is also believed to have kidnapped a man at gunpoint Monday morning and then trying to force him to withdraw money from an ATM. Rios set fire to his sister’s apartment in Georgetown, broke through a wall into a neighbor’s apartment, and tried to flee before being captured. He had a gun nearby. "
