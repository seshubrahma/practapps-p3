the Second Amendment protects rights that belong to every   American, regardless of race: No matter the color of your skin, no matter where you come from, no matter your economic status or your education level, whether you’re young or old or a man or a woman, if you’re a   citizen of this country, you have a constitutional right to your Second Amendment and a   freedom to protect yourself and your family. There is no doubt the NRA is a political success.
