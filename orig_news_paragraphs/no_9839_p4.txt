Saporta said threats to abortionists have traditionally been reported to the U. S. Department of Justice’s Task Force on Violence Against Health Care Providers. She says, however, that if Sen. Jeff Sessions becomes the U. S. Attorney General, she can’t be certain whether this avenue can be relied upon for assistance. " We are concerned if we have an AG who thinks Operation Rescue is a legitimate organization and takes cues from them versus understanding that the law is the law and it needs to be enforced," Saporta said.
