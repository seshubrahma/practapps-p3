In a statement from the university, President David Parkyn confirmed that the student had "fabricated" the entire story. " We are confident there is no further threat of repeated intolerance to any member of our campus community stemming from this recent incident," Parkyn said. Parkyn told local media that Volk is no longer enrolled at the university, which serves as an "immigrant gateway community," according to NBC Chicago.
