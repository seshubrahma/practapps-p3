Quarles has given nearly $33, 000 to political campaigns over the years. He gave money to Democratic presidential candidates Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. In addition, Quarles gave more than $10, 000 to help Democrats get elected to the House and another $10, 000 on the Senate side, including money to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But Quarles is also the only lawyer among Muellerâ€™s team for which records were available who ever donated to Republicans.
