What’s more, according to the countersuit filed by the Management Group, Mr. Depp’s financial distress was a result of his tendency to overspend  —   at a rate of $2 million a month   —   on items like 14 homes, a chain of islands in the Bahamas, $30, 000 per month on wine, and $3 million to blast the ashes of Hunter S. Thompson from a   cannon. " I need to give my kiddies and famille as good a Christmas as possible," Mr. Depp wrote to his financial advisers when they counseled him to "take it easy on holiday spending," according to the firm’s countersuit.
