Though not legally bound to do so, news organizations have kept this information under wraps for fear of suppressing turnout and affecting   races if the presidential election were called before voting in most states had ended. " Politicians from Western states have been very critical of any attempt to project election outcomes and report election outcomes before voters in their states have had a chance to cast their votes," said Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Research, which conducts exit polling for leading news organizations on election nights. There is no conclusive evidence that early reporting suppresses turnout.
