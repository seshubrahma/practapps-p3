" N. I. H. has made it clear that its job is not to decide prices of drugs, period," Dr. Rohrbaugh said Kite says it has not decided what to charge for   but Dr. Belldegrun hinted that Kiteâ€™s therapy might be relatively expensive because ideally it would be a single treatment that would cure the patient, not a drug that would have to be taken continuously. He added that Kite would take steps to make sure that everyone who needed the drug could get it. Meantime, the relationship between Kite and the National Cancer Institute is expanding to develop treatments for other cancers, including one technique Dr. Rosenberg thinks could be used to attack solid tumors like colon, breast and lung cancer.
