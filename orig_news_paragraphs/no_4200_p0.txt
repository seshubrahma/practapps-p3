"   While Jones was clear she felt the photo was "inappropriate," she also declared,"Our president cracks me up when he says his son was upset. " Jones said, "It’s tough, you know when you cross the line, and you used to always say, Joy, funny is funny, but then there are some things that just are not funny.
