Rubio talks about 21st century conservatism and and talks up Sen. Tim Scott’s story, Haley’s story, and his story. Rubio says conservatives will fight for single moms, fathers who work two jobs to give kids opportunities they never had, high school students who go to schools across towns to better their lots in life. " We will fight for you because we come from where you are now, we live the way you are living now," Rubio says.
