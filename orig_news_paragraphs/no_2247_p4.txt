Progressive groups have offered mixed reviews of Mr. Kaine, with MoveOn. org Political Action saying it supports him in light of the "racist, bigoted" message coming from Mr. Trump. Democracy for America, a liberal group that backed Mr. Sanders, agreed with the   sentiment but said the selection of Mr. Kaine was not helpful to the progressive movement.
