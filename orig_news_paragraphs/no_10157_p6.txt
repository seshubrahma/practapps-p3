Later in 2014, President Barack Obama placed economic sanctions on Russia —  in response to its aggression into Ukraine —  that shut down  ’s Russian operations before they really began to pay off. This "friendship" between Tillerson and Putin has been joined with charges by Capitol Hill Democrats and Obama administration officials that actors under the control of but not part of the Russian government hacked into the email servers of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee. The narrative put forward is that because the actors associated with the Russian government only leaked emails damaging to the Democrats and the presidential campaign of their nominee Hillary R. Clinton, it must have been the intent of the Russian government to help Trump get elected and to hurt Clinton’s campaign. Coons said he understands that there is no direct evidence that Russian government officials directed interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, and he does not know of a concrete effect this participation could have had on the election results.
