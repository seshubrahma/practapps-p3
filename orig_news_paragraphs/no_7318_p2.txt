But authorities have said that they confiscated a gun —  and didn’t find a book —  in the vehicle. The first night of protests saw many police officers injured, and now this second night has seen a protester shot —  according to police by another protester. The crowd is protesting the Tuesday, Sept. 20 police shooting of Keith Lamont Smith. Police say he was shot and killed after he produced a gun during a meeting with police.
