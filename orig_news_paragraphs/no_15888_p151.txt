Well, it seemed like forever that we had no help. It seemed like about, I would say, a minimum of two minutes, maybe as much as five minutes before we started hearing sirens.    We had people in the first base dugout who were screaming into their telephones that we were under attack and to send help immediately. And I think that was because of the concern that our security detail may be outgunned.
