Back on March 2’s broadcast of MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of defense under Obama, backed up a March 1 New York Times report revealing an effort to gather as much intelligence on    Donald Trump and his campaign and transition team ’s ties to Russia.   " I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration," Farkas, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said.
