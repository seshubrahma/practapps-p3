Donald Trump addressed the nation from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania  —   not far from where President Lincoln delivered his famous address in 1863   —   on Saturday afternoon, where he laid out his closing arguments ahead of the election in 17 days. ["President Lincoln served at at time of division like we’ve never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now," Trump stated, noting that he isn’t a politician.
