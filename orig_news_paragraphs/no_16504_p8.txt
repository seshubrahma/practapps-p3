Both Clinton and Trump has started to prepare for their upcoming presidential debates. Trump met with aides over the weekend to discuss strategy about the events, while Clinton, aides have said, is just starting the process by reading briefing books and discussing strategy with her tight group of advisers. Clinton spoke for around 15 minutes and touched on a number of policy topics, including minimum wage, mental health, gun control and education. The former secretary of state also discussed her speech in Reno earlier this month, where she accused to Trump campaign of being built on "prejudice and paranoia," accusing the Republican nominee of racism and arguing that "fringe" elements have taken over the Republican Party.
