" People resent the fact that they had to give up French cheese in order to support the presidentâ€™s policies and such corruption cases still erupt," she said in an interview. On Tuesday, the Kremlin cranked its information machinery into high gear to paint the arrest as part of a continuing anticorruption crusade that has included the arrest of three governors in the last two years.
