After a tense primary where Sanders surprised Clinton and the political world by racking up big victories, the two sides developed trust during the July convention when the Vermont independent’s team helped squash an uprising by Sanders’ backers eager to disrupt the proceedings. On Labor Day, he barnstormed New Hampshire for Clinton    with two events in the state    and later did a   swing through Ohio. A source close to Sanders said the senator plans to hit the road for House and Senate candidates starting next week, including in states like Washington not considered a presidential battleground. But with Sanders’ ability to connect with younger progressives at a time when Clinton is struggling with those voters, many are eager to see the   Democratic socialist follow through on his vow to do more to help their presidential nominee.
