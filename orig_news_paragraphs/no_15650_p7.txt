Asked about Spicer not being included in the group that met the Pope, a source close to the White House said: "Wow. That’s all he wanted," adding it should "very much" be seen as a slight. Schiller, meanwhile, is a deputy assistant to the President    a lower rank than Spicer    but he is an aide with few equals, a body man who rarely is away from the President, whether he’s on the golf course or the Sistine Chapel. And Ivanka Trump and Jared Kusher    who are both Jewish but nonetheless attended the Vatican session with the President    have rarely been away from the President’s side as he navigates the tricky international politics of the Middle East and Europe.
