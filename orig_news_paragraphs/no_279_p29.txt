Mr. Mulvaney was forced to address suggestions he had made in the past that Social Security was akin to a Ponzi scheme, and he played down that characterization. " I wouldnâ€™t read too much into it, as describing it as a Ponzi scheme," he said, explaining that he had merely been referring to the fact that the program takes money from people and gives it to other people. As for keeping the program solvent, Mr. Mulvaney said he would not recommend cuts that would cause current retirees to lose benefits.
