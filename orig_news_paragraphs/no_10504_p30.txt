Few people have pushed this notion more assiduously than Brendan Cox himself —  who donated a large chunk of the memorial fund raised in Jo Cox’s honour to the dubious charity Hope Not Hate, whose speciality is to promulgate this same misleading line —  that the "far right" is an equivalent threat to fundamentalist Islam. No doubt in doing so Brendan Cox believes he is honouring his wife’s memory. The problem is that the "good work" Brendan Cox believes his wife was doing before she died is anathema to over half the country —  and indeed to millions of people in Europe whose countries have been swamped by the kind of mass immigration that the Coxes believed would be good for them.
