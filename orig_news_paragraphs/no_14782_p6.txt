Protesters descended on Kievâ€™s central square in a peaceful protest in the winter of 2013 when Yanukovych unexpectedly backed out of a trade deal with the European Union under pressure from the Kremlin. Close to 100 people died in the shootings in the weeks before Yanukovych fled in February 2014. Ukrainian authorities say Yanukovych created conditions that allowed security forces to kill the   protesters in Kiev, but so far have not been able to charge him because he is in Russia.   Manafort has not been linked to the shootings.
