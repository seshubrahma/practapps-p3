(Note: This may be the first time ever Trump complained about getting too much attention!) In 2013, Trump, this time outraged by Jon Stewart’s jokes about him on "The Daily Show," took to Twitter not only to mock Stewart as having "no talent" but also curiously to mention Stewart’s real last name, asking, "why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz. " Last year Stewart even suggested that this Trump tweet was   saying, "I think this guy’s trying to let people know I’m a Jew."  That same year, Trump was so upset by Bill Maher’s joke that Trump was "the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan," that he sued the comedian for $5 million.
