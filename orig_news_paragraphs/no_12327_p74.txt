Breitbart asked Schlafly for her take on how Rubio had not been asked about his signature achievement in the U. S. Senate —   the Gang of Eight bill —   during the first four Presidential debates. Schlafly laughed and suggested that the establishment media is doing the Kingmakers’ bidding: "They’re protecting him," she said. Schlafly issued a clear warning to Republican publications, such as National Review, whose writers seem to boost Rubio’s campaign despite Rubio’s support for President Obama’s transformational immigration agenda.
