He’s not winning by a tiny margin that could be portrayed as misguided dupes, and a healthy party doesn’t see its own voters as "dupes" anyway. Trump is winning because a lot of people are voting for him, including voters from demographics the other candidates were supposed to dominate, such as evangelicals in South Carolina and (if entry polls are to be believed) Hispanics in Nevada. Trump’s margins are also far too large to be dismissed as whatever unpleasant fringe movement a particular commentator prefers to blame, from the "alt right" to mischievous   trying to set up an easy   win for Hillary. A lot of the   commentary along these lines would be far more plausible if he was only winning by a point or two, but that just isn’t the case.
