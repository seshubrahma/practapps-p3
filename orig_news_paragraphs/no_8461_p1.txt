Authorities say they shattered her eye sockets, strangled her, broke her neck bone, raped her, and left her for dead.   Pharis, described by her family as a "gentle" woman, desperately tried to fight back as she was pinned down in her own bed under the heavy weight of her assailant as he was crushing the bones in her face with his hammer, according to police. Pharis died a few days later in the hospital. The illegal alien accused of assaulting Pharis had been arrested six times in just the 15 months leading up to her rape and murder, but he was never removed from the country.
