No passion. Say what you want about Jack Kemp, who was Ryan’s mentor, but Kemp was from outside the Beltway. Quarterbacking and captaining the Buffalo Bills (  town) and San Diego Chargers (diverse region) allowed him to genuinely connect with   Americans and those living in, in Kemp’s words, the ghettos and the barrios. Ryan, meanwhile, is a creature of the Beltway and sounds more like a career political staffer than an inspirational politician.
