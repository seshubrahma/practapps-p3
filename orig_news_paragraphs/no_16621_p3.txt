And Mike Pence’s campaign, who once praised the group "one of the best ways" to back Trump, has told CNN that he is now not assisting their efforts, though he did not explain why. Any revival of the PAC will be closely watched by Trump donors and Republicans eager to see a group that can support Trump on television, where he is still being badly outspent by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. And the new ad campaign will shed light on how his main   group plans to portray the candidates in the final eight weeks. The group said in a strategy memo to donors earlier this month obtained by CNN that it now plans to focus on positive messaging, rather than the negative ads it had spent the summer blasting on the airwaves.
