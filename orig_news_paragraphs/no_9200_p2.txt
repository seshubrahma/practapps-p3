The Sandoval endorsement, coming two months after the state voted, led to a lot of   sniggering that it was too late to help the Kasich campaign where it counted. Sandoval didn’t endorse anyone during the state’s caucus, but let it be known that he had voted for Marco Rubio. Sandoval’s endorsement, though, could be more be important now than back in February. While Nevada decided how its delegates would vote on the   of the RNC convention two months ago, the state is only now preparing to decide who will serve as delegates.
