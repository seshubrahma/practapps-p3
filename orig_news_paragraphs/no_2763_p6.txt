Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, expressed the Obama administration’s support for Ms. Lagarde, saying that "she is a strong leader of the I. M. F. and we have every confidence in her ability to guide the fund at a critical time for the global economy. " For the Trump administration, "I don’t think this kind of ethical question is likely to be the highest priority," Mr. Truman said. While the I. M. F. and other global institutions did not figure in the presidential debate, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized a "global power structure" that fixed the economy against workers.
