Despite being heavily courted to run, Christie passed on a bid to challenge President Barack Obama in 2012 and instead served as a top surrogate for nominee Mitt Romney. (Christie did raise some eyebrows that year with his speech at the Republican convention in Tampa, which was widely seen as being more about Christie than Romney.)   Christie was vetted to be Romney’s running mate, with Romney’s aides later leaking private information regarding concerns over Christie’s health and weight as well as a Justice Department investigation over his exceeding government travel expense rates while serving as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey. Christie also rubbed many Republicans the wrong way when he warmly welcomed Obama to his state in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, just a week before the 2012 presidential election.
