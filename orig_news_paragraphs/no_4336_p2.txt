Breitbart News: When you state that "that although the department makes "databases available to law enforcement entities," that information would not include the legal status of license holders,"  is that because DMV withholds that info. or doesn’t have it? Or is it because DMV treats the AB 60 Drivers license like every other driver’s license that once in the DMV database and there is no way to distinguish them?
