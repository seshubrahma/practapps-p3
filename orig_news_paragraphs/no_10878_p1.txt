He just doesn’t do anything about it. Having abdicated all responsibility for global leadership, deliberately weakened America abroad with his noxious "smart power" and "lead from behind" philosophy, and created a power vacuum like nothing seen since World War II, Obama has been effectively leaning against the Oval Office wall and wondering when someone else will come along to rescue the Syrian people from Assad.   It’s hard to remember now, given what a comprehensive disaster Obama foreign policy has been around the world, but it is actually the official U. S. position that Bashar Assad must be removed from power. We have trained, armed, and financed local armies for that very purpose.
