Trump’s rally Thursday in the   Vermont is slated for 7pm and, as NBC News notes, will occur across the street from Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ campaign headquarters. The Hill reports that some Sanders’ supporters have schemed on Facebook to reserve tickets but then not show up. I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun.
