In a week of testimony before the Senate’’s Watergate committee,   Nixon’’s White House counsel, John Dean, was first to describe a   complex and   secret   operation   that involved the president. He famously recalled a conversation   in which he said he told Nixon there was a "cancer growing on the   presidency and that if the cancer was not removed, the president   himself would be killed by it. " ’ ’    A month later, Alexander Butterfield, Nixon’’s deputy chief of   staff, told the committee that Nixon did, in fact, have   "listening devices" in the Oval Office.
