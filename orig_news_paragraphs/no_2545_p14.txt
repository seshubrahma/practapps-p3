The 618 housing units to be granted building permits in East Jerusalem on Wednesday have been in the works for a while, and the planning committee meeting agenda was set before the United Nations acted. But the committee chairman said he was determined to go forward with units totaling 5, 600. " I wonâ€™t get worked up over the U. N. or any other organization that might try to dictate to us what to do in Jerusalem," Deputy Mayor Meir Turgeman, the planning committee chairman, told the newspaper Israel Hayom.
