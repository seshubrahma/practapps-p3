Mrs. Clinton said that while a racially charged and "paranoid fringe" had always existed in politics, "it’s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it and giving it a national megaphone, until now. " Mrs. Clinton’s remarks coincide with a conspicuous shift in strategy from Mr. Trump, who has spoken with more compassion about people in the country illegally and expressed a desire to win   support. He has even suggested he might revisit his call to deport 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally, a pivot seen as an attempt to draw in moderate voters turned off by his views.
