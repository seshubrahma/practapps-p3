Netanyahu has threatened a diplomatic "declaration of war" against New Zealand if it supported the resolution, an official said.   Netanyahu made the threat to New Zealandâ€™s Foreign Minister Murray McCully hours before the vote last Friday, according to an official with knowledge of the conversation who asked not to be identified because of diplomatic sensitivities. New Zealand was one of four countries which introduced the resolution. Netanyahu instructed the Israeli Ambassador to New Zealand to return to Israel for consultations after the vote.
