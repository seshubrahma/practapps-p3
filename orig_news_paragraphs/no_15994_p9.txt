In the middle of the night, the House GOP had sought to end the extraordinary day of drama by swiftly adjourning for a recess that will last through July 5. The Republican move was an effort to terminate a protest that began Wednesday morning in reaction to the massacre in Orlando when Democrats took over the House floor and tried to force votes on gun control. But throughout the morning Thursday,   Democrats, including House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi for much of the time, remained on the floor. At one point, a police officer told the Democrats that they would be conducting a daily security sweep.
