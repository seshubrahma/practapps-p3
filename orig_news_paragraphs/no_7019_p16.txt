Mueller was abducted in 2013 in Syria, and subjected to "torture, verbal abuse, prolonged isolation, sensory deprivation, stress positions, forced labor or sexual assault," including rape at the hands of   himself, it is believed. While enslaved, Mueller refused to convert to Islam, defying her jihadist captors when they tried to claim otherwise, and became a protective elder sister figure to Yazidi girls who had been captured and enslaved. She refused to escape with a group of girls, arguing that, as an American, she would bring undue attention to the other girls. While Mueller died in captivity, the Islamic State continues to control large swathes of Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, and claims supporters in China, Russia, much of Europe, and the United States.
