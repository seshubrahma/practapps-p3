Earlier Thursday morning, Trump had tweeted that it would be better to skip the meeting if Peña Nieto continued to insist Mexico would not pay for the wall    something the Mexican leader had said as recently as Wednesday evening.   " If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting," Trump tweeted and in an earlier tweet he noted the US’s trade deficit with Mexico and what he said were the American job losses caused by NAFTA. Trump spoke about the cancellation during remarks at a gathering of congressional Republicans in Philadelphia.
