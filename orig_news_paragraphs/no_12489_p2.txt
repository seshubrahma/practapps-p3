Mr. Blair said there is "real anxiety" about the world changing, but argued that attributing falling wages to migration is wrong and simplistic. " If they think their incomes are stagnating and they arenâ€™t really getting anywhere in life, then this [migration] becomes easy to gravitate to" he said.   During his premiership, Mr. Blair decided not to impose transitional controls on migrants arriving from Bulgaria and Romania, loosened asylum policy and opened up family reunification rules, which led to unprecedented levels of migration.
