Relations between the Chicago police and residents have grown especially tense since late 2015 when city officials made public a video showing a police officer shooting Laquan McDonald, an   teenager, 16 times. The Department of Justice is investigating the Chicago police. Los Angeles had 282 murders in 2015, compared with 262 in 2014, while New York had 352 murders last year, and about 333 in 2014, the report said. Other cities that had large increases in murders in 2015  —   including Baltimore, where they rose to 344 from 211 in 2014, and Milwaukee, where they increased to 145 from 90  —   have seen murders drop this year.
