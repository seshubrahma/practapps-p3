Mr. Giuliani was paid for "three or four" speeches he delivered to the group, said Robert G. Torricelli, a former senator from New Jersey who served as a lawyer for the M. E. K. as the group is known, as it sought to be removed from a State Department list of terrorist organizations. Mr. Giuliani, after receiving payments from   groups of Iranian immigrants who had ties to the Iranian dissidents, gave rousing speeches at these annual rallies condemning Iranian leaders and the Obama administration for negotiating with them. " The ayatollah must go," Mr. Giuliani yelled, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, as thousands stood and cheered him.
