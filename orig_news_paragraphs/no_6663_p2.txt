In his social media post, Guerra, who is a Mexican congressman for Mexico’s Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) for the state of Queretaro claimed that it was easy for him to climb the fence and as such it would be easy for anyone to climb the fence and cross into California. Guerra failed to mention that at no point during his stunt did he try to cross into the U. S. and simply sat on top of the fence before crossing back into Mexico. Guerra also failed to mention that as a congressman he has immunity from criminal prosecution in Mexico.   Guerra hails from Mexico’s PRI, a political party with a long history of corruption including embezzlement, taking money from Mexican drug cartels, money laundering, and other illicit activities the PRI is the same party that Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto represents.
