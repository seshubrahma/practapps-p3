While Clinton did tweet out the hashtag "bring back our girls" in the wake of the kidnapping, she was no longer in office when the kidnapping occurred. It’s impossible to know whether a U. S. terror designation would have made any difference in the girls’ kidnapping. President Barack Obama did authorize the deployment of 80 U. S. troops to neighboring Chad about a month after the event in an effort to aid in their search. Therefore we rate the claim that the "solution from the   team" was a "hashtag campaign" as false.
