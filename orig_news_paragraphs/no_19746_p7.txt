The petitioners in the case are Shannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden. Nelson was convicted of five counts of sexual abuse allegedly directed at her children. A state appeals court reversed her conviction, however it said that the trial judge had allowed improper "expert" testimony that tainted the juryâ€™s verdict. After the appeal, the state brought Nelson to trial again.
