—    Andy C. Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) April 16, 2016,   The coalition of   students and faculty that aggressively disrupted a students for Donald Trump event last week at Oregon’s Portland State University is at it again, planning to shut down millennials who want to discuss Trump’s plan to "make America great again" at a rally planned for 1:30 pm Pacific time. Posters have begun to appear on campus attacking Trump and the students who support him as "racist" and calling for a rally.
