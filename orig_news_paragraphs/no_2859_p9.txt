Senator Donnelly is pushing for the government to consider outsourcing as a factor in deciding which companies receive federal contracts. Kenneth G.   a professor of labor and employment law at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University, said he also thought that Mr. Trump "could get a win here," adding, "Because they are a defense contractor, the federal government has some leverage. " "Whether he can do something that benefits the working class in general is a different story," he said.
