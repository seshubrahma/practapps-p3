When asked a series of detailed questions about the matter, Easton sent the exact same statement to Breitbart News —  and noted that the AP has, as of Wednesday afternoon, issued a correction to the incorrect reporting that Plenda’s activism fed into the AP newswires. Plenda has not responded to a request for comment on this matter, specifically about the inaccuracies she reported to the AP or about her violation of AP standards. On her Facebook page on Nov. 10, 2016, Plenda made a direct call to action against incoming President Donald Trump, overtly stating her efforts to become part of the resistance against the new administration. The decision to make a public political call to action is a clear violation of what Easton says are the AP’s "standards," but she has thus far refused to publicly and clearly acknowledge that the freelancing Plenda is in violation of AP ethical guidelines —  or to answer detailed questions about Plenda or others involved in this inaccurate and unethical activity at the AP.
