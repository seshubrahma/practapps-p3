The editorial also argued that there was no apparent reason for Rice to have requested the unmasking of Trump campaign officialsâ€™ names, contrary to her explanations. " Ms. Rice had no direct intelligence duties in her NSC post, and no Democrat has provided a valid reason that Ms. Rice might have needed to unmask anyone associated with the Trump presidential campaign," the editorial said. Rice has denied doing anything "untoward" with the intelligence she received, as did Bolton.
