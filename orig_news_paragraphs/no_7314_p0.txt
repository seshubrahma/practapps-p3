Tuesday at the Senate Democratic Legislative Agenda press conference, incoming Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) said because of   Donald Trump’s announcement nominating Rep. Tom Price ( ) to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services, "It’s clear that Washington Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year. "   Schumer said, "I was just so disappointed to see the   nominate Congressman Price to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services this morning. When it comes to issues like Medicare, The Affordable Care Act, Planned Parenthood, Congressman Price and the average American couldn’t be further apart.
