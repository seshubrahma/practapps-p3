Within minutes, one of our   officers finds Martinez hiding underneath a tarp on the patio of a home on Cox Street, three blocks from Ms. Pharisâ€™ home and one block from the Donovan home. He was arrested for burglary, sexual assault, and attempted murder. During the fourth day of the investigation, detectives identified and arrested the second suspect, Jose Villa Gomez. He was subsequently charged with the same crimes as Martinez.
