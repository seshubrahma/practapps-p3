Morning Consult released its latest national poll Friday, and the news is all good for Donald Trump, whose support jumped from 38% last week to 44% support today. That puts The Donald a full +27 points ahead of second place Ted Cruz, who enjoys 17% support, which is exactly where he sat last week.   Ben Carson and Marco Rubio are tied for 3rd place at 10%.
