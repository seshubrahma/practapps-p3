Davis said the defense secretary "intends to always have the Chairman at his side when he is discussing anything that has anything to do with our national security or our military," whether he’s engaging with the full National Security Council or the Principals Committee.   " We don’t see this as a change, we see this as a continuation of the very critical role that the chairman has played in an advisory capacity," Davis said. Spicer hammered President Barack Obama’s National Security Adviser Susan Rice for asking on Twitter why the CIA was omitted from the NSC, noting that Obama’s own NSC memo from 2009 didn’t list the CIA.
