The show, hosted by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, refused Wednesday to discuss the controversy surrounding Kathy Griffin’s photo shoot involving a mock beheading of President Trump. However, the show did decide to discuss a misspelled tweet by Trump, something the RNC picked up on. " According to a rough review of this morning’s program, the crew spent the majority of the show discussing misspelled tweets, White House staffing plans, uncorroborated Russia stories, and the supposed horror of President Trump giving his cell phone number out," the email by RNC Deputy Communications Director Michael Reed said. Reed notes that they spent "little to no time" on the lack of evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia or on how leaks are hurting national security.
