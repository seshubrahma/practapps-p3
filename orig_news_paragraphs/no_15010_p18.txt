The suits involved at least 678 property owners. The litigation in each case started after federal authorities invoked its "eminent domain" power, which under the US Constitution allows for the seizure of private land for public use only if property owners are fairly compensated. In most cases, property owners have little recourse to prevent their land from being taken. The litigation typically centers on whether they were offered a fair price.
