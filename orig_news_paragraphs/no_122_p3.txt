Whatever the decision on whether to charge Mrs. Clinton with a crime, Mr. Comey, a Republican former Justice Department official appointed by President Obama, was going to get hammered. And he was. Republicans, who made her use of a private email server a centerpiece of their campaign against Mrs. Clinton, attacked Mr. Comey after he decided there was not sufficient evidence she had mishandled classified information to prosecute her. The Clinton campaign believed the F. B. I. investigation was overblown and seriously damaged her chances to win the White House and resented Mr. Comeyâ€™s comments about Mrs. Clinton at his news conference.
