Just three weeks after leaving office in 2011, Bayh changed his address to his $2. 3 million home in a leafy neighborhood in Washington, according to Indiana records. And often when Bayh registered his address    whether it was on an Alaska fishing license, a donation to Hillary Clinton or on the deed to his beachfront property in Southern Florida    he listed Washington as his home. Even when Bayh returned back to Indianapolis last summer for an Indiana Democratic Party dinner, he stayed at a JW Marriott just 12 miles away from his condo. A source with Indianapolis Power and Light said Bayhâ€™s monthly electric bills averaged less than $20 per month since 2012, suggesting little    if any    use at his Indiana condo.
