This campaign is going to be hell     but the result will be worth it. When Barack Obama entered the White House, a building partly constructed by slaves, that sight alone was worth a lifetime of campaigning. When Hillary Rodham Clinton enters the White House, the sight of a woman honored not just as a partner or mother of someone else    but for her own brain and heart and work    that sight will begin a new era, too.
