The total estimated costs for those trips are around $21. 6 million. Obama, by contrast, spent just under $97 million on travel in his eight years as president, according to documents reviewed by Judicial Watch, a conservative government watchdog. These trips included personal trips   including ski trips to Aspen and the Obama’s annual family vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts    and work trips, like a visit to Everglades National Park on Earth Day in 2015.
