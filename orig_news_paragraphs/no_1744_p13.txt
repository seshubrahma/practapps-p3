The campaign stops in Toledo and Akron marked the first time Mrs. Clinton had visited Ohio since Labor Day, as polls show the stateâ€™s white   voters gravitating toward Mr. Trump. Fifty percent of likely voters in Ohio preferred Mr. Trump, compared with 46 percent for Mrs. Clinton, in a   poll last month. Early voting begins next week in Ohio, and the Clinton campaign has roughly 300 staff members and an army of volunteers working to register voters. On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton plans to embark on a   bus tour through the state largely focused on   economic issues.
