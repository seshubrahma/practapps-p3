" Obama’s efforts to transform the nation’s energy system began in 2009 with his attempt to kill the coal industry by passing a tax on   emissions.

Having been rebuked by many in his own party, Obama instead sought to use the Environmental Protection Agency as a blunt instrument to circumvent Congress to achieve his goal of fundamentally restructuring the U. S. energy system.
