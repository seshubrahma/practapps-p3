In conclusion, the Order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality. National security is not a "talismanic incantation" that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power under § 1182( f). The court also relied on President Barack Obama’s judgment that upping the inflow of refugees to 110, 000 a year is safe, saying: President Obama previously determined that the admission of 110, 000 refugees to the United States during fiscal year 2017 was justified by humanitarian concerns or otherwise in the national interest  …      To the extent that 60, 000 additional refugees can be considered a class of aliens, EO2 makes no findings to justify barring entry in excess of 50, 000 as detrimental to the interests of the United States.
