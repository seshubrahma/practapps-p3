I became politically active because I wanted my daughter to grow up to be proud of me.   I was on the Tulane University law faculty in New Orleans when white supremacist David Duke was running for governor, and I certainly didnâ€™t want my daughter to grow up in a state run by white supremacists.   But I also wanted her to be proud that her mom did all she could to stop Duke, and then to work for social justice in our community.
