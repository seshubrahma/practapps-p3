And, from the perspective of an outsider, no other country has my back like you guys do. The principles upon which America was founded have made it the freest and fairest country in the world. Capitalism, freedom of speech, property rights and Enlightenment values have given women, blacks, gays and everyone else equal representation and access to this countryâ€™s great institutions and marketplaces. And although the loony Left I spend so much of my time ridiculing hates precisely the freedom that has afforded those minorities power, I am confident that America will see through the divisiveness, hypocrisy, dishonesty and   bullying of the social justice tendency, whether it be feminists or Black Lives Matter, and reaffirm its commitment to that most sacred freedom: the freedom to be, do, read, write and say whatsoever you please.
