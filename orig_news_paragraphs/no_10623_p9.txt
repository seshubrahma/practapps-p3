Sen. John McCain ( ) called social and religious conservative leaders "agents of intolerance" during his 2000 campaign and then saw his projected $100 million campaign implode after he teamed up with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy ( ) and George W. Bush to push comprehensive amnesty legislation before his 2008 campaign. McCain, whom conservatives have never considered one of their own, lost the 2008 election to a   Senator in Barack Obama even after his selection of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin propelled him to a   lead. Mitt Romney, one of the most prominent faces of the    pastels wing of the GOP, also never won the hearts of conservatives even though he vowed that he was "severely" conservative. Romney never resonated with   voters who felt disillusioned with Obama.
