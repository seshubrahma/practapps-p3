It’s also where you’d find the headquarters of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   It’s an alliance of 28 countries, mostly from Europe, plus Canada and the U. S.   It was formed in 1949 as a way to counterbalance the military might of the Soviet Union.    The alliance is based on collective defense, an attack on one NATO member is considered an attack on all of them, and that was invoked once in 2001 after the September 11th terrorist attacks on the U. S.  Troops from other NATO members served in the resulting war in Afghanistan.
