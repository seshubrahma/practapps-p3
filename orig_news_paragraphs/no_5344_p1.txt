The mural —  painted by Salvador "Sal " Barajas —   one of the artists who painted the first "Historical Mural" in the park in 1973 that highlights key figures and history of the Chicano movement, was commissioned by a border activist group known as Border Angels. Border Angel’s founder, Enrigue Morones has been trying to raise the $10, 000 for nearly a decade —  but credits Trumps election with the new enthusiasm.
