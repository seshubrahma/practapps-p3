Sean Hannity is ripping into Wall Street Journal deputy editorial page editor Bret Stephens. [Iraq War artifact Stephens, who staunchly defends George W. Bush and Bill Kristol’s   experiment, is a pillar of the exiled Republican Establishment.   " Fox News’ dumbest anchor had a message for y’all," Stephens tweeted, slamming Hannity for saying he was "sick and tired" of Republicans for going on and on about how upset they are over Donald Trump’s feud with   DNC speaker Khizr Khan.
