Mr. Trump had originally said, in an earlier Twitter post, that he would announce his business plans during a news conference on Dec. 15. But officials with the transition confirmed on Monday that the news conference had been delayed. Now, he will not hold it until January   â€”   most likely before his inauguration and after a vacation at his    resort in Florida, officials said, confirming a report in Bloomberg News.
