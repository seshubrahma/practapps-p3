An "undervote" is the term for when a voter casts a ballot but   does not vote in a particular race. As some Republicans stick by   Trump and others reject him, the party is at grave risk   of triggering what I’’ll call the triple undervote. ’ ’    When you combine those three effects, the result is that   Democrats can win up and down the ballot even if most of the   voters in a given state or district lean Republican.
