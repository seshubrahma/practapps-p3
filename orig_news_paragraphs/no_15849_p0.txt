Washington (CNN) The Russia "cloud" is growing over President Donald Trump and threatening to wreck another week for the embattled White House as one of his closest allies tries to avoid a public spectacle on Capitol Hill. Attorney General Jeff Sessionsâ€™ announcement that he would testify before Senate Russia investigators caught everyone    including the intelligence committee    by surprise. Now, before he even testifies, the focus is both on Sessions and whether or not he would appear before the TV cameras like former FBI Director James Comey did last week, when 19. 5 million Americans watched.
