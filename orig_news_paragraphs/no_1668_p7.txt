And because the two of us have a budding office romance, we decided to invite Tika Sumpter, who plays Michelle Obama in "Southside With You," the romantic drama about Michelle and Barack’s first date, to talk about her worst first date. One thing we should note about our dip into the podcasting pool: We like the studio, but we love the world outside of it. We’re taking field trips to museums and restaurants and people’s houses. We’ll also invite on guests: the colleagues we admire at The New York Times, filmmakers, artists, writers, scientists, and regular people in our daily lives, like Jenna’s energy healer (no joke).
