The GOP now controls 69 of 99 legislative chambers across America. They hold nearly   of the governorsâ€™ mansions. And, in 25 states, they have complete control of the government, including both executive and legislative branches. This gives Republicans control of the rules that govern voting and the reapportionment of legislative and congressional districts.
