King said he’s amazed with how Cruz has come from the bottom of the pack to now be competing with Trump for either first or second place in tonight’s caucuses. King said of the Cruz campaign: It’s been terrific. I would add to that that four years last November, I remember sitting in a pickup that became known later as the ‘Chuck Truck’ [which was owned by Chuck Laudner, now Trump’s top Iowa staffer who helped deliver Iowa to Rick Santorum in 2012] at 1:30 in the morning talking through the presidential race at the time, and Rick Santorum was down pretty low in the polls, I don’t know where. There were a lot fewer candidates than we have today.
