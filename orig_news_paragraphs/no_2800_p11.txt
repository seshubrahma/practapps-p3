Tim Selaty, director of operations at Citizens for Trump, said his group was paying for private security to bolster the police presence. While Mr. Selaty said people should be allowed to carry guns, his group is banning long weapons from a rally in a park it is hosting on Monday. " Weâ€™re going to insist that they leave any long arms out for sure because we believe that will make sure our people are safer," he said.
