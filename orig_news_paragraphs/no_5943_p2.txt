U. S. immigration officials in the greater Los Angeles area arrested around 160 individuals in the past week in what a spokesman affirmed were "routine" immigration enforcement actions. The majority were male, according to the Washington Post, and the enforcement actions targeted criminal illegal aliens. Immigration activists advocating on behalf of those residing illegally in the United States have seized on the story of Rayos, driving up unrest among illegal aliens and sparking protests.    social media communications online and varied accounts of enforcement actions led a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson to make an statement as to the routine nature of the actions, an uncharacteristic move to take while a wave of enforcement actions is ongoing.
