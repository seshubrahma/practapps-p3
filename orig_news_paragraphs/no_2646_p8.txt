It is not as if there were few options for voters on the right: John Neely Kennedy, the state treasurer and presumed Republican   in the Senate race, has said he would "rather drink weed killer than support Obamacare," and he is considered to be among the moderates. Along with Mr. Kennedy, there are also two sitting congressmen, a retired Air Force colonel and five other Republican candidates vying for the seat being left by David Vitter. Under Louisiana’s system, the two top   out of the two dozen candidates running in November’s nonpartisan    primary will head to a December runoff. Pollsters of both parties say they have trouble seeing Mr. Duke making the cut.
