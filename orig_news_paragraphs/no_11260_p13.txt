If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U. S. court. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.

S. courts, and the arbitration panel could require American taxpayers to cough up millions  —   and even billions  —   of dollars in damages. If that seems shocking, buckle your seat belt.
