But the facts are getting out. For example, yesterday’s Breitbart exclusive with the victim’s father which revealed that he had seen 30 seconds of the video of the assault was discussed on Sean Hannity’s radio program Friday afternoon. As this new interview segment with the victim’s mother and father shows, the assault has also had devastating consequences for both the victim and her family. The    daughter was allegedly orally and anally raped by a seven and    boy, according to police allegations, while a boy believed to be 14 years old videotaped the assault on his cellular phone.
