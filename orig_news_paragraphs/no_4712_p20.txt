Harris sought the presidency again in 1976, and, once more, his campaign went nowhere.    And for the last four decades, Harris has been a professor at the University of New Mexico, although he has continued to be a liberal Democrat in good standing.   Now 86 , he has been a delegate to every Democratic convention, a campaign   for Barack Obama in 2008, and a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton last year.
