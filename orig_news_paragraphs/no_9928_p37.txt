I was happy to let him know that his kindness was appreciated, even decades later. In my interview with Mr. Trump and during our chat off the air, he lived up to the memories I had of the man. The guy who moved a crazed football kid down to better seats, the man who took the time to hang with college guys on a golf course, the man who was happy to exchange pleasantries at a tennis match, was the same man now. He just happens to be oh so close to becoming our 45th president.
