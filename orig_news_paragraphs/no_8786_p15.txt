It noted that the First Congress had passed laws creating the office of a paid chaplain in the U. S. House and another in the U. S. Senate, who would offer public prayers every day Congress was in session, and on that basis held such prayers are not an establishment of religion under the original meaning of that term. Similarly, here, Congress’s contemporaneous defining of the term "natural born citizen" in a 1790 statute is compelling evidence of the definition used by many of those same people when they drafted or ratified the Constitution’s Natural Born Clause only a short time earlier. It means a person was a citizen according to his or her natural birth into this world, rather than through a legal process (of immigration and naturalization) that they went through later in life. Ted Cruz was never required to immigrate or go through a naturalization process.
