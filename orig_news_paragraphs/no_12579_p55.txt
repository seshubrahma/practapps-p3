I abhor police union leadership that regularly protects bad cops and discredits citizens voicing concern over bad actors in authority. Iâ€™ve been there. Many of you know my own experience with   constant, frightening encounters and threats to my family to "bring us down" via a badge and gun. We suffered an exhausting era knowing we were defenseless against a bad cop, his union, and a gleefully politicized media never reporting the truth.
