Members of the moderate Tuesday Group, who also pose a threat to passage of Obamacare repeal and replace, met with members of the Administration on Monday at the White House. On Monday evening, Meadows told reporters that no Freedom Caucus members had changed their positions on the Republican House Leadershipâ€™s Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Sen. Rand Paul and President Donald Trump met and golfed together in Virginia last weekend. Paul told reporters that he was "very optimistic" about progress towards repealing Obamacare.
