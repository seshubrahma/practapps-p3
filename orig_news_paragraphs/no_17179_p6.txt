More than 260, 000 Cubans left in a   airlift between 1965 and 1973. In 1980, Castro let another 125, 000 leave in the chaotic Mariel boatlift. At other times, desperate Cubans have fled the island nation in makeshift boats across the treacherous Straits of Florida. Thousands died from drowning or exposure to the brutal Caribbean sun.
