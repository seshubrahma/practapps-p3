Searching continued into the night and Friday, eventually leading to a long police standoff outside a nearby home. Marcus Antonio Cassani, 41, the man police believed to be inside that home may have escaped during that time as the home was ultimately found empty according to local Fox 5 News. Cassini surrendered and was taken into custody a few blocks away, just a short time later after his sister called police reported the Los Angeles Times. Cassani was arrested on an outstanding warrant on Friday, San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman announced at a Friday press conference.
