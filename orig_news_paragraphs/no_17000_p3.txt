That fraying contributed heavily to Clinton’s inability to match the 66 million votes Obama garnered in 2012    the   "Obama coalition"    by just enough, in just the right places, to lose the race to the White House. I’ve long believed that the Democratic Party, like the Republican Party, has work to do to maintain a winning coalition, the deeper we get into the 21st century. I just thought Trump’s nomination would force the GOP into a reckoning now, allowing Democrats to postpone their own for at least another cycle.
