Turner told the local Fox11 News that his effort could "attack 13. 5 percent of their revenue base" for a mere "couple hundred bucks and less than a hundred signatures. " He told Breitbart News that by filing under 218 he only needs to gather 62 signatures from Cudahy voters. It could take   weeks before signature gathering begins, but once it does Turner will have 180 days to gather the 62 Cudahy voter signatures.
