As a result of CBPâ€™s tactical infrastructure and technology investments between the ports of entry, the U. S. Border Patrol (USBP) can detect and interdict illegal activity, monitor evolving threat patterns, and strategically deploy assets,"  a spokesman said. The Department of Homeland Security is weighing various options for wall construction or additional fencing on the border. DHS Secretary John Kelly is expected to present a proposal to President Trump, and the administration could then present a plan to Congress.   As CNN reported Thursday, sources involved in   discussions with DHS are set to recommend the construction of additional fencing rather than a concrete wall, as President Trump called for during the campaign.
