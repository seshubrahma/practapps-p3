Many current and former F. B. I. agents and Justice Department officials said Mr. Comey had needlessly plunged the F. B. I. into the politics of a presidential election, with no clear way out. A long list of former Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. chided Mr. Comey. Despite the fact that the bureau did not find anything that changed its original conclusion about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Comey has insisted that he had no choice but to inform Congress about the new emails because the investigation had been completed and he had pledged transparency, according to senior F. B. I. officials. Because of Mr. Comeyâ€™s Oct. 28 letter, Attorney General Loretta Lynch made completing a review of the emails a top priority.
