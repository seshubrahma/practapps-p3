Sure,   forces within the party are still trying anything and everything they can to desperately aim to slow the   momentum of Trump’s ascension down, but they’re running out of options as the battle heads into a dog fight for delegates between Cruz and Kasich and Trump in the next stages of battle. Every establishment effort to coalesce behind anyone to stop Trump —  whether it be former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal or now Rubio —   has utterly and absolutely failed. Now the Washington establishment seems to be aiming to coalesce next behind Kasich and then lastly behind Cruz in their efforts to maintain control over the populace, and it remains to be seen if these last ditch efforts will be even close to successful or if they will fail just like every other fight.
