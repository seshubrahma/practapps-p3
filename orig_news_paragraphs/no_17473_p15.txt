A spokesperson for the UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura welcomed the ceasefire, saying in a statement that a cessation of hostilities was a "cornerstone" of a UN Security Council resolution from 2015 on Syria. The statement said that de Mistura hoped the agreement would "save civilian lives, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance across Syria, and pave the way for productive talks in Astana" in Kazakhstan. But the statement also said that the developments should contribute to negotiations convened by the UN in planned Syria talks on February 8.   Turkey and Russia appear to be sidelining the United States, which has led an international coalition to fight ISIS in Syria and has vehemently opposed any attempt to keep Assad in power.
