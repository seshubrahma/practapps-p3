According to press reports, Dr. Ben Carson had eight delegates before withdrawing, and Jeb Bush had four delegates before he ended his campaign. Should Trump win Arizona and keep Cruz below the 50 percent mark in Utah, while passing the 15 percent threshold himself in that state, he would need to take 51 percent of the outstanding delegates to secure a first ballot nomination. But if Cruz wins more than 50 percent, that number increases to 53 percent for Trump. If Cruz wins Arizona, Trumpâ€™s "need to win" number jumps to 58 percent.
