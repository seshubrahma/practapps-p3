WASHINGTON   —    Federal prosecutors announced criminal charges on Wednesday against six Volkswagen executives for their roles in the company’s   scandal, a sharp turn by a departing administration that is trying to remake its image of being soft on corporate crime. The six executives include a former head of development of the Volkswagen brand and the head of engine development.
