A spokesman for Mr. Bharara declined to comment. Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an email that all remaining holdover United States attorneys had been asked to resign, leaving their deputy United States attorneys, who are career officials, in place in an acting capacity. " As was the case in prior transitions, many of the United States Attorneys nominated by the previous administration already have left the Department of Justice," she said in the email.
