" At this point, we see nothing consistent with an (intercontinental ballistic missile) launch," a second defense official told CNN. David Wright,   of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said North Korea may have shown off a missile with a "considerably longer range than its current missiles" with Sunday’s test. Writing on his organization’s blog, Wright pointed out that the Japan’s Ministry of Defense had the latest launch reaching an altitude of 2, 000 kilometers (1, 242 miles) considerably higher than would be needed for the distance the missile traveled during what was reported as a   flight time.
