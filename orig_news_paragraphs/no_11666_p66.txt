I mean, if they give me a good argument on the other side, I like to   TV, but it’s just   bilge coming from these people.   But I have noticed, before I stopped watching at least the news, all these people you never heard of before, who don’t exactly have   good looks, like Rick Wilson? Have you ever heard of him? Charlie Sykes?
