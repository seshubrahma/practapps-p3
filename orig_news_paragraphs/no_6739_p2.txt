" McCarthy was fired last year over the controversy caused by a fatal   shooting in October 2014 of a black    named Laquan McDonald. Dashcam video footage released a year later showed that Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke shot McDonald more than a dozen times, eventually killing him as he tried to walk away from the officers, NBC 5 Chicago reported. The officer was charged with   murder, and there was a public outcry that McCarthy resign.
