Washington (CNN) The FBI released Friday nearly 200 pages of notes from its investigation of Hillary Clintonâ€™s private email server, just three days before she squares off against Donald Trump in the first presidential debate. The notes, taken from interviews of top Clinton aides, supporters and others, include details of how a close Clinton confidant explained how the State Department made sure the White House system would not bounce back the emails from the   of state.   But the documents    a summary of which had already been released in the overall FBI report    provide little in the way of major bombshells.
