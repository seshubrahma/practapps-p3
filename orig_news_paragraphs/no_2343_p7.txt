" My relationship with Mr. Stepien was that he expected me to give him information that would help him secure endorsements," Mr. Wildstein said. Mr. Christieâ€™s office was seeking endorsements from those they called "target" Democratic mayors to help the governor, a Republican, win a broad   victory that would propel him to the front of the pack of Republican presidential contenders for 2016. The mayor, Mark Sokolich, still had a "good relationship" with Mr. Christie in 2011, Mr. Wildstein testified.
