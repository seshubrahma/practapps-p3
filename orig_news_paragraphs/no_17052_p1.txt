While largely peaceful, the protests have resulted in blocked highways and bridges, arrests during clashes with police and the early Saturday shooting of a man at a march in Portland, Oregon. In Cincinnati,   demonstrators were joined by hundreds of people protesting a hung jury in the murder trial of a former University of Cincinnati police officer who fatally shot a black motorist during a July 2015 traffic stop. In Los Angeles’ MacArthur Park, the site of immigrant rights protests over the years, demonstrators took turns Saturday swatting a stick at a piñata resembling Trump.   Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, praised the protesters.
