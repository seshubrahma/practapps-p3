Again, in Heller, the Court held that the Bill of Rights’ use of the term "the people" in the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments confirmed the Court’s reasoning that "the people" in the Second Amendment meant private citizens, not state government militias. As noted in our first report, the language of the Natural Born Clause parallels two other constitutional provisions, one requiring that candidates for U. S. House must be (1) at least 25 years old, (2) have been a U. S. citizen for seven years, and (3) be a resident of the state that elects them at the time of their election.   Similarly, U. S. senators must be (1) at least 30 years old, (2) have been a U. S. citizen for nine years, and (3) be a resident of the state that elects them at the time of their election. Together, these three provisions thus dictate those qualifications for every elected federal official.
