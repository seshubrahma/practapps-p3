I was one of 13, 14 Republicans who voted no against President   Reagan. It’s not my job to be reporting to any political   organization or office. It’s my job as a public official to try   to determine, with the help of my friends and advisers, what is   the best thing to do to serve the public, and that’s what I try   to do. And the chips fall where they may.
