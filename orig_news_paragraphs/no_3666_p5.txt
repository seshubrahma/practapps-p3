She argued that those supporting the nuclear weapons ban did not understand the potential negative effect disarming responsible international actors would have and argued that North Korea and Iran would both be "cheering" if such a nuclear weapons ban passed. The international resolution Haley opposes is the product of the UN General Assembly, which passed the legislation in December calling for the member nations to "negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination," according to Reuters. Haley argues that such legislation would disarm responsible nations and remove a necessary deterrent for rogue nations who have since acquired some nuclear capabilities. Instead, Haley argued, the UN should adhere to the Nuclear   Treaty signed in 1968.
