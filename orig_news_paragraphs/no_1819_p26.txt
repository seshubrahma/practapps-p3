Halloween may be over in the United States, but Mexico and Central America are celebrating DÃ­a de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. Hundreds of years ago, the Aztecs of that region honored their dead with elaborate rituals in the summer. The invading Spanish could not stamp out the tradition, and it was eventually merged with the Roman Catholic holidays of All Saints Day (Nov. 1) and All Souls Day the next day. Decorative skulls made of sugar are the most famous symbols of the holiday.
