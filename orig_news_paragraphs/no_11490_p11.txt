Here’s what concerned me: What concerned me was the way this article attempts to characterize what I said and believe, that I had to step back and rewatch the videos and listen to my comments that I made at campaign rallies over the weekend and make sure that I hadn’t said what the article and the comments within the article imply. Beck went on to explain his view of the specific mechanism all Christians, including those who support Trump, should follow before deciding the candidate for whom they will vote in the 2016 GOP Presidential contest: I believe evangelicals and Christians and Jews and Muslims are in this together, that we all have access to God’s inspiration. That’s all I’m asking for: On this Easter weekend, that you would take the time and ask for God’s inspiration. Take the time to examine the principles and put them up to your Christian values and principles.
