Mr. Rove has longstanding relationships with many of the partyâ€™s biggest donors, and has intricate knowledge of how "super PACs" can help elect candidates. Mr. Rove also has a long relationship with Sheldon Adelson, another casino magnate who has said he would spend upward of $100 million to back Mr. Trump. Mr. Adelson and Mr. Trump met on Tuesday, their second meeting in the last few weeks. Mr. Rove has talked with Mr. Adelson about what super PAC to use as a vehicle for donating such a large sum of money to support Mr. Trump, including possibly using the Crossroads   groups, which he helped establish, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.
