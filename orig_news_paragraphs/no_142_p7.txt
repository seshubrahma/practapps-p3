Ms. Holliday is a Broadway icon, renowned for her performance as Effie in the original cast of "Dreamgirls," and she returned to Broadway this season as a replacement Shug Avery in the revival of "The Color Purple. " The final performance of that show was Sunday, and the Clintons were in the audience. Ms. Holliday said she was asked on Wednesday if she would sing at the concert scheduled for Jan. 19, and she agreed, seeing the request as similar to those she received to sing at the White House during past Republican and Democratic presidencies.
