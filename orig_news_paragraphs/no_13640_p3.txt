For anyone who views those pesky California ballots, referendums, and initiatives as inconsequential, remember that California voters once removed a sitting governor at the ballot box. The Gray Davis recall occurred before Kaepernick reached voting age, but based on his track record he probably wouldn’t have shown up for that, either. Kaepernick not voting in any of the Obama elections stands out as the real offense here. He claimed this election as nothing more than a contest to see "who’s less racist," calling both Trump and Clinton racist.
