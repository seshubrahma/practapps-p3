Trump: ’ We don’t want them here’ The executive order was quickly decried as a "Muslim ban" by Democrats, human rights organizations and advocacy groups, who slammed Trump for instituting a policy they say cuts against US values and America’s image around the world as a sanctuary for those fleeing oppression. Trump rejected the criticism, insisting Saturday that the new policy did not amount to "a Muslim ban" like the one he called for in December 2015 in the heat of the Republican primary campaign.
