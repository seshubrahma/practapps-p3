A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries. Originally conceived as a   educational program, the series began in 1963 and, with the exception of a   gap ( ) has been broadcast since. The show is a national institution in Britain and a cult favorite elsewhere in the world, with more than 800 episodes (a Guinness world record). The Doctor is capable of regenerating, a concept that was introduced to prolong the series when its first lead actor, William Hartnell, left amid failing health.
