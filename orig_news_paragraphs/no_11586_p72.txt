I will tell you my favorite bit, which was when he wrote me a bizarre email claiming I am obsessed with him, the NRA is a white supremacist organization  —   that will come as a shock to Sheriff Clarke, who both frequently works with the NRA and is an actual black man  —   and that the game of pool is a racial symbol. I suppose because the white cue ball hits the colored balls? And if all that wasn’t enough, Shaun King also looks eerily similar to Manny Escuela, a character from Grand Theft Auto 4.   Ironically enough, Manny also feigns a desire to help the   community all while trying to boost his own social status and achieve fame.
