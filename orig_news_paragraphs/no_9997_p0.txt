More fake news from the Weather Channel, which last week attacked Breitbart for writing the truth about global cooling, and which has now launched a similarly politicized and gratuitous attack on the Florida sugar cane industry. [Florida sugar growers, it claims in a     fronted by its toothsome Hit Girl presenter Kait Parker, are responsible for the outbreak of toxic algae blooms on Lake Okeechobee in the summer.   If true, fair or accurate this would represent serious investigative journalism: the algae, which invaded a   mile section of the Florida’s largest lake in May this year, caused havoc to the local economy and environment, killing fish and other wildlife, poisoning water supplies, closing beaches (on Florida’s Treasure Coast) and causing sickness in humans. Clearly, if the sugar cane industry is responsible then something needs to be done.
