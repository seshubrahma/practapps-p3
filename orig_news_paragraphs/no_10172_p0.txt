BEIRUT (Reuters)   —   Donald Trump’s election as U. S. president on Wednesday drew concern among Syrian rebel groups and a degree of optimism in Damascus, where his victory was seen as a better outcome than a Hillary Clinton win. [Syrian rebels have long been fiercely critical of what they perceive as the Obama administration’s inadequate backing for their fight against President Bashar   though Washington has been an important sponsor of the uprising.   But Trump’s statements on Syria, and his more   stance toward Assad’s ally Russia, have fueled rebel concern about the policy he may adopt on Syria’s conflict, in which the Russian air force has been bombing insurgents.
