White House press secretary Josh Earnest warns that heightened   rhetoric in the presidential campaign is helping terrorists defeat the Obama administration’s "war of narratives" against the Islamic State. ["In some ways this is actually just a war of narratives, and so we want to make sure that we get out our counter narrative against ISIL and we’re having some progress," Earnest said during an appearance on MSNBC, urging Americans to stop blaming terrorist acts on Muslims.   He urged more moderate American voices to condemn the "poisonous, empty, bankrupt, mythology" of the Islamic state. Earnest made his comments in response to the New York City Manhattan bombing that injured 29 people, as law enforcement officials have discovered additional bombs placed around the city and in New Jersey.
