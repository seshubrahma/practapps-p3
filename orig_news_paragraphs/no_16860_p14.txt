But Evan McMullin, the conservative former Republican staffer who is mounting an independent bid, blasted Pence as a Trump "enabler." "Calls for Pence, Trump’s number one enabler, to replace the nominee may be a feel good exit for GOP leaders, but it isn’t actually feasible," McMullin said. One of the scenarios being played out by GOP party elders is convincing Pence to leave the ticket. Vin Weber, a former Jeb Bush supporter, says he would "absolutely" call for Pence to leave the ticket as a way to put "immeasurable pressure" on Trump to leave the race.
