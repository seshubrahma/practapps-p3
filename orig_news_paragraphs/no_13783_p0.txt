Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief John Podesta called today ’s decision by FBI Director James Comey to   the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server "extraordinary," in an apparent change of heart since the Clinton campaign praised Comey’s decision to clear her of any wrongdoing back in July. ["It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining," Podesta said in a statement.
