Tuesday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," former Gov. Jeb Bush ( ) a candidate for the 2016 Republican nomination, discussed a report from The Washington Post that in a private meeting he had with Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. In that meeting, Romney had reportedly said he thought Jeb Bush was "unfairly burdened" by his brother former President George W. Bush ’s legacy.   Bush downplayed that critique, calling his brother "probably the most popular president" among Republicans and that he was honored to be a part of that family.
