These foreign graduates are eager to take U. S. jobs, even at very low salaries, partly because the U. S. government supplements their salaries with the chance to win the very valuable reward of U. S. citizenship for themselves, their children, siblings and parents. That   supplement allows companies to hire foreign workers for much less money than requested by young   American graduates. The hidden subsidy for foreign graduates makes it difficult for American graduates to compete against foreign graduates for many jobs that don’t require direct cooperation with customers. Obama’s pending regulation is beneficial, according to the regulation, because it encourages "skilled nonimmigrant workers contributing to the economy to continue seeking LPR [Green Card] status   …     Allows [foreign] dependents to enter labor market earlier and contribute to [guest workers’s] household income   …     [and] may expand the numbers of [Green Card] petitioners that are cap exempt and thus allow certain employers greater access to   workers," says the new regulation, which was drafted by the Department of Homeland Security, which runs much of the   program.
