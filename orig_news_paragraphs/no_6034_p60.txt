For that, I would point you to the type of California that the people of the California National Party would like to establish. Frankly, I would rather California remain a US state than to be put into the hands of the people of the CNP, who, as I stated, canâ€™t follow their own bylaws (how can we trust them to abide by the constitution?) who are willing to suspect due process out of convenience, whose leadership supports capital punishment for white collar crimes, and who at least one of their key members   the "Chairman" at "California Communist Socialist Party of the USA" and the "Deputy General Secretary at Communist Socialist Party of the USA". These people are not in this for the right reasons, they have actively worked to undermine our effort, and the people of California should be wary of them.
