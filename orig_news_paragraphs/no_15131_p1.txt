The strike in Nangarhar province near the Pakistan border killed 36 ISIS fighters, Afghan officials said. The US military previously estimated ISIS had 600 to 800 active fighters in the area but was unclear whether it had hoped to strike more.   The blast destroyed three underground tunnels as well as weapons and ammunition, but no civilians were hurt, Afghan and US officials said. However, ISIS denied that any of its fighters were killed or injured, according to a statement in Arabic distributed by the terror groupâ€™s media wing, Amaq News Agency.
