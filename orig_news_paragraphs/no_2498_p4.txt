In a   telephone interview with a morning television news show, Mr. Trump said Mitt Romney remained a candidate for secretary of state and denied any responsibility for dividing the nation. Mr. Trump did not dispute the interviewer’s comparison of campaign promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants who kill and rape Americans to comments made by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, about annihilating drug dealers and users. Our photojournalist documented 57 homicides over 35 days in Mr. Duterte’s bloody crackdown. (Warning: graphic images.)
