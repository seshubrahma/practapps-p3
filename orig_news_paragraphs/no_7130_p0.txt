Disney CEO Bob Iger, one of the few entertainment industry executives asked to attend President Donald Trump’s policy forum at the White House this week, will not be attending the event. [UPDATE: A Disney representative emails to clarify that Iger was unable to attend the policy forum because the White House changed its date from Thursday, February 2nd, to Friday, February 3rd. A Disney Board of Directors meeting had been scheduled for the 3rd long before the forum’s organization.
