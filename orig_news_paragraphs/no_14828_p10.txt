When US Defense Secretary James Mattis visited last month, he said what South Koreans wanted to hear     that Washington promised an "overwhelming" response to any attack mounted by North Korea. Officials will be looking for statements along the same lines from Tillerson. Tillerson also arrives at a time when Seoul claims Beijing is punishing it economically for agreeing to install THAAD, the US missile defense system that Washington says is needed to counter the North Korean missile threat.   With Park now out of the picture, he’ll also be seeking assurances that South Korea’s new leader honors the agreement.
