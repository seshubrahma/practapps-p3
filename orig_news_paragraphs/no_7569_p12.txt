The party of Lincoln indeed.   The only thing morally bankrupt here are those who continue to turn a blind eye to these evils, and proclaim it is the market’s invisible hand at work and not the truth that it is shady   political trade deals that are nothing more than crony capitalism writ large.     The question that conservatives must answer in the   debate over President Barack Obama’s proposal to rewrite the rules for the world’s economy through the   Partnership is whether following General Electric’s agenda to flatten the world’s regulatory regimes to produce efficiencies in manufacturing and labor is in the interests of the United States?   The only moral conservative position is to change the U. S. tax laws and regulatory regimes to make it advantageous for job creators to expand operations here in America.
