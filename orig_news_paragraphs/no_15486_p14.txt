The decision to fire James Comey and the string of lies that followed that decision feel different to many observers. President Trump seems to have really slipped into the realm of President Richard Nixon.   There is ample evidence to suggest that the President either lashed out at Comey because he was angry about the Russia investigation or, even worse, is attempting to cover this up and obstruct the investigation. When Trump threatened Comey in a tweet, it was impossible not to feel like this was 1974 all over again.
