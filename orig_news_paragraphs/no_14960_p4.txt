Soldiers with U. S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division are deploying to give more help to the Iraqis.   A U. S. defense official says the number of American troops going is in the low hundreds.    "The Military Times" reports that there are more than 6, 000 U. S. troops now serving in Iraq and though they’re officially there to advise and assist Iraqi forces, some of the Americans are believed to be close to the fighting if not directly in it. Another way the U. S. is supporting Iraq in the battle is through airpower.
