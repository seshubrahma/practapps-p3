Months later, Mr. Shenker filed for bankruptcy, citing $184 million in obligations. About that time, Mr. Puzder and Mr. Murphy left his firm, which limped along until Mr. Shenker was indicted on bankruptcy and tax fraud charges in 1989. He died later that year. During the bankruptcy case, government lawyers were able to extract $26 million for the pension fund, Mr. Temchine said.
