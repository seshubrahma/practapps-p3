That is 24 million jobs, nine million more than 10 years ago. Many of these jobs are poorly paid. A 2008 study by Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Ethan Kaplan, then at the Institute for International Economic Studies at Stockholm University, found that outsourcing imposed a wage penalty of up to 7 percent for janitors and up to 24 percent for security guards. The Government Accountability Office of Congress concluded that contingent workers in the education field  —   substitute teachers, adjuncts and the like  —   earn almost 14 percent less per hour.
