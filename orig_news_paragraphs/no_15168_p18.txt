Trump, for instance, praised China last week for sending back a fleet of coal ships to North Korea, in line with international sanctions on the Stalinist state’s exports adopted during the Obama administration. Beijing is determined to avoid any action that could trigger the chaotic downfall of his regime and send refugees fleeing across the border into China. China also wants to avoid the eventual scenario of a unified Korea, which could produce a   nation on its frontier and change the complexion of Northeast Asia’s security architecture in favor of the United States. And for all its hawkish rhetoric, the Trump administration is also constrained by the delicate military balance that has prevailed on the Korean peninsula for 60 years.
