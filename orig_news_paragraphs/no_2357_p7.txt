The federal law Mr. Kasowitz cited does not appear to apply to state returns. In any event, the federal law is a criminal one that does not appear to authorize private civil suits. Mr. Kasowitz did not respond to a request for comment, and it may be that there is a statute or legal theory in one of the four jurisdictions in question that allows the lawsuit he described. Even if that is so, the First Amendment poses a very high barrier to any such litigation.
