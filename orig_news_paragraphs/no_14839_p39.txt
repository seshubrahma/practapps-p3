Mexico City policy, Implemented by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City policy, or Global Gag Rule, blocks US funding to   organizations that perform or promote abortions. Since Reagan instituted the rule, itâ€™s   in and out of existence depending on the political party of the President. Obama rescinded the rule, and on January 23, Trump reinstituted it. Kaiser Family Foundation has a guide that outlines the history of the policy.
