Some of Clinton’s top aides    including those who travel with her    have been felled with respiratory issues in the last month, sources tell CNN. At least three senior aides have been ill, including at least one of whom was hospitalized and treated for dehydration. Clinton’s spokesman Nick Merrill said she was feeling better on Monday but was following her doctor’s recommendation to stay home and rest. Aides said the Democratic nominee would work on debate prep for her debate clash with Trump    and event that takes on even more significance in the light of Clinton’s health episode.
