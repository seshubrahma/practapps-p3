Buryakov’s former employer made headlines this week when the White House acknowledged that Kushner had an undisclosed meeting with VEB Chairman Sergey Gorkov in December 2016, at the request of Russia’s ambassador to the US. Gorkov is a graduate of the Russian academy of Federal Security Service, which trains people to work in Russia’s intelligence and security forces. He was appointed to his job at VEB by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting raised questions because the bank has been under US sanctions since 2014    and because Kushner spent years as a real estate developer and was trying to attract financing for a building project in Manhattan.
