Then there’s the media. I wrote this in 2015 in a draft and find it applicable today: Is Trump the one who makes media especially the left wing at Univision, Telemundo, MSNBC and others shudder? As we recently saw in his handling of MSNBC’s   on illegal immigration it appeared more like a stutter? Love him, hate him or something in between, apparently Trump will not be trampled over by bully media.
