From Mark Levin, writing at Conservative Review:   A little while back, I argued that Marco Rubio’s tactics in attacking Ted Cruz’s Senate record on immigration and national defense, among other things, were Alinskyite.   They were and still are simply and demonstrably dishonest.   Yet he persists, knowing full well that by the time the truth catches up with him, if ever, the damage will have been done.
