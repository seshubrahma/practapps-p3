CureViolence is another   program that trains previously incarcerated individuals to serve as "interrupters" who help identify conflicts and high risk individuals in their own neighborhoods to mobilize the community to change norms.   To truly combat urban violence, however, we need a new commitment from all city leaders and stakeholders   —   business leaders, educators and researchers, philanthropists and public officials  —   not just law enforcement or the neighborhoods most immediately affected.   The best   tool is a job, and city leaders must engage businesses to support jobs and mentorship programs to youth drawn from the most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
