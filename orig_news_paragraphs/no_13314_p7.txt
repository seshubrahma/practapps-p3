People in almost every political group and demographic believe that Americans who play by the rules should get a fair shake from The System. (Remember President Obama’s constant hosannas to "the people who work hard and play by the rules," which mysteriously stopped right around the time the primary contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders began heating up?) The questions in the   poll are largely pitched from this perspective of fairness: existing citizens shouldn’t lose large numbers of jobs due to either legal or illegal immigration, existing citizens should have first crack at jobs before foreign guest workers are brought in, the needs of American workers should outweigh the demands of companies looking for cheap labor, illegal immigrants shouldn’t be rewarded with citizenship schemes that put them ahead of those trying to immigrate legally, government funds should be spent on rebuilding American cities instead of providing benefits for foreign nationals. The critic of "populist" immigration reform decries such results as evidence of selfishness or chauvinism, but for many people, it’s all about that fair shake.
