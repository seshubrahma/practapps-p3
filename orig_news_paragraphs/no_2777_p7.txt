I suspect that a few pollsters will ultimately field surveys, but there won’t be many. At first glance, the state looks as if it should be a good one for Mr. Trump. It’s a mostly   state with   educational attainment among white voters, which has been a strong correlate for Trump support. He has run well in states along or near the Ohio River, including Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky.
