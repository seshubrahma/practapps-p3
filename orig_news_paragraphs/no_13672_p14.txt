Todayâ€™s films, television and music further split us apart under the guise of leading us toward an enlightened civilization, while in fact it is all about an agenda that erases God and Country from our discourse and replaces them with a teardown of the American experience, erases institutions and replaces them with a    pantheism. Take the current rioters: while some are subversive anarchists, bought and paid for by George Soros, there are others who are absolutely sincere in their protest. But those sincere souls I believe are protesting because of a failure, or should I say deliberate attempt, by   educators to not fairly teach but to propagandize and preach to students. I wrote about this danger several years ago.
