Allendale, New Jersey (CNN) J. Brien Comey had an important visitor coming to his home here in this quiet suburban town on Saturday. Reached by phone Saturday morning about an interview, the father of former FBI Director James Comey expressed a willingness to speak to a CNN reporter. But he was expecting "company," he said, and asked that the reporter call back in a few hours.
