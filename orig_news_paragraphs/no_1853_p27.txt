Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who was elected to her first term in Congress on Tuesday representing part of Seattle, said that whispers of what might be called West Coast values  —   particularly a higher minimum wage   —   found echoes on Tuesday in states like Arizona that also voted for Mr. Trump. West Coast states, she said, should look for those allies and cultivate them. Voters in Colorado, Maine and Washington State also voted to raise their minimum wages.
