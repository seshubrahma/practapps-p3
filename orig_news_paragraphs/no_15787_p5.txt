Members of Congress have asked to see the memos, but it is unclear whether Comey intends to read from them    or hand them over    to Congress. As CNN reported last week, while Comey was "disturbed" by his meetings with the President, he "thought he had the situation under control" because he felt the President did not quite grasp the inappropriateness of his actions. Comey believed, according to one source familiar with his thinking, that the President could be "trained" about how you do and do not interact with an FBI director.
