By 2014, the average income of half of American adults had barely budged, remaining around $16, 000, while members of the top 1 percent brought home, on average, $1, 304, 800 or 81 times as much. That ratio, the authors point out, "is similar to the gap between the average income in the United States and the average income in the worldâ€™s poorest countries, the   Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Burundi. " The growth of incomes has probably increased a bit since 2014, the latest year for which full data exists, said Mr. Zucman, who, like Mr. Saez, also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.
