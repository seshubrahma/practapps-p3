" Mr. Johnston, who has followed the real estate impresario for nearly three decades, offers a searing indictment of his business practices and creative accounting. He examines Mr. Trumpâ€™s taste for debt, what associates have described as his startling capacity for recklessness, multiple corporate bankruptcies, dealings with reputed mobsters and accusations of fraud. The portrait of Mr. Trump that emerges from these books, old or new, serious or satirical, is remarkably consistent: a   narcissist, almost comically   a "hyperbole addict who prevaricates for fun and profit," as Mr. Singer wrote in The New Yorker in 1997.
