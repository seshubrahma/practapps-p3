All the Christian leaders who spoke to Breitbart News congratulated Mr. Trump for being elected president of the United States on November 8. Syriac Catholic Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem Joseph III Younan told Breitbart News he is optimistic Mr. Trump will secure a safe future for Christianity in its historical cradle, the Middle East.
