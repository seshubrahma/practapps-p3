So please notice me    which we are. Or Rand Paul (polling at 7%) taking center stage in the Senate to oppose renewal of the Patriot Act in an   Brother, happily libertarian moment. Or appearing on MSNBC to say that the rise of ISIS is actually due to overzealous GOP hawks   â€”   an    move that takes his whole brand of noninterventionism to a different level
