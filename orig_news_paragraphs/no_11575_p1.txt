The policy will also mandate that officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) be barred from the Duke University campus unless a warrant is given. Under the policy, illegal immigrant students who cannot find work due to laws such as   which Trump has promised to enforce, will have their university expenses paid for. Duke student Senator Olivia Simpson proudly touted the sanctuary campus policy as one that riffed off sanctuary city policies, which shield illegal immigrants from being turned over to federal immigration officials even after theyâ€™re suspected of committing a crime. " [A sanctuary campus] is a safe space for undocumented students, wherein the University will not outwardly support measures to harm or deport its students," Simpson told the Duke Chronicle.
