I am making a moral declaration about our political system, so the person should respond and engage with that on a moral level.   Should people be able to cancel the election if they don’t like the result?   Should we have a system that has a safety valve, where if the people don’t like the direction of the country, you can cancel their vote, you can put in a double agent delegate?"
