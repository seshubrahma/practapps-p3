Over the past few years, while the MSM has been lavishing attention on, say, Occupy Wall Street and #BlackLivesMatter, the working class has been gathering in its anger —  and in its plan for political revenge.   Yes, sadly, the   trend of declining incomes (according to the Pew Center, the share of national income for the middle class fell from 62 percent in 1970 to 43 percent today) and even declining health (according to two Princeton economists, life expectancy for   and   whites is actually declining) merited only the scantest of attention from the chattering classes —  until this year, when the Trump voters took history into their hands.   Indeed, even now, as Trump seems headed for victory, the condescension from up above is obtusely thick. National Review magazine, for example, has taken a principled orthodox conservative position against Trump, and that’s a fair stance, given Trump’s obvious lack of orthodoxy.
