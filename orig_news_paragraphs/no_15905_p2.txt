Later, that position was contradicted by the President himself, in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, when he stated that he had made up his mind to fire Comey before he had even seen  the Rosenstein memo. In the same interview the President suggested that he was thinking about the Russia investigation at the time he terminated Comey. On the following day in an Oval Office meeting with Russian officials, the President described his FBI chief as a "nut job" and "crazy" and expressed relief that the "pressure " of the Russia investigation had been lifted by the firing of Comey.   In a move that surprised and angered the President, new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an early and ardent supporter off the Trump campaign, had recused himself from any aspect of the FBI’s then ongoing investigation into the Russian alleged hacking of the presidential election and whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the Russians in their   efforts.
