There are two explanations for the halt, which are not mutually exclusive: either the Obama administration made a decision to refrain from strikes or the cessation derives from a lack of need or opportunity to conduct strikes. The number of strikes in Pakistan has consistently declined since their peak of 122 strikes or about ten per month in 2010. In an October interview, President Obama said he was "troubled" early in his presidency by "the way in which the number of drone strikes was going up."   Yet beyond Pakistan, there is little evidence that the Obama administration has reined in its air wars against terrorist groups.
