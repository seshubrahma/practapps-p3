The November contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is likely to be one of the closest elections since the 2000 contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore. In that election, Al Gore was trying to succeed Bill Clinton, whose approval rating was   percent ahead of the election, and benefited from a relatively healthy economy. (The economy didnâ€™t dip into a recession until after the election.) In 2000, in fact, the top issue for voters was Education, followed by the economy and health care.
