An Hispanic woman named Ruth, who said she moved in the 1980s from Mexico and became a citizen, said she was at the Sanders rally because she believes he is the only candidate who can help people like her and her husband. She told Breitbart News her husband couldn’t make it to the rally because he had to work and said he is a member of Union 13, the fish canneries’ workers’ union.
