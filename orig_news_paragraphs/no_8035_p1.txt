The event is sold out and the main ballroom, which seats more than 700 people, isn’t large enough for the full crowd. South Carolina Tea Party activist Joe Dugan, the convention’s executive producer, tells Breitbart News the group has created an extra, overflow room that will broadcast the major speeches from the ballroom —  and speakers will head down there to mingle with event attendees after their speeches. There’s overwhelming interest outside the convention as well. Event organizers tell Breitbart News that the group’s website has cratered under immense traffic many times leading up to this weekend, due to the widespread statewide and national interest in the convention.
