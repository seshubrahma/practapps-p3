’  ’ ’   LONDON (Reuters)   U. S.    Donald Trump will propose   offering to end sanctions imposed on Russia for its annexation of   Crimea in return for a nuclear arms reduction deal with Russian   President Vladimir Putin, he told The Times of London. ’ ’   Trump, in an interview with the newspaper published online on   Sunday, was deeply critical of previous U. S. foreign policy,   describing the invasion of Iraq as possibly the gravest error in   the history of the United States and akin to "throwing rocks into   a beehive". ’ ’
