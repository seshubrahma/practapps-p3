It’s been an integral part of my life since the early 1980s. I’m roughly fluent in Italian, my children are all dual citizens and, for better or for worse, Italy is home.    If "No" does win, the worry is that it will send all the wrong signals to foreign investors and financial markets: First, that Italy is simply unwilling to reform and to tear down its great wall of red tape.   Second, if the referendum fails and Prime Minister Renzi makes good on his vow to resign, Italy will plunge headlong into a period of political instability.
