According to Discover the Networks, CREW has also been funded by the   Tides Foundation. In August 2014, longtime Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, founder of the heavily   Media Matters for America progressive group, was elected chairman of CREW’s board. Brock departed the organization last December, but Politico reported over the weekend that CREW is part of a network of groups for which the activist is attempting to raise $40 million to take on Trump. Politico reported from a fundraiser Saturday in Aventura, Florida: The constellation of political groups in Democratic strategist David Brock’s network are aiming to raise roughly $40 million in 2017, the Clinton    ally told roughly 120 donors gathered here on Saturday.   …    Brock’s groups include Media Matters, a liberal news media watchdog ShareBlue, a liberal news site American Bridge, the party’s primary opposition research organization and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) which carries out legal actions.
