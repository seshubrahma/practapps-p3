CNN’s Jake Tapper and Brian Stelter made sure to fact check a Twitter typo from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before the polls closed on Tuesday.   Trump quoted CNN in a tweet about "voting machine problems" in Utah. The tweet used the word "country" instead of "county," and the gumshoes at CNN were all over it! Just out according to @CNN: "Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country"  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2016,
