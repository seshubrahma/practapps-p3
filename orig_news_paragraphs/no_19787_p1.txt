After years of steady growth, the NFL’s average television audience fell 8 percent from the previous season. After the election, the NFL’s ratings perked up a bit, but were still    through the end of the season and even through this past weekend. The audience for Saturday night’s playoff game between the Detroit Lions and the Seattle Seahawks was 20 percent below first Saturday night playoff game of 2015. At best, televised football is no longer a growth industry, but merely a strong business that has peaked.
