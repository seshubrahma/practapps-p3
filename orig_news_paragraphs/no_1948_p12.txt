Mr. Huckabee, who said during the 2008 presidential campaign that Mr. Romney reminded voters of "the guy who laid them off," told Fox News on Wednesday that picking Mr. Romney would be "a real insult" to Mr. Trumpâ€™s supporters. Mr. Giuliani is a favorite of the Republican voters who turned out in large numbers to lift Mr. Trump to victory. Sean Hannity, a Fox News host whose opinion Mr. Trump often privately solicits, has also been deeply critical of Mr. Romney on his show. Shortly after the election, Mr. Giuliani told associates that he believed the job was his.
