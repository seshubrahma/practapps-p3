The speaker wrote that he was concerned by media reports filed by reporters traveling with the president in Lima, Peru describing Obama’s ambitions to bolster his arrangement with Iran, specifically how that arrangement supports the Iranian economy.    Donald J. Trump described the president’s arrangement with Iran as one of the worst deals ever made between the United States and another country. Because the president did not call his arrangement a treaty and submit it to the Senate for ratification, it does not have the same weight as a treaty. The Iran deal was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by Obama, so Trump cannot simply undo the lifting of sanctions and other measures that are now federal law.
