—   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2016, After blasting Sasse and Cruz, Trump then went after Fox News for not mentioning that he raised $6 million for veterans at his event Thursday night, instead of participating in Fox News’s GOP debate. . @FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6, 000, 000 raised in one hour for our VETS.   —
