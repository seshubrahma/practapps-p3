Mr. Pence left most of the   role that is typical of a running mate to Mr. Trump. Instead, he spoke softly and with humility about a   upbringing and his spirituality. He also seemed more mindful than Mr. Trump of the need to present a united front, a particular challenge given the fractured state of the Republican Party and the two candidates’ own considerable differences. He sought to glide over his previous criticism of Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants, choosing instead to criticize Mrs. Clinton’s call to take in more Syrian refugees.
