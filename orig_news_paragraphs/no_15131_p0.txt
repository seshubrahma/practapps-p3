 (CNN) The US military on Friday defended its decision to drop its most powerful   bomb on ISIS positions in Afghanistan, describing it as a "tactical" move. The    Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, or MOAB, was dropped Thursday night on a network of fortified underground tunnels that ISIS had been using to stage attacks on government forces.   The strike in Nangarhar province near the Pakistan border killed 36 ISIS fighters, Afghan officials said.
