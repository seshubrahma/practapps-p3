An audio recording of Mr. Bentley, said to be in conversation with the woman, Rebekah Caldwell Mason, was leaked and left Alabama residents listening to the governor utter phrases like "when I stand behind you and I put my arms around you and I put my hands on your breasts. " Mr. Bentley, whose wife of 50 years filed for divorce in August 2015, said he had apologized for "any conversations and behavior that was inappropriate," but he insisted that he had not had a physical relationship with Mrs. Mason. Mrs. Mason, who declined to comment and whose husband leads the Governor’s Office of   and Volunteer Service, resigned as Mr. Bentley’s senior political adviser soon after the governor’s public acknowledgment of misconduct.
