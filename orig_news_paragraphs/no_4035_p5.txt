I can say so with authority because I closed a Canadian factory in 2015 while with Neptune and brought those jobs back to America —   more profitably I might add. While with Tyden and SPX, I moved Mexican and Chinese factory jobs back to the U. S. —  again more profitably. I’d do so again in a heartbeat.
