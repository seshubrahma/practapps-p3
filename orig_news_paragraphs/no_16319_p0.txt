 (CNN) Although the intense criticism over Donald Trump’s personal, intolerant, and wrongful criticism of the family of a fallen American soldier in Iraq has taken center stage, the media coverage    typically focusing on the sensational    misses important issues that only Trump has had the political courage to bring forward to the American people.    The reality is that by injecting themselves into the American presidential campaign by criticizing a candidate in the highly political arena of the Democratic National Convention, the Khan family opened itself up to some pushback from the target of their criticism.   As usual, where Trump erred was by going personal in his criticism, bringing up the irrelevant and stereotypic criticism of Ghazala Khan that she had to let her husband, Khizr Khan, do all the talking during the convention speech.
