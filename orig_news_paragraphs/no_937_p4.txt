Jillian Rogers, a spokeswoman for the Labor Department, declined to comment when asked why OSHA had not issued any such releases. But she said that the agencyâ€™s enforcement efforts were unchanged and that such efforts were "reflected across various media channels," like newsletters and social media. " The Department of Labor is continuing to operate business as usual, including enforcement operations," Ms. Rogers said.
