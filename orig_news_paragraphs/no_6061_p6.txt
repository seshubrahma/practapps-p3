Netflix talk show host Chelsea Handler is leading her own   rally in Park City, Utah which will coincide with the march at the nation’s capital. While Women’s March on Washington organizers say the event "is an evolving effort originally founded by white women," activists of races and genders are expected to attend. Nevertheless, the rally has been marked by racial tension. On Wednesday, the NAACP of Portland said the group voted to withdraw its support of the Women’s March on Portland, a satellite   protest.
