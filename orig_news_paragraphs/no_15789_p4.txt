DHS has yet to select its top proposals.   After being rebuffed by Congress for money to build any wall in fiscal year 2017, the administration has asked appropriators for $1. 6 billion to build 74 miles in 2018, according to DHS: 32 miles of wall in the Rio Grande Valley, 28 miles for levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley and 14 miles of replacement for secondary fencing in San Diego. While Trump has discussed a concrete wall dozens of feet high, Kelly has told Congress that Border Patrol agents on the ground say different solutions may be better    especially that any border barrier should be   so agents can have an understanding of what is happening on the other side.   Kelly also testified before the Senate this spring that the wall would not stretch "from sea to shining sea," but would be placed selectively where it made the most strategic sense.
