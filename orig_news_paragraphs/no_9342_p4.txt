Failed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney announced he would vote for Cruz leading into the Utah primary. Cruz won Utah with an overwhelming almost 70 per cent on Tuesday. Romneyâ€™s choice was not made for lack of trying to boost Rubio or Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Romney stumped for both Rubio and Kasich ahead of the March 15 Florida and Ohio primaries with robocalls for each and an   appearance for Kasich.
