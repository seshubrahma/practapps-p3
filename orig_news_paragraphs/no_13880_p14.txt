According to both Howard and Lauren Hersch Nicholas, an assistant professor of health economics at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, the study results are similar to previous studies that looked at health care utilization: Generally, it is known that when people have to pay more for medical care, they get less of it.   However, said Nicholas, who was also not involved in the study, the "study does not provide enough information to know whether the observed trends over time are due to the ACA changes or any number of other changes," such as differences in the health of patients or their awareness of screening. Howard agreed. "
