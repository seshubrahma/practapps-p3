We are on track to have EVERY Door canvassed before the general election with over   of those completed prior to the start of early voting. We managed to get an all call out to county central committee people to canvass their own precincts, especially in the 3 cities, however many of those folks are backers of the State Central Committee person and will likely NOT be distributing Trump lit or knocking on doors. The state party did not immediately return a request for comment for this report. Trump seized control of the Ohio ground game from Kasich last month.
