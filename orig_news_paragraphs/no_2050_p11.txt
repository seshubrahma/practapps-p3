Gen. Jon K. Mott of the Air Force, a senior operations officer from the Pentagon’s Central Command, was recently dispatched to the Turkish Army’s operations center in Ankara to help coordinate the war effort and defuse any conflicts with the Kurds. Pentagon officials are also toning down their vocal support for Kurdish fighters to avoid further inflaming Turkish domestic political sensitivities about any collaboration between Turkish troops and Kurdish fighters. Addressing the Manama Dialogue, a conference here sponsored by the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Mr. Carter defended the Obama administration’s security commitment in the Persian Gulf, and the Middle East more broadly, but repeatedly scolded Middle Eastern partners for failing to provide more military muscle in the broader campaign to defeat the Islamic State and counter extremism. Without singling out any country by name, Mr. Carter suggested that the United States had been the target of disingenuous criticism from "regional powers here in the Middle East" for not doing more to help fight extremism.
