British Prime Minister Theresa May said the action was an "appropriate response" to the "barbaric" chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime. UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon noted that the strike was a United States operation, "but let me emphasize again we fully support it. " " This strike was very limited to one airfield, it was entirely appropriate, itâ€™s designed to deter the regime from carrying out further chemical weapons attacks," he said.
