GLEP opposes SB 826 through their partnership with the Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards. DeVos has funded and served on the board of GLEP, an organization that promotes school choice and is a supporter of Common Core. " We appreciate the work of the State Senate in supporting the Common Core State Standards, which we believe will make our students more competitive in a global economy," said Gary Naeyaert, executive director at GLEP, in October of 2013.
