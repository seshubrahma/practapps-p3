John McCain has always had one foot across the aisle, but now the other is in the political grave. The very fact that he is thinking about running as an independent shows how endangered he is in the primary now that he is facing a conservative champion who will finally mix the mortar to fix the border. McCain was almost John Kerryâ€™s Vice Presidential nominee in 2004. After he loses his primary, he would be a prime contender for Secretary of Defense in a potential Clinton administration due to his lenient stance on terrorist interrogation.
