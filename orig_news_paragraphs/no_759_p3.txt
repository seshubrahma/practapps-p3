Mr. Trumpâ€™s top advisers huddled in the White House this weekend to work on his Tuesday night   address. They focused on a single, often overlooked message amid the chaos of his first weeks in the White House: the assertion that the   candidate is now a president determined to keep audacious campaign promises on immigration, the economy and the budget, no matter how sloppy or disruptive it looks from the outside. " They might not agree with everything you do, but people will respect you for doing what you said you were going to do," said Jason Miller, a top communications strategist on the Trump campaign who remains close to the White House.
