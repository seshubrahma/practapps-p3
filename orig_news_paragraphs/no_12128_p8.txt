The Miami Herald reported that Ernesto Perez, who owns the   Dade Medical College, surrendered on Tuesday and plans to plead guilty for illegally bundling campaign contributions. He will likely serve one day in jail and pay a $200, 000 fine  …      Rubio got a particularly large windfall from Perez. In 2013 he contributed $15, 000 to the Florida senator’s political ambitions —  $10, 000 to his leadership PAC and $5, 000 to his principal campaign committee.
