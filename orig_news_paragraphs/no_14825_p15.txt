Italy   While several European nations have said no to populism, a referendum in Italy on constitutional changes was widely seen as a victory for rising populist fringe parties.   In December, Matteo Renzi resigned as Prime Minister after conceding an "extraordinarily clear" defeat in the referendum. He had promised the reforms would help revive Italyâ€™s lagging economy, but voters used the opportunity to push him out, setting the scene for a possible snap general election this year, if not one in 2018.
