But illegal immigration across the southern border has fallen dramatically in recent years.   According to Customs and Border Protection, 415, 816 people were caught trying to enter the country illegally in the fiscal year that ended last September. Of those, 408, 870 were caught trying to cross the southern border.   That national figure is less than half the 1. 1 million people caught on average annually between 1980 and 2008.
