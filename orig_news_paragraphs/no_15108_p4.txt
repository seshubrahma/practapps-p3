In Tuesday’s special election, Democratic early vote was almost twice as large as that for Republicans, according to figures provided to me by a prominent Republican pollster. That’s a sure sign of a base enthusiasm disparity. And in a district where there are typically twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats, early vote was 44. 5% Democratic and 43. 5% Republican.   Republicans appeared to do just enough in the final days to drive their voters to the polls a visit to Wichita on Monday by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as well as   from Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and a $100, 000 ad buy by the House Republican campaign committee may have done just enough.
