What she said: Harth and her   George Houraney, entered into a business venture with Donald Trump which included holding an event at one of the real estate magnate’s Atlantic City casinos. Donald Trump made unwanted sexual advances towards her, including groping her under her skirt on two different occasions in 1992 and 1993 during their initial meetings, according to Harth’s lawyer, Lisa Bloom.   What Trump said: Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement to CNN: "Mr. Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth. These 24 year old allegations lack any merit or veracity, as evidenced by her repeated requests for employment, attempts to seek out Mr. Trump, and her support of Mr. Trump’s candidacy."
