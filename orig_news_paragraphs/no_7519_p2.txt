Both Bush and Kasich have spent millions on advertising in New Hampshire and have each made dozens of appearances in the state that puts a high value on direct, retail politicking.   New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose affiliated super PAC has also spent considerable money on advertising, is third with 11 percent. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has spent relatively little time campaigning in New Hampshire, is a close 4th with 9. 7 percent. Rubio is 5th with 8.
