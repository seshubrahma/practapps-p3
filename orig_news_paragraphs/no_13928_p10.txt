Rubio’s questions to Tillerson on Wednesday were consistent with the way he has approached foreign policy throughout his career. He took exception to Tillerson taking refuge in the fact that he had not yet had classified briefings on many human rights questions, judging that the nominee fell short of the sharp moral clarity Rubio believes should underpin America’s engagement with the world. What the last 48 hours told us about Trump’s next 4 years, The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has often viewed America’s foreign policy through the prism of human rights and a deep antipathy towards communism and authoritarian governments. He has spoken out in favor of Chinese dissidents, branded Russian President Vladimir Putin a "gangster" and pushed for democratic reforms in the Western Hemisphere in particular.
