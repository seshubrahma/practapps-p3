Kai Newkirk, Democracy Springâ€™s campaign director, told Breitbart News on Thursday that 100 people have confirmed that they will participate in the full march, with activists hailing from 33 states across country.   Each city stop is expected to draw its own pool of local protesters. Newkirk said his organization has secured the help of local churches and residents who are "opening up their homes and establishments, providing food and housing, and some committing to come. "
