Andre Segura, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:30 p. m. on Saturday. He said that the outside section of Central Diner, a restaurant in Terminal 4, was "entirely taken over by attorneys," all working to file petitions for individual clients with the help of the clientsâ€™ families. " There were attorneys from numerous major law firms, nonprofits, all working together," Mr. Segura said.
