The Palestinian Authority reportedly provides compensation to the families of terrorist prisoners incarcerated in Israeli prisons, as well as to those who have killed themselves in attacks on Israeli civilians. The total amount allocated by the Palestinian Authority budget for "the Care for the Families of the Martyrs" was reportedly about $175 million in 2016, and an additional $140 million was reportedly allocated for payments to prisoners and former prisoners. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was also among the first world leaders that President Obama called after taking office in January 2009. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
