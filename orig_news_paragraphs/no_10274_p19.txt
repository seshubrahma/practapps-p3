Carr is best known nationally for his books about South Boston’s own Bulger Brothers  —    Whitey, the leader of a murderous crime organization called the Winter Hill Gang, and Billy, who rose to become the president of the Massachusetts State Senate and for many years was the most powerful politician in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Even at the height of Billy’s power, he was known as "the corrupt midget" in Carr’s columns and on the radio show.
