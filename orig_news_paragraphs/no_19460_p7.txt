A Trump stimulus would also likely be offset by Federal Reserve   action: the Fed could be expected to accelerate its interest rate   increases to stop inflation, and those higher rates would further   crowd out private investment, preventing the economy from   overheating. ’ ’    Of course, Trump could try to pressure the Fed against   tightening, but he does not directly control its actions. Many   Republicans in Congress have an ideological commitment to hawkish   Fed policy and would be unlikely to look kindly on a Trump effort   to pack the Federal Reserve Board with money printers.
