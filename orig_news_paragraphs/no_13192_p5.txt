In the Obama era, conservatism became the dominant   theme of American politics, thanks partly to Palin. However, over time, Palin has found herself increasingly at odds with the conservative establishment itself, parts of which are   —  happy to have her backing, but faintly embarrassed by her and repulsed by her supporters. (Update: Ted Cruz has made his reputation as an   politician, so it would not have been surprising had Palin supported him instead of Trump, simply on ideological grounds. Palin’s reasons for choosing Trump may be more personal than political.
