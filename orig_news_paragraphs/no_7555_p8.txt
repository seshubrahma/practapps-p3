Trump’s initial list of 11 potential Supreme Court justices includes several such judges, and his second list of 10 includes a couple more, if you count Sen. Mike Lee ( ). Top conservative leaders still hope to see a couple more of the greatest conservative minds of this generation added to the list. Of these, their top choice is Solicitor General Paul Clement, perhaps Scalia’s most brilliant and accomplished former law clerk —  having repeatedly saved both the Second Amendment and religious liberty before the Supreme Court, and having led the fight against Obamacare —  and thus a fitting heir to Scalia’s seat on the High Court. Between these choices and the possible addition of a superstar like Clement, Trump could restore the Court to where it stood before Scalia’s passing.
