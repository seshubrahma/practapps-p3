As FDR said on December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor, Always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.   No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. . . . With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph â€”  so help us God. Why, to read those words today, one could be forgiven for thinking that FDR was a Republican!
