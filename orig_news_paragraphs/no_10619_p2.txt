Following the terrorist attack at Pulse nightclub, I was planning on delivering a speech in the nice air conditioning of UCF on the dangers of Islam to the west. But the speech was cancelled.   The police felt they couldnâ€™t protect me from many threats they received. I was perfectly happy to go on with the show my primary concern was speaking.
