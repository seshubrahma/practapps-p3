Chabot talks about Bill Clintonâ€™s impeachment trial and how he argued then that hundreds of people are in jail for perjury and the President should not be above the law. He says it was  a "travesty" that Clinton has not been treated like any American would have been under similar circumstances. " Look what Comey laid out," he says, adding that Comey found that Clinton lied about saying she never sent or received emails marked classified on her private server.
