Indeed, Clintonâ€™s stance on NAFTA (although timid compared with Bill Clinton when he was in office) may have contributed to losses in Michigan and Pennsylvania.    The other trade agreement attacked by Trump during his campaign, the   Partnership, was pretty much declared dead by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the Senate will not move forward with the ratification of this 12 nations agreement. This means NAFTA is pretty much the only trade agreement left that President Trump will be able to give "The Art of the Deal" treatment.
