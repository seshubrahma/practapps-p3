Mr. Wilders, who was convicted in December of inciting discrimination after leading an   chant at a political rally in 2014, has vowed to end Muslim immigration and shutter the country’s mosques if elected prime minister in a general election on March 15. His party has 12 of the 150 seats in the lower house of Parliament. But while ahead in the polls, Mr. Wilders’s lead is narrowing after recent gains by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, a   conservative. Even if his party places first in the election, questions remain about whether Mr. Wilders would be able to successfully form a governing coalition.
