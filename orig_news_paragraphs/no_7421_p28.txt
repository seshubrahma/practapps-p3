That is why we have got to have a, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is   and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud, is serious about making sure the people are not being discouraged to vote, That is why the voting rights legislation that was passed a couple years ago to help the county clerks to make sure that the machines are in place are important. Thatâ€™s why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines, so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after you punched that letter to make sure it has not been hacked into. Those are all part of the process of making sure that our democracy works for everybody. One of the great things about this election has been all the interest that has been taken in this election.
