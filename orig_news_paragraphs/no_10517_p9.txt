â€”   $7. 1 billion, Smithfield Foods got its start during colonial times, making a name for itself by producing quality hams. In 1962, Joseph Luter III became the owner after he inherited the company from his father who had passed away. Later, he sold the company for $20 million to Liberty Equities based in Washington D. C. Due to poor business decisions by Liberty Equities, Luter was summoned by the board of directors as CEO.
