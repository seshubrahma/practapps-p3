With the Trump administration, that’s the philosophy we should take and we should not lock ourselves in one side or the other. And I’m a Democrat, and I say it with all due respect to the Democratic party and the Republican party , this country needs somebody that is going to lead it, not somebody that is going to force us to choose sides. If Donald Trump believes he should be talking about what black Americans have to gain, and as President Obama said and Hillary Clinton said, let’s give him a shot and give him the benefit of the doubt and see if we can find common ground.
