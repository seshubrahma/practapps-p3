None of this makes Clinton a model citizen. From her private     email server at the State Department to her speeches to banks     and other institutions, Clinton has been opaque and unwilling     to divulge details. She is secretive, even when the truth is     far from scandalous, as with her illness this past weekend.      Given this, we should press her for more transparency.
