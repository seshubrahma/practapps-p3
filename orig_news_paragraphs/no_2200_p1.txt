Even some of Mr. Trump’s appearances in battleground states have been tied to  : A New Hampshire rally on Monday night was planned in conjunction with a   in Boston, but both events were canceled after the deadly shooting in Orlando, Fla. on Sunday. Mr. Trump has informed people raising money for his campaign that he is not interested in traveling to states for donor events unless there is a rally scheduled as well, according to the people involved. Those rallies have often garnered Mr. Trump national cable news coverage, the type of news media attention that fueled his primary campaign. But the result for now has been that Mr. Trump is campaigning in states where he has far less risk of being defeated by Mrs. Clinton than states that are likely to be competitive, like Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, Rust Belt states with large numbers of the white   voters who have been most receptive to Mr. Trump’s message.
