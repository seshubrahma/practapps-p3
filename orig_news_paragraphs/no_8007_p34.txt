No one can fault the growing number of German and Austrian citizens who not only believe the government is unwilling to protect them, but is actively fighting against their interests. The established German political parties have experienced a gradual transformation over the past 20 years. In the 1990s, the parties that rule today were politically conservative. As late as 2010, Merkel herself said that "Multiculturalism is a sham" and that it, as a project, multiculturalism had absolutely failed in 2010, referring to Turkish immigrants who entered Germany after World War II who have refused to integrate and created a parallel society in Germany.
