CNN reported at the time that the FBI denied Priebusâ€™ request, although White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at the time that the White House was simply asking the FBI "to tell the truth" in response to reports about Trump campaign communications with Russian officials. Comey did take issue with the February New York Times report during his testimony last week. Comey did not state specifically what he disputed, and The New York Times stood by its story. The White House and FBI did not respond to requests for comment.
