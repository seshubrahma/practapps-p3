The Justice Department will defend President Trump from a new lawsuit that accuses him of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and business operations to accept payments from foreign governments, officials said on Monday. But while Mr. Trump said on Monday that the case was "without merit," a Justice Department spokeswoman, Nicole Navas, declined to comment on it, saying only, "The department is reviewing the complaint and will respond as appropriate. " The lawsuit, assigned on Monday to Judge Ronnie Abrams, an appointee of President Barack Obama, centers on the Constitutionâ€™s "emoluments" clause, which bars federal officeholders from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments.
