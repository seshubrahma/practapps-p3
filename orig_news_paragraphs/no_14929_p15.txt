Whether from drugs, accidents or any other cause, premature death rates are worst in rural America, where health care is least accessible.   Life expectancy in America took a backwards turn in 2015 for the first time since the   peak of the AIDS epidemic, falling to 78. 8 years on average, combined for men and women. Cancer death rates fell, but more Americans in 2015 died  from unintentional injuries, suicides, respiratory diseases and Alzheimerâ€™s.
