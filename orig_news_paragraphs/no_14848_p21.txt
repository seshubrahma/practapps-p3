Activism is a big theme, Discussions and debates about Trump and his policies echoed this week in lecture halls, meeting rooms, concert venues and street corners, making the President, who was not invited to speak at the festival, an omnipresent force. " This year, the fact that everyone is talking exclusively about world order and Donald Trump, it stands to reason that thatâ€™s what the conference will have a bit more of a focus on (that)," Hoffberger said. While politics have always had a place at SXSW, this year, the national surge in activism has made its way into panel discussions represented in various festival verticals    technology, film, music and interactives.
