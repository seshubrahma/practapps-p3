The Copa Sudamericana match this week, which was suspended by soccer officials early Tuesday, was set to be played against a Colombian team on Wednesday in Medellín. On Tuesday, that team, Atlético Nacional, asked the South American Football Confederation to award Chapecoense the trophy as a "posthumous homage to the victims. " In Brazil, soccer officials suspended all games for a   mourning period, and the teams in Brazil’s top league released a statement offering to loan players to Chapecoense so that it could return to the field.
