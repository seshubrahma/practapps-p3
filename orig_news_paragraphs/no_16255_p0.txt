Philadelphia (CNN) It was supposed to be the boring convention    but the Democrats suddenly found that their Philadelphia party had turned into a Cold   espionage thriller. Democrats expected to show up in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton, paper over their disunity and turn their fire directly on Republican nominee Donald Trump and the foreboding picture he painted of America at the GOP convention. Instead, they were greeted by explosive fallout from a suspected Russian hack on the Democratic National Committee that exposed emails    published by Wikileaks    of top officials scheming against Bernie Sanders.
