Secretary of Defense James Mattis was attending the Alfalfa Dinner, an elite social gathering in Washington, at the time of the raid and was informed that the US had suffered casualties during the operation. Mattis left the event to help address the situation. US defense officials told CNN that reams of intelligence were recovered during the operation, including computer hard drives.   While the assessment of that information is still ongoing, officials believe it is highly possible that information contained within could help prevent future terror attacks by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is thought to be the most capable of al Qaedaâ€™s franchises and was behind the 2015 terrorist attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris.
