When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!" Trump tweeted. The US intelligence community concluded in a report publicly released Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clintonâ€™s chances of being elected president. The campaign consisted of hacking Democrats, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, before releasing that information via   websites, including WikiLeaks.
