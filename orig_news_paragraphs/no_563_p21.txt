The gloves are off: It is absolutely in style to have a political opinion right now," the D. J. Mr. Darden said, predicting that the Grammys would "absolutely have that moment" where current events come up, such as with Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech aimed at President Trump. Lady Gaga, a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter, did not make a grand political statement, as some had hoped, at the Super Bowl, but she will have another platform when she performs with Metallica at the Grammys. Among the other performers scheduled on Sunday are Katy Perry, who was a dedicated surrogate for Mrs. Clinton, and Chance the Rapper, a frequent guest of President Obama’s White House. Beyoncé and Adele, who is British, both expressed support for Mrs. Clinton last year.
