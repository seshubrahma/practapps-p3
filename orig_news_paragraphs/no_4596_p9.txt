The Rodong reported that Kim applauded the test as a success: He noted that the success made in the current test marked a great event of historic significance as it declared a new birth of the   rocket industry which has radically turned into a     industry both in name and in reality by completely doing away with dogmatism, conservatism and formalism left in the field of rocket industry and the dependence on the technology of other countries. Kim said of the test, "the whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries. " The rocket engine, experts presume, is meant to fuel the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
