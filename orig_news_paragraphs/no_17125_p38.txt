I think we have a number of defenses. The first is the ocean that separates us, so I do think Europe is more vulnerable when it comes to foreign fighter plots, as we have tragically seen in Paris and Brussels. The second is the architecture that was put in place by both the Bush administration and this administration, to shore up our travel protections, our screening mechanisms, our information sharing both within our country    amongst our law enforcement and homeland security and intelligence communities    and with our international foreign partners. I will be talking to my successor about continuing to focus on the   relationship with our European partners, because that is critical.
