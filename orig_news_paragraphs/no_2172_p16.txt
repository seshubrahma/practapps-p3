In addition to increasing the basic ceiling, which will be set to match the pay of   salaried workers earning at the 40th percentile of salaries in the countryâ€™s   region, currently the South, the new regulation will be updated every three years to keep pace with changes in pay. The Labor Department calculates that 4. 2 million workers will become newly eligible for overtime. Other estimates put the number of newly eligible workers substantially higher. In addition, according to the department, nearly nine million more workers who should already be eligible for overtime under the current duties test will be protected against being denied overtime illegally.
