Over in France, things are chivalrous between French President François Hollande (L) and   Secretary of State John Kerry, seen here at the Elysee Palace on January 16, 2015 in Paris.   On the other side of the world, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe meets Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on August 26, 2014 in Beijing, China. Then there’s this awkward meeting between     Wang Qishan (R)   Secretary of Treasury Timothy Geithner (L) and   of State Hillary Clinton (C) on May 24, 2010, in Beijing, China.
