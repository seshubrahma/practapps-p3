Upcoming votes in Turkey and the Netherlands serve as a backdrop for the dispute: In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has cracked down on opposition    particularly journalists, academics and the public service sector    since a July coup attempt, is pushing an April referendum that would expand his powers. In the Netherlands, this weekâ€™s general elections will pit a hardline   candidate in a tight race against the incumbent prime minister. Erdogan is keen to rally the roughly 4. 6 million expatriate Turks living in Western Europe, many of whom will be permitted to vote in the Turkish referendum. Following similar moves in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Netherlands on Satuday barred a plane carrying Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu from entering the country, citing security concerns.
