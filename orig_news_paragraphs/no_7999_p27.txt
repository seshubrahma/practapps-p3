So if we follow the news, we know their names: Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO Eric Garner in New York City Laquan McDonald in Chicago and, perhaps most consequentially, Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Yet we can note that none of the deceased were choirboys.   Eric Garner, for example, had been arrested 30 times. As for Laquan McDonald, as a juvenile, he had "a history of arrests for drugs and petty crimes," and on the night he died, he was seen breaking into cars he was shot with a knife in his hand.
