At Mercury Radio Arts, we endeavor to take people at their word and will do so here. In the meantime, Glenn will continue to enjoy his vacation. Please tune in Monday at 9AM EST to hear Glennâ€™s thoughts on these events directly from him. The Glenn Beck Program is available through your local affiliates, TheBlaze Radio Network (via the iHeart Media app) and, presumably, the Patriot Channel.
