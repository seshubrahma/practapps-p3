Early Sunday morning, a federal court in Massachusetts also issued a temporary restraining order, blocking part of the executive order in a case brought by lawyers for two lawful permanent residents who are college professors. That order, issued by United States District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs, also an Obama appointee, went a step further ordering that the government could not "detain or remove" individuals who had arrived legally from the countries subject to Trumpâ€™s order: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Burroughs said that her order applied to the petitioners in the case as well as those similarly situated including lawful permanent residents, citizens,   approved refugees, and other individuals from nations who are subject to the January 27, 2017, executive order. The order was also signed by United States Magistrate Judge Gail Dein.
