these are only some of the many crucial interior enforcement issues not addressed in this legislation. As Crane explained at a press conference with Senator Jeff Sessions after the bill was introduced: Almost one month ago, we asked for a meeting with the Gang of Eight to discuss law enforcement concerns  …      They told us they weren’t taking meetings but they were meeting all along with special interests and   groups. Finally, after public pressure grew, I got a late Monday night meeting with Sen. Rubio the day before this    bill was introduced.
