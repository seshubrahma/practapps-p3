Connection to immigration: Difficult to assess, The departments of Justice and Homeland Security have been unable to provide reporters with any estimates of how many   members nationwide came into the US illegally    and how many members joined the gang after coming to the US. The gang actively recruits in immigrant communities in the US and often victimizes undocumented immigrants, who are vulnerable to extortion because they fear law enforcement will discover their status.   There are roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US.   The Department of Justice says it has found in recent investigations that gang leaders in El Salvador are directing US cliques to become more violent.
