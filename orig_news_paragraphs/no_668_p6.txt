Mr. Bannon was Mr. Harwardâ€™s biggest supporter in the West Wing for the national security adviser role, whisking him into a secret meeting with the president on Monday. On Saturday evening, a senior administration official described General McMaster and General Caslen as the leading candidates. The one candidate who has not emerged from the military is Mr. Bolton, an outspoken conservative respected by Mr. Bannon, although it is unclear if Mr. Bannon is supporting him for the national security job. Mr. Bolton does have support from two important donors to Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the White House process: the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson and the philanthropist Rebekah Mercer.
