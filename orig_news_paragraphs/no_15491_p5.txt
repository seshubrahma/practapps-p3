But Melissa Hanham, senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California, said it could be a stepping stone to just that. " This may become half or a third of an ICBM," she said, pointing out that ICBMs are built in two or three stages stacked atop of each other. Hanham also said the fact that the missile’s   vehicle flew so high above the Earth put it under more stress than a warhead might undergo when fired on a more normal, flatter trajectory, North Korean engineers "may well be able to draw warhead   data from that which is applicable to their ICBM ambitions," said Euan Graham, an expert on North Korea at Australia’s Lowy Institute.
