No, it was a split decision, with Quinnipiac showing a tight race and    showing a considerable Clinton lead. I’m inclined to lean toward    considering that the Clinton campaign isn’t taking Pennsylvania especially seriously [no ad spending, although a   super PAC is spending money there]. But it’d be nice to have more data there. Toni It was a rich day of polling.
