Speaking to reporters here Tuesday, Pence said he doesn’t plan to meet    with Trump before the events. But he compared Trump to former president and GOP icon Ronald Reagan. " I think he has spoken into the frustration and the longings of the American people as no one since the 40th president, and I think you’re going to continue to see him do that," Pence said.
