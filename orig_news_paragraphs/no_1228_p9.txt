Republicans argued that changing the rules to push through the nomination was their only option, accusing Democrats of razing Senate norms with the   successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Allowing this obstruction to stand, Republicans said, would have caused more damage than overriding Senate precedent to turn back the filibuster. " This is the latest escalation in the leftâ€™s   judicial war, the most audacious yet," Mr. McConnell said, after describing Democratic opposition in the past to Judge Robert H. Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas.
