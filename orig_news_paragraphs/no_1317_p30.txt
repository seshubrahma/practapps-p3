A few blocks south, a townhouse at 28 East 20th Street (now a replica) was the childhood home of Theodore Roosevelt, the only president born in New York City. And among the others, an apartment at 142 West 109th Street in Morningside Heights was where President Obama lived when he was a junior at Columbia University. It was even available for rent in 2010. At the time the landlord did not charge a presidential premium.
