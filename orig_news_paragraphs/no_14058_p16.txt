In his opening prayer, the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the dean of Washington National Cathedral, appeared to be making a point about the need for unity after the bitter, divisive election campaign that made Trump president. " Look with compassion on the whole human family take away the arrogance and hatred which infect our hearts break down the walls that separate us unite us in bonds of love and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish your purposes on earth that, in your good time, all nations and races may serve you in harmony around your heavenly throne through Jesus Christ our Lord," Hollerith said, reciting an excerpt from the Book of Common Prayer. Trump, who was accused of discrimination against followers of Islam throughout the campaign, also sat quietly as a Muslim prayer echoed through the nave.
