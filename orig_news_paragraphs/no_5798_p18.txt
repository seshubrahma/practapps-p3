EPA is the principal funder and advocate of global warming alarmism, the myth that   climate change is a crisis. That movement would end on the day EPAâ€™s doors shut, allowing Congress to return to taxpayers and consumers a "peace dividend" amount to some of the $4 billion a day currently spent   on climate change. Dismantling EPA is one part of a comprehensive set of reforms, many of them discussed by Trump and referred to in the GOP platform, to lighten the massive weight of government regulations on the American people. The nation needs a     and   agenda that recognizes the tremendous value of the natural resources under our feet.
