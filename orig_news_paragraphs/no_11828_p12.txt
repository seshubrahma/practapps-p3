Young people in America once again have hope that we will bring jobs back to America by repealing Obamacare, passing it, reigning in the federal regulators that are killing small businesses, passing a flat tax and abolishing the IRS. We will unleash incredible economic growth. Our border will finally be made secure and sanctuary cities will end. Truck drivers and mechanics and plumbers and steel workers, union members, men and women with callouses on their hands, will once again see wages rising, opportunity expanding.
