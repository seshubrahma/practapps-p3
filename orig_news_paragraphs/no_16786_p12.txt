The participants who reported having faced weight discrimination, compared with those who hadn’t faced any weight discrimination, experienced more daily stress, worse emotional health and worse physical health over the subsequent eight days, said Angelina Sutin, assistant professor in the Florida State University College of Medicine and lead author of the study. " When we did the study, it was what we had expected. We published a paper earlier this year that showed weight discrimination increased risk of mortality, so people who had experienced weight discrimination had died younger than those who hadn’t experienced it," Sutin said.
