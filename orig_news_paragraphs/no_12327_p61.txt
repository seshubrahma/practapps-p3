Schlafly explained that echoing the Democrats’ policy platform on the critical issues of the day makes a Republican candidate weaker —  not stronger. For instance, while Rubio’s campaign team has sought to promote declarations from liberal operatives that a   match up "scares" Democrats, Schlafly explained in 1964: "One of the favorite tricks of the Democrats is to try to get the Republicans to pass over their strongest candidate and nominate instead a candidate who will be easy to beat. For example, in 1948 the Democrats cooperated with the Kingmakers to persuade Republicans to nominate a [bipartisan] ‘me too’ losing candidate, Tom Dewey, instead of the Republican Majority Leader, Bob Taft.
