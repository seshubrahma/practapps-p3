 (CNN) Is Donald Trump really a "big fan" of the intelligence community, as he claimed on Twitter, or did he disparage intelligence professionals when he repeatedly referred to them and their work in sneer quotes about "Intelligence" briefings and the "  ’Russian hacking’"?

Did he convince Ford not to move a car plant to Mexico, saving American jobs, or was it all a fabrication for publicity?
