The White House announced Friday afternoon that Obama will visit the area on Tuesday, after his vacation concludes. The Republican presidential ticket traveled down miles of roads where the receding flood waters are leaving behind ruined homes and heaps of residents’ possessions.   After Trump and Pence toured the flood damage, they went to Greenwell Springs Baptist Church, to meet with Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, and Franklin Graham, president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan’s Purse, an international Christian relief organization. Trump and Pence also met volunteers and were cheered by the crowd in front of Samaritan’s Purse mobile kitchen.
