As is, the federal government spends more on interest payments on its debt than on education, energy and the environment, international affairs, and science    combined. An increase in both debt levels and the interest rate would be devastating for domestic discretionary spending for decades to come.   Second, even if we were to plunge into more debt on a risky gambit for greater growth, why should tax cuts for the rich get the first (and maybe only) priority for the corresponding goodies?    The rich already get away with paying little if any taxes, as the President himself  knows perfectly well.
