New Hampshire was once one of the most solid Republican states, but on the presidential level it has become a real battleground state," says Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the   polling firm that executed the poll. The poll  carries a 2 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence. " It is a small state, but because most of its population is in the Boston media market, it is an expensive state for any campaign," he said.
