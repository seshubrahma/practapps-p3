For the blank slate of 2017, may I suggest you follow the   anniversary of the Cultural Revolution in real time. Fifty years ago this past May, Mao Zedong declared the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in 2016, someone had the idea to livetweet that tumultuous period on a   delay. @GPCR50 has about 1, 500 followers, which is frankly on the low end of modest. But Iâ€™ve been one of its avid followers because this was an uncanny year to see the events of the Cultural Revolution swirled together with the 2016 election in my feed.
