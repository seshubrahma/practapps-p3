Sunday’s vote in Saarland state    Germany’s smallest    isn’t expected to have a major impact on the balance of power in Germany, and the Christian Democrats have held power in the area for the better part of two decades. But the election was seen as a bellwether for a series of upcoming votes in Germany, ending in the federal elections on September 24. Merkel’s party performed better than expected. The   Christian Democrats won 40. 7% of Sunday’s vote, a solid 5. 5% increase over four years ago and a convincing win over the   Social Democrat Party, which only took 29.
