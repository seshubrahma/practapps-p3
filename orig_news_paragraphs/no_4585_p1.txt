" Companies have the opportunity to bring workers from overseas on   visas in the event that qualified Americans aren’t available, but we can’t allow the law to be exploited to displace American workers and send their jobs abroad," Collins continued. But, NumbersUSA’s Director of Government Relations Rosemary Jenks said the congressmen are "misunderstanding" what the   visa program actually does, as far as Americans being replaced by cheaper, foreign workers.
