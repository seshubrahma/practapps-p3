I said if we don’t respond to Donald Trump, which I’m doing, as you have seen, I have said he was unqualified to be president. I believe that deeply. I’m going to keep focused on Donald Trump because I will be the nominee. I will be running against Donald Trump in the fall, and I do not want Americans and, you know, good thinking Republicans as well as Democrats and Independents, to start to believe that this is a normal candidacy.
