Wilson is a 1982 graduate of the US Air Force Academy, a Rhodes Scholar and a former member of Congress, representing New Mexico from 1998 to 2009. During her confirmation hearings, Wilson said she plans to address the Air Force’s pilot shortage as well as seek additional funding for the service’s modernization efforts. Her bipartisan confirmation is likely to be welcome news for the Trump White House, which has struggled to fill some of the Pentagon’s top posts more than 100 days after inauguration. There are a total of 57 presidentially appointed,   positions at the Department of Defense.
