I believe strongly that in a democracy, we should respect the will of the people," Hillary Clinton said, "and to me that means itâ€™s time to do away with the Electoral College and move to the popular election of our president. " Sixteen years later, the Electoral College is still standing, and Mrs. Clinton has followed Mr. Gore as the second Democratic presidential candidate in modern history to be defeated by a Republican who earned fewer votes, in his case George W. Bush. In her concession speech on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton did not mention the popular vote, an omission that seemed to signal her desire to encourage a smooth and civil transition of power after a divisive election.
