Iraqi officers, though, say they know exactly what happened: Maj. Gen. Maan   a commander of the Iraqi special forces, said that the civilian deaths were a result of a coalition airstrike that his men had called in, to take out snipers on the roofs of three houses in a neighborhood called Mosul Jidideh. General Saadi said the special forces were unaware that the housesâ€™ basements were filled with civilians.
