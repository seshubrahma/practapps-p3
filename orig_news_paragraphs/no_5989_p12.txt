Both executive orders also called for a temporary 90 day travel ban on all visas issued to citizens of Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, and Iran, countries that the Obama administration had already deemed to be havens of terrorism. Executive Order 13769 had also called for such a ban for citizens of Iraq. The same federal judges struck down these country specific travel bans as well.
