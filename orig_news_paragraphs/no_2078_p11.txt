In describing the new weapons deployment, a Defense Ministry statement suggested that China was further watering down a pledge made by its president, Xi Jinping, to not militarize the islands. That indicated that such installations were part of China’s plan to deepen its territorial claim over the islands, which has created tensions with its neighbors over their rival claims and with Washington over freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest commercial waterways. The United States Navy routinely sends warships to sail the South China Sea as part of ongoing American policy meant to demonstrate that all countries have the freedom of navigation in disputed waters. M. Taylor Fravel, an associate professor of political science at M. I. T. who studies China’s territorial disputes and has written on the South China Sea, called the seizure of the drone "a big deal, as it represents the deliberate theft of U. S. government property and a clear violation" of maritime law.
