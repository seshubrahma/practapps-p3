GRAHAM HOLDINGS COMPANY, When Amazon owner Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post, he did not buy the   Foreign Policy magazine with its declining readership. Alexa. com, which is a site ranking organisation run by Amazon itself, reveals Foreign Policy to be the 9719th website in the world compared to its competitor the Economist, which is the 1, 935th website. Instead, the magazine stayed with the aforementioned Donald Graham, who changed the name of the Washington Post group to Graham Holdings Company to reflect the sale of the paper.
