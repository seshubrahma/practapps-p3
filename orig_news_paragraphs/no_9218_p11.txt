Speaking at the Brookings Institute last September, Clinton presented a   plan regarding U. S. strategy toward Iran. The plan maintains the current nuclear deal while increasing sanctions targeting the Tehran regime. The CAP, meanwhile, is financed in part by billionaire George Soros.   It was founded by John Podesta, who served as Bill Clinton’s chief of staff and was   of Obama’s White House transition team in 2009.
