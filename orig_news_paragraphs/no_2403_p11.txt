A photo I took in Greensboro, N. C. showing Mr. Trump in front of a dimly lit American flag, with only a pointed finger and his iconic golden hair visible, is one of the most revealing portraits I have made of him   â€”   not just because of what is shown, but because of what is obscured. I was initially reluctant to cover another election, but I quickly realized that this year it was more important than ever to be out there with a vigilant, thoughtful and critical eye.
