"Balenciaga: Shaping Fashion," at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London "The World of Anna Sui," at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London (the first retrospective of an American designer to be held in Britain) and, of course, "Rei   des Garçons" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. The Met show should provide the best   moments of the year, as   gala attendees attempt to honor Ms. Kawakubo’s work, which focuses less on beauty than on the question of what clothing is. It should give new meaning to the concept of wearable art.
