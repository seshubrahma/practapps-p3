According to a Democratic source familiar with the hack, the DNCâ€™s analytics platform was compromised and data with the Clinton campaign along with it, but data from the DGA was not affected. The DGA recently began using the platform that tracks field operations, while the Clinton campaign has used it throughout the primary process, the source said.   The hack was originally discovered as being two separate breaches of the DNC, both by hacking groups identified by cybersecurity experts as working for the Russian military and intelligence complex. One hack was said to have lasted a year and targeted internal communications, the other was for a few months and targeted opposition research on Donald Trump.
