• Build the New Independent, Integrated, Mass Militant   Civil Rights and Immigrant Rights Movement! On Sunday, June 26, the fascist Traditionalist Workers’ Party, the Golden State Skinheads, and other    supporters are planning to hold a public recruitment rally on the West Steps of the State Capitol in Sacramento to launch a campaign of racist terror in California. They are not rallying to merely talk and listen to each other and then go home.
