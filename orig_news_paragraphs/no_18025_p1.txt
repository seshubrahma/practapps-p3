" ’   Pollock, whose documentary, "Strange Fruit," premiered at the   South by Southwest Festival on Saturday, claims the new security   tape featured in the film points to a   of evidence on the   part of Ferguson police, and a false narrative painted about   Brown by city officials.   ’ ’    At around 1 a. m. the night before he was shot, "you can clearly   see Michael Brown walking into the store, you see him then make   an exchange. He trades a little bag of weed for two boxes of   cigarillos," Pollock said when Baldwin asked him to tell the   audience what the video showed.
