Both Ryan and Hillary Clinton supported the failed   2007 amnesty plan. In fact, in a December address at the National Immigrant Integration Conference, Clinton touted her support for the Chamber of   immigration agenda, which would have resulted in an explosion of   workers to compete for American jobs and drive down wages. " We could add hundreds of billions of dollars to our GDP by passing comprehensive immigration reform, which is why people across the political spectrum from labor unions to the U. S. Chamber of Commerce supported the 2013 senate bill," Clinton said.
