But for six consecutive weekends during his first two months in office, the President has spent time at properties that bear his name    including a visit Saturday to the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, for meetings. The visits are not out of the norm for the President, who was known to regularly frequent his holdings when he was a private citizen. And they don’t violate the promises Trump made about not having a hand in the operation of his old business. But the constant visits as President do blur the lines between Trump’s responsibilities as    and his ability to benefit    both directly and indirectly   his family’s empire of hotels, golf courses and apartment buildings.
