Manafort, still holding out hope of an endorsement, recently reached out to Kasich’s strategist, John Weaver, to brief him on efforts to run the campaign as a more disciplined and polished operation, according to people familiar with the discussions. Kasich’s camp was unmoved.   Another overture arrived Sunday afternoon from Gingrich, an ally in their shared House days during the 1980s and 1990s. He asked Kasich’s team whether the governor could be persuaded to endorse Trump or whether it was "a waste of time."
