In North Carolina, where about 22, 000 votes have been cast, those from registered Democrats only narrowly outpace those from registered Republicans, though Democrats have a nearly    advantage in party registration overall. Still, thatâ€™s a better rate for Dems than at this point in 2012, when almost twice as many registered Republicans had returned ballots than Democrats.   Other battleground states included in this data either have fewer than 10, 000 ballots returned so far, or do not ask voters to affiliate with a party when they register.
