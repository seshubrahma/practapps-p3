"One of the most enjoyable aspects of the election process is getting to meet so many great people across the country, and New Hampshire has been no exception. Iâ€™m honored and humbled to have the generous backing of so many citizens of The Granite State, and I thank everyone for their kind hospitality and support. I commend the many staff and volunteers from New Hampshire who worked tirelessly to spread our call to return faith, integrity and common sense to American leadership. Across New Hampshire I heard from people who were sick and tired of D. C. insider political games and manipulation.
