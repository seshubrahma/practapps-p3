They’ve taken our jobs away," Trump said. Thursday’s dinner is not a   official state dinner, but instead of a pair of McDonald’s signature hamburgers and fries, Trump and Xi will share a more traditional meal, according to the dinner menu provided by the White House. After enjoying a Caesar Salad, Trump, Xi and two dozen other guests will get to choose between a   Dover sole or a   prime New York strip steak. The meals will be served with a 2014 Chalk Hill Chardonnay from Sonoma Coast and a 2014 Girard Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley.
