A firebomb tore through the Republican Party headquarters in North Carolinaâ€™s Orange County on Saturday night, and graffiti warning its members to flee town was painted on the walls of a neighboring building, the party and police officials said on Sunday. The party posted images on Twitter of the damaged building in Hillsborough, N. C. on Sunday afternoon that showed blackened walls, charred couches and burned campaign signs for Donald J. Trump and several local candidates. A window was broken, and a swastika was   nearby alongside the words "Nazi Republicans leave town or else. "
