According to former State Department Spokesman P. J. Crowley, the more subdued rollout is likely the result of a combination of factors, including the fact that Tillerson is still adapting to his new position.   " It’s a matter of not having a full team in place, it’s a matter of timing, and it’s also a matter of hitting him when he’s still getting comfortable as the secretary of state, and everything that comes along with that," said Crowley. But he acknowledged the administration could also be signaling a change in policy when it comes to promoting human rights abroad.
