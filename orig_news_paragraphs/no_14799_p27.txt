At eight years old, this is the second longest bull market in history, behind the epic run from 1987 to 2000.   That rally, the longest and strongest in history, up 583 percent.   To match the length of that run, this one needs to go another four years.   To match the gains from that 1987 to 2000 bull run, it will have to at least double again from here.
