But in the context of the Security Council where only an American veto can prevent   resolutions from automatically passing, an abstention is a vote for the resolution and because of this automatic majority, an   resolution like this one cannot be reversed by a future American president. A veto once cast cannot be cast retroactively. The effect, therefore of the Obama decision to push for, and abstain from, a vote on this resolution is to deliberately tie the hands of President Obama’s successors, most particularly   Donald Trump. That is why Trump did the right thing in reaction to Obama’s provocation.
