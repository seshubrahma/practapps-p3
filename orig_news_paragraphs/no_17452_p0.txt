 (CNN) With less than a month left in office, Secretary of State John Kerry issued a stern rebuke Wednesday over Israeli settlements and warned that the   solution to the enduring conflict with Palestinians is at risk. Kerry defended the United Statesâ€™ decision last week to abstain from a vote on    and not veto    a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as one aimed at "preserving the   solution," which he called "the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians." "I am also here to share my conviction that there is still a way forward if the responsible parties are willing to act," Kerry said, opening his speech.
