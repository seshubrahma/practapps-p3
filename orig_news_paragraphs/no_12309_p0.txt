A group of Hollywood celebrities are calling on Republican electors in the Electoral College to disregard their states’ voting results and deny Donald Trump the presidency when the group casts their official ballots on December 19. [In a   video PSA released Wednesday, actors Martin Sheen, Debra Messing, Richard Schiff, Bob Odenkirk, BD Wong and others urge Republican electors to be "American heroes" and ensure Trump doesn’t reach the 306 electoral votes he earned in November’s election. It would take 37   "faithless" electors to prevent Trump from reaching the required 270 electoral votes.   "Republican members of the Electoral College, this message is for you," Sheen, who played a fictional President on the political drama The West Wing, opens the video.
