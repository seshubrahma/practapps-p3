PARIS   â€”    A man armed with two large knives and shouting "God is great" in Arabic lunged at a military patrol near an entrance to the Louvre on Friday, causing little harm, but rattling a city already on edge over terrorist attacks and casting another shadow over its international image. A soldier opened fire, hitting the attacker several times, but not before he slashed at one of the other soldiers, causing minor injuries.
