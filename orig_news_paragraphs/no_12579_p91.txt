The report states: The shooter, who did not have a criminal record, was identified as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, of the Dallas suburb of Mesquite, said the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly. Although police feared for hours that at least one other sniper was involved and on the run, the official said Johnson is now believed to be the lone gunman. At least three others who were detained by police as possible suspects may have no connection with the attack or Johnson, the official said. Update 2:45
