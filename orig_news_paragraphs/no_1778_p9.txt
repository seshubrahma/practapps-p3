Wells Fargo’s embattled chief executive, John Stumpf, above, has abruptly decided to step down. The announcement comes just over a month after the bank was handed a $185 million fine for a   scandal in which employees opened fake accounts in clients’ names. Complaints about the fraudulent accounts date back 2005. Mr. Stumpf will be immediately replaced by Timothy Sloan, the bank’s president and chief operating officer.
