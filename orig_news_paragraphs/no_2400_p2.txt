The election news bubble that’s about to pop has blocked from plain view the expanding financial sinkhole at the center of the    branch of the news industry, which has recently seen a print advertising plunge that was "much more precipitous, to be honest with you, than anybody expected a year or so ago," as The Wall Street Journal editor in chief Gerard Baker told me on Friday. Papers including The Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian, the Gannett publications and others have responded with plans to reorganize, shed staff, kill off whole sections, or all of the above. Taken together, it means another rapid depletion in the nation’s ranks of traditionally trained journalists whose main mission is to root out corruption, hold the powerful accountable and sort fact from fiction for voters. It couldn’t be happening at a worse moment in American public life.
