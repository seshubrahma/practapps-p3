Trump made the previous night at a "commander in chief forum" on NBC News.   " Certainly, in that system, he’s been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader," Trump said, when asked about his repeated praise and kind words for Putin despite Russia’s increasing aggression toward the United States.     Pence also defended Trump’s comments that "the generals have been reduced to rubble" under the Obama administration, responding to critics that interpreted those words to mean Trump was putting down the US military.
