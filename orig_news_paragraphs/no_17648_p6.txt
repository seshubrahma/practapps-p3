’ ’  ’ ’    The challenges of this new market structure were made apparent on   October 15, 2014 when the yield on the ten year note rose and   fell 37 basis points  for no apparent reason whatsoever. The "flash   crash" undermined the confidence of market participants and   challenged the official sector’s assumptions about the resilience   of the market. If this kind of market shock was possible during   the calm period of Fall 2014, imagine what might be possible   during the unwind of QE or during a major fiscal expansion.
