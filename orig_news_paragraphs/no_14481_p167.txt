It’s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I    when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment    when I was called out on Mexico, I was    honestly, I was really, really surprised.    But I said "you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen" but that wasn’t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who’s a very fine man, by the way.
