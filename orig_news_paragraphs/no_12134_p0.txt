Comedian Jon Stewart sat down for a lengthy   conversation Wednesday with New York Times editor Chris Smith and dished on all aspects of politics in the era of Trump. ["It is odd to be in a position of knowing that the leader of the free world tweeted that you were a pussy at 1:30 in the morning," the former Daily Show host said of   Donald Trump.   Stewart was set to discuss his new book, The Daily Show: An Oral History, but spent most of the evening airing his thoughts on the presidential election, why Obama was bad for freedom of the press and Hispanics, and how corporate media helps divide America.
