 (CNN) Taking aim at a joke by comedian Stephen Colbert, CNN’s Michael Smerconish insisted Saturday that "going low" is a bad way for liberals to try to accomplish their goals. Smerconish took issue with Colbert’s monologue Monday during his show, "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," in which he joked about oral sex between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
