My wife came to the US legally and her visa expired before we could get married. We didnâ€™t want to get married on an arbitrary government timeline. You know, they picked "three months" out of the sky and require you to get married within that timeframe. While we were ready to relocate to the United States, we were not ready to get married within three months of stepping off the plane.
