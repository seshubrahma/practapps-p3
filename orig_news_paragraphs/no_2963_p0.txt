When Jared Rutledge called his mortgage broker one morning last week after putting in an offer on a home in Glendale, Ariz. just west of Phoenix, he discovered that the 3. 8 percent rate he had been quoted a couple of months ago had already gone up to 4. 125 percent. That afternoon, it had inched up to 4. 25, and by evening, when he finally called back to finalize the deal, it was 4. 375 percent.
