The leadership and clergy of Adas Israel Congregation stands with the entire Conservative movement and other local organizations such as the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington in advocating for the rights of immigrants, rejecting the targeting of individuals based on religion, and calling on the US government to reject policy proposals that would halt, limit, or curtail refugee resettlement in the US or prioritize certain refugees over others," the synagogue wrote on Facebook and in an email sent to congregants. Adas Israel, which describes itself as a "socially conscious congregation" on its website, reaffirmed a longer statement from the Conservative Jewish community.   " Our religious tradition repeatedly forbids us from oppressing the stranger," that statement reads.
