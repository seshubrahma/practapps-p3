If Rubio’s immigration plan had been enacted, according to a Center for Immigration Studies analysis based on CBO data , immigration could add a potential 32 million new voters in the span of around two decades —  or more than one new voter to cancel out the vote of every one Tea Party voter in America —   nullifying completely their national electoral impact. In effect, if a President Rubio were able to enact the immigration system he wanted, Tea Party voters could continue to live in conservative clusters and some might read the National Review, but their ability —   and the ability of their elected representatives —   to affect national policy would be totally weakened.
