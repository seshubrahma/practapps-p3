(Hello, "The Hurt Locker"!) Still, while the academy did give "Moonlight" best picture, the fact that Mr. Chazelle won best director suggests that last night was a squeaker. It may be that the academyâ€™s push to diversify itself by adding new members has paid off, but some of the ugliness that aired during the interminable slog up to Sunday night indicates that the academy remains deeply divided. (Sound familiar?)
