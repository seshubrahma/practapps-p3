That’s what came to mind when I saw Kathy Griffin’s gruesome image. I’m not sure what reaction Griffin wanted us to have when she posed for a photo with a bloody, decapitated mask of Donald Trump. But there are no good ones to be had after looking at a picture like that. In the more forgiving (but still unforgivable) metaphorical version, I suppose she’s suggesting that comedians like her will symbolically take Trump down with their wit and humor and moral superiority.
