They’re hoping no one will mention the awkward fact that blacks punch way above their weight in the percentage of crime they commit. Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute looked at the FBI statistics for the 75 largest counties in the country and found that although blacks are only 15 percent of the population in those counties, they commit 57 percent of the murders, 45 percent of the assaults and 62 percent of the robberies. There is not a crime that blacks do not commit at rates higher than whites, Hispanics and Asians, except probably failing to properly extinguish a campfire in a national forest.
