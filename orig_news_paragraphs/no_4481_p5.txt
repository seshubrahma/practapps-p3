—   though Putin greatly expanded the diplomatic influence of Russia during President Obama’s tenure, particularly in the Middle East  —    Putin has appeared publicly favorable to establishing positive relations with the Trump administration. Following President Obama’s announcement of new sanctions on Russia in December, shortly before Trump took office, Putin said in a statement he would not retaliate, calling President Obama’s actions "regrettable" and implying he would wait for Trump to assume the presidency before evaluating how bilateral relations should go forward.
