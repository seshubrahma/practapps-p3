Trump will never be able to turn puppet reporters into "force multipliers" for his agenda, the way Obama’s Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes boasted of doing. (To be brutally frank, reporters will still be as lazy as Rhodes found them, and a Republican Administration can take advantage of that lassitude, but no Republican will ever get the kind of willing assistance with spreading false narratives that Obama did.) I’ll rest my #NeverHillary case without making any "NeverTrump means you’re working for Clinton! " cracks.
