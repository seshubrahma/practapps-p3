The announcement comes after Trump made the decision to skip the annual dinner in February, breaking with the tradition presidents in recent years have set by attending the event. The rally will be held April 29 in Harrisburg, the same day as Trump marks the 100th day of his presidency, Politico reported. A senior White House official said the decision to hold the rally that day had more to do with how Trump planned to spend the hours of the 100th day than the correspondentsâ€™ dinner.
