In a ruling issued on Wednesday afternoon, a federal judge, and Obama appointee, prevented the President of the United States from enforcing his own executive order to protect the nation from migrants from   countries. [The judge then prevented every other judge and every other state from following the Presidentâ€™s order, the judge making himself a   Supreme Court and substitute President.   The judge then held that American universities and immigrants living here can prohibit America from ever limiting immigration from   countries, claiming the First Amendment gives   nations a right of immigration to America. Such arrogance and abuse of authority sound familiar?
