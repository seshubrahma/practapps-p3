The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding.   Unlike nearly all of the Old Testament verses of violence, the verses of violence in the Quran are mostly   meaning that they are not restrained by historical context contained in the surrounding text, although many Muslims choose to think of them that way.   They are part of the eternal, unchanging word of Allah, and just as relevant or subject to interpretation as anything else in the Quran.
