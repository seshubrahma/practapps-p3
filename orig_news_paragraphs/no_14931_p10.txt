For Netanyahu, building in the settlements isn’t just a promise he’s made to the approximately 420, 000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank it is also about   political survival, as Netanyahu and Bennett battle for the same   constituency. Netanyahu has boasted that there is no government that will be more   than the current one, and he can’t afford to be outflanked on the right by his own coalition partners. At the same time, no Israeli leader    on the right or left    would risk angering Israel’s primary international ally.
