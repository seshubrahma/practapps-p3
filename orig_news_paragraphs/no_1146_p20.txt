Justice Thomas is one of two sitting justices, along with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to have fallen short of 60 votes, complicating Democratsâ€™ recent claims that Judge Gorsuch must be held to a   "standard" for confirmation. There is likewise, with respect to Judge Garland, no rule prohibiting the consideration of Supreme Court nominees eight months before an election. Sanford V. Levinson, a Supreme Court expert at the University of Texas School of Law, said the present enmity stemmed as much from bitter quarrels over   judgeships as from past clashes over Supreme Court picks. He noted the series of filibusters against judicial nominees under President George W. Bush.
