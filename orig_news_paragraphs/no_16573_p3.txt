" Clinton’s   speech, coming two months out from Election Day, demonstrated her campaign’s efforts to inject more of the Democratic nominee’s personal touches into the election narrative and get beyond the intensely negative headlines that have dominated the news.   Clinton will look to draw attention to some of her policy platforms in the coming weeks by delivering a series of "Stronger Together" speeches around the new book that she and running mate Tim Kaine published this week, Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton’s spokeswoman, said Thursday. The speeches will speak to both what animates Clinton    faith, children and families    and how she will work to impact the economy and push national service.
