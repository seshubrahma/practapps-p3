On Thursday, a coalition of 23 powerful conservative advocacy groups endorsed Mr. Pruittâ€™s nomination, in advance of his confirmation hearing, set for Wednesday. " Some claim Mr. Pruitt opposes clean air and water. This could not be further from the truth," wrote the groups, which include the political action committee Club for Growth the American Energy Alliance, which has advised Mr. Trump on energy policy and Americans for Tax Reform, the group founded by the   lobbyist Grover Norquist.
