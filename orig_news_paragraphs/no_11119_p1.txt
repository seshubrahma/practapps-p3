Cruz also made a trip to California this week to appear on the   show Jimmy Kimmel Live! hold a   fundraiser, and meet with the lion’s share of more than 100 Californians slated as delegates for Cruz. In the days leading up to the March 15 Missouri and Florida primary contests, Cruz picked up endorsements from over 100 faith leaders. While Cruz and frontrunner Donald Trump came out    in Missouri, Trump took a resounding win in Florida over   competitor Sen. Marco Rubio, with Cruz in third. On Saturday, Cruz will host a screening of God’s Not Dead 2 in Green Bay.
