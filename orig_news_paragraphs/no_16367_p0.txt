Washington (CNN) Fifty prominent Republican foreign policy and national security experts    many veterans of George W. Bush’s administration    have signed a letter denouncing Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy and pledging not to vote for him.   The letter, first reported by The New York Times Monday, warns: "We are convinced that in the Oval Office, he would be the most reckless President in American history."   Its signatories include former CIA and National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden, former Director of National Intelligence and Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Eric Edelman, who was Vice President Dick Cheney’s national security adviser and has worked closely with Michele Flournoy    a candidate for secretary of defense in a prospective Clinton administration    to forge a centrist group of defense experts on key military issues.
