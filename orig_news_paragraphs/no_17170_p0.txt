London (CNN) UK politician Nigel Farage told CNN Thursday he’d like to act as a "middle man" to improve relations between the British government and US   Donald Trump after a bumpy start. But he said he had no plans for a second    meeting with Trump while on a trip to the United States in the next few days, despite reports to the contrary. Trump caused diplomatic ripples Tuesday when he tweeted that Farage would "do a great job" as Britain’s ambassador to the United States.
