President Donald Trump "strongly supports" the house Obamacare replacement effort spearheaded by Speaker Paul Ryan, according to a statement of administration policy sent to House Republicans. ["This bill begins to fulfill the President â€™s commitment to rescue Americans from the failures of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and expand access to affordable, quality healthcare," the statement from the executive office of the president read.   The statement adds that the bill is only part of the three step process to repeal and replace Obamacare.
