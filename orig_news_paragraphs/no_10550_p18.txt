The cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. It is rare for any anesthesia to be used. In 2012, Al Jazeera recounted the experience of one London woman: Aissa describes how her sister was taken away by a woman to "wait for her turn" while Aissaâ€™s stepmother instructed her to lay down on a bed. Aissa did as she was told, as four women stood over her pinning her to the bed as another woman began to cut her.
