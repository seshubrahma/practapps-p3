early this morning a young man ambushed a Milwaukee police officer in his squad car. A Milwaukee police officer was shot in a "vicious" attack early Sunday as he sat in his squad car while colleagues investigated a domestic disturbance call, an official said. The suspected shooter, identified by police as a    West Allis man with two felonies on his record, was found dead in a nearby yard, they said. The incident began as a response to a domestic disturbance call near South 17th Street and West Morgan Avenue at about 2 a. m.
