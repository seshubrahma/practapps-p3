The unidentified organizers were noticeable before the march, texting unknown people and discussing the logistics of the protest. One of the   men was wearing New York Cosmopolitans sportswear. The audio makes it clear that the organizers are connected in some way to the New York Cosmopolitans football team. At one point they say, "Everyone from the Cosmos should be out now," and another man discusses being at the Cosmos home opener.
