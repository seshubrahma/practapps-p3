In 1955, the then Lebanese President Camille Chamoun invited delegates from seven towns called Lebanon    those in Oregon, Nebraska, Indiana, Tennessee, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Ohio    to visit his country for two weeks. As a parting gift, Boukaram says, each visitor was given a cedar tree sapling. Boukaram wanted to locate the trees, and so went through the local newspaper microfiche archives from 1955 to 1958 in each of these towns looking for reports about the gifts, apart from in Nebraska where he met a woman who had been present at the planting ceremony. In the end, he was only able to locate one, in Ohio, where all the saplings had initially been sent.
