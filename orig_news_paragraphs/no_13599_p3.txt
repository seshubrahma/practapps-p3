As NYTimes report notes: In his single term as a congressman, he [Rivera] twice made the list of the most corrupt members of Congress published by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan group, which cited claims he ran afoul of campaign finance laws and failed to report certain income sources  …      In one case, federal prosecutors investigated Mr. Rivera’s role in a secret plot to finance a sham candidate, Justin Lamar Sternad, in which tens of thousands of dollars were spent to pay for Mr. Sternad ’s mailers, robocalls and other expenses with the goal of undercutting Mr. Rivera’s Democratic opponent, Joe Garcia, in the 2012 congressional race. Instead, Mr. Rivera’s friend, Ana Alliegro, who helped facilitate the plan, as well as Mr. Sternad, testified before a grand jury and pleaded guilty to felonies in the case.
