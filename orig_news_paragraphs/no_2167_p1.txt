Or should we have known all along? Was Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory a black swan, the electoral equivalent of World War I or the Depression: an unlikely event with complex causes, some understood at the time but others overlooked, that came together in unexpected ways to produce a result that no one could have reasonably anticipated? Or did we simply underestimate Mr. Trump from the start? Did we discount him because we assumed that voters would never nominate a   star for president, let alone a provocateur with iconoclastic policy views like his?
