Mr. Trump and his advisers have defended his charitable practices in the past, noting that Mr. Trump has made significant donations personally and through the foundation. Lawyers for the foundation uploaded the tax filing on Friday to Guidestar, a national database of nonprofits, and it was then made publicly available, according to representatives from Guidestar. It is unclear whether the Internal Revenue Service has received the filings. The 2015 form showed that Mr. Trump donated a total of $616, 000 that year to his nonprofit foundation, his first contribution to it since 2008 and his largest donation in a decade.
