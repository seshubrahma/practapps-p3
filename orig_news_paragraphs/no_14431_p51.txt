Hundreds of volunteers tried to help, but 400 whales died over the weekend.   And bear with us, this is a little gross.   Conservationists say the dead whale can explode in the heat, so they’ve been puncturing them so their carcasses don’t blow up and they can be safely moved to a nature reserve that’s closed to the public. Scientists don’t know why whales beach themselves.   It could be that they got lost or disoriented.
