Separately, Mrs. May confirmed that she would meet with President Trump in Washington on Friday in the first visit of a foreign leader to the new president, a traditional prize that Britain has been seeking avidly. She said she would emphasize to Mr. Trump the importance of the NATO military alliance, calling it a "bulwark" of the West, and would say that Britain favors the progress and cohesion of the European Union, even though the country plans to leave the bloc. Trade will be an important topic, she said, with Britain wanting new   agreements with key countries, including the United States, after it leaves the European Union. Mr. Trump, a supporter of "Brexit," as Britainâ€™s departure from the bloc is known, has said that he is open to early talks on such a deal with Britain.
