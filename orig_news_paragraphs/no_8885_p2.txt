Alison Saunders, the current Director of Public Prosecutions who has acquired a reputation for feminist crusading, framed the new guidelines in terms of womenâ€™s issues, saying: "Worryingly we have seen an increase in the use of   crime in cases related to Violence against Women and Girls, including domestic abuse" However, closer examination of the new guidelines reveal that prosecutors are encouraged to take much more questionable cases to trial, ranging from controversial "hate speech" cases to cases involving speech that is "grossly indecent or offensive. " The CPS reminds prosecutors that: Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988 deals with the sending to another of an electronic communication which is indecent or grossly offensive, or which conveys a threat, or which is false, provided there is an intention to cause distress or anxiety to the recipient. The Malicious Communications Act has already been used to jail teenagers for posting offensive messages on Facebook.
