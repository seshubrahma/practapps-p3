And this Court has specifically recognized that there is no "judicial remedy" to override the Executive’s use of its delegated 8 U. S. C. § 1182( f) power to deny classes of nonresident aliens entry into this country.

This longstanding, exacting standard for judicial scrutiny of government motives has been recognized by this Court in multiple types of constitutional challenges.
