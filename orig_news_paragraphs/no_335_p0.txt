Donald J. Trump spent his first week in office repeating the lie that between three million and five million people had voted illegally in the November election, first to members of Congress, then on Twitter, then in an ABC News interview, then again on Twitter on Friday, citing an unsubstantiated claim popular in conspiracy circles. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump had announced in a pair of tweets that he would be asking for a "major investigation" into voter fraud, "including those registered to vote in two states. " Since then, a variety of news organizations have found that several members of Mr. Trumpâ€™s inner circle were registered in more than one state during the election.
