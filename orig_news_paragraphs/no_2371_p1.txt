On Tuesday, Mr. Trump was still seething over Mr. Ryanâ€™s refusal to stick with him. Mr. Trump also appeared to be laying the groundwork to blame Mr. Ryan and Republicans who opposed him should he lose the election next month, complaining that it is "hard to do well" without the support of his own party. Democrats, he said, are more loyal to their own kind. In a mood to settle scores, Mr. Trump also assailed Senator John McCain of Arizona for selling him out.
