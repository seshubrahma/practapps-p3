Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein countered mainstream media reporting that he had threatened to resign over the firing of FBI Director James Comey. [Rosenstein wrote a scathing memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions Monday recommending Comeyâ€™s immediate dismissal, a recommendation quickly taken up by President Donald Trump. Rosenstein concluded his assessment saying, "The FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions. "
