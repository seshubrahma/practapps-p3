Calais is now known as The Jungle and the Paris Metro looks like South Sudan  —   and is about as safe. In my home town of London we’ve elected a Muslim, Sadiq Khan, as mayor. We call him a moderate, ignoring his past history with some nasty characters, the fact that his wife immediately donned a hijab after he was elected, his idiotic beef with Donald Trump and his move to ban "body shaming" ads on the Tube. He has vowed to ban images of women in the public square in the name of feminism.
