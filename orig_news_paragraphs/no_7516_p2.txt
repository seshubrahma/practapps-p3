We have a very important job to do in California," said Tim Clark, Trump’s state director. According to the Los Angeles Times, he added "By harnessing the excitement surrounding Mr. Trump’s candidacy, it’s our intention to deliver 172 delegates for Trump to the national convention" during the June 7 California primary. Trump is scheduled to speak at the California Republican Party’s convention, taking place between April 29 and May 1 at the Hyatt Regency in Burlingame. Neither Cruz nor Kasich have enough delegates to date to secure the required 1, 237 for a nomination.
