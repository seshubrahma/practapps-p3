And yet either way the story is told, we can see the results in the humongous Internet of today: The U. S. made a profound choice, and it had a profound impact. Next we can cite another example of the government giving the Net a boost: In 1998, Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which included a "safe harbor" provision for Internet Service Providers, immunizing them from legal liability for the actions of Internet users.   We can immediately note that most other industries have no similar safe harbor if a consumer misuses their products, the companies can be held legally liable. Indeed, we might pause to reflect on the immensity of this safe harbor provision: If, say, Google were to be held liable for every copyright violation found on its site, it wouldnâ€™t be in business today.
