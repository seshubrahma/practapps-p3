What protesters have to say, Guard troops were seen arriving Thursday afternoon and the state was in the process of activating 316 troops for security and crowd control. What’s on the video? While the public shouldn’t expect to see the video, Todd Walther, spokesman for the Charlotte Fraternal Order of Police, told CNN that he viewed the footage, and it demonstrated Scott was "an obvious threat" to police officers. He said Scott can be seen with a gun and ankle holster in the video.
