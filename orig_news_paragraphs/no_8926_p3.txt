You talked about this with your team? Did the Warriors decide to scrap the basketball portion of basketball practice to talk about the election? I must confess ignorance as to when Donald Trump directly insulted Steve Kerrâ€™s wife and daughter, much less his entire basketball team. Steve Kerr apparently got the   talking points memo, though, because his comments almost to the letter mirror what Stan Van Gundy said earlier in the day, specifically, the charges of insulting women and minorities.
