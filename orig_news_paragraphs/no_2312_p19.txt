Mr. Obama had his own awkwardness with the Chinese when he arrived at a Group of 20 summit meeting Saturday. A   dispute over who would drive the staircase to the doorway on Air Force One forced him to exit from a door in the plane’s belly. White House officials attributed the dispute to inexperienced, overzealous security officials rather than any premeditated effort to humiliate Mr. Obama. But the images of Chinese guards shouting at reporters and hassling the president’s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, added to the sense that the Chinese were sticking a thumb in his eye.
