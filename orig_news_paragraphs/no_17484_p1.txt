Amid the flurry of activity    President Barack Obama ’s announcement of sanctions and expelled diplomats, Trump’s assertion that the US should "move on," and Putin’s declaration that (despite the recommendation of his Foreign Minister) he will not retaliate in kind against US diplomats in Russia (yet )    reports reached me in Rome that the Kremlin would allegedly take steps to shut down the school as retaliation against Obama’s moves against Russia. I was shocked, both by the sudden and dire turn of international events and by the material object before me.
