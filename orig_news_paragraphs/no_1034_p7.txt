The attack came on the anniversary of suicide bombings in Brussels that killed 32 people, along with three bombers. It confirmed fears among counterterrorism officials that London, which had largely escaped recent terrorist attacks in Europe, would join cities like Paris, Brussels and Berlin as targets of mass violence. " Terrorism affects us all, and France knows the pain the British people are enduring today," President Fran√ßois Hollande of France said at a news conference in Villepinte, near Paris.
