In issuing his temporary restraining order, Robart, the US district judge for the western district of Washington, acknowledged that issuing it is "an extraordinary remedy" but he held that the executive order "adversely affects the statesâ€™ residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom of travel. " He said the harms are "significant and ongoing," and concluded that the order against the government was necessary until the court could hear arguments for further relief. His order came after a different judge in Massachusetts declined to renew a temporary restraining order previously issued.
