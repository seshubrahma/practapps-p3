Donald Trump is expected to win all five states and collect most of the delegates from these contests. The only exception is Pennsylvania, which elects 54 unbound delegates to the RNC convention through the stateâ€™s congressional districts. If Trump captures Indiana and wins most of its delegates, he will be well positioned to secure, or get very close to, the 1, 237 delegates he needs to win the nomination on the first ballot at the RNC convention. If Cruz captures Indiana, however, Trump will face a steep challenge in winning a majority of delegates before the convention.
