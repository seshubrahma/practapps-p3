Trump held court during a news conference that lasted an hour and fifteen minutes, carving out a stunning moment in modern American political history. He displayed a sense of anger and grievance rarely vented by a President in public    let alone one who has been in office for just four weeks. " I have never seen more dishonest media, frankly than the political media," Trump said, later slamming leaks to the press from the intelligence community    some of which led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn.
