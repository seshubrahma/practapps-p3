" Levee wall" is a term for strong   walls alongside rivers, particularly along the Rio Grande river which marks the border with Mexico. Trump’s primary promise in his 2016 campaign was the construction of the border wall, which is being desperately resisted by legislators who went to preserve the northward flow of roughly 550, 000 illegal immigrant workers and customers per year up to businesses and donors in their districts. However, illegal immigration has less of an impact on Americans than does the federal government’s policy of inflating the new labor supply by roughly 25 percent.
