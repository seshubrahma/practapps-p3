Thursday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Democratic strategist and   Clinton confidante James Carville admitted that Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton has some image problems that must be addressed before the November general election.   Carville told "Morning Joe" Clinton’s high negatives must be addressed and he proposed using the convention as a platform to do so by telling Clinton’s story. " First of all, I think there is a problem that her negatives are higher than people would like," Carville said.
