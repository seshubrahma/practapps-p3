Some analysts note that this military surge has not brought with it a clear strategy to end Yemenâ€™s war or uproot Al Qaeda. " As the military line has surged, there has not been a surge in diplomacy," said Katherine Zimmerman, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The United States faces a similarly complex set of overlapping conflicts in Syria, where a brutal civil war opened up opportunities for Al Qaeda to infiltrate the rebels seeking to topple the government while the Islamic State seized an area of territory that extended over the border into Iraq.
