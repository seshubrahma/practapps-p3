Reports of vandalism against Trump’s campaign offices have peppered the news over the past few days, with campaign offices in Denver attacked twice in the span of 24 hours. In the first attack,   slogans and words such as "pervert" and "thief" were painted on the brick wall as well as the windows of the office. In the second attack on the same office, a rock was thrown through the office’s front window. A Republican campaign office in Alamance County, North Carolina was also vandalized earlier this week from a spray paint attack, WTVD reported.
