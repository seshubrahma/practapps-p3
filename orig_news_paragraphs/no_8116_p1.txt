Buzzfeed reported Friday the Purple One wrote a song called "Donald Trump (Black Version)," which was performed by an RB group called The Time. Biographer Matt Thorne wrote in his 2012 book Prince: The Man and His Music that Prince wrote the song for the Timeâ€™s unreleased album Corporate World, but it was instead added to their 1990 album Pandemonium.
