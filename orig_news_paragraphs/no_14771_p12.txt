The White House showed willingness to roll back Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion earlier than the 2020 date stipulated by the bill, in an attempt to assuage conservative opposition. " We’ve been pulling the bill to a more conservative place for a week plus," one senior administration official said, adding the White House is more "in concert" with conservatives on Medicaid. Ending the Medicaid expansion sooner could however complicate prospects for the bill in the Senate.
