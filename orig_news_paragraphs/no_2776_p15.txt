Mr. VandeHei, who stepped down last week as Politico’s chief executive, and Roy Schwartz, the company’s departing chief revenue officer, have been seeking potential investors and video and television partners. Mr. Allen is for the time being continuing to write his vital morning tip sheet at Politico, "Playbook," seven days a week. When I met with Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen, they were   about their next venture. They would only describe it in the broadest terms, as "a media company" that will focus on news and information, exist largely on mobile devices and social media, and not directly compete against Politico.
