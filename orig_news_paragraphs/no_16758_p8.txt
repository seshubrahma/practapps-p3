Schiff called Trumpâ€™s refusal to blame the Russians for the cyberintrusions "troubling," saying Trump "has essentially become an apologist for the Kremlin."   " My guess, Wolf, is if this guy weighs 400 pounds, he is sitting somewhere in Russia right now," Schiff added. Asked in July whether Russia was trying to use cyberattacks to influence US elections, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Russia believes it is reacting to what it sees as US attempts to destabilize Russia.
