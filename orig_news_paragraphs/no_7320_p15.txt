" This is 2016, and conservatives are so desperate they are considering a libertarian for the first time ever".   Maybe describing oneself as the candidate for the desperate isnâ€™t the greatest start, but he does point to how the recent U. S.

Not by supporting the ruling, but in shifting their argument from banning same sex marriage to one that involves getting government out of the business of marriage in the first instance.
