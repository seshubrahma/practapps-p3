Video shows ErdoÄŸan speaking to the   agents before they rushed the protesters in a coordinated attack and watching the violence.   It was brutal    with the agents punching protesters and kicking them while they were on the ground. The word outrage does not come close to describing this incident. I frequently write about my objection to political violence and censorship in America, and we have plenty of examples of both.
