The presidency has not made Donald Trump more presidential. If you look at Donald Trumpâ€™s actions over the last 100 days, by contrast, the record is much more mixed. I strongly disagree with Trump on many of his policies, from immigration to health care. But he has also seemed to moderate on key issues, including NATO and his relationship with key allies.
