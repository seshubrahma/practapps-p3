Patti and Richard Schwalm, owners of a machine shop in rural Henry County, an hourâ€™s drive east of Indianapolis, said they had to cut their staff to three employees in recent years. They blamed President Obama for hurting the manufacturers that are their clients. The Schwalms plan to vote for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican primary. Pressed for details about Obama administration policies that hurt manufacturing, Ms. Schwalm acknowledged, "The problems we have are 50 years in the making. "
