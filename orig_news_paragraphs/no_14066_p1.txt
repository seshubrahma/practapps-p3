Now I’m on the road again, making my way to the nation’s capital to join the Women’s March on Washington on Saturday. I’m going with my teenage daughter. As a male, I’m sort of hoping they manage to take over the place, since my gender hasn’t exactly been doing a   job when it comes to human rights. I’m not a joiner by nature, but I figure it’s time to woman up.
