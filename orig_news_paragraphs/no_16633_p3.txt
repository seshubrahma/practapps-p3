Since Sunday, Clinton has been off the trail with pneumonia, but returned Thursday to Greensboro, North Carolina, to campaign and also take questions from reporters. " As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good," Clinton said at her campaign event.
