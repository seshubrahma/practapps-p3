Thoughtful proposals have been put forward to pay for some of these projects with private funds —  for example, encouraging private businesses to build toll roads —  but most projects only deliver revenue to investors over many years and up front private borrowing will be needed.   Many projects simply can’t generate enough revenue directly through user fees to attract private capital, such as public facilities like parks and most mass transit, and those must be financed by new federal and state governments bonds. Replacing Obamacare with direct subsidies and tax credits to help low and middle income Americans purchase health care may instigate more competition among private insurance companies, but it won’t fundamentally lower prices for drugs, medical devices and the services offered by physicians, hospitals and the like. That would require implementing more far reaching reforms, such as the price controls imposed by the German government on its system of private insurance, and those are not likely to find much appeal in a Republican dominated congress.
