Finance chairman Steven Mnuchin has been floated for Treasury, as has Trump friend and businessman Carl Icahn. For secretary of state, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and former ambassador to the UN John Bolton’s names have come up.   Clinton’s team, Clinton’s list is also predictable in that it draws from a stable of longtime Democratic party insiders.    Potential names for Clinton’s chief of staff include former vice presidential chief of staff Ron Klain, campaign Chairman John Podesta, top aide Jake Sullivan, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and HHS Secretary Silvia Mathews Burwell.
