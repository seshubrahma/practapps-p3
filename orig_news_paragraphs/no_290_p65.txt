The opinion blamed a dysfunctional immigration system for creating the crisis by failing to keep out undocumented immigrants or provide them a path to citizenship. " Already disadvantaged as a result of poverty, lack of   ability and undeniable racial prejudices, these children, without an education, will become permanently locked into the lowest socioeconomic class," Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority, quoting the   opinion. The case also introduced the argument that undocumented children were legally blameless, unlike their parents: "The classification at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity for education afforded all other children simply because they have been assigned a legal status due to a violation of law by their parents," Justice Lewis Powell wrote in a concurring opinion. Undocumented children poured into the nationâ€™s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship.
