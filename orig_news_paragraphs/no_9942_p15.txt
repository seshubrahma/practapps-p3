All Of The Party Power Brokers, Who elected our State Chairman to his   term? Well, indirectly, the precinct committeemen.   Every two years, the Republican voters in each voting precinct get to elect one Republican to the volunteer office of precinct committeeman and one more for every 125 Republican voters in the precinct, or majority portion thereof. My precinct has twelve such positions.
