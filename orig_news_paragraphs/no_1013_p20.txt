The white slavery narrative has long been a staple of the far right, but it became specifically Irish after the 2000 publication of "To Hell or Barbados: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ireland," a book by the late journalist Sean Oâ€™Callaghan, which Mr. Hogan and others have said was shoddily researched. It received positive reviews in Ireland, however, and was widely read there. In America, the book connected the white slave narrative to an influential ethnic group of over 34 million people, many of whom had been raised on stories of Irish rebellion against Britain and tales of   bias in America at the turn of the 20th century.
