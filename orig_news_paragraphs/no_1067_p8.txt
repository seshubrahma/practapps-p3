The Polks’ grave, which is currently tucked away on a grassy patch, was designed by William Strickland, the noted Greek Revival architect who designed the state Capitol and George Washington’s sarcophagus at Mount Vernon in Virginia. A handsome monument framed by classical columns notes that Polk "planted the laws of the American union on the shores of the Pacific. " The grave is dwarfed by a nearby equestrian statue of Jackson.
