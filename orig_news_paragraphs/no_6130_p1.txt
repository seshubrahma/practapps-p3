The latest request, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, asks for money for flood relief, including for repairing the damaged spillways of the Oroville Dam, which nearly failed last month, resulting in the temporary evacuation of 200, 000 residents downstream of the dam. Desperate   engineering maneuvers  —   including a massive release of water from the dam down an   main spillway   —   averted a collapse of the emergency spillway. The Chronicle adds: "The Governor’s Office of Emergency Services has also requested assistance from the U. S. Small Business Administration for individuals in Colusa, Lake, Lassen, Plumas, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, where the flooding from February storms damaged more than 200 homes and businesses.
