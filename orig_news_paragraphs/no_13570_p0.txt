Billy Bush could have a new gig lined up by early next year as producers for the hit ABC show Dancing with the Stars are reportedly keen to have the embattled Today host compete in the upcoming season of the dance competition show. [A source with knowledge of the plan told the New York Post‘s Page Six that the network believes that the controversy around Bush could subside by the time the next season of the show premieres in Spring 2017.   Bush is reportedly negotiating an exit from NBC’s Today after he was heard on an    leaked tape appearing to laugh as Donald Trump joked about women behind the scenes during an Access Hollywood segment.
