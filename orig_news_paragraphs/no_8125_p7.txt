Despite all the changes to the Politico piece, there has been no notice to readers anywhere in it or at the end of the piece to notify them that Politico erred in calling Ivanka Trump the "wife" of Donald Trump. The Politico reportersâ€™ aim in writing this piece, as clearly laid out in the next sentence after this epic fail, is for them to use their influence as members of the media to drive an inaccurate narrative that there is somehow widespread discontent with Trump inside the GOP. "    Republicans are trying to suppress their displeasure with his controversial campaign and rally behind Trump before the GOP convention this month," the three Politico reporters wrote.
