Last week, the actor Peter Capaldi made headlines when he announced he would be leaving his starring role on "Doctor Who," the   British television series about a   alien. The Doctor  —   who isn’t referred to as Doctor Who   —   is a Time Lord from a distant planet who explores the universe in a time machine called the Tardis (which stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space). A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries.
