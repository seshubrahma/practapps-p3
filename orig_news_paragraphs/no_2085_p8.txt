No elector has been prosecuted for doing so, but then again, almost every elector has voted with his or her state’s results in the past. The Supreme Court has not weighed in on whether pledges and the related penalties are constitutional. On Friday, Jan. 6, at 1 p. m. members of the House and Senate will meet in the House chamber to count those votes. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the departing president of the Senate, is expected to preside over the count, during which every state’s vote is opened and announced in alphabetical order.
