I also just want to point out, because some people are spreading this information about the protester, he had canvassed for Hillary Clinton. And he had donated to her campaign. So, this is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. And I think that people saw a nimble, resilient Donald Trump, who would be nimble and resilient as president as well, take back to the stage, Dan Scavino telling people, weâ€™re not going to be stopped.
