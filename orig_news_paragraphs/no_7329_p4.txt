Roughly 1, 000 of the 1, 600 tickets from Saturday night’s debate went to the RNC and the South Carolina Republican Party, according to the RNC’s Sean Spicer. Following the debate, Trump and his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, have called for the general public to be able to attend the debates rather than donors and special interests. Trump urged his supporters to get out and vote on Saturday so America can be great again, adding, "These politicians are not going to do it. "
