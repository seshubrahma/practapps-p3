In 2011, as China became more assertive in the South China Sea, Vietnam accused China of instructing three   patrol boats to  cut the cables of a Vietnamese oil and gas survey ship. The authoritarian Vietnamese government was so furious that it allowed   demonstrations in Hanoi. In 2014, China moved a   oil rig to waters close to the Paracel Islands that both Vietnam and China claim, and then blasted a flotilla of Vietnamese ships with water cannon. Since then, China has hardened its position, sometimes referring to the South China Sea as a "core interest" in which there is no room for compromise, though others in the region call it bullying by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
