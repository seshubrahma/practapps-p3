Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama on Thursday dismissed suggestions a $400 million payment to Iran amounted to a ransom paid in return for the release of American hostages. Confirming the US offered the payment in cash, Obama nevertheless downplayed the deliveryâ€™s significance, saying it was not a "nefarious" deal. And he pushed back on Republican attacks charging that the White House completed the transaction as part of the prisoner swap.
