Urban, whose work in Pennsylvania for Trump after joining his campaign when former Sen. Rick Santorum dropped out in the early parts of the primary proved crucial in not just the primaries but also the general election, told Breitbart News that the images of Trump interacting with the Army cadets and Navy midshipmen were iconic and reminded him of when President Ronald Reagan rallied the military when he was  . " You saw a    who when he entered the stadium took the time to shake the hands of the cadets and midshipmen who were waiting to meet him and looked each one of them in their eyes and said ‘thank you’ to them," Urban, the man responsible for delivering Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes to Trump in the general election, said in a phone interview.
