After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November, governors in the nation publicly rejected President Obamaâ€™s plan to relocate Syrian refugees into the United States, as reported by Breitbart News. One of the terrorists had entered Paris under the pretense that he was a Syrian refugee. The number of governors calling a halt to resettlement of the refugees grew after the initial list of governors was reported. Breitbart Texas reported that Texas Governor Greg Abbott called upon President Obama to halt the settlement of Syrian refugees in the Lone Star State after the Paris attack that killed   injured approximately 200 people.
