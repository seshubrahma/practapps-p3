Behind the scenes, Democrats and Republicans on the House committee have quietly bemoaned the partisan split on one of the few panels in Congress that is known for its bipartisan work ethic. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland Democrat who used to serve as the top Democrat on the House committee, said that Nunes decision last week to alert Trump to the potential that he and his campaign aides had been picked up in "incidental" intelligence collection had cast a cloud over the entire House investigation. " It’s extremely disappointing," Ruppersberger told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin on "CNN Newsroom."
