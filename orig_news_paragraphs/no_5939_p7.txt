MATTIS: Only now are we completing the encirclement of Raqqah and there’s been no delay in the effort to do that other than the normal vagaries of the battlefield where we have to deal with an enemy who’s trying to defeat us. Trump would eventually decide to arm the Syrian Kurdish fighters. Dunford and Brett McGurk, the administration’s envoy to the   State coalition who also briefed the press alongside Mattis, said they have worked to mitigate Turkish concerns.
