Some of those stranded in Mexico and Central America have protested that the treatment of Cubans under the Obama administration, which differed significantly from the welcoming attitude the administration had towards other Latin American immigrants, was a result of  ’ embrace of conservative values. A result of a combination of factors  —   from the massacre of Cuban patriots under Democrat John F. Kennedy at Bay of Pigs to the   Congressional Black Caucus’ embrace of Fidel Castro   —     voters are largely conservative on foreign policy issues and lean Republican. The final tally of November election results showed Cubans more likely to support Republican candidate Donald Trump than even   white Americans.
