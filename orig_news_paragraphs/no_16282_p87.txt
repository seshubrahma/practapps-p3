While Toomey has certainly benefited from the stock market, how much heâ€™s made remains unclear. From 1984 to 1990, Toomey worked as an   trader for Chemical Bank and Morgan Grenfell. According to a Politifact investigation, he would have made approximately $260, 000, not including bonuses, during his stint on Wall Street.   Even if you factor in generous bonuses, it is unlikely Toomey topped $2 million as a trader.
