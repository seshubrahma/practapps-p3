But producers deemed the video so partisan that they excluded the De Niro section on Trump from the video and released it separately. The video began attracting attention when it aired Friday on "The Kelly File," the Fox News show hosted by Megyn Kelly, who has been on the receiving end of Trump attacks in the past.   The video was recorded before news broke Friday that Trump had used vulgar language to describe his attempt to sleep with a married woman and how his fame allows him to have his way with women. In the video, De Niro called Trump several names, employing some that the GOP nominee has used to describe people he doesnâ€™t respect like "pig" and "dog."
