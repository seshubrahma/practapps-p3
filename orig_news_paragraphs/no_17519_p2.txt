The campaign was asked to move to a larger venue to accommodate the thousands of people who wanted tickets, according to Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks.    The Trump campaign said 15, 000 tickets were distributed for the event at the Phoenix Convention Center, where the North Ballroom has a capacity of only 4, 200, according to the facilityâ€™s website. The campaign said thousands were turned away because of fire regulations. The candidate was welcomed by several   supporters, including Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose stands against illegal immigration and often controversial punishments have earned him a  reputation as a   unyielding lawman.
