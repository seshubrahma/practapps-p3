It seems like everyone wants to stop Trump, except the actual voters who keep backing him over his rivals in contest after contest. The biggest one is coming up on Tuesday, as voters here in Florida, per recent polling, are likely to select him over Kasich, Cruz, or their home state senator Rubio —  and voters in Kasich’s Ohio, recent polls show, may select Trump. Trump and Kasich are dueling it out for Ohio right now, according to new polls. Missouri, Illinois, and North Carolina voters will also head to the polls.
