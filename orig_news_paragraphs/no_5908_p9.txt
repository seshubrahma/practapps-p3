During the campaign last year, the former player called Trump a racist, attacked him over his statements on Islam, and exclaimed that Trump intended to set up a "tyranny" if he won office.    even claimed Trump was helping ISIS by daring to note that ISIS is a   terrorist outfit. The former NBA great doesnâ€™t just stick to Trump bashing, either. Last year   compared   NFL protester Colin Kaepernick to Thomas Jefferson as Kaepernick spent an entire NFL season attacking the United States, police officers, and the U. S. military.
