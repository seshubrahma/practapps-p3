He didn’t defeat 16 opponents by parroting Republican establishment talking points," said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Mr. Trump’s most stalwart supporters. The broader meeting with Republican senators followed a more upbeat session with more than 200 Republican House members at the Capitol Hill Club. According to two lawmakers in attendance, the conversation was fairly subdued and focused on border security, the need to protect the Second Amendment and the high costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, the health law that Mr. Trump wants to repeal and replace. Mr. Trump also insisted that he could be trusted to pick conservative judges for the Supreme Court, thanks to the advice of the Heritage Foundation’s Jim DeMint, and warned about the fate of the bench in the hands of Hillary Clinton, the lawmakers said.
