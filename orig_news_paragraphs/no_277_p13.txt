While Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers say that China has more to lose than the United States in a trade war, Chinese officials told visiting American businessmen last week that Beijing was prepared. They had developed lists of punitive options they would take against the United States if Washington took the initiative, they said. " The signals are very clear: If this is going to be a trade war, China will reduce imports of American aircraft from Boeing and agricultural products," said Wu Xinbo, director of American studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.
