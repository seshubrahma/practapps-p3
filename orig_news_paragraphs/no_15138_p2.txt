The US troops will join the small number of US special operations forces already there providing counterterrorism support to local forces battling the local al Qaeda affiliate, al Shabaab. That advisory mission has been underway for several years.   The US military official added that there are approximately 50 counterterrorism advisers already in Somalia as part of the ongoing mission.   The deployment was first reported by Voice of America.
