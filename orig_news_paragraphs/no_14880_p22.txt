My building happens to be mostly Muslim    brown, black, and white Muslim    and is located close to several prominent mosques, one of the reasons I’ve loved living here. But in the hallway my neighbors and I wonder what others are saying. In hushed tones we curse the casual and constant bigotry of this administration, just as we beg each other to take good care. We residents have become closer since the Paris Attacks last year, when police presence in this neighborhood ramped up noticeably.
