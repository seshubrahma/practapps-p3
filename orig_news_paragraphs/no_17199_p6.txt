The rebels inside, who were part of the Tawhid faction, had just executed someone accused of being a spy.   Moments later a young man was brought outside, blindfolded, his hands tied behind his back, led by two masked gunmen.   His friend, who was sitting next to me on the curb, explained the young man, 16 years old, had been arrested and interrogated because rebel fighters had found the phone numbers of girls on his mobile phone. The faction, which now controlled his neighborhood, was taking him home to his parents, who would be forced to pay a $75 fine.
