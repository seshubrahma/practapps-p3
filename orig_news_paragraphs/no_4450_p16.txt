Staying Safe: Despite the beefed up security, there are still some safety precautions one can take. Donâ€™t carry a ton cash, use a purse with zippers (or even better, a cross body bag) and pack photocopies of all your important documents (think ID, credit cards, airline tickets, etc. ). With such an influx of people, its bound someone is going to get lost. Be sure all children, disabled and elderly people carry an information card, including their name, address, emergency contact info, and medical information.
