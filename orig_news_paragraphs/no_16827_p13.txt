Pence says Clinton failed to negotiate plan to leave troops in Iraq, VERDICT: TRUE, BUT MISLEADING, Pence accused Hillary Clinton of failing to negotiate an agreement with the Iraqi government allowing US forces to remain in the country past 2011. When President Barack Obama entered office in 2009, he inherited a "Status of Forces" agreement signed in 2008 by his predecessor, President George W. Bush. That agreement stipulated American troops would leave Iraq by 2011. Pence’s claim that Clinton failed to renegotiate a plan to leave US troops in Iraq is accurate, but he failed to provide the context that the original plan to remove all troops from the country was signed by Obama’s Republican predecessor.
