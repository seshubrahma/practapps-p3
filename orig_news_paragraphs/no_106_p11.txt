Mr. Trump voiced only faint concern about what United States intelligence officials said was a campaign by Mr. Putin to meddle in American democracy. He reserved his sharpest condemnation for American intelligence officials who he said had failed to keep secret the accusations that could be damaging to him. On Wednesday, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. said he had spoken with Mr. Trump that evening and expressed his "profound dismay" over the leaks of unsubstantiated information. He said he had emphasized that this information was "not a U. S. intelligence community product" and that the intelligence agencies had not determined that it was reliable.
