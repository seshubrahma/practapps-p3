President Barack Obama himself has called out this behavior, pressing Chinese President Xi Jinping in    talks in 2013 in California on the topic of cybersecurity and continuing the pressure today. In a report this week, cybersecurity firm FireEye found that successful Chinese hacking against U. S. companies has decreased since the two countries signed an agreement in September to not engage in cybertheft of intellectual property    but found that it still continues at a substantial level. The State Department is not responsible for stopping Chinese hacking. The Treasury Department ultimately decides on sanctions, the Justice Department brings legal actions, and the White House and State Department work together to apply diplomatic and public pressure.
