Chelsea Manning, Obama’s concluding news conference comes amid a flurry of   activity, including handing down a commutation for national security leaker Chelsea Manning and a pardon for Gen. James Cartwright, convicted of lying to investigators in a leak probe. Obama defended the decision to commute Manning’s sentence, saying that she served a "tough prison sentence. " He said he looked at the particulars of the case the same way he had any other person whose sentence he had commuted.
