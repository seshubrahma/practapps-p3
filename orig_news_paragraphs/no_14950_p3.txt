The DACA program, created in 2012 by President Barack Obama’s executive order, is meant to shield from deportation certain people brought into the United States illegally when they were children. The program allows undocumented immigrants to legally obtain driver’s licenses, enroll in college and secure jobs.   Rodriguez says he showed immigration agents his DACA work permit, but was taken into custody anyway. President Donald Trump has vowed to preserve protections for DACA recipients, who often are called Dreamers, a reference to the proposed bill that would give DACA participants permanent legal status.
