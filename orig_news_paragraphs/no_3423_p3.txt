" Lefties from across the globe expressed that they lost all respect for McIlroy.   USA Today writer Christine Brennan can’t understand why Rory, who says "he won’t be having many cups of tea" with the members of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers because they took so long to admit women members to Muirfield golf club, agreed to play with someone as horrible as Trump in the first place.    Brennan wrote, "But wasn’t it natural to wonder why he said he wouldn’t be having tea with the sexist members of that stodgy club, yet still felt comfortable playing a round of golf with a man who bragged about sexually assaulting women, mocked a disabled person and carried on a   battle with a Gold Star family, among other things?"
