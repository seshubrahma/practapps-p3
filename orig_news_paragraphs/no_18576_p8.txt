Abbe D.   Lowell, a prominent trial attorney who represented Republican   lobbyist Jack Abramoff in a 2005 corruption scandal and is   currently representing NJ Sen. Robert Menendez against corruption   charges, was reportedly one of the people contacted. " "   As part of a   inquiry into the Trump campaign’s   possible ties to Russia, FBI and congressional investigators are   also reportedly looking into  a Russian banker who is a close confidant to   Russian president Vladimir Putin, in December. The meeting   between Kushner and Gorkov would have taken place shortly after   Kushner’s alleged meeting with Kislyak. " "   Gorkov was tapped by Putin to head up Russia’s Vnesheconombank in   January 2016, and Reuters reported that the FBI is examining   whether Gorkov suggested to Kushner that Russian banks could   finance Trump associates’ business ventures if US sanctions were   eased.
