While it is true that Clinton used a   server for email during her time as secretary of state, there has been no conclusive evidence that the server was compromised, nor any indication that foreign governments were involved in any attempts to do so. Two law enforcement officials told CNN that security logs turned over from the server showed no apparent signs of hacking. They cautioned, though, that does not show definitive proof that no one ever got in, as skilled hackers may have been able to cover their tracks. In a May inspector general report from the State Department, the IG cited instances where hacking attempts were suspected as part of evidence that officials were aware of her email practices.
