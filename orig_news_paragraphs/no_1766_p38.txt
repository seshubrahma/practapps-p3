The United States called the treatment "water dousing," but the term belies the grisly details. Mr. Ben Soud, in court documents and interviews, described being forced onto a plastic tarp while naked, his hands shackled above his head. Sometimes he was hooded. One C. I. A. official poured buckets of ice water on him as others lifted the tarpâ€™s corners, sending water splashing over him and causing a choking or drowning sensation.
