Kennelly says ICE can detain whomever it wants, including   people who have committed lesser crimes, and the county will   house these detainees. Hudson County has no hand in choosing   these detainees, he says. " With 287( g) we exercise very careful   discretion in the choices of   individuals we report   to ICE who are drawn from the arrested persons brought to our   facility by local police," he writes.
