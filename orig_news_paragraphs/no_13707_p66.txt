Rubio says the climate is changing because the climate is always changing but he says the flooding in Miami is caused because South Florida was build on swamplands. But he says there is no law that you can pass to change the weather. But he says the climate change laws will have no impact on the economy while American workers foot the bill. He says he is in favor of a clean environment but "these laws" will do nothing for the environment while hurting and devastating our economy.
