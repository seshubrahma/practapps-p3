August 25, 2016,    The Clinton campaign attack ad targeting Donald Trump portrays Breitbart News employees and readers as racists, white supremacists, and members of the Ku Klux Klan. The ad includes shots of men dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes followed by footage of crowded Trump rallies. One shot shows Stephen K. Bannon, who temporarily stepped down as executive chairman of Breitbart News, standing in front of a mural depicting the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
