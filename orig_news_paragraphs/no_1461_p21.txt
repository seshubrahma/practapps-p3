Immigration agents have conducted many roundups of drug traffickers and human smugglers. At the same time, a    migrant from Honduras, Wildin Acosta, was still being held in an immigration detention center in Lumpkin, Ga. five months after he was arrested when he was heading to high school in Durham, N. C. In 2014, Mr. Acosta crossed the border illegally and turned himself in to border agents, asking for asylum. Since he was 17 at the time and traveling without his parents, he was held under special protections for unaccompanied minors.
