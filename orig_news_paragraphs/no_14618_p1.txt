But hours later, Zagoria sent a   email to the group saying the visas were not approved and the talks were off. The   withdrawal of the approval of the visas came hours after the Malaysian government announced that  VX nerve agent was used to assassinate Kim Jong Nam, the estranged brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, on February 13 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport as he waited to board a flight to Macau. The extremely toxic chemical is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. South Korea has accused Pyongyang of ordering the killing, and the Malaysian government has implicated four North Koreans in Kimâ€™s death.
