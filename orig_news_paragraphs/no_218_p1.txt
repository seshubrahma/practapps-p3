Mr. Guzmán was put on a plane on Thursday in Ciudad Juárez, near the border with Texas, and arrived in the United States on President Obama’s final night in office. According to a Justice Department statement late Thursday, he was flown to Long Island MacArthur Airport in Islip, N. Y. The decision to extradite Mr. Guzmán was an   for the Mexican government, which once claimed that he would serve his long sentence in Mexico first. However, after his   escape in 2015, when his associates tunneled him out of Mexico’s most secure prison, officials began to reconsider.
