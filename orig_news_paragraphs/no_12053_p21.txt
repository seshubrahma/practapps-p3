But the think tank life is a nice life. You can be a Capitol Hill staffer, then you can go work at a particular think tank, and then you can be a   GOP strategist on Fox News or some other station, and then you can go be a lobbyist, and then maybe you can go be a consultant, and around and around and around you can go. And you can feel good about yourself because maybe on a Friday night, you go to a townhouse somewhere, and you have an esoteric conversation about the   bank, and think that youâ€™re really smart and fantastic and fabulous, and give yourself a pat on the back. Meanwhile, Americans are dying in the streets because of our open border.
