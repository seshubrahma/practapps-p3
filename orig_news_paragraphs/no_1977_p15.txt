Since the election, Mr. Trump has made only a few   announcements aimed at soothing controversy or bolstering his popularity, like the Carrier deal or his pledge to preserve elements of the Affordable Care Act. But he has not situated any of his pronouncements within a larger, cohesive agenda, or answered even basic questions about them, like whether the terms extended to Carrier should be made available to other companies. Mr. Trump has appeared comparatively uninterested in a set of   appointments in which his close advisers, like Mike Pence, the vice   and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, have quietly installed Republican stalwarts. On Tuesday, after Mr. Trump raged on Twitter about   his transition team announced the selection of Elaine L. Chao, a former labor secretary, to lead the Department of Transportation, and Representative Tom Price of Georgia, a conservative   as Mr. Trumpâ€™s choice for health secretary.
