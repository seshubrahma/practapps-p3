"I would say they need to lighten up, start going out and preaching the gospel to different people, including Donald Trump, and give him some time to think about spiritual matters, and work with him, and not condemn anybody," he told WABC radio host Rita Cosby. Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, called evangelical leaders’ continued support for Trump a "disgrace and a scandal."   " The damage done to the gospel this year, by   evangelicals, will take longer to recover from than the ’80s TV evangelist scandals," he tweeted on Saturday.
