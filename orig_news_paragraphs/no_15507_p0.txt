 (CNN) Republican Sen. Tim Scott said Monday that if tapes exist of President Donald Trump speaking privately with former FBI Director James Comey, then members of Congress should be able to review them. " If there’s any information that’s out there, we should have that information," the South Carolina senator told CNN’s Dana Bash at a "Politics on Tap" event in Washington.
