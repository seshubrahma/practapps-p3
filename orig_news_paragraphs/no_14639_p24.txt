Defense Secretary James Mattis, for instance, warned against cutting diplomatic resources during congressional testimony in 2013. " They need to be as fully funded as Congress believes appropriate because if you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition," said Mattis, who was then serving as the head of Central Command. Several of Mattis’ former colleagues, including celebrated generals like David Petraeus and admirals like James Stavridis, the former supreme commander of NATO, wasted little time in mobilizing to challenge his proposals.
