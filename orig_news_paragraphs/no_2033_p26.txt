Mr. Burnett, who is known for producing shows like "Survivor," "The Voice" and "Shark Tank" as well, also told Mr. Trump that he should consider a parade up Fifth Avenue. The group planning Mr. Trump’s inauguration has secured about $50 million in pledged donations since it began   in earnest last week, a breakneck pace that promises a glittering event, according to two people involved in the effort. The early success puts Mr. Trump on pace to easily surpass President Obama’s 2009 inauguration, when his finance team raised a record $53 million to fund the inaugural festivities. The group, the Presidential Inaugural Committee, has set a   goal of $65 million to $75 million, though the final figure could well be higher, the two people said.
