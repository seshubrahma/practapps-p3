Firstly, feminists like most academic charlatans like to use lots of big long words like "intersectional" and "systemic" to make themselves seem clever without doing any real science. They think this hides the fact that they aren’t actually saying anything. It works with grant applications, but it isn’t working on the general public.   Sorry ladies!
