The reason the supreme court is the central issue of this election is that the next president is likely to select quite a few justices   â€”   probably four, and perhaps even more than that. And that will shape the court for decades, just like it did for Nixon. There are currently 8 justices, and they often deadlock   on cases, which means the lower court ruling stands and no precedent is set.
