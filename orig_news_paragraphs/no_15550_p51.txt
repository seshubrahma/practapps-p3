MARK RADFORD, CEO, BLIGHTER SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS:   The RF jamming system is sending a radio frequency signal through the drone to block communication channels and that ray allows us to force the drone to land or to return to its base. SUBTITLE:   The radar system can automatically detect and track a flying object.
