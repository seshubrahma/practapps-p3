Yet after more than two decades of attacks from conservatives  —   some seizing on Mrs. Clinton’s own missteps, her former aides say, but most generally groundless  —   others worry that an even darker turn is possible, given the advisers now guiding Mr. Trump’s campaign. In addition to Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump is relying on the advice of Roger Ailes, the founder and recently ousted chairman of Fox News, and Roger J. Stone Jr. whose 2015 book, "The Clintons’ War on Women," accused Mrs. Clinton of being a lesbian, shaming her husband’s sexual accusers and playing a role in the death of Vincent W. Foster Jr. the deputy White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993. " This is beyond anything anyone even thought about in their worst nightmare," Mickey Kantor, a longtime Clinton family friend who was the United States trade representative and secretary of commerce under President Bill Clinton, said of the new conservative coterie around Mr. Trump.
