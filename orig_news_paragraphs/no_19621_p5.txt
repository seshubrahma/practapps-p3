The president reiterated his support for the   and   evacuation deal that is currently under way in Aleppo, the   epicenter of the nearly   civil war. ’ ’    "Our biggest priority right now is to put pressure, wherever we   can, to try and get [the civilians] out" of Aleppo, Obama said,   and noted that he would help   Donald Trump  —     who said on Thursday that he is in favor of establishing   humanitarian safe zones in Syria   —   with any advice he can provide   so that he can make informed decisions.
