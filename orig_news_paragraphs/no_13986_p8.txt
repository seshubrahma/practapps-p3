McConnell,   and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,   York, have held intense talks for weeks negotiating the overall confirmation process.    Democrats pushed to obtain background information from the nominees including ethics agreements to ensure the nominees wonâ€™t have conflicts of interests once in office before hearings are scheduled. They also urged GOP committee chairs not to schedule hearings on the same day so they are not bunched together in order to allow senators and the public to listen to the testimony. Democrats also wanted confirmation votes after senators have had time to digest the information and ask and receive answers to follow up questions.
