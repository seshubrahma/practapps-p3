In March 2015, it became publicly known that during her tenure as Secretary of State she utilized a private server for email communications rather than the secure government server. This act was clearly in violation of State Department protocols and federal record keeping regulations.   Upon learning Clinton also used her private server to send classified material, the FBI launched an investigation into it later that year. In May 2016, the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General released an   report on both the Department’s email practices as well as Clinton’s unauthorized practices.
