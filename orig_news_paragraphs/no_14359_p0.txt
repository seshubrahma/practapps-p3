 (CNN) Steve Bannon, chief strategist to President Donald Trump, repeatedly in 2012 interviews equated the Occupy Wall Street movement to Nazi Brownshirts, the paramilitary group that harassed and instigated violence against opponents.   Bannon made the comments in appearances to promote his film, "Occupy Unmasked," a movie that, according to its official description, "reveals the sinister, organized, and highly orchestrated nature of its leaders and their number one goal: Not just to change government, but to destroy it."   In his interviews and through the film, Bannon argues that the Occupy movement was part of the professional and highly organized left.
