Ask any conservative how shocked they still are when Donald Trump says exactly what they are thinking. We are so used to hearing   platitudes that don’t have any substance that hearing this man speak from his heart and wealth of experience and wisdom has electrified the nation. Donald Trump has also opened our eyes to the shady cabal of politicians and pundits in the conservative movement that don’t truly have America in their heart. Globalists, open borders activists and RINOs both in Congress and in the media first mocked the Trump candidacy, then were angry at him, then vowed to stop him at the convention, and now are terrified to their core at the thought that the Trump train doesn’t have brakes.
