" We are going to systematically walk through the entire Russia issue and fully understand what has transpired," Corker said Tuesday. It will be the third Senate committee planning to dig into the issue next year, joining the Armed Services Committee led by Arizona Sen. John McCain and the Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr. But these three reviews stop short of a separate standing committee whose sole task is to investigate the matter    similar to the way House Republicans established a panel to review the 2012 Benghazi attacks.
