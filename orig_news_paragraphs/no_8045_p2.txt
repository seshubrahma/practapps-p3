N. also emphasized that the limit Iran violated was a "soft limit," based on a calculation of how much heavy water Iran needs for its reactors, with a stipulation that excess material must be exported to the international market. The United States has purchased excess heavy water from Iran in the past. Reuters invests several paragraphs in speculating that   Donald Trump would be unwilling to accept these "soft limit" violations because he was strongly critical of the nuclear deal during the campaign, although it cites no specific statement from him about heavy water or the export provisions of the agreement.
