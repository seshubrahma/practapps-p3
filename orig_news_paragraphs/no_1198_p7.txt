Republicans have argued that "the real story," as Mr. Trump put it, is not the F. B. I. investigation into contacts between his associates and Russia, but the conduct of the Obama administration. Mr. Trump said on Monday that he had been the target of a "crooked scheme" by Mr. Obamaâ€™s team, and he followed up on Tuesday by retweeting a link from the Drudge Report: "RICE ORDERED SPY DOCS ON TRUMP?" Fellow Republicans seized on reports about Ms. Rice in the conservative news media. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky called the reports a "smoking gun" and said Ms. Rice should be subpoenaed to testify.
