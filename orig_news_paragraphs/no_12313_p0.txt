In a   piece from The New York Times, the   paper gushes over religious institutions across the country offering "sanctuary" to migrant felons. [The piece, titled "Houses of Worship Poised to Serve as   Immigrant Sanctuaries," showcases the movement known as "Sanctuary Not Deportation," where churches help shield illegal immigrants from federal law enforcement.   For instance, The Times   mentions one church which is actively helping to harbor illegal immigrant felon Javier Flores Garcia of Mexico, who is facing deportation again after already being deported three times prior. Flores "took refuge" in the Arch Street United Methodist Church, according to The Times, after he bypassed federal immigration officials and failed to arrive for his scheduled deportation back to Mexico: The federal immigration authorities say Mr. Flores has a long history of violations: He was apprehended nine times between 1997 and 2002 trying to cross the border.
