As things stand, websites like Snopes that are willing to sell out their   reputations to advance personal political prejudices have a rapidly shortening shelf life.   Just remember, when Daddy Trump takes office he won’t vow to destroy antagonistic news organizations as free   Hillary Clinton has. He’ll simply allow organizations like Breitbart to continue telling the truth, and let audiences vote with their feet. So to Snopes, CNN, and other leftist propaganda outlets (not to mention establishment GOP shops) I say this: enjoy it while it lasts, because we’re coming for you.
