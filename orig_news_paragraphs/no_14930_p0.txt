Charleston, W. V. (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence doubled down on the Trump administration’s health care message Saturday, even reading one of President Donald Trump’s tweets from the podium during an event about small business. " The American people want Obamacare gone, and as the President said today, don’t worry, America," Pence told a crowd of a few hundred gathered at a construction supply company outside of the state capital.
