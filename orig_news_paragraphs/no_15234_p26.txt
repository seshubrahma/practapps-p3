Legislative proposals, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration: Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act: An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class.
