A Marquette University survey of Wisconsin conducted last week showed Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 9 points in the Badger State. President Obama won Wisconsin by 7 points in 2012 and 13 points in 2008. Democrat Russ Feingold leads incumbent GOP Sen. Ron Johnson by 9 points also in the stateâ€™s contest for the US Senate. It is noteworthy that Trump is polling exactly the same as another Republican running for federal office in Wisconsin.
