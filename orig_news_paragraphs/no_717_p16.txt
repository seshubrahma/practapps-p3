Seemingly borrowing a practice from President Trump, Russia appears to be labeling as fake any articles it dislikes. The one from Bloomberg, for example, quoted Richard Ferrand, the chief of Emmanuel Macron’s presidential campaign in France, as accusing Russia of carrying out cyberattacks against the campaign. It quoted Dmitri S. Peskov, Russia’s presidential spokesman, as denying any link. The New York Times article, by a veteran national security reporter and former Moscow correspondent, Michael R. Gordon, detailed concerns in the American administration about Russian violations of a nuclear arms treaty.
