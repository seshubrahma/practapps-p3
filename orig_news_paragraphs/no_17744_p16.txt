Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a     wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very   moment, American troops are fighting    with our Iraqi   partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi   pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our   common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against   ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic   ideology of hatred.
