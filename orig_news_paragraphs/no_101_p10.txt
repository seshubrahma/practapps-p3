Richard W. Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota and a chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump and his team deserved credit for bringing Mr. Kushner on as an employee, rather than as an informal adviser not subject to criminal    rules. Mr. Painter noted that the trust was irrevocable, meaning it cannot be modified without the permission of the beneficiaries. He also said it was a positive sign that Mr. Kushnerâ€™s wife and young children were not beneficiaries. However, other relatives are.
