Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution and a longtime critic of how the government builds and runs the nation’s transportation infrastructure, laid out a long list. An increase in infrastructure spending would still lift the economy, Mr. Winston said, "but my God, wouldn’t it be so much better if we were more thoughtful about what we do with the money we have?" This, at least, is where the nation’s   grade turns out to be good news. Economists say infrastructure’s productivity lift is greatest when investment is being raised from low levels.
