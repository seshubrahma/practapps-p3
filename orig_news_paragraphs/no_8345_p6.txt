Clinton says that even if we were to stop the flow of big money into politics, "we would still have the indifference, the negligence we saw in Flint, we would still have racism holding people back, we would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay, we would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and fired on Monday, and we would still have governors like Scott Walker who are trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. " Clinton’s best closing to date in appealing to all of the left’s interest groups. Sanders is often a   pony in the debates.
