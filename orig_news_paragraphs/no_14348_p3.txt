After that episode and reports of other disturbances in other districts, House GOP conference chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers,   asked her colleague, Rep. Dave Reichert    a former sheriff    to give members some advice for handling potential protests both at events and at their district offices. " As membersâ€™ offices are experiencing an influx of phone calls and foot traffic highly organized by the left, Sheriff Reichert shared some best practices about how offices can still be safe and effective in this current environment," one Republican who attended the meeting told CNN. Politico first reported on the security discussion at the GOP meeting.
