[State officials urge that President Trump was acting within his lawful authority given to him by Congress when national security, foreign affairs, and immigration policy judgments require him to exercise it.   Last month the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed a lower district courtâ€™s order blocking the executive action, as reported by Breitbart News. The   opinion of the court was issued on May 25. The   decision upheld the halt of the executive order by the federal district court in the District of Maryland.
