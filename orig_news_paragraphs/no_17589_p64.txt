Over the past several years, we’ve seen                         Putin’s government operate with remarkable                         success from a defensive posture, fighting                         to protect what it sees as its interests                         and to maintain its relevance on the world                         stage. But we’ve only begun to see him act                         from a position of unquestioned power and                         influence. This is a dangerous and                         unfamiliar position for the United States,                         but also for Putin. After all, the rat                         didn’t catch young Vladimir.
