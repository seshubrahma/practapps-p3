Washington (CNN) Jim DeMint has been officially ousted as the president of The Heritage Foundation, one of the leading conservative think tanks. The decision by Heritage’s board of trustees, announced Tuesday, came after they found "significant and worsening management issues that led to a breakdown of internal communications and cooperation," according to a statement from the board’s chair, Thomas Saunders III.   DeMint, once a powerful South Carolina senator before rising to the top spot at Heritage, had been expected to depart the organization following tension with the board.
