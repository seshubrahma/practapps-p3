For the Americans who voted for Trump the speech will be a winner. They heard in the speech the exact person they voted for and he confirmed that there will be no "pivot" toward a more toned down style. For his opponents, and even skeptics on the fence, the speech will do nothing. They wonâ€™t forget everything that this campaign was about and the kind of advisors he is bringing into his cabinet.
