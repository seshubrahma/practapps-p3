Delivering the report, Tana de Zulueta, head of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, said the "No" campaign had been restricted and that the electoral authority unfairly changed the rules after polls had opened. She confirmed that the authority decided to accept ballots without official stamps late in the day, adding that it "significantly changed the ballot validity criteria, undermining an important safeguard and contradicting the law."   The referendum results cement a yearslong effort by Erdogan    who has served as President since 2014, following nearly a decade as Prime Minister    to consolidate his position.   A failed coup last year allowed him to turn up the heat on opposition voices in the   to Sundayâ€™s vote.
