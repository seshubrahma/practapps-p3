These financial ties  —   including the past speeches, business endeavors and well as donor relationships with the Clinton Foundation  —   have already attracted critics who say they include inherent conflicts of interest and could be problematic under a Clinton administration. From 2007 to 2015, according to returns released Friday and previously, the Clintons made a total adjusted gross income of $150 million and paid $48 million in federal taxes. In the same period they gave $16 million to charity, including $1 million last year that went mostly to their family foundation. The Clintons’ other income last year included $24, 932 in interest, $84, 358 in mutual fund dividends and $226, 297 in pension payments from the federal and Arkansas governments.
