The answer is simply that we have a deep structural problem in our economy and the basic answer is we don’t invest on American soil like we used to. That’s a major problem. We invest in Mexico and China and Vietnam and Cambodia instead. That drains our GDP directly, and then we also run a massive trade deficit: $766 billion a year, which alone probably takes a point off our growth rate.
