The U. S. Government is currently seeking the criminal forfeiture of more than $14 billion in drug proceeds and illicit profits from El Chapo, the former leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel who was recently extradited to the U. S. to face criminal prosecution for numerous alleged   crimes, including conspiracy to commit murder and money laundering," Cruz stated. The Mexican government extradited the former Mexican drug kingpin in January, Breitbart Texasâ€™ Ildefonso Ortiz reported. The move to an American prison cell followed months of court battles in Mexico and multiple escapes from prison by Guzman. As part of the agreement with Mexico, Guzman will not face the death penalty in the U. S. for his crimes.
