However, the one thing I did not approve of about this letter was that it had not been sent to a greater number of Iranian dissidents to be signed. Thatâ€™s why the Iranian regime is now trying to diminish the position stated in the letter by producing   letters with many signatures that go against the original letter sent to   Trump. Although the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) did not sign the letter, they are so far the most   Iranian opposition group to the Iranian regime (collectively referred to as   ) and have garnered support from advisors to Trump such as Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, and John Bolton. Tehran has classified NCRI, also known as MEK, as terrorists.
