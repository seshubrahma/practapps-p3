According to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trumpâ€™s order. Darweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon.   " America is the land of freedom," he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release.
