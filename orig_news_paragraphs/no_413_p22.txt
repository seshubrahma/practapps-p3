Being a movie star shouldn’t excuse you from the obligation of balancing your checkbook once in a while. And that’s the rub for observers like me (and perhaps you) who believe Mr. Obama’s fiduciary rules are good policies and should become established law: We don’t like having to defend the irresponsible choices of people like Johnny Depp. We don’t want citizens to be encouraged to think less about their finances and retirement rather, we want them to think more.
