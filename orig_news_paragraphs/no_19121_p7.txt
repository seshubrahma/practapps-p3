" ’    "It is extremely unlikely that someone who is a terrorist will be   sent through the refugee resettlement program," Greg Chen, the   director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers   Association, . ’ ’    "It takes a great deal of time, and it wouldn’’t make sense for   someone who is a terrorist for someone to go through that   process," Chen said.
