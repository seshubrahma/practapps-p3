Washington (CNN) Former US attorney Preet Bharara on Sunday talked about the three times Donald Trump called him, and the one time he didnâ€™t answer. Bharara was a US attorney until March, when the President fired him after Bharara refused to resign along with a raft of other   Justice Department attorneys. The sudden showdown came after several interactions with Trump during his transition to the presidency, when Bharara said he had two "unusual phone calls" with him.
