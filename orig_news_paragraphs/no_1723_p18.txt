In    cases, Chief Justice Roberts voted in a conservative direction 85 percent of the time, a rate higher than that of any other member of the court, according to a study last year in The Journal of Legal Studies and to related data. The study was prepared by Professor Epstein William M. Landes, a law professor and economist at the University of Chicago and Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago. " He is a reliable conservative in the most closely contested cases but moderate when his vote cannot change the outcome," the authors wrote.
