Jack Dorsey, a businessman whose estimated   was at more than $2 billion before falling out of the three commas club recently, is a leftist whose acquaintances include Black Lives Matter leaders DeRay Mckesson and   Coates. When he’s not busy driving Twitter’s stock value into the floor, he likes to engage in progressive activism. He follows notable progressive heroes on Twitter such as Feminist Frequency, Bernie Sanders (both accounts!) Amy Schumer, Stephen "help me check my white privilege" Colbert, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ahmed "Clock Boy" Mohamed, Sandra Bland, Lena Dunham, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Hillary Clinton, and Spike Lee.
