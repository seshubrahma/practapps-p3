 (CNN) At Oroville Dam in California this week, a major disaster was only one bout of heavy rains away. Luckily, the quick response of civil servants has averted a crisis, and with the water level at Lake Oroville dropping, authorities lifted the mandatory evacuation order and the nearly 200, 000 evacuees made their way home. Ominously, rain is now expected Thursday and over the weekend, and authorities are warning residents to be vigilant.
