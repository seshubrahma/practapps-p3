" Mr. Katz, known as Ketzale, was the driving force behind the yeshiva, its religious high schools for boys and girls and the   academy. A charismatic former member of the Israeli Parliament from a   party, Mr. Katz, a staunch nationalist, is credited with building up the   network in the United States and bringing in tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Friedmanâ€™s late father, Morris, commemorated on a plaque as a "founding member of Beit El," was one of the first American Jews to meet Mr. Katz when he started going to the United States more than quarter of a century ago and could barely speak English, according to Mr. Silberstein.
