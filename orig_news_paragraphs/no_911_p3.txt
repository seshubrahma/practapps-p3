According to two people with knowledge of the events who were not authorized to discuss delicate conversations publicly, Mr. Bharara notified an adviser to the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, that the president had tried to contact him and that he would not respond because of those protocols.

Mr. Bharara was a highly public prosecutor who relished the spotlight throughout more than seven years in office.
