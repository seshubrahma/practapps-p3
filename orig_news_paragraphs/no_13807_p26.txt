The country likely already has working nuclear warheads for its Nodong   ballistic missile, which threatens all of South Korea and Japan, experts say. And Pyongyang’s intermediate range missile, the Musudan, can hit Guam, the location of a major US military base and a critical node in the defense of the western Pacific Ocean. It isn’t clear whether North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear warhead on the Musudan yet. The ICBM would be the next level up, putting the continental US within Pyongyang’s deadly reach.
