It is possible, however, that Rubio’s campaign discarded   in Iowa and New Hampshire to pay for the advertising time already reserved in South Carolina. When a campaign reserves future   it doesn’t pay for it when it places the order. The campaign pays for it just before it airs. If the Rubio campaign says the decision to scale back advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire is linked to the primary in South Carolina, it seems likely the changes have been made to pay for ads currently reserved in South Carolina.
