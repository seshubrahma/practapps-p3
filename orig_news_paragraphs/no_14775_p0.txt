 (CNN) Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the   GOP senator, told CNN he is planning to run for   next year, abandoning his plans to quit the chamber after four decades of service. The Utah Republican    who promised in 2012 that his current term would be his last    said he has changed his mind at this time, partially because heâ€™s been getting encouragement from President Donald Trump and top Republicans to run again.
