Graham is a glittering example of the very same "loser" mentality Trump attacks so effectively. He’s also the kind of reptilian opportunist that would set aside all those   professions of contempt for Cruz to admit he might just be the only effective candidate against Trump  …      and then, in the very same breath, admit he doubts it would work anyway. How inspiring!
