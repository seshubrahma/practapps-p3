President Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama famously refused to refer to groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State as "radical Islamic terrorists," claiming the term unfairly maligned Muslims who were not members of jihadist groups. The Washington Post notes that Trump’s inaugural address was also the first to use the words "urban" and "infrastructure," a nod to the core message of city repair and equality of opportunity in his speech. " Whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator," Trump told the crowd gathered in the heart of Washington, DC.
