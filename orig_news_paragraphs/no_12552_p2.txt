We must restore the confidence of our people to be safe and secure in their homes and on the street. The senseless, tragic deaths of two motorists in Louisiana and Minnesota reminds us how much more needs to be done. This morning I offer my thoughts and prayers for all of the victimsâ€™ families, and we pray for our brave police officers and first responders who risk their lives to protect us every single day. Our nation has become too divided.
