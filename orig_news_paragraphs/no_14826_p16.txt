Nap said he himself voted for the progressive PvdA party because it had had the guts to go into government with Rutte’s party, despite that making it "very unpopular" with many supporters. Military historian Kathie J. Somerwil, 86, said she had voted strategically    for Rutte. " With this Wilders, I think this is not the Dutch way and with what’s going on in America, I must vote for the most strategic thing to keep the balance," she said.
