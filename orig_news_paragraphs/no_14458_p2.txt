Carl Azuz.   Thank you for taking the time to watch. It was the first time that U. S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met face to face since the American leader was inaugurated.   In a news conference Wednesday, President Trump said the U. S. would encourage a great peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians, but that it would be the two sides themselves that would have to directly negotiate that agreement.
