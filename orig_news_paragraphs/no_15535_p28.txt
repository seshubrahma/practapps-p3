The Washington Fire and EMS Department’s Twitter account said that nine people were injured during the protests on Tuesday. Those injured were taken to George Washington University Hospital and Georgetown Hospital.   In a separate video from Voice of America, a very bloodied Erdogan supporter is helped away from the scene.   It’s unclear how he received these injuries.
