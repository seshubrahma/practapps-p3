By the way, I am not arguing that liberals are not cowards. I have experienced their cowardice first hand during my college speaking tour, when they cancel shows with last minute exorbitant security fees because they are too cowardly to simply say "We are afraid to let this gay Jew with the wrong opinions speak on campus". But what   have learned is that courage involves action. It involves building infrastructure and infiltrating existing institutions, like they have so effectively with academia.
