A local gas station also became engulfed in flames. The MPD said that someone in the crowd began firing shots, perhaps in the air, according to the Milwaukee Sentinel. There have yet to be reports of anyone being hit by gunfire. Police also reported on Twitter that Milwaukee fire fighters were kept from extinguishing the flames because shots were being fired by some of the rioters.
