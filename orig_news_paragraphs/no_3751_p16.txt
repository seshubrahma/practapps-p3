The     program allows companies to annually bring in 66, 000 foreign workers instead of hiring Americans. The program provides the companies with cheap seasonal workers, minimizes the need for companies to recruit and train Americans, and it also cuts the salaries paid to   American workers, say advocates. Ryanâ€™s December 2015 language expanded the visa program by saying that foreign   workers would not count towards the annual 66, 000 limit if they had worked for a   employer during the prior three years. In effect, the "returning worker exemption" covertly quadrupled the size of the   program from 66, 000 visas per year up to 264, 000 visas per year.
