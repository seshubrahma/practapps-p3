It is not uncommon for a doctor to diagnose pneumonia merely after listening to a patientâ€™s chest through a stethoscope and hearing "rales," which sound like tissue paper being crinkled, said Dr. William Schaffner, the chairman of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical School. A doctor can also order a chest   a sputum sample and blood tests, "but she could be getting perfectly good medical care even if these things were not done," Dr. Schaffner said. Normally, patients are started on antibiotics immediately, and the test of whether the diagnosis and treatment were right is whether they quickly improve. Elevated white blood cell counts could indicate a bacterial infection, and a sputum sample and nasal swab can be taken to see what bacteria are present.
