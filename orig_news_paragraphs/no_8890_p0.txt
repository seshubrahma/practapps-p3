Former House Speaker John Boehner has taken a step back from his promise on Wednesday morning to back House Speaker Paul Ryan for the GOPâ€™s 2016 nomination. ["He has endorsed Governor John Kasich," his spokesman, David Schnittger, told Breitbart News via email.   " His    comments this morning [in Florida] were about a hypothetical scenario in which none of the current candidates are able to secure the nomination at the convention," said Schnittger, a "senior policy advisor" at the D. C. lobbying firm, Squire Patton Boggs.
