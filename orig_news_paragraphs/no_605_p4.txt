Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, revealed that Mr. Trump had known about concerns that Mr. Flynn lied for more than two weeks before demanding his resignation on Monday night. But Vice President Mike Pence was kept in the dark and did not learn that Mr. Flynn had misled him about his Russia contacts until reading news accounts late last week. Mr. Spicer described a deliberative process in which a new president took his time deciding what to do with Mr. Flynn, a retired   general who played a major role in his campaign. The issue, Mr. Spicer said, was not about legality but credibility.
