If Mr. Trump finished the day with a forceful speech denouncing Mrs. Clinton, he began with a meandering telephone interview with Fox News, during which he asserted that there were "many foreign connections" to the weekend attacks, though none had been established.

Mr. Trump also applauded himself for having described the Saturday night explosion in New York City as a bombing even before the police did.
