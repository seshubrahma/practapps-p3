Years before running for office, Trump went after Jon Stewart, who at the time was still hosting "The Daily Show," numerous times on Twitter after the   host comically crushed him.    In 2011, after the White House Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner where Seth Meyers stung Trump with jokes mocking him as politically inexperienced and racist  we saw Trump lash out at Meyers, calling him a "stutterer."   And in a stunning 2013 twist, Trump actually sued Bill Maher for $5 million after the comedian joked that Trump was "the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan. "
