May signaled a retreat from interventionist policies of previous UK and US leaders like Tony Blair and George W. Bush, saying that a renewed   partnership could not repeat the "failed policies of the past."

But nor can we afford to stand idly by when the threat is real and when it is in our own interests to intervene," she said.
