There’s still this ambivalence in regarding the Central American situation as a refugee crisis," said Wendy Young, the president of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington organization that offers legal assistance to unaccompanied immigrant children. " There’s a perception in today’s world that refugees are people who are fleeing war, and that gang and drug violence is not war," she said. Longer term, the Obama program in Central America could also be under threat because of its frequent reliance on a special provision called humanitarian parole, which allows certain immigrants to enter the United States temporarily even if they do not qualify as refugees.
