Note that the article references "border crossers". The term refers to anyone crossing the border illegally whether captured or not. The news outlet goes on to defend its original story by referencing Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reports about border apprehensions along the southwest border. The article attempts to further justify its claims by going back more than 40 years, something not referenced in the original article.
