We are using resources as appropriate to the commander ’s priorities and as the situation dictates," a military official said. On Friday in Syria, the day the United States fired 59 cruise missiles around 3:40 a. m. local time against Al Shayrat airfield, the   coalition carried out just seven airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, according to the command. All the airstrikes were near Tabqah, where Syrian fighters and American advisers are trying to take the town and a nearby dam, a move that would cut off the western approaches to Raqqa, the Islamic State’s   capital.
