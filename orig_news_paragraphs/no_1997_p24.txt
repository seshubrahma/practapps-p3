Both Beijing and Taiwan have played down the phone call, suggesting that they would prefer to see Mr. Trump’s words as a mistake rather than a deliberate policy shift. Still, Mr. Trump has retained some advisers who advocate more fully siding with the democratic Taiwan over the authoritarian China, perhaps even granting the former partial or full recognition. China and Taiwan, preparing for potential changes in America’s policy, must ask whether the call hints at a coming change, or at least at the possibility that   on Mr. Trump’s team could steer policy in radically new directions. If they are unsure, prudence would seem to require at least preparing for the possibility of a shift.
