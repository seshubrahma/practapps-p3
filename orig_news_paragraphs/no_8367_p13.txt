The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton," Trump declared. He pointed to the Middle East’s condition before Obama and Clinton took office, saying that in 2009 Libya was stable, Syria was under control, and Egypt was ruled by a secular president. He added that Iraq had a reduction in violence and a group, which is now called ISIS, was close to extinct. However, Trump says under Obama and Clinton’s foreign policy Libya is now in ruins, ISIS has gained territory, Syria is in a civil war, and a refugee crisis is plaguing Europe and the west.
