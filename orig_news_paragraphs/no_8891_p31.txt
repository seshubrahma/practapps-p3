: Sky News in Britain, which is also operated by the Murdochs, doesn’t have the edge of Fox News in the United States. If there is a change, Shepard says it will be a sign that "the Murdoch sons want to put their stamp on the company by importing practices from Sky News in Britain. " We can all parse over the phrase "doesn’t have the edge of Fox News," but to me, the meaning is clear: The Murdoch sons, aka the Minor Murdochs, think Fox is too conservative, too Roger   too Middle American.
