A Turkish official said Abedi had transited through Istanbulâ€™s Ataturk airport "recently" and did not enter Turkey. The official, who did not want to be named due to government protocol, said he could not confirm where Abedi arrived from or was traveling to. He did say, however, that it could not have been Syria because there are no flights to or from Syria from Istanbul. The official said Turkey had not received any information from foreign intelligence services about Abedi, so he did not raise any red flags.
