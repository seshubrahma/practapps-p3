Not to be outdone, CNN media reporter Dylan Byers brought up the recent Gallup poll that found more Americans than ever distrust the press. Byers insisted that the drop in trust is "largely fueled by Republicans" and their mistrust of the media as well as Donald Trumpâ€™s constant attacks on the press. Byers claimed that all these attacks on the media are a "serious problem. " "Because it is the role of the media to hold these candidates accountable, to hold both the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates accountable," Byers said.
