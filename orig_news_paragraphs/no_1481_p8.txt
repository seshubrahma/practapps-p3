Speaking sternly, and in far more detail than he usually does, he listed several previously undisclosed findings from the F. B. I. ’s investigation: ■ Of 30, 000 emails Mrs. Clinton handed over to the State Department, 110 contained information that was classified at the time she sent or received them. Of those, Mr. Comey said, "a very small number" bore markings that identified them as classified.

I. did not disclose the topics of the classified emails, but a number of the 110 are believed to have involved drone strikes.
