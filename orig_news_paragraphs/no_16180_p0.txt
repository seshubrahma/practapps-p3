Cleveland (CNN) Open discord and revolt broke out on the floor of the Republican National Convention Monday as GOP officials crushed an attempt to change party rules, a maneuver that could have embarrassed presumptive nominee Donald Trump. In a highly unusual show of disunity and anger on the floor of a modern party convention, a group of states tried to force a    roll call vote on the rules of the convention. The rebellion apparently caught Trumpâ€™s campaign team by surprise, and his lieutenants were seen frantically whipping votes on the floor to squelch the effort amid scenes of deepening disarray.
