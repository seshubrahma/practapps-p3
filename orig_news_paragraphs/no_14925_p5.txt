Democrats were already seething over Nunes’ decision Wednesday to brief the White House and tell the media that he had obtained intelligence suggesting President Donald Trump’s communications may have been intercepted by intelligence agencies    before telling his own committee members. Nunes later apologized for the move, which Democrats said was a major breach of protocol. On Fox News’ "Hannity" Thursday evening, Nunes said he "felt like I had a duty and obligation" to brief Trump on the intelligence, because "he’s been taking a lot of heat in the news media. "
