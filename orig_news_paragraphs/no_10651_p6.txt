A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and will stop the jobs from leaving Michigan. During his rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump noted that in addition to those jobs: GM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton. Lear Corporation laid off another 50 people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea. FTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills.
