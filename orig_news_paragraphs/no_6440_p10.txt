This tight margin means that the Senate Republicans do not have the votes to end debate and force a vote, which requires 60 votes. To make an end run around lacking the votes for cloture, Republicans are forced to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through the budget reconciliation process. In this process, the budget bills are privileged, so they must come to a vote after 50 hours of debate. The drawback to this process is that bills can only deal with   issues, and whatever is passed expires in 10 years.
