Two years ago, a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia began bombing the rebels, hoping to weaken them militarily and restore the government. They have made little progress, while more than 10, 000 people have been killed and large parts of the country are on the verge of famine, according to the United Nations. Under Mr. Obama, the United States provided military support to the   coalition, but halted the sale of   munitions over concerns that airstrikes by Saudi Arabia and its allies were killing too many civilians. But since Mr. Trump took office, his administration has advanced some arms deals for coalition countries, while approving the resumption of sales of   munitions to Saudi Arabia, according to an American official familiar with Yemen policy.
