Cruz replied, "One of the disturbing things of this election, and there are many, is it opens the door potentially for what comes next and what comes next is not likely to be sound, stable leaders with good judgement and the understanding of the problems facing this country, our economy and the challenges and threats facing us across the world. " Cruz said his next step is heading back to Washington to go back to the U. S. Senate and fight for the jobs, freedom and security platform he ran on during his presidential campaign.
