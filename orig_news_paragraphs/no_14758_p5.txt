" More than 20 million Americans currently have health care coverage due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and among the AMA’s highest priorities for   health system reform efforts is to ensure that these individuals maintain that coverage," said the letter signed by James L. Madara, the CEO of the interest group, a prolific donor to both political parties. Other leading health care industry players opposing the bill include America’s Essential Hospitals, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Children’s Hospital Association. The AARP has also come out against the legislation.
