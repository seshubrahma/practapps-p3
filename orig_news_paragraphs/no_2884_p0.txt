A fake news article led to gunfire at a Washington pizzeria three weeks ago. Now it seems that another fake news story has prompted the defense minister of Pakistan to threaten to go nuclear. The defense minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, wrote a   Twitter post directed at Israel on Friday after a false report  —   which the minister apparently believed  —   that Israel had threatened Pakistan with nuclear weapons. Both countries have nuclear arsenals.
