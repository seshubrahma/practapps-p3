a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence  —   and an acrimonious,   vigil on the Senate floor by the chamber’s Democrats. Tom Price was confirmed as secretary of health and human services after another   marathon. This week, the Senate holds confirmation votes on Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, David Shulkin to head veterans affairs and Linda McMahon for administrator of the Small Business Administration. It will also hold a hearing on Andrew Puzder, whose nomination to be labor secretary has been opposed by labor groups concerned about his heavy opposition to workplace regulation.
