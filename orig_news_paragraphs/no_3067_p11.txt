Safronkov explained that the reason Russia vetoed the U. N. resolution was because it "appointed the guilty party prior to the investigation, prior to an independent and objective investigation," an approach that was "incompatible with the legal norms. " However, the U. N. resolution did not actually name the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as the perpetrator of the attack. It condemned "the reported use of chemical weapons, in particular the attack on Khan Sheikhoun" and called upon the Syrian government to fully cooperate with an investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
