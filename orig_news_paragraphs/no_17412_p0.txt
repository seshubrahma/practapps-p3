Washington (CNN) Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team has expanded its search for the   command at the State Department, several sources familiar with the deliberation told CNN, as one of the leading candidates is facing resistance.   The sources say the transition appears to be struggling with who they want for the deputy secretary of state post, just as they did for the top job before Trump tapped retiring ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former National Security Advisor Steve Hadley and Bob Gates, former secretary of defense, all of whom know Tillerson, recommended him for the post after   elect Mike Pence asked their advice about possible candidates.
