" Not no more," Ramirez allegedly replied, according to the government’s filing. "(Ramirez) was then questioned further regarding a ’gang tattoo’ on his forearm, to which he responded that he ’used to hang out with the Surenos in California,’ that he ’fled California to escape from the gangs,’ and that he ’still hangs out with the Paizas in Washington state,’" the government’s filing says. The government says it transferred him to a detention center in Tacoma and issued him a "notice to appear" at immigration removal proceedings.
