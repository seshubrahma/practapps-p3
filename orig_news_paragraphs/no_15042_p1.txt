Trump, who has previously argued against removing Assad from power, said the attack on a   town in Syria’s Idlib province was a "heinous" act that "crossed a lot of lines for me."   The President has not offered any details of how US strategy on Syria would change    but he did tell some members of Congress that he’s considering military action in Syria in retaliation for Tuesday’s chemical attack, a source familiar with the calls told CNN on Thursday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff held a quickly called meeting in the office of the chairman, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, on Thursday afternoon and were briefed on the military options regarding Syria, a US military official told CNN.   The attack killed at least 86 people, including 26 children.
