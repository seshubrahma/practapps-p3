The new memo also directs officials to collect and share information about immigrants and refugees who commit crimes, including the terror and   crimes associated with people from   countries.   Section 11 of the new order declares officials should collect information about: (i)    information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with   offenses while in the United States convicted of   offenses while in the United States or removed from the United States based on   activity, affiliation with or provision of material support to a   organization, or any other    reasons, (ii)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and who have engaged in   acts, or who have provided material support to   organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, (iii)  information regarding the number and types of acts of   violence against women, including   "honor killings," in the United States by foreign nationals.   (iv)   any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses. The new Executive Order says it does not "discriminate" against any particular religion, which is likely meant to rebut progressive claims that opposition to Islamâ€™s combined religious and political ideology is similar to legal curbs on the practice of Christianity and other religions which do accept the separation of church from state.
