Intelligence Analysis concluded that the intelligence arm of CENTCOM routinely produced intelligence that "distorted, suppressed, or substantially altered" the results of the campaign against the Islamic State.   Much of the   August 10, 2016 House report remains unreported by the news media. The investigation provides insight into the manner in which Obama administration officials were caught reforming one U. S. intelligence agency to produce results that conformed to a political agenda instead of accurately reflecting intelligence information on the ground. The document deserves a revisit amid unsubstantiated claims about Trump and Russia in recent months that have dominated the discourse after they were amplified by Obama administration intelligence agencies.
