Former UN Ambassador John Bolton will come on the program to speak about prosecuting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for using a private email server while serving as Secretary of State.

Bolton will also talk about the upcoming Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Red Jahncke of the the New York Sun will speak about how Trump will likely lock up the Republican presidential nomination if he wins the Florida primary.
