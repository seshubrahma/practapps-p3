Theyâ€™re not like other pens.   Instead of relying on gravity, they have special pressurized cartridges that use nitrogen gas to push ink out, which means they can write at any angle or in extreme cold, or extreme heat, where an ink of a normal pen would get too thick or too thin to write.    And though most pens use   ink, space pens use glycol, allowing them to write underwater, or even through grease.    Paul Fisher first created the pressured ink cartridge in 1966.
