The full statement from the NBPC: March 30, 2016, The National Border Patrol Council is the official organization representing our nationâ€™s Border Patrol Agents. We represent 16, 500 agents who selflessly serve this country in an environment where our own political leaders try to keep us from doing our jobs. The NBPC has had a longstanding practice of not endorsing presidential candidates in the primaries. We will not, however, shy away from voicing our opinions as it pertains to border security and the men and women of the United States Border Patrol.
