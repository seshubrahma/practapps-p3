Camarota offers the following conclusions from his study: The report of fiscal costs of immigrant border crossers is based on "net present value" (NPV). This process has a net effect of reducing the size of the net drain on economic resources based on their education level. " Rhe actual net lifetime fiscal cost of illegal   given their education levels, is possibly $140, 000 to $150, 000 each in their lifetimes if the NPV concept is not used," Camarota stated.
