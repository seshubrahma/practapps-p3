Marnell, a longtime Southern Nevada developer told the   that a recent study showed that an estimated 27 percent of travelers from Southern California would take   rail to Las Vegas if it existed. This report added that the ridership demand combined with the cost of   tickets, with an average of $115, would generate more than $1 billion a year in operating revenue when the system is fully operational in 2035. A train could be running sooner, Marnell said, with an estimated two to three years to ramp up and four to five to build. Marnell also credited President Trumpâ€™s election for the resurrection of the project, telling the  : "We all know that the Republicans are not big advocates of spending money on infrastructure, although this president is one of the first presidents to come along in a long time that recognizes the country needs another investment in infrastructure and it needs an investment in 21st century technology.
