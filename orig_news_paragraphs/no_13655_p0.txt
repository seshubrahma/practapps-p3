Robert Jeffress, pastor of the 12, 000 member First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, is rebuking talk radio host Glenn Beck for his recent criticism of evangelical Christians who live in the South and are not supporting Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign to secure the Republican Presidential nomination. ["All throughout the South the Evangelicals are not listening to their God," Beck said at a rally in Utah on Monday.   " Beck’s wacko comment speaks for itself," Jeffress tells Breitbart News.
