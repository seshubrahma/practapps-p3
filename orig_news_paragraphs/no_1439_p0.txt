Donald J. Trump said in an interview published on Sunday that he would be in favor of Britain leaving the European Union. Mr. Trump made the remarks in an interview with The Sunday Times of London ahead of a referendum on the issue on Thursday and before his planned visit to Britain. " I would personally be more inclined to leave, for a lot of reasons like having a lot less bureaucracy," Mr. Trump said.
