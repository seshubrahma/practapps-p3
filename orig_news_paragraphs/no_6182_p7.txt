The Task Force recognizes terrorist inﬁltration into the United States through the refugee process is less likely than other routes and more time intensive for extremists, but these threats must be kept in mind during the refugee screening process.   Such tactics would not be new for terrorist groups, and more than four million people have ﬂed the conﬂict zone in Syria, offering extremists ample opportunity to blend into migrant groups.   …     Law enforcement and intelligence officials have expressed concern publicly and privately to Task Force Members that our refugee screening process has inherent vulnerabilities, particularly in   countries where we have little intelligence on the ground. The lack of information makes it difficult to conduct   background checks on potential refugees. In other words, we cannot screen against information we do not have.
