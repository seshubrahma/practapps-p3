If Alexei Ulyukayev had been accused of running over an old lady while driving a Gelandewagen at high speed through Moscow late at night, even that would look more probable," Mr. Shokhin said. Ilya Shumanov of Transparency International, which fights corruption, told RBC Daily, a financial newspaper, that a $2 million bribe was a paltry, unrealistic sum in Russia’s moneyed oil industry, suggesting that was the kind of sum a deputy mayor might solicit. A recent   among Mr. Putin’s advisers prompted some analysts to suggest that Mr. Ulyukayev’s arrest was part of a trend of replacing seasoned veterans with a younger generation less likely to question the president’s decisions. Many analysts, however, considered the arrest part of a different trend: the increasing power of the siloviki, or members of the security services, over the whole government.
