[In a new report by USA Today, sanctuary cities can be expected to find themselves on the receiving end of a Trump administration that has "broad powers" in terms of cracking down on their refusal to hand illegal immigrants over to federal authorities:   Donald Trump, with a little help from Congress, will have broad presidential powers to crack down on "sanctuary cities" that protect undocumented immigrants from his planned roundup and deportation of millions who are in the country illegally. In what could become a major conflict between the new president and local governments, the showdown likely will result in legal challenges testing how far the White House can go in dictating its priorities. Trump will be armed with a range of powerful options, including federal lawsuits and the power to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in grants that states and cities rely on.
