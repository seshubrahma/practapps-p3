Bannon noted Coburn’s trustworthy reputation, and asked a tough question about Rubio: didn’t the Florida senator’s participation in the Gang of Eight immigration fiasco leave many voters unable to trust him? Coburn was convinced such voters would regain their trust in Rubio if they got to know him better.   He noted that he personally opposed the Gang of Eight plan, insisting that border security had to be achieved before any other steps could be taken toward comprehensive immigration reform, and said Rubio learned that lesson "the hard way. "   He stressed that making mistakes shouldn’t cause someone to be regarded as untrustworthy.
