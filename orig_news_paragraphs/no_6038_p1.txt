[The TV report quoted navy chief Adm. Habibollah Sayyari as saying the   maneuver will cover an area of 2 million square kilometers (772, 000 square miles) in the Sea of Oman and the Indian Ocean near the strait. It showed Iranian warships and helicopters taking part in the exercise.   Nearly a third of all oil traded by sea passes through the strait and it has been the scene of previous confrontations between the U. S. and Iran. But the drill does not involve Iranâ€™s elite Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force the U. S. Navy often criticizes for harassing its vessels.
