Washington (CNN) White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Sunday there was no collusion between anyone involved in President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian officials.   Priebus, in an interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace, also offered the closest thing to an official timeline for former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s firing, who was asked to resign after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about US sanctions before Trump took office. The time frame Priebus laid out, however, leaves it unclear exactly when Pence was told Flynn had misled him.
