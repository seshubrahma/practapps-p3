In FY15, 322   members were arrested by HSI out of 125, 211 total arrested by ICE. In the current fiscal year, which began last fall, 253   members have been arrested.   ICEâ€™s other arresting agency, Enforcement and Removal Operations, does not track arrests by   and has no data on the gang.   Leap says the gang has earned a reputation above others in the US not because it is more dangerous, necessarily, but because its violence is known to be particularly brutal, because it is one of the rare gangs that operates internationally, and because in Los Angeles it was the only gang to not observe "prison discipline"    the customary pause in rivalry among gang members who were incarcerated.
