And I’m going to be very blunt. I’ve watched in pain, when I see a presidential candidate, all of our words matter, whether you’re a citizen or a presidential candidate, words matter, and this is a time where we need courageous empathy, where we need undeterred love. And so, when I hear a presidential candidate like Donald Trump gratuitously demeaning women, demeaning Muslims, demeaning Latinos, at a time where our country needs reconciliation, we need people that bind our wounds, and build bridges across our chasms. To see someone so callously stoking hate and fear, and inflaming divide.
