John Kelly stood by US laws against the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture, doubted the efficacy of monitoring Muslims as a group in counterterrorism efforts and    perhaps most significantly    downplayed the importance of a physical border wall.

It has to be a layered defense," Kelly said, advocating the importance of partnerships with Latin American countries to combat drug and human trafficking.
