 (CNN) Donald Trump and his senior White House aides are preparing for what they expect to be a prolonged and trying fight over whether the President, his campaign or his ring of associates had inappropriate contacts with Russian operatives during the 2016 election. After initially dismissing the probe    which has ballooned into a Justice Department inquiry led by special counsel Robert Mueller    as nothing more than a politically motivated "witch hunt," the White House’s top officials are beginning to realize that the drumbeat of stories about Russia could overshadow the administration’s objectives for months, if not years. Trump is expected to hire attorney Marc Kasowitz to represent him as part of a team on matters related to the inquiry into his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, according to a senior administration official and a person close to Trump.
