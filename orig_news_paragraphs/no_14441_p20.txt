Other Republicans have called for an investigation into the leaks over the information related to Flynn, instead of into the actions of the former national security adviser himself.   The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Mark Warner of Virgnia, told CNN the American public "deserves" to know more about Michael Flynnâ€™s resignation and the events leading up to it. " I think it would be appropriate for Mr. Flynn, now that he has resigned, to testify," Warner said.
