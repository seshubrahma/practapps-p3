In the meantime, now that Brexit has won, we might take note of those, in addition to Farage, who were early prophets. One such is Robert Tombs, professor of history at Cambridge University, who in 2015 was quoted in Breitbart London, describing the EU in the direst possible terms: There is a soft push to create a sense of European citizenship which is based on frankly an invented common history because the history of Europe is to a large extent the history of division, not the history of unity. When it has been the history of unity, as weâ€™ve seen under Napoleon and Hitler or under the Soviets in Eastern Europe, it has gone disastrously wrong. It is a papering over the discordant elements in European history to create this idealized event.
