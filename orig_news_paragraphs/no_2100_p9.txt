The decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which is composed of five members appointed by Parliament but is independent of the government, drew outrage from the government in Beijing. China had warned the secretary of the Nobel committee against giving Mr. Liu the prize, and after the decision, Beijing canceled meetings with Norwegian officials and it later halted the trade talks. Even so, "the overall impact on trade, even in the seafood sectors, was not very profound, and bilateral trade hit record levels in 2015," according to Marc Lanteigne, a senior research fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. At the prize ceremony in December 2010, Mr. Liu was represented by an empty chair.
