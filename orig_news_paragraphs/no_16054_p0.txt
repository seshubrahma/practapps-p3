 (CNN) Former President Bill Clinton said he regrets his meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier in the week, an encounter that has caused another controversy for his wife’s presidential campaign. The 42nd president’s remarks echo those made by Lynch on Friday, who acknowledged that the meeting has cast a "shadow" over the Justice Department’s investigation into a private email server used by Hillary Clinton while she was leading the State Department. The criticism of the meeting prompted Lynch to say Friday that she will accept the determinations and findings of the FBI and career prosecutors who are investigating Clinton’s email use.
