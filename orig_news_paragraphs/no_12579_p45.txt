Media: quit claiming the rioters are "peaceful" as they stomp on our flag, shout "death to cops!" and celebrate violence. It is sick. You perpetuate a perverted message evil men thrive on to intimidate and warp malleable minds that would believe one race matters more than another. Blood is on your complicit hands when you naively or purposefully refuse to tell of this movementâ€™s truth.
