On matters like the Supreme Court, Trump can count on all 52.

That February afternoon in the Roosevelt Room, Donnelly thanked Trump for negotiating with Carrier, the manufacturing company based in Indiana that had threatened to move jobs to Mexico before Trump   it into keeping many of them in Indiana.
