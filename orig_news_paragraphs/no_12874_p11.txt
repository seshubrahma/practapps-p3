because with his time in office dwindling down, I’m very worried that Obama and Kerry are going to be trying to build their legacy in an ideological way that’s gonna cause significant damage to the United States. Bolton said the media’s coverage of the two leading U.

We have interests that diverge, particularly on strategic weapons, and the overall global arrangement of things. The Obama administration’s gotten it completely wrong.
