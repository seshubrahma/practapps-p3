At noon Friday, the most divisive campaign in recent history    and a similarly contentious transition period, marked by Trump’s attacks on Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, and dozens of House Democrats saying they’ll boycott Trump’s   over it    reaches its end.   Trump’s brash statements about ISIS, his cozy relationship with Russia and his criticism of NATO have the world bracing for a new type of American president.   But before all that, Republicans and Trump’s   staff are set for a celebration. Trump and   elect Mike Pence go through the ceremony at the Capitol at noon, followed by a parade up Pennsylvania Avenue    and past Trump’s new hotel    to be followed by a weekend of balls and an anticipated flurry of new executive actions Monday.
