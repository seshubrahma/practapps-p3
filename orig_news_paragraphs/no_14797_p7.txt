Close political aides to both New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio    both Democrats    have recently come under Bharara’s prosecutorial microscope.    The investigation of possible ties between members of the Trump campaign team and Russian officials, and the President’s claim that he was wiretapped in Trump Tower on orders of President Obama, will all lead back to the Southern District of New York. In the end, President Trump has undoubtedly decided that he wants his own pick rather than the choice of Senate adversary Chuck Schumer in place as the top federal prosecutor in New York.    In terminating Bharara, though, the President has created a formidable and charismatic enemy who shares the President’s social media skills.
