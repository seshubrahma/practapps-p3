The European intelligence agencies detected multiple communications over several months between the Trump associates and Russian individuals    and passed on that intelligence to the US. The US and Britain are part of the   "Five Eyes" agreement (along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand) which calls for open sharing among member nations of a broad range of intelligence.   The communications are likely to be scrutinized as part of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russia ’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.
