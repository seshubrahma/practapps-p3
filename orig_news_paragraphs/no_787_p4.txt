But the pivot since Election Day is huge. The Standard   Poorâ€™s 500 index is up 12 percent since Nov. 8, the London FTSE 100 index reached a new high Wednesday, and other global markets have grown nicely in that span.   Treasury bonds now yield 2. 45 percent, up from 1. 85 percent on Election Day, suggesting investors believe higher growth and inflation are more probable than had seemed likely just four months ago.
