The official said that the desire to get this out came from a subordinate Special Operations unit involved in the raid frustrated by the politicization and coverage of the mission. The Pentagon quickly approved the idea when broached by CENTCOM, the official added. A White House official told CNN it was not involved in the Pentagonâ€™s decision to release video of the January raid in Yemen. The video that was released is nine years old, according to US CENTCOM officials.
