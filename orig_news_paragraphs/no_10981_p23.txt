Convention program (Exhibit B, Paid for by the Colorado Republican Committee, www. cologop. org) and noticed that the numbers only went up to 588, yet for 4 of the delegates on the slate, their numbers were higher than 588, and therefore not listed in the program: #589 Kimberly Jajack, #598 Rheba Massay, #602 Becky Mizel, #610 Gabriel Schwartz, I started asking around to try to figure out what the delegates were using as a reference to vote with what was the "official" guide to match names to numbers?   I was given a "Delegates to the Republican National Convention Ballot Supplement" (Exhibit C) and cross referenced numbers and names on the slate with this.
