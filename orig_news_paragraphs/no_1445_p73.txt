Ryan views himself as a guardian of conservative "ideas. " "Ideas" is one of those fetish words, popular among ambitious young pols (conservative   are constantly dropping Kemp’s name). As the speaker of the Florida House, Rubio published a book in 2006 of "100 innovative ideas" and spoke about his love of ideas during his presidential campaign, before he started making   jokes about Trump. Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor who was then considered one of the   innovators of the party, warned after Romney’s defeat in 2012 that the G. O. P. must stop being "the stupid party" and urged fellow Republicans to talk "like adults" and swear off "offensive and bizarre" rhetoric.
