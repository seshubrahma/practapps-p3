There you go again, and the presidency election was over right there. And that I think, it really hurt Rubio. I’m not sure how much it helps Christie, but he did show himself rather well. Of the others, interestingly, I thought that Trump and Cruz didn’t hurt themselves very much, but they didn’t help themselves, each of them had fairly rocky nights.
