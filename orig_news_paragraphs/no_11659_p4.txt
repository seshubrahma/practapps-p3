Juanita Broaddrick, who claims Bill Clinton outright raped her, has also been back in the public eye, including through social media via her Twitter account. As someone who lived through the 1990’s I can tell you that the DC Media was every bit as ugly as Hillary when it came to personally destroying these women. To protect their alleged abuser, a sitting Democrat president, the media was a White House ally in attacking these women as liars, stalkers, psychos, and golddiggers. The fact that Bill Clinton ended up settling with Jones, ended up admitting he had lied about his affair with a White House intern, or that Broaddrick has contemporaneous witnesses she told about the assault, did nothing to alter the DC Media’s role in personally destroying any and all Clinton accusers.
