You may also remember that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg went   on the immigration issue, forming a new   immigration reform group called FWD. us and even having a computer "hackathon" for illegal immigration as a promotional event. For a "hackathon" Wednesday, Zuckerberg brought together a group of undocumented immigrants, the youngest of whom are known as "dreamers" because of the DREAM Act, a proposed immigration reform that would give legal residency to young immigrants who meet certain educational or service requirements. Those high tech giants aren’t investing in immigration lobbying and doing hackathons because they are concerned about bedmakers and fruit pickers.
