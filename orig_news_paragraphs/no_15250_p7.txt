Turkey has long been opposed to the PKK, considered a terrorist organization by both Turkey and the US.   Ankara sees the PKK and the Kurdish forces in the Syrian Democratic Forces    known as the YPG    as closely linked, while the US views them as distinct organizations. The US sees the SDF as the most effective force fighting ISIS in Syria supporting its push on the city of Raqqa, ISISâ€™   capital.    "We recognize the threat the PKK poses to Turkey, but Turkey cannot pursue that fight at the expense of our common fight against terrorists that threaten us all,"   said.
