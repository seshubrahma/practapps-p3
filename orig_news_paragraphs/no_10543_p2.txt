To Bump, it is unfathomable that merely visiting with the Mexican president might be beneficial to Trump, after months of being demonized by the media and the Clinton campaign as the latest incarnation of the Ku Klux Klan. He envisions  —   hopes for?   —   a spectacle where President Enrique Peña Nieto humiliates his guest and destroys his campaign. It would take a "miracle" for Trump’s visit to succeed, Bump said.
