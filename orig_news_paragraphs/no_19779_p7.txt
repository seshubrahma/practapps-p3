Trump has consistently rejected the idea that the Russians were behind the hacking, and he has dismissed the idea that the intention was to help him. His opponents, on both left and right, have for months spoken hopefully of some sort of Holy Grail of information that would fatally compromise him, but so far no such information has emerged. There have been more concrete reports linking Trump aides to Russia. Carter Page, a     adviser, is deeply enmeshed in business interests there, while Paul Manafort, who for a time managed Trump’s campaign, had previously worked for a Kremlin client who was president of Ukraine and did business with a member of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.
