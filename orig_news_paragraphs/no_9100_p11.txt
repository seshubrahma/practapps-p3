Currently, 75 percent of U. S. population growth since 2000 is attributable to immigration, counting ongoing arrivals and births to migrant mothers —  whose anchor babies are automatically awarded U. S. citizenship, as in the notorious case of Mexican drug lord Joqauin "El Chapo" Guzman’s twin daughters. If U. S. immigration policy is not changed, "immigration will add another 100 million people to the United States in the next 50 years," according to a report published by the Negative Population Growth group last October. A poll released on election day found 54 percent of voters wanted annual immigration levels slashed by half or reduced to zero, including 45 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans.
