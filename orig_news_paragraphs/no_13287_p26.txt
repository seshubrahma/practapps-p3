But Kanye West would have done well to understand that him standing in front of NBC cameras potentially raising money from individuals, from families, from friends, neighbours, and countrymen of those affected in 2005 was much stronger than attempting to score   political points off George W. Bush. And as a conservative, George W. Bush should have realised that   governmental relief efforts are always destined to fail, or at very best come up short of expectation. So blaming Obama for his own ineptitude this time around may be politically useful. But we should be blaming leftism (liberalism, U. S.) for setting these places up for disappointment.
