Afghan forces have taken heavy casualties over the last year as they have sought to hold off the Taliban and prevent them from capturing provincial capitals. General Nicholson repeated previous assessments that the sanctuary Taliban fighters and militant groups enjoy in Pakistan remains a major obstacle. " It is very difficult to succeed on the battlefield when your enemy enjoys external support and safe haven," said the commander, who added that the United States needed to do a "a holistic review" of its policy toward Pakistan.
