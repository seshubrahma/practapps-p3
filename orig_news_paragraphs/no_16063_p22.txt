White supremacists have delivered a groundswell of support for Trump, and the billionaire real estate mogul has taken flack for retweeting tweets from   accounts. Trump has also been slow to disavow   white supremacists who have expressed staunch support for his candidacy. Trump initially refused to disavow the support of David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard who continues to promulgate Jewish conspiracy theories, when pressed repeatedly about Duke’s support in an interview by CNN’s Jake Tapper. He would later tweet "I disavow" regarding Duke’s support and blamed his initial refusal on a faulty earpiece.
