I was raised to believe in hard work, faith and family. My dad, Ed Pence, was a combat veteran in Korea who ran gas stations in our small town, and was a great father. Although Pence always understood the value of faith, he became a   Christian in college, beginning almost four decades of regular Bible reading, family prayers, and being active in church. His faith also makes Pence the consummate family man, as seen by how he introduced his family: The best thing that ever happened to me —  even counting tonight —  is that 31 years ago, I married the girl of my dreams, a school teacher and artist.
