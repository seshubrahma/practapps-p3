The violence in Washington began about an hour before Mr. Trump was sworn in at noon. Storefront windows at a Bank of America and a Starbucks several blocks from the parade route were smashed, leading to many arrests. Around 2 p. m. as Mr. Trump ate lunch on Capitol Hill with lawmakers and supporters, the protests expanded and turned violent. Protesters hurled rocks and bricks at police officers several blocks from the parade route.
