Four of the islands, Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai, were occupied by Russia three days after the end of World War II, giving them complete control of the Kuril chain. Japan still considers those four islands part of its territory, a sticking point in relations between the two countries for the past 71 years. On Thursday evening, Putin and Abe discussed free passage of islanders as well as potential "joint economic projects" to be developed on the islands. But while Tokyo may be hoping to make progress on having the islands returned, experts told CNN talks were unlikely to yield those kind of results.
