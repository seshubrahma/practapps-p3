Washington (CNN) A top adviser to   Donald Trump said Monday he thinks the Russians were involved in   hacking of the US    a very different view than that held by the incoming administration.   Former CIA director James Woolsey, an adviser to Trump on national security issues, told CNNâ€™s Jim Sciutto that determining who was behind the hacks is difficult, but that he believes the Russians    and possibly others    were involved.
