At least 25 million Kurds are spread across Iraq, Iran, Syria and also Turkey, which has a large Kurdish minority. The Turkish government will never tolerate the creation of a Kurdish state. At the same time Sunnis, who make up the majority of Mosulâ€™s population, are leery of the Shia militias and the   Iraqi government, and if their interests are marginalized as they have been repeatedly in years past, they will throw their support    or at least their acquiescence    to any Sunni militia group that seems to be fighting for their interests, just as some did with ISIS and before that its parent group, Al Qaeda in Iraq. Add to these factors the understanding that the fall of Mosul will do nothing, of course, to end the continuing civil war in neighboring Syria, which is where ISIS first made significant battlefield gains.
