According to the groupâ€™s founder, Rosanne Ponkowski, the events are a fun way for volunteers to gather in support of the nominee. She also said the events are growing in number. " Each location will have a local feel unique to its community, but each site will show their support to elect Donald J. Trump during the same 4 to 5:30 p. m. time window," said Ponkowski in a statement.
