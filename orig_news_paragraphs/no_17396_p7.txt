Because once we recognize something as genocide, America and other leading nations are then obligated to act. The US has ratified the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article I of which establishes a duty for contracting states to "prevent and to punish" genocide, and Article 8 of which states that such countries "may call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action" as "appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide. "  If     Trump wants, as he has previously stated, to prosecute criminals, then let him hold these genocidal war criminals responsible for their actions. If, as he claims, he wants to take a firm stand against Islamic terrorism, let him take action in a realm where every day matters, where every hour can mean the difference between life and death for innocent men, women, and children.
