Although Trump’s comments have been treated as outrageous and beyond the pale, at some level he’s saying the same thing Coburn did, in a blunter and much broader way.   Unless Coburn elaborates on precisely which American behavior he thinks Muslims "hate," the difference between these two analyses is a matter of (considerable) degree.    Trump also said it was important to "figure out" why Islam is angry with the West and "get to the bottom of it," which has been the official position of the U. S. government since shortly after the   attacks.   Government and military personnel have been subjected to countless lectures on the topic, sometimes with a very poor choice of lecturer.
