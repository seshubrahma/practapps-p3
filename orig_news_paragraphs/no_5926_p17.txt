Egyptâ€™s Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East. They have long complained of discrimination and that the government does not do enough to protect them. Egyptian media had previously reported that the church in Tanta had been targeted before, with a bomb defused there in late March. The Copts were largely supportive of the military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, and incurred the wrath of many of his followers, who attacked churches and other Christian institutions.
