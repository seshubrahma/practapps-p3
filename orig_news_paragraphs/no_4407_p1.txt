Rep. Maxine Waters (D, Calif.) slammed President Donald Trump on Sunday for his temporary refugee ban and backed a MoveOn. org petition calling for the United States to take in 100, 000 Syrian refugees," the Free Beacon reported earlier this week. " Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton chided President Trump Friday for ordering airstrikes against the Syrian regime at the same time as he attempts to bar Syrian refugees from the U. S. urging the administration to recognize that we cannot in one breath speak of protecting Syrian babies and in the next close Americaâ€™s doors to them," CBS News reported last week. But for President Trump and many Republicans, the airstrike presents an opportunity to   a concept President Trump raised on the campaign trail: the establishment of refugee safe zones overseas.
