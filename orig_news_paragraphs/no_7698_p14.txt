For a   baseball zealot like myself, it doesnâ€™t get any better when you consider the passion and support of Cardinals Nation, the legacy of the franchise over multiple decades, and the winning tradition that has been established with the organization as one of the signature teams in Major League Baseball. The Rams situation is of course very different. I never felt the city of St. Louis met the benchmarks that I consider when looking at a franchise looking to relocate. Unfortunately, the Rams are owned by a man who exhibits no loyalty to anything other than the almighty dollar and this influences every decision he makes with all of the teams he owns.
