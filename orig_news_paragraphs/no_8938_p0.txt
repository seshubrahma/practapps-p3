Sen. Marco Rubio dismissed the idea that he was considering a unity ticket with Ted Cruz to stop Donald Trump from winning the nomination for president. ["I have never talked to Ted Cruz about that, I have never talked to anybody about that," he said emphatically to reporters today during a press conference at the Temple Beth El here in West Palm Beach.   "None. Zero," he added, when questioned if there was a chance he would create a unity ticket.
