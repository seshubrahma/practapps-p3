Billionaire and 2016 GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump told Breitbart News on Tuesday in a   exclusive interview that in his estimation, the terrorist attack in Brussels, Belgium, proves terrorists are winning the war against the Western world. The Islamic State, or ISIS, has taken credit for the Brussels attacks.   " The terrorists are totally winning," Trump said in the interview that lasted more than 30 minutes.
