If information is the lifeblood of Washington, the Politico writer Mike Allen’s Playbook forms the veins. Pumped out by email every morning, it is where the most influential political operatives in the United States send tidbits or bigger news scoops that they hope will give them the edge in the D. C. skirmish of the week, month or year (and sure, maybe settle a score or two). They do so because it’s what 100, 000 insiders, outsiders, lobbyists and journalists, governors, senators, presidents and   presidents read every morning of the week to be in the know, or, in some cases, to see their own names in print. If they say they do not look for it in their inboxes in their first waking minute, they are lying.
