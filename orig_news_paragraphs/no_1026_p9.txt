There were 211, 460 international medical graduates practicing in the United States in December 2015, according to the latest data available from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat Susan M. Collins, Republican of Maine and Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, have urged the agency to continue premium processing. " Slowing down this successful    program and the doctors it brings to rural areas will hurt families across North Dakota and rural America," Ms. Heitkamp wrote in an email.
