More importantly, though, many economists believe low labor productivity growth is baked into the cake.   Led by Northwestern University Professor Robert Gordon, most hew to the notion that the faster pace of productivity growth accomplished during the American industrial era —  roughly 1870 to 1970 —  resulted from ground breaking innovations like electricity, the interstate highway system and antibiotics whose effects are not likely to be repeated. They argue that these days important new technologies do more to entertain and enhance our leisure time —  game machines and hand held devices that permit comparison shopping while roaming the aisles at Target —  than boost productivity.
