Barclays has said it expects the economy to actually slow in the first half of 2017, before rebounding modestly in the second half. " Given this data today, we see downside risk in our already soft expectations for the first half," Mr. Martin said. The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent last quarter, with the pace of growth in the current second quarter rising to 3. 5 percent.
