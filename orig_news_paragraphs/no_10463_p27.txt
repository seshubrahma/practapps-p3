Remember when the Clinton’s close family friend Anthony Weiner pulled this same exact trick when Andrew Breitbart nailed him for sending a photo of his bulging underwear to a young lady who was not his wife? (And his wife is Hillary Clinton’s top aide,   Huma Abedin, you’ll recall.) Anthony was caught   (double entendre intended) so he played the victim card and found someone else to blame. The Democrats are following the Weiner playbook, trying to cast doubt and lay the blame anywhere they can.
