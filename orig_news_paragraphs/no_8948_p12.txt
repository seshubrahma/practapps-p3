If Cantor’s political faith is globalism, then one could analogize that Paul Ryan is that faith’s priest. As a result of Ryan’s efforts, Congress gave Obama fast track trade authority, helping to ensure the passage not only of the   Partnership agreement, but all subsequent trade pacts, which are now liberated from the Senate filibuster, amendment process, and constitutional treaty vote. Thus, it is very likely that the outcome of the GOP primary contest will determine whether or not America is permanently bound under the   Partnership agreement and the multinational governing commission it establishes. Trump’s position on the critical issue of trade may help to explain his populist appeal.
