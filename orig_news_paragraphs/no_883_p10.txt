Greyball came out of an Uber program called VTOS, short for "violation of terms of service," which the company says it created in part to identify people it thought were using its service improperly. The program began as early as 2014 and remains in use, mostly outside the United States. Uberâ€™s legal team approved the use of Greyball. Uber employees said the practices and tools came about partly because of a need to protect drivers who had been the target of violence in a number of countries.
