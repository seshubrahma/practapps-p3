On "Happening Now," an interview with Danny Coulson, a former deputy assistant director at the F. B. I. centered on the "lunacy" of not equipping police officers with guns, words that echoed Mr. Trump’s comments about security guards after the nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Kilmeade repeatedly turned his focus to London’s "Muslim mayor," Sadiq Khan, calling on him to discuss the difference between his faith and that of the attacker. " Fox and Friends" also spent time on comments that Mr. Khan made in 2016 about how terrorism preparedness was "part and parcel" of living in a big city.
