My Step Mom was a Rosie the Riveter on the   Liberator, tail section, at Consolidated Air Force Plant #4 at Carswell Army Airfield in Fort Worth, Texas.   She left the dairy farm in Yantis (East Texas) for the War Effort. . . .   I am so proud of her and our Greatest Generation! The actual Rosies, of course, are mostly departed by now, which makes commenters wish all the more to savor their memory.
