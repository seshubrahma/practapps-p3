Northeast over the weekend, bringing massive amounts of snow to Massachusetts, and coating areas of Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut.    The same winter storm system swept snow and frigid temperatures all the way the East Coast, knocking out power to tens of thousands in Georgia and North Carolina, covering roads and bridges with ice, and leading to the cancellations of thousands of airline flights, stranding travelers. Out West, heavy rain, plus forecast of mountain snow factored into the fact that 77 million Americans were under some sort of winter weather advisory in recent days.   Parts of Oregon were expecting sleet and freezing rain.
