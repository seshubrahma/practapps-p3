Prior to the election, Trumpâ€™s campaign manager recognized that Americans are far more likely to openly oppose immigration when they are asked if companies should be allowed to hire immigrants instead of Americans.   This same outspoken response is also visible in a   poll of the midwesterners who gave Trump his   state victories, and of Latinos, who mostly prioritize the economy over additional immigration of their ethnic group. On Nov 8, "actual election results from counties with large Latino populations suggests that Trump probably did no worse than [Gov Mitt] Romney among Latinos, and probably did better," said Harry Enten, a data analyst at Fivethirtyeight.
