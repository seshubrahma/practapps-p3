May editorial, written by Tomasz Piątek, attempted to discredit Tyrmand by accusing him of "belonging to Trump’s stable" with the latter "declaring his sympathy for Mr Putin". Tyrmand however is a     supporter of Republican Senator Ted Cruz, switching allegiance to Mr. Trump when he had all but secured his party’s nomination, like most Republicans in the United States. Mr. Piątek also attacked    papers that Tyrmand has contributed to, such as Wprost and Do Rzeczy. Piątek alleged that these    media were "owned by  " and "perhaps even KGB collaborators linked to Gazprom" as well as "various   Polish outfits".
