The Clinton Global Initiative, a   charitable organization (and spinoff of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation) in 2010 helped arrange a $2 million commitment from a Canadian businesswoman and CGI member to invest in a   company owned by Clinton friends, according to a Wall Street Journal article last month. That year, Bill Clinton lobbied   of Energy Steven Chu for a grant the Department of Energy gave the company an $812, 000 grant, the article said. Then there’s the story of Rajiv K. Fernando, a   securities trader who was a fundraiser and donor to The Clinton Foundation. Fernando wound up getting himself a seat on the State Department’s International Security Advisory Board    giving him access to highly classified materials    despite the fact that he didn’t have any background in foreign affairs, ABC News reported last week.
