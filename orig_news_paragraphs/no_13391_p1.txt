The affiant is a poll watcher, certified by the Broward County Supervisor of Elections, and states that these incidents have been ongoing at the North West Regional Library polling location in Coral Springs, Fla. since early voting began on Oct. 24. Per voting laws, assisting a voter who is mentally or physically incapable of filling out their own ballot is limited to reading off the ballot language and receiving a form of confirmation from the voter before taking action to fill in the ballot. Furthermore, this interaction must be witnessed by two poll workers. These measures were never enforced as dozens of mentally ill voters had their ballots filled out on their behalf without interaction between the assistor and the voter and without oversight from poll workers, according to the affiant.
