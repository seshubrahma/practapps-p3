Sen. Richard Burr,   Carolina, the committee’s chairman, and Sen. Mark Warner,   the committee’s vice chairman, said in a joint statement that the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election also will focus on Russian cyberactivity and "active measures" against the US.   It was known that intelligence panels in both chambers of Congress were tapped by Republican leaders to probe the hacking, but Friday’s announcement makes clear the scope and details about the review. It is also notable that the announcement was joined by Warner, as Democrats have clamored for a bipartisan look into what role, if any, Russia may have played in the election. The statement said the committee will produce both a classified and unclassified report on its findings.
