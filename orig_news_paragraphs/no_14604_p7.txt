In a statement congratulating Perez, Sanders said "it is imperative that Tom understands that the     is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before. " Now, more than ever, the Democratic Party must make it clear that it is prepared to stand up to the 1% and lead this country forward in the fight for social, racial, economic and environmental justice," he said. While Obama and Clinton are bigger names, Sandersâ€™ reaction is probably what matters most in terms of whether the election result polarizes party members.
