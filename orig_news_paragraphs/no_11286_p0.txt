Saturday in Halifax, Nova Scotia at the annual Halifax International Security Forum, Sen. John McCain ( ) pushed back against the possibility of   Donald Trump’s administration using the tactic of waterboarding, as Trump may have suggested in the past.    " So I do n’t give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do, or anybody else want to do, we will not waterboard," he said.
