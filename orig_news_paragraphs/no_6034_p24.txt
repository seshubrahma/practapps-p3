There is no reference to secession in the US Constitution so again at risk of sounding like a conservative , that power is a power reserved to the people, or to the states via the Tenth Amendment. I am a big supporter of the Tenth Amendment. Now as for these law experts  â€”   they have only provided their opinions but law experts provide their opinions in a court of law everyday only to be rejected by the courts.
