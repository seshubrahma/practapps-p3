The MK has been a keen supporter of U. S. President Donald Trump during the presidential campaign last year. Despite a negative reaction from many in his own party who have called for him to be excluded from future elections, Hazan has defended his remarks. In an interview with Israeli broadcaster, i24 News Hazan said: "A lot of other members of the House say in private that they support Marine Le Pen but are afraid to [say so publicly]. " "Marine Le Pen took all the bad,   things her father did and kicked him out of his own party," Hazan added saying Le Pen had transformed the Front National and manoeuvred it away from its controversial past.
