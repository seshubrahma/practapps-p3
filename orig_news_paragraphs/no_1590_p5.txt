On Thursday, Mr. Rogata was still at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was taken for an evaluation after he was detained, the police said. At Trump Tower that day, four police officers, including two from a counterterrorism unit, surveyed the premises. Two private security guards stood in the lobby as tourists flowed in and out. At least seven cameras dotted the lobby and the buildingâ€™s exterior, in addition to those on nearby buildings and traffic lights along Fifth Avenue.
