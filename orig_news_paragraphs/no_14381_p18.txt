Now, we have very warm water in the Gulf of Mexico and all around the coast of Florida, it’s going to warm the air above it and that warm air is going to clash with very cold air coming from the north.   Now, nor’easters carry winds out of the Northeast at about 58 miles per hour or more.   And keep in mind, the win direction out of the Northeast is what defines a nor’easter.    It’s also going to cause beach erosion, as well as coastal flooding and very, very rough ocean conditions.
