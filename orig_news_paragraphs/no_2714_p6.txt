Mr. Ford, with whom he has not yet met, is a regular commentator on the MSNBC show "Morning Joe," whose host, Joe Scarborough, Mr. Trump regularly calls for advice. So far, however, his picks have consisted of five white men: Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist in the White House, Reince Priebus as chief of staff, Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser, and Representative Mike Pompeo as director of the C. I. A. Mr. Trump is also rumored to be close to naming Gen. James N. Mattis as secretary of defense. While not as vocal as other supporters like Rudolph W. Giuliani or Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Mr. Carson has been a steadfast backer of Mr. Trump. He went on television to defend him after the release of an "Access Hollywood" tape in which Mr. Trump spoke about groping women.
