The proposal calls for the largest lot, at the southern end, to be 2. 35 acres, with the potential to include a house of more than 51, 000 square feet with 10 bedrooms and 12 baths. The other two parcels would be just under two acres, able to accommodate homes of 42, 000 square feet. In Palm Beach, the biggest land prize is ocean frontage. The largest parcel would have 173 linear feet on the water, while the other two would have about 150.
