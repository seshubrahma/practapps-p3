That directive maps closely to Trumpâ€™s travel style as a chief executive, when he would fly his private jet abroad for business meetings but rarely lingered for long. Since President Ronald Reagan,   presidents have traveled to a contiguous US neighbor before early April as their international debut: Barack Obama visited Canada on February 19, 2009 George W. Bush traveled to Mexico on February 16, 2001 Bill Clinton went to Canada April   1993 George H. W. Bush journeyed to Mexico February 10, 1989 and Ronald Reagan stopped in Canada March   1981. Trump has not scheduled a trip north or south of the border, though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invited him to visit Canada during a phone call shortly after Trump was elected last November. The delay is not necessarily a surprise.
