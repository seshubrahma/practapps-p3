Local Voices, founded by documentary filmmaker Lee Hirsch (Bully) in 2008, says on its website that it plans to produce more than 50 television  ahead of the election, to air in swing state markets. The group of filmmakers joins several   directors who have already contributed their talents to the Clinton campaign this year. In July, Star Wars: The Force Awakens director J. J. Abrams and Avatar director James Cameron both produced videos that aired during the Democratic National Convention. Film and television director Mike Judge (Office Space, King of the Hill) wanted to produce an   ad campaign this year featuring the fictional character of President Camacho from his 2006 film Idiocracy.
