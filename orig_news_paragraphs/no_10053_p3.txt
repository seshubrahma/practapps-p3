Two sources from within the Republican National Committee told Politico the RNC has been in contact with most of the GOP electors numerous times and the committee is only aware of one elector, Suprun, who is at risk of voting against Trump. A candidate needs 270 votes to win the Electoral College. With Trump’s 306 electors, 37 would need to defect during Monday’s vote to put him below the majority needed to officially secure the presidency. Lessig was asked whether the entire effort was an exercise in futility given that the decision would be thrown to the   House if the Electoral College indeed failed to finalize Trump’s presidency.
