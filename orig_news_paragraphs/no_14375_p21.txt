As the hours went on, we literally had chaos at the Philadelphia airport," said Josh Shapiro, the   attorney general of Pennsylvania.   Several states rushed into court to try to block the implementation of Trump’s travel ban    but it was Ferguson who was most successful. After a judge halted the implementation of Trump’s travel ban, the offices of Schneiderman, Shapiro and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey led the drafting of an amicus brief in which 16 additional states backed Washington’s case.    The most recent group phone call between the AGs came Tuesday afternoon, when Schneiderman and his staff, as well as the Democratic Attorneys General Association, led a discussion of the travel ban challenge just hours before oral arguments before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
