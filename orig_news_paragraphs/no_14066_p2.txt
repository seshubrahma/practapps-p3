I’m not a joiner by nature, but I figure it’s time to woman up. One thing I’ve discovered during my previous travels for Trump is that even those who, like me, have daughters may not care what Trump says or does    they’ll support him anyway. In Pennsylvania, I met some people who were   at the prospect of what would have been our first woman president. But others literally hissed at the mention of her name and slammed the door in my face.
