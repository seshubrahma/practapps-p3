Carson says we should support those mothers not get   the cycle of poverty by providing child care and encouraging them to get GEDs and continue their education. Carson also says he would have a   hiatus on corporate tax rates with one condition: 10% of the repatriated funds must to be spent in enterprise zones and to help impoverished communities. He said that would be the biggest stimulus since FDRâ€™s programs. Carson says Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty.
