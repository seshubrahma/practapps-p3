We have this almost this triangulation that no other country in the world, no region in the world has.   We have the Rocky Mountain to our west, we have the Gulf of Mexico in our south, we have Canada and very cold air masses coming down from the north, all of those things combined make Tornado Alley.   Typically, the Plains, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, all the way to Chicago, as far south as the Southwest, including Georgia and Alabama, thatâ€™s basically the new or the bigger Tornado Alley.
