The auction house also secured the collection of Steven and Ann Ames, New York arts patrons, for its Contemporary sale Thursday evening   —   albeit with the help of a $100 million guarantee. It includes two colorful paintings by Gerhard Richter (one from 1986 and one from 1988) each estimated at $20 million to $30 million. Christie’s’ highlights include a 1977 Willem de Kooning work, "Untitled XXV," one of the artist’s large "pastoral" paintings, which is expected to sell for around $40 million on Tuesday night, at its Postwar and Contemporary sale.
