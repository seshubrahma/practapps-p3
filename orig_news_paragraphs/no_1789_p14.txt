Mr. Obama repeated that criticism of Republicans on Friday morning, blaming the party’s elected officials for failing to stand up to Mr. Trump’s brand of politics until polls showed that it might damage their own fortunes. " Republicans who knew better stood by silently and even during the course of this campaign didn’t say anything," Mr. Obama said. He acknowledged that a number of Republicans have denounced Mr. Trump in the wake of the lewd recording, but added, "What, you weren’t appalled earlier when he was saying degrading things about women?"
