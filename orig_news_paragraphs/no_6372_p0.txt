  protesters held rallies in several California cities and around the nation on Saturday to demand that President Donald Trump release his income tax returns for the past several years. [The demonstrations were timed to coincide with "Tax Day," April 15, which is traditionally the deadline for taxpayers to submit their annual returns to the U. S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The deadline is April 17 this year, due to the Easter holiday weekend.   The demonstrators complain that unlike previous presidential candidates over the past several decades, Trump did not release any of his tax returns.
