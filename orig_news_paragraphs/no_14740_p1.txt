Trump will start traveling the country to stump for the plan, with visits expected to Kentucky and Tennessee in short order. And the White House is plowing ahead to help House leadership sell this bill to the full Republican caucus, attending daily leadership meetings and "war room" meetings on the Hill, while also reaching out directly to members and outside advocacy groups that have taken issue with the House bill.   Trump is meeting Wednesday afternoon with a slew of members from the key conservative groups that could make or break the health care bill. The attendees, according to a White House official: David McIntosh of the Club for Growth, Jim DeMint of Heritage, Tim Phillips of Americans for Prosperity, Adam Brandon of FreedomWorks, Mike Needham of Heritage Action and Jenny Beth Martin of Tea Party Patriots.
