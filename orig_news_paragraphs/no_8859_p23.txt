Veterans who served our country, and put their lives on the line, can’t see a doctor for half a year, while healthcare premiums for those now forced to buy insurance plans they already can’t afford are skyrocketing, all while Democrats want to take away Americans’ guns and make them pay higher taxes —  while regulating their businesses into submission making it easier to get a welfare check than to start a company. Americans, meanwhile, want it to stop. The onslaught from Washington, D. C. and world elites is too much, and they can’t believe what they are being forced to endure. They want it to end, and Trump is offering voters an end to the madness.
