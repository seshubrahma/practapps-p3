In 1964, Berkeley was the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement, which demanded the right to advocate for any political cause on campus, with or without the approval of the administration. The movement broke open dialogue on campuses nationwide, and inspired a generation of activists to join protests against the Vietnam War and other causes. Brown notes an odd irony  —   present at many other campuses today, as well  —   where the students are demanding an end to free expression, the very right that their parents’ generation marched to protect and expand.
