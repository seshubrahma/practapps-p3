Comey remained in Trump’s good graces after he was inaugurated, and Trump’s team expressed confidence in him up until last week.     As CNN’s John King and Jeff   Zeleny reported, the change in Trump’s feelings about Comey were evident to a friend who spoke with him last weekend and noticed the President was "white hot" over Comey’s recent testimony on Capitol Hill. Comey had said he felt "mildly nauseous" about the possibility of having affected the November election.
