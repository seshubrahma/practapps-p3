The Town of Columbus chipped in a $1 million grant to award Hostess for creating jobs. " We’re not doing it to be nice guys, we’re doing it to create jobs," said Wylly Harrison, who worked on the deal for the Georgia Department of Economic Development and said that the state was thrilled Hostess came back. Hostess said it also received incentives from Emporia, the State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis.
