Oxford University, students are seeking therapy to deal with threats from unsavory ideas that allegedly are so inherently threatening that the mere uttering of certain words triggers a mental breakdown. Even Rolling Stone magazine, not having a fictional campus rape epidemic to exploit that particular week, devoted considerable space to the notion that students’ demands for safe places is a parody of our country’s public discourse. We need safe places everywhere! Yes, progressives do want to see censorship expanded beyond the campus so political correctness can be enforced in town halls and July 4th parades down Main Street.
