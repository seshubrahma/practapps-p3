Washington (CNN) Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee met with Hispanic supporters of the real estate mogulâ€™s campaign at Trump Tower Saturday. The meeting with the National Hispanic Advisory Council came as Trump has struggled to attract minority voters, particularly Hispanics, and after a week in which he made major changes to his campaign leadership and struck a more conciliatory tone on the trail. New campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and CEO Steve Bannon accompanied Trump.
