It’s politically useful to say that insidious racism is the cause of "inequality," and it’s impossible to "prove" it isn’t.   The size of the disparities in employment, wages, and wealth mentioned above is supposed to be taken as evidence of systemic racism in America, because nothing else could possibly explain those differences. This line of thinking prevents us from considering what those other explanations might be, which in turn makes it impossible to address them. If racism is the reason for black economic difficulties, we might ask how racism is supposedly getting worse under a black President who won two elections, and presides over the richest and most powerful regulatory state in the world.
