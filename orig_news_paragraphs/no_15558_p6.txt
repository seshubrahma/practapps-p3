Why would Trump name as his top national security adviser a man he knew was under federal investigation, a man he had been warned against by a sitting president of the United States? And then why would he keep Flynn in that job even after it was made clear to Trump that Flynn was lying about his contacts with the Russians and was vulnerable to being blackmailed by that country? On its face, it makes zero sense. Trump hates when his subordinates make bad news for him.
