TEHRAN   —    Iran and Boeing signed a deal for the sale of 80 airplanes on Sunday, five weeks before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump, whose Republican supporters in Congress have tried to block any aircraft sales to Iran. Iran’s national airline, Iran Air, said that it had signed an agreement with Boeing, an American manufacturer, to purchase the aircraft, at a total cost of $16. 6 billion.
