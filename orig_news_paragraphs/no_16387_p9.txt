Priebus pointed out that if GOP senators donâ€™t win reelection, the outcome will be worse for Trump because his administration would have to deal with a Democratic Senate. Meanwhile, tension continues to fester in the top ranks of the RNC about how to deal with Trump, according to a GOP official. There are ongoing disagreements both in terms of messaging from the communications side and allocating resources on the political side, the source said. And Andrew Weinstein, an   Republican, began circulating a letter for signatures that urges Priebus to focus GOP resources on helping vulnerable House and Senate races, instead of continuing to help Trump with his campaign.
