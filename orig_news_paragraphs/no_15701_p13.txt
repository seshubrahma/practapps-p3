The future of Medicaid has split Republicans down the middle. Moderate Republican lawmakers, along with many GOP governors, are worried that millions of their constituents would lose coverage under the House bill, which eliminates enhanced funding for Medicaid expansion and curtails federal support for the entire program. The CBO estimates that 14 million fewer people will be on the Medicaid rolls by 2026. Many moderates want to eliminate or at least soften those provisions so that fewer are stripped of their coverage and of their access to substance abuse and mental health treatment, which has helped combat the opioid epidemic in many states.
