Much of what he says he wants to do may be unwise (e. g. 45% tariffs on China) or unconstitutional (e. g. broad surveillance of mosques).

That should please constitutional conservatives who want to restore the balance of powers. Moreover, just by winning the nomination, Trump will have advanced the conservative cause.
