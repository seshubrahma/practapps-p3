The Texas Commission of Environmental Quality, overseen by appointees of the governor, cited a 2013 Texas AM study saying that Mexico’s failure to deliver its annual water allotment cost the state economy nearly 5, 000 jobs and $400 million each year. Mexico countered that it did not have the water because of drought   —   a position that some American environmentalists said was valid. The issue was resolved this year when the United States, jointly with Mexico, said the water debt had been paid off.
