Washington (CNN) The Department of Justice asked the chairman and vice chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for "additional time" to collect evidence to support President Donald Trump’s accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower during the campaign. The committee had set a Monday deadline for the agency to provide the evidence, a source familiar with the matter has told CNN    a deadline that did not appear to apply to the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation. Senate panel Chairman Richard Burr told CNN, "I’ve talked to all the appropriate people," adding later that he has received "sufficient" responses about the wiretapping claim.
