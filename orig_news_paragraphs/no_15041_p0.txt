Washington (CNN) The Senate Thursday triggered the   "nuclear option" that allowed Republicans to break a Democratic filibuster of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. The chamber is now expected to vote to confirm Gorsuch Friday around 11:30 a. m. ET. The controversial changes to Senate rules, made along partisan lines, allows filibusters of Supreme Court picks to be broken with only 51 votes rather than 60.
