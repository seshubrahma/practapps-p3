The Obama administration is dismantling a dormant national registry program for visitors from countries with active terrorist groups   â€”    a program that   Donald J. Trump has suggested he is considering resurrecting. The registry, created after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has not been in use since 2011, so the move is largely symbolic and appeared to be aimed at distancing the departing administration from any effort by the new president to revive the program, known as the National Security   Registration System, or Nseers.
