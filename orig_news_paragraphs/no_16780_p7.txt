Enthusiasm to be for something or someone in an election is quite literally the difference between a win and loss. We see it in polls: There is a difference in numbers between registered voters (where Clinton has historically performed much better) and likely voters (where Trump tightens her lead or bests Clinton). There are two reasons I havenâ€™t written this piece before now. One is that I have not been particularly excited about this election.
