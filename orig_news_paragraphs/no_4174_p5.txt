They think they can engage in the same sort of suppression of protest and free speech that they engage in in Turkey," he argued. A similar incident occurred during Erdogan’s visit to Washington last year, in which Erdogan guards beat Turkish journalists protesting for their rights. Erdogan’s government has engaged in a prolonged military operation against the nation’s Kurdish minority in the southeast of the country, arguing that the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) a U. S.  Marxist terrorist group, is a threat to Turkish security. Ankara does not distinguish between the PKK and the PYD and its militia, the People’s Protection Units (YPG) who are strong U. S. allies and considered the most effective force against the Islamic State in Syria.
