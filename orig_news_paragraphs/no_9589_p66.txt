Thinks about some of the things Christianity brought to western civilization: In the twelfth century marriage came to be counted as a sacrament by the catholic church. As a sacrament, it does not require a priest, only the agreement of the man and woman, which is the greatest protection ever given to women in a system of marriage: by the Church’s argument, women cannot be married against their will, they and their bridegrooms must both say, "I do. "  Think about that ladies   —   without the catholic church getting smart hundreds of years ago, you’d be married off to the highest bidder by your family.
