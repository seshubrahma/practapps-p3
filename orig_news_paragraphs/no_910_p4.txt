On Tuesday, civil and immigrants rights groups announced that they had filed a petition in United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana to stop Ms. Vargas’s deportation. The Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Immigration Law Center, the Elmore and Peterson firm in Mississippi, and the law office of William Most said in the petition that the government had violated her due process and First Amendment rights. " We’re joining the community in celebrating the release of our client, Dany Vargas," said Naomi Tsu, the deputy director of the law center, in a statement.
