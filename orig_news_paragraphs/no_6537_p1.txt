[The Tornillo Temporary Holding Facility suspended operations, effective February 14, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from CBP spokesman Rober Maier. CBP officials opened the facility in November 2016 in response to the surge of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) and Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) apprehensions. It is now being shut down "due to a continual decline in the total number of apprehended and inadmissible alien migrants. "  The processing of migrants at other CBP ports of entry and stations has been reduced to a "manageable level," Maier stated.
