Vermont Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders offered gracious and sincere condolences after Justice Antonin Scalia passed away Saturday of apparent natural causes. ["While I differed with Justice Scaliaâ€™s views and jurisprudence, he was a brilliant, colorful and outspoken member of the Supreme Court. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and his colleagues on the court who mourn his passing," the socialist candidate said in a brief statement.   Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton took a more forceful tact: My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Justice Scalia as they mourn his sudden passing.
