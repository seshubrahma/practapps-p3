Earlier in January, Trumpâ€™s transition team engaged in active discussions with the US Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department to begin planning a wall along the Mexican border, including how specific environmental laws could get in the way, CNN reported. A US official with knowledge of a visit last month to the Interior Department    which oversees most federal lands and major environmental laws    said the transition team was particularly interested in finding out "how long it would take" to build the wall given potential legal obstacles. " It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall," the source said.
