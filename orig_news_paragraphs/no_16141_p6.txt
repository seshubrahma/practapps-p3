Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley,   would not call on Ginsburg to resign. " I think that it was the wrong statement, she ought to apologize for it, she ought to withdraw it," Grassley said Wednesday when asked about Trump’s demand. Even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump’s old primary rival and a sharp critic of Ginsburg, stopped short of calling her to resign.
