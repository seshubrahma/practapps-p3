McCain further ratcheted up pressure on McConnell Sunday, sending a letter to the majority leader asking him to allow for a Senate select committee to probe Russian hacking. " Cyber is the rare kind of   challenge for which the Congress’s jurisdictional boundaries are an impediment to sufficient oversight and legislative action," McCain wrote to McConnell in a letter, cosigned by fellow GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.   "Only a select committee that is     and   can address the challenge of cyber," wrote the bipartisan quartet of senators.
