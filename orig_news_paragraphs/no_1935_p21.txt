In its earlier days, Snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange. The app had an incredible series on "city life" that gave users direct windows into different worlds. People submitted short video diaries about life in their cities, which the company compiled into a single video, viewable by anyone using the app. I remember feeling delighted watching people in Istanbul and SÃ£o Paulo showing off their routines and customs.
