Democratic ranks have also been decimated in state governments across the nation, where new leaders tend to plant roots for future higher office. After the 2008 elections, Democrats controlled 62 of the 99 state legislatures today, Republicans control 68 chambers, according to Governing magazine. Over the same time period, the number of Democrats in governorâ€™s mansions fell from 28 to 18. In both cases, Republican control is now at or near historic highs.
