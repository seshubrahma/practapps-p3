They offer fake, radical sounding solutions to the growing problems of unemployment, poverty and economic insecurity in the U. S. today. The fascists scapegoat and call for attacks on the immigrant,   black, Muslim, Jewish, and LGBT communities and against the trade unions, leftists, and other progressive organizations. To this torrent of cynical racist lies, our integrated civil rights and immigrant rights movement must counter pose real,   solutions to the economic and social, crisis.    black, Native American, Arab, Asian, and white, immigrants with and without papers, we are ALL Californians!
