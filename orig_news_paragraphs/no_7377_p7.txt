In the film, Douglas, who plays American President Andrew Shepherd, warns Sen. Bob Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) to leave Annette Bening’s character, Sydney Ellen Wade, out of a political dispute. " You want a character debate, Bob? You better stick with me, ’cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league," Douglas says in the film.
