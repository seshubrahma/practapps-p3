Some will want to use this day simply as a means to contribute to the votes of the Democratic Party, whether that be for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. We cannot be distracted by that.

We need to make clear to every fascist and   promoting white supremacy and racist violence that they will face militant, organized, and determined opposition.
