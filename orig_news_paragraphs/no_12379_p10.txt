NOT US. NOT IN NYC. Let’s send a strong and loud message to the GOP that they should be ASHAMED of themselves for giving this fascist a platform and join us to protest the hateful, racist, xenophobic,   bigoted GOP Presidential front runner candidate Donald Trump. New York City knows how to shut it down so let’s do it for our Latinx, Black, And Muslim brothers and sisters!
