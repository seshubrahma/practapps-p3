"During 2016 the bank’s management repeatedly met with representatives of the world’s leading financial institutions in Europe, Asia and America . .. including the head of Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner," the VEB statement said.   A spokesman for the Kremlin said Tuesday the Russian government was not aware of the meeting, calling it "absolutely the bank’s prerogative" and stressed that the discussion was one of dozens held to discuss the bank’s   strategy. Senate Intelligence Committee member Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told CNN’s "New Day" Tuesday morning that it was "interesting" that VEB "seemed to contradict" Kushner’s statement that he was acting as a campaign official when he met with the bank president.
