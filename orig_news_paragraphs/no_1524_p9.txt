Burning a flag is permitted by law, Chief Williams said, and the officers intervened with fire extinguishers because the person who set fire to the flag "lit himself on fire" and then, while trying to fend off the police, "got a couple of other people lit on fire. " Chief Williams said that he did not know of anyone who had been treated for burns. The arrests followed a mostly peaceful day of protests, with police standing nearby but not interfering much with the demonstrations.
