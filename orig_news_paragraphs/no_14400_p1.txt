Kim was present at the site and personally gave the order for the launch, which was the first missile test by Pyongyang since US President Donald Trump took office, KCNA reported. The agency described the missile as a "Korean style new type strategic weapon system."  South Korea and the United States confirmed the launch Sunday. A US official said the missile traveled 500 kilometers (310 miles) before landing in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, and that it was launched from North Pyongan province.     ballistic missiles typically travel from 3, 000 to 5, 500 kilometers (1, 864 to 3, 417 miles).
