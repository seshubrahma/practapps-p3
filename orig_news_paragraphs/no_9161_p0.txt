Reddit CEO Steve Huffman made an announcement on the site today stating that Reddit is, "taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities"  —   by which he meant    the site’s hub for   users. [The post, titled "TIFU [Today I F*cked Up] by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy," refers to a recent incident where Huffman edited comments from   Reddit users who insulted him, replacing his own Reddit username with the usernames of Reddit’s   community moderators.    This led to Reddit users calling for Huffman to resign as Reddit CEO.
