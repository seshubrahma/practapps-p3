US presidents have long been frustrated that many nations do not reach their commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. Germany is among those nations, spending about 1. 2 percent of its GDP on defense, although the US leader thanked Merkel for Germanyâ€™s commitment to increase spending and to work towards that figure. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said his meeting with Merkel went "great," but he singled out Germany for its defense spending, saying it "vast sums of money to NATO   the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!"
