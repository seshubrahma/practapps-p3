"Among adults with a bachelors degree or postgraduate degree, Trump performs about 10 percentage points better online than via live telephone," the study found.    voters who lack college degrees, which is the stereotype of typical Trump voters, are not hesitant to wear their support for Trump on their sleeves. But Trump gets support from a huge swath of the GOP electorate, even moderate Republicans and those with college degrees and higher incomes. If these voters had to publicly declare their support for Trump like Democrats have to at their caucuses, though, some may be reluctant to do so just like moderate women who support Sarah Palin and are often hesitant to reveal their support in pubic because it may not be "socially acceptable" to admit support for someone whom their peers like to bash in public.
