Visiting the region this week, he met Mr. Netanyahu in Israel on Monday and is scheduled to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. A State Department spokesman said Monday that a senior National Security Council official was accompanying Mr. Greenblatt, but was unsure whether a State Department official had been included. Mr. Greenblatt appears more independent of the State Department than at least some previous envoys he has told others he reports not to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, but to the presidentâ€™s    Jared Kushner, 36, one of the most senior White House advisers. And where past envoys were foreign policy specialists, Mr. Greenblatt told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in April that his main sources of information were daily email alerts, material supplied by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and a weekly Jewish radio program.
