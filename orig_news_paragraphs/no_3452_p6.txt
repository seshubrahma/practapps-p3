In fact, just before the DOD issued the transgender policy change, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services refused to provide national coverage for gender reassignment surgery citing insufficient studies about the health outcomes of such surgeries and small sample sizes in the studies that have been conducted. However, DOD is now requiring taxpayers to foot the bill for gender reassignment surgery, with no benefit to the taxpayer or the military. If implemented as planned, these transgender policies will require our military to assume the risks of recruiting and retaining persons who may require   medical treatment. Such procedures and physical changes often produce uncertain results associated with higher rates of depression and suicide.
