It’s hard to see the entire GOP base show up to support Bush, Rubio or Kasich in a general election —   and it’s hard to see the Democrat base show up for Clinton. Voters feel extraordinarily disenfranchised, and question whether a distant Washington, D. C. —  which, again, is enriching itself at the expense of the rest of the nation, as evidenced by the fact the D. C. metro area is one of the only economically growing regions in America —  has their best interests in mind. Globalist trade deals, like the George H. W. Bush negotiated and Bill Clinton ratified North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico saw many factories across the United States —  including many in the textile industry here in the Carolinas —  close down and reopen in Mexico.
