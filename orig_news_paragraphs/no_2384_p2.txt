Officials at both the F. B. I. and the State Department said Monday that no deal had been struck, or even offered, over the classification of Mrs. Clinton’s private emails. They noted that the Benghazi email in question had been made public with a sentence blocked out, meeting the F. B. I. ’s demand for classification. They also said no additional F. B. I. agents had been posted overseas. There is no indication from the documents that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the discussion.
