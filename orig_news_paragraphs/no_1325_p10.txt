In a standard proportional allocation, Mr. Trump would probably be on track to win at least 40 of the state’s delegates. In a    system, like Indiana’s or California’s, Mr. Trump would be favored to win at least 60 delegates. The difference matters a lot because Mr. Trump’s prize of 1, 237 hangs on a thread. He is probably on track to finish a bit short of 1, 237.
