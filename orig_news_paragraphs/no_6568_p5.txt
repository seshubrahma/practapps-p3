â€”   Tim Pool (@Timcast) April 15, 2017,   The violence in Cologne comes just days after antifa members in Berkeley, California, attacked a free speech rally organised by a number of popular conservatives. Rally attendees fought back, driving the antifa off a fair distance after one of their own smoke bombs was blown into their lines by the prevailing wind. Police told the Los Angeles Times that sixteen people were arrested and nine people were injured.
