One of the informants told the FBI that Fazeli fled Iran in 2007 or 2008 after being notified that he was going to be arrested by the Iranian government as a dissident. " Fazeli decided not to turn himself in and instead he left his family and fled for Syria. Fazeliâ€™s family later joined him and they fled Syria for Lebanon because they feared the Syrian government would deport them back to Iran," the affidavit says.
