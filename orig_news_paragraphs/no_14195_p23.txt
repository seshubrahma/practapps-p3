There is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees,   and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017, Executive Order," the ruling said. The ACLU argued Saturday evening in federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the organization called "President Trump’s new Muslim Ban."    The civil rights group is representing dozens of travelers held at JFK International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States.    The ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi of Yale’s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion.
