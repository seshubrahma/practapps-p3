The senator, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, is among a group of 10 Democratic senators who represent states that voted for Mr. Trump and who are up for   in 2018. So far, two others  —   Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota   —   have announced their support for Judge Gorsuch. That leaves Republicans, who hold 52 seats in the Senate, five Democratic votes short of breaking any filibuster mounted by Democrats.
