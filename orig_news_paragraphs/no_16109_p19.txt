Obama, in a meeting with the presidents of the European Union and the European Council, sought clarity on how the bloc would handle the divorce. Officials said he stressed the importance of finding a solution that could stabilize markets quickly. " I think it was clear that people recognize just how important it is that this be done in a way that not upset financial markets, that not upset global economic stability," said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ€™s deputy national security adviser.
