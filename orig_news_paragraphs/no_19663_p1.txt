’ ’    The man who was killed, Anis Amri, was shot dead in Milan by   Italian police during a Friday morning shootout after a   continental manhunt for him. Amri was shown in a video,  after reports of his death surfaced pledging   allegiance to the terror organization ’ ’    "I pledge my allegiance to the Emir of of the Faithful, Abu Bakr       for compliance and obedience, in vigor   and impulsion, abjectness and abundance, and in favoring his   preference to mine, and not contending the orders of his   trustees, unless I witness manifest disbelief," he said.
