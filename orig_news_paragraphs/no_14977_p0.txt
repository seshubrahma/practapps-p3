 (CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday indirectly knocked Hillary Clintonâ€™s failed 2016 campaign at a Thursday event, suggesting that the former secretary of state failed to talk to   voters. " What happened was that this was the first campaign that I can recall where my party did not talk about what it always stood for    and that was how to maintain a burgeoning middle class," Biden said during an appearance at the University of Pennsylvania.
