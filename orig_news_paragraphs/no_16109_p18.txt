British Prime Minister David Cameron, seen chatting privately with Obama multiple times over the   summit, sought to soothe fears that his decision to allow a referendum on exiting the EU could destabilize the continent. " While Britain may be leaving the European Union, we are not withdrawing from the world, nor are we turning our back on Europe or on European security," Cameron said Saturday. Obama, in a meeting with the presidents of the European Union and the European Council, sought clarity on how the bloc would handle the divorce.
