Washington (CNN) Members of the House intelligence committee met Monday evening as the future of the House’s Russia investigation hangs in the balance. Monday’s meeting was the first of the full committee    Democrats and Republicans    since the top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, called on House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation. House investigators did not discuss Russia at Monday’s meeting, multiple sources said, but instead plan to talk about it at a separate meeting Tuesday.
