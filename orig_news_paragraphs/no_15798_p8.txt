In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBI’s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure   Trump that we were not investigating him personally.

During our    meeting at Trump Tower, based on President Elect Trump’s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.
