Raul Labrador for   opposing the American Health Care Act   —   the plan to repeal and   replace Obamacare that stalled in the House last week. ’ ’    The resistance from conservative members forced Trump and House   Speaker Paul Ryan to pull the AHCA from the House floor roughly   30 minutes before it was scheduled for a vote.
