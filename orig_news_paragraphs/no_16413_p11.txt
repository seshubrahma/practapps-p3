Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States since   has been carried out by an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, not by recent immigrants or by refugees. So tamping down immigration won’t fix the real issue, which is "homegrown" terrorism. Further, the terrorist attacks and plots in the United States have in recent years been influenced by ISIS’s online propaganda, which clearly isn’t being brought into the country by immigrants, but instead can enter any American home via the internet. Finally, Trump said that newly captured foreign terrorists would be tried in military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay.
