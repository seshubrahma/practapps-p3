"New Day," Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) the 2016 Democratic   nominee, told show host Chris Cuomo there was "no legal justification" for President Donald Trump ’s action against Syria a night earlier, which was a military strike against a Syrian air base in response to the nation ’s use of chemical weapons earlier in the week.   Kaine said although he agreed from a "moral standpoint" with the decision, there was no "legal justification" for Trump’s decision because he did not come to Congress first.
