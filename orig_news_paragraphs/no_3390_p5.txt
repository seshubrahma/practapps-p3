While trade deficits with some countries —  particularly those with oil exporting countries —   are to be expected and not the result of abusive practices, persistent trade deficits in manufactured goods may be the result of unfair trade practices. Examples of  abusive trade practices include manufacturers selling goods below their cost of production and unfair subsidies aimed at undercutting U. S. manufacturers. The report produced by the study will be the basis for the administration to implement policies cracking down on these abuses, according to Commerce Department officials.
