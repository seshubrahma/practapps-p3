Some analysts said North Korea has toned down its provocations toward the South ahead of the election to avoid emboldening the country’s   conservatives. China, which saw relations with Park’s government strained over the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system, congratulated Moon on his win Wednesday.   " I have always attached great importance to South Korea as well as   Korean relations," Chinese President Xi Jinping said, according to the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
