Thursday on MSNBC’s election coverage  former Rep. Bob Barr ( ) a leader in the push for the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was lacking in policy in his campaign.   When asked if voters falling for personality over policy with their support for Trump Barr said, "They’re falling for something over policy, because there is absolutely no policy that has come out of Trump’s mouth in this entire election contest thus far.
