Gorsuch meeting with senators, Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado, has been meeting with senators on both sides of the aisle since being nominated last week.   Blumenthal said the two men met for 40 minutes in the senator’s office, where they discussed their shared running habits and "common love for the outdoors," among more serious conversations about Gorsuch’s judicial views and background.   While Blumenthal described the meeting as "amicable," he said he was "disappointed" in Gorsuch’s responses to his questions and felt he was not being forthcoming and specific enough. He said he was especially looking for more answers on Gorsuch’s thoughts about reproductive rights, workers’ rights and consumer protection issues.
