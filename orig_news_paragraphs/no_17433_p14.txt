" Americans deeply believe this is one of our fundamental strengths, the opportunity to carry out new, innovative ideas to better society    so long as they’re responsible for the results and there’s a limit to those freedoms," said Nathan, who advises districts and lawmakers on charters and other policy matters as director of Center for School Change.
