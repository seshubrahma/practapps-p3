Additionally, the number of unaccompanied minors detained illegally entering the U. S. from October to January  —   20, 455  —   is up by over 100 percent compared to those same months last year. Interviews with migrants, people smugglers and officials show many migrants are trying to cross now instead of facing tighter policing and new policies to halt illegal immigration if Trump or another Republican wins the Nov. 8 election. " If Trump wins, we’re all screwed and all Latinos are screwed," Isaias Franco, a    from El Salvador who was deported from the United States late last year and is now trying to get back, said at a migrant shelter in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas.
