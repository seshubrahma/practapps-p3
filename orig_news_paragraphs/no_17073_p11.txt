Comey has a history of bucking presidents. In 2004, as the Justice Departmentâ€™s No. 2 official, he refused to reauthorize a surveillance program ordered by President George W. Bush. The episode included a dramatic showdown between Comey and White House officials at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft. He and other top officials threatened to resign until Bush made changes to quell the rebellion.
