For Mr. Trump, the new, more tempered talk on immigration could help convince some    voters, particularly whites, that he has more compassion for Hispanics and other minorities than his harsher earlier positions would suggest. " He finally figured out that you can’t win a national election with just white voters," said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who worked for Mr. Rubio’s campaign. But whatever the possible gains, Mr. Trump risks offending millions of conservatives who were drawn to his   as an unwavering opponent of illegal immigration.
