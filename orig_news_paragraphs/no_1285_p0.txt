The New York Times won three Pulitzer Prizes, and The New York Daily News and ProPublica shared the prize for public service, as journalism presented its highest honors on Monday at a time of steep financial challenges for the industry and unabashed antagonism from a new presidential administration. The Daily   joint effort won for a series on the New York Police Departmentâ€™s widespread abuse of a   law to force people from their homes and businesses over alleged illegal activity. The investigation, which involved the examination of more than 1, 100 nuisance abatement cases, found that the Police Department almost exclusively targeted households and shops in minority neighborhoods. The reporting drove New York City to   the nuisance law and pass sweeping reforms.
