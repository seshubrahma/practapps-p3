Many of these migrants are fleeing violence in what MSF calls the Northern Triangle of Central America (NCTA) consisting of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. However, their countries of origin are not limited to those in Central America. In just a few days in September of last year, there was a surge of almost 5, 000 Haitian, African and Asian migrants entering by Mexicoâ€™s southern border. None of these migrants requested permission to stay in Mexico, as they all wanted to reach the United States.
