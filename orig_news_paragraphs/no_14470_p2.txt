CBP officials say efforts to measure the effectiveness of fencing were stopped in 2013 due to "funding shortfalls," according to the report. Border Patrol officials interviewed by the GAO said fencing helps divert illegal   away from urban areas and into rural areas where agents can more readily respond. But officials also said smugglers and others can breach border fences by simply cutting through or finding ways over or under them. In response to GAOâ€™s findings, the Department of Homeland Security said metrics to assess fencing contributions would be developed, according to the report.
