Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf, but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the opening of a session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, he decided to seek other accommodations.

National security concerns have also complicated Anbang’s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States.
