But for whatever reason you don’t like Hillary Clinton. You should give that some thought     especially if you enthusiastically supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, who in campaigning and certainly in governing has proven himself pretty much the ideological equal of Clinton in 2016. If you liked him, but don’t like her, ask yourself why.
