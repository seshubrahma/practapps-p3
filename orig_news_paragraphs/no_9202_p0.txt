Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Houston, Texas yesterday, giving a speech entitled "How to Destroy The Alt Right". During the QA session following Milo’s speech, an Army Sergeant First Class spoke to Milo, saying that he had given a voice to the voiceless within the military. [   The Sergeant stepped up to the microphone saying, "I’m stationed at Fort Sam Houston down in San Antonio and as heartening as it is to see the movement push back against the political correctness culture on campuses the military is continually pervasive in silencing us and essentially making us shut up so sir from the bottom of my heart, I just wanted to say you give a voice to us who have to be silent, who have to deal with having the political correctness shit pushed down our throats
