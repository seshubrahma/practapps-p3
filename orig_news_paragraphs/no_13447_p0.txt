A new national poll from Quinnipiac University finds socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders surging into a tie against Hillary Clinton. Sanders has closed a   gap from Quinnipiac’s last national poll at the end of December. ["Democrats nationwide are feeling the Bern as Sen. Bernie Sanders closes a   gap to tie Secretary Hillary Clinton," Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll, said in a release.   Clinton leads Sanders by 2 points,   within the poll’s margin of error.
