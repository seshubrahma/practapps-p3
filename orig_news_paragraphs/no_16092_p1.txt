In fairness, Erdogan pushed back on Tuesday, conceding in a CNN exclusive interview that his death     "I am a mortal, I could die at any time"    would end his rule.     The White House readout of the call made no mention of the ongoing crackdown in Turkey, where Erdogan has targeted opposition figures, journalists and other elements of civil society in the aftermath of a failed coup last year. A senior Trump administration official told CNN the call skirted the controversy surrounding the referendum and, apart from a "simple congrats," mostly focused on Syria.
