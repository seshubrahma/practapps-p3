Cedar Springs, Michigan (CNN) Rep. Justin Amash said Monday the solution for dysfunction in Washington likely boils down to removing House Speaker Paul Ryan and replacing him with someone who is "nonpartisan." "We need either a change in direction from this speaker, or we need a new speaker," Amash said while answering a question about the perpetual gridlock in Washington. The Michigan Republican also laced into President Donald Trump, hewing close to a strategy of blasting Republican leaders like Ryan and Trump, during a town hall with about 100 residents from his district, which is loosely centered around Grand Rapids.
