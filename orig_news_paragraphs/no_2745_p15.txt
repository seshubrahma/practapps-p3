__ _ 7. Our investigation into Chicago’s crisis of violence took our journalists to the city’s 11th police district, where homicides are up 89 percent from a year ago. Only about 74, 000 residents call it home, yet 91 people have been killed there so far in 2016  —   more homicides than larger cities like Seattle and Buffalo saw in all of last year.
