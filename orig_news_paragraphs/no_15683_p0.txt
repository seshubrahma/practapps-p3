This weekend the Washington Post reported that in December Jared Kushner, now presidential adviser (and Donald Trump’s   ) and former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn discussed with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak the possibility of creating a secret back channel between the countries. The two  —   who would become key figures in Trump’s administration   —   did not initially acknowledge the conversations. Kushner was a private citizen at the time, not a US government official.
