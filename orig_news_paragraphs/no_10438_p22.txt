Donald Trump is now all that stands between you and a Hillary   justice who would create a Supreme Court majority of "Interpretivists," the legal school of thought reacting against the Court’s restrictions on the New Deal which teaches that the Constitution means whatever Leftists believe it should. The Court has become a   in which today’s four Democratic appointees vote in lockstep while the five Republicans do not. I had the privilege to attend a meeting with Justice Antonin Scalia just months before his death at which he noted that for 50 years GOP nominees have been an ideological   while Democratic nominees have been uniformly leftist. Granted, early signs of what Trump might do have not been promising.
