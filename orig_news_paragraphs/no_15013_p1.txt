The Senate Judiciary Committee voted   along party lines to move Gorsuch’s nomination to the full Senate.   With Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware, Dianne Feinstein of California, Mark Warner of Virginia and Patrick Leahy of Vermont all saying Monday they could not support Gorsuch, Democrats reached the votes they needed to prevent the advancement of Gorsuch’s nomination under current chamber rules.   Republicans, who hold a   majority, needed a total of 60 votes to end the filibuster.
