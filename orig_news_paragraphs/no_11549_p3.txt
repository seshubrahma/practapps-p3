—   between a tweet sent at 12:10 PM EDT and one sent at 3:27 PM EDT it is possible that the tweet may be reintroduced to the timeline in order to hide the manipulation.   Milo Yiannopoulos, editor of Breitbart Tech, predicted 2 months ago that Twitter would seek to interfere with the primary process, noting that Twitter’s head of news, government and elections served as Deputy Chief of Staff for a Democrat senator from Louisiana in 2008, and that he is also a Term Member of the Council of Foreign Relations. A move to shadowban the tweets of the Republican   would therefore not entirely be unexpected.
