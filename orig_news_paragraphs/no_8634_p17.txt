President Sisi should be considered a key ally of America as he is leading Egypt towards democracy and also is leading the fight against global jihad, both militarily and politically, in countering radical Islamic ideology.

Egypt and Russia signed a $2billion arms deal after the United States abandoned them during their fight against terrorism.
