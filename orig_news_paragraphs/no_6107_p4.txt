President Putin presented Secretary Tillerson with the Russian Order of Friendship award in 2013. The unscheduled meeting between Tillerson and Putin comes amid heightened tensions between the United States and Russia over Syria. Last week, President Trump ordered airstrikes on assets linked to Syrian dictator Bashar   in response to the regimeâ€™s use of chemical weapons in a   area in the northern part of the   country. Since the U. S. airstrikes, U. S. and Russia have been trading barbs.
