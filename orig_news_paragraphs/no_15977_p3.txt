" Lewandowski had been the chief proponent of what he called the "Let Trump be Trump," strategy, which in practice meant wanting the candidate to continue to be outspoken, even to the point of offending millions of voters. Indeed, even after he was fired    against the backdrop of flagging poll numbers for Trump since he became the presumptive nominee    Lewandowski refused to question Trump’s decision to attack an   federal judge overseeing the Trump University case as "Mexican" and therefore biased against him. In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash shortly after his firing was announced, Lewandowski seemed to offer his own version of the Trump style, insisting that he was a "straight shooter," and offering some   assertions about Trump’s poll numbers in Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
