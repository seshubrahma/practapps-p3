A pot advocacy group is pledging to lead a   march while handing out 4, 200 joints to random people in the crowd attending Donald J. Trump’s January 20 inauguration ceremony in Washington, D. C.[The group, DCMJ. org, led a successful campaign to legalize marijuana in the District of Columbia, and now it is targeting both Donald Trump and his U. S. attorney general nominee, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, both of whom the group says are not sufficiently friendly toward legalizing marijuana.   DCMJ is planning a protest march during Trump’s oath of office ceremony.
