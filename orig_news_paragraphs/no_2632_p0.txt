Donald J. Trump will visit Mexico on Wednesday for a private meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto  —   a trip that will take him to a nation he has repeatedly scorned   —   before quickly flying back for what is billed as a major immigration speech in Arizona. Mr. Peña Nieto’s office said Tuesday night that the meeting would take place at the presidential palace in Mexico City, and Mr. Trump, on Twitter, said he looked "very much forward" to the visit. The Mexican president’s office said Mr. Peña Nieto had sent invitations last week to both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton.
