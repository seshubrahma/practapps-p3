Trump has named every Cabinet and   official, as well as a handful of deputies and ambassadors. Obama had not named any ambassadors but had many agenciesâ€™ deputies selected and several board positions filled, including at the Federal Reserve, Council of Economic Advisers and the Council on Environmental Quality. Unlike Obama, Trump also had a Supreme Court vacancy at the beginning of his term. He nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, whose hearings are scheduled for next month.
