On April 3, the Department of Labor will start distributing another 85, 000   visas to companies, as required by law. Statements from White House officials suggest that a reform of the   program will be linked to a larger plan to comprehensively reform the nation’s   immigration system into Trump’s proposed   immigration system. Business groups will likely oppose Trump’s   immigration reform unless they can negotiate a promise for additional   contract workers. In 2013, Democratic politicians supported this negotiated demand by business groups, because the business groups promised to pressure GOP politicians to create "a path to citizenship" for the resident population of at least 11 million illegal aliens.
