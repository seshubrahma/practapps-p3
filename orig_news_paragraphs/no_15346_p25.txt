This family lives on the 13th floor, and in North Korea, in a lot of the buildings, people don’t use the elevators because of electricity interruptions. It’s not something we’re used to in the West, having to take the stairs up and down every day.   On the upside, it’s really good exercise. This is where we take our shoes off when we walk in.
