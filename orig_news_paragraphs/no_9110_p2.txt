After disabling the vehicle and dumping rotten food into the interior I feel I have improved the community and supported our nation â€™s values by stopping a promoter of hate speech. I do not wish to have ignorant bigots in my town and in a just world the person deserved what was received and  the situation is made whole. As America is far from just, I expect the bigot will want to be made whole.
