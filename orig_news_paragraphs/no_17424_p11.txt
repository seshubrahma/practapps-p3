The tax base is unaffected by the value of exports or the cost of imports, so there is no payoff to manipulating "transfer prices" between domestic and overseas operations so that reported profits are lower in the United States and higher in overseas,   jurisdictions.   Most importantly border adjustment removes incentives for domestic firms to relocate production offshore. Because they will owe taxes on US sales whether production takes place in the United States or elsewhere, and owe no US taxes on   sales, they will gain no tax benefit from shifting operations abroad.   We can concede global production to our competitors and make it more expensive for US families to purchase those products.
