Democrats want to preserve the Affordable Care Act, and a handful of Republican senators expressed serious concerns about the House plan as it was being developed. Under the House Republican plan, the   tax credits provided under the Affordable Care Act would be replaced with credits that would rise with age as older people generally require more health care. In a late change, the plan reduces the tax credits for individuals with annual incomes over $75, 000 and married couples with incomes over $150, 000. Republicans did not offer any estimate of how much their plan would cost, or how many people would gain or lose insurance.
