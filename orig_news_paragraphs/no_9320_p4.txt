The latest smear campaign from the Left against Border Patrol agents comes after years of efforts to denigrate them as a means of further reducing their ability to properly secure our nation’s borders. The NBPC’s endorsement letter for Trump follows: March 30, 2016, The National Border Patrol Council is the official organization representing our nation’s Border Patrol Agents. We represent 16, 500 agents who selflessly serve this country in an environment where our own political leaders try to keep us from doing our jobs. The NBPC has had a longstanding practice of not endorsing presidential candidates in the primaries.
