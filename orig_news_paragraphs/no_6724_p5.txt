When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. We may look upon the strains of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, and we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims. We see only that they were children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy. We can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden.
