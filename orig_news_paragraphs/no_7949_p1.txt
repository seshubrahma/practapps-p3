This is the guy who created Romneycare, who was the template for Obamacare. Mitt Romney marched in gay pride parades. He did the first same sex wedding in America, put homosexuals in the Supreme Court in Massachusetts. He boasted, remember in that famous clip of him and Ted Kennedy, that he was more   than anyone and then hosted a Planned Parenthood event and then contributed to them.
