Death by China, published in late 2011, provided a    indictment of how China had systematically flooded U. S. markets with illegally subsidized products   over 50, 000 American factories caused 25 million Americans to be unable to find a decent job and left the U. S. than $3 trillion dollars in debt to the world’s largest totalitarian nation. Navarro has stated that Donald Trump read Death by China and saw the film version before reaching out to him, in advance of running for President. Once the   bid for the presidency was launched, Trump appointed Navarro as a campaign adviser. The Financial Times reported that after Trump’s unanticipated victory, Chinese diplomats have been scrambling to set up meetings with current and former U. S. officials who focus on Asia to try to try to discern what   Trump is thinking.
