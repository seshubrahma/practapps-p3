On June 5, the Qatari Ministry of Defense transmitted a message to the governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, saying they would fire on any naval ships from those countries that enter into its waters, a US official said. That official and others say the situation in Qatar has not affected US military operations and security in the country.   The three Sunni Gulf countries    Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE    along with Egypt accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region because of its ties to their Shiite rival, Iran, and its support for groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.   Qatar acknowledges its links to these groups, but denies that it supports terrorism.
