At the time, one GOP aide told Breitbart News that Ryan’s expansion to the   program "is a knife in the heart of the working class, and African Americans," who depend on the jobs now to be filled by   foreign workers.

While Ryan did not fund this   wall for the American people, Ryan does support border walls for his own family.
