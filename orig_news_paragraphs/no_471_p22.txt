Exxon Mobil, whose former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, just became secretary of state, was one of the provision’s primary opponents. He argued that the rule would force the company to disclose "commercially sensitive information" and make it harder to compete against certain foreign oil companies that do not need to comply. By Friday, both the House and Senate had approved the first two of these repeals  —   on the stream rule and the foreign government payments   —   and final action by the Senate approving the repeal of the methane gas rule is expected soon.
