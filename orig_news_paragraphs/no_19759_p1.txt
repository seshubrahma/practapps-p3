The cost of solar and wind power are falling so fast that they will soon beat fossil fuels on price alone, regardless of what the federal government does. Since 2008, the price per watt of   solar energy has fallen by 64 percent. Even Walmart puts solar panels on its roofs now. Others argue that the Obama administration has stoked this sense of technological inevitability —  and that if the Trump White House were to heavily subsidize coal or natural gas, or permanently disrupt the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases, the rise of renewables might falter.
