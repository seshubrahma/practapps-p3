The ransom demanded from WannaCry victims reportedly ranged from $300 to $600, with a threat that higher payments would be demanded if victims did not pay up quickly.   The total haul for the criminals responsible for the attack has been estimated at just $50, 000, but the financial damage to victims around the world will be several orders of magnitude higher by the time all is said and done. For example, the China National Petroleum corporation took 20, 000 gas stations offline to control the spread of the virus, while India shut down some financial networks in an apparently successful bid to minimize WannaCry damage. The total cost of dealing with this viral attack will probably run into billions of dollars worldwide.
