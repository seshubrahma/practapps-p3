Officers wouldn’t let reporters approach those on the float or those driving it, but a magnet on the side said "Trump Unity Bridge. " As the float headed east to move away from the parade, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, a Trump supporter, was seen walking along the sidewalk, taking in the scene but remaining silent. He did not respond to a reporter’s question about his opinion of the march or protest.
