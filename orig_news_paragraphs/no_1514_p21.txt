Calvin D. Williams, Cleveland’s chief of police, told reporters on Monday that the shooting in Baton Rouge had not altered the city’s security plans. After five officers in Dallas were killed this month, the police here began dispatching patrol cars with at least two officers at a time. " Our officers are told to be especially cautious," Chief Williams said.
