Two years ago, the only people who concerned themselves with   cyberattack attributions were top security experts like Bruce Schneier, who wrote an article in The Atlantic arguing that the government didn’t have enough evidence to connect the Sony hack to the North Korean government. (He was convinced later that month, when the Times reported that U. S. intelligence agencies were also relying on secret evidence from the NSA and from sources inside North Korea to back up its claims.) Now, Trump’s public disavowals of hacking analyses have made it popular to question Russia’s involvement. The increase in public mistrust in   mirrors the way that the language of doubt has taken hold around climate science and the trustworthiness of mainstream news reports.
