The U. S. government has not responded to a Freedom of Information Act request from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) seeking information on why Page was surveilled. In April, CNN reported that the controversial   dossier on Trump compiled by a former British intelligence officer served as part of the FBI’s justification for seeking the FISA court’s approval to clandestinely monitor Page. In his testimony last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight,   Director James B. Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agency ’s ties to the dossier, including whether it was used in the Russia probe.
