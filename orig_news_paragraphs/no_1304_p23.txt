But a review of public records suggests at least some of them are connected to efforts to salvage investments he made with Jessica Manafortâ€™s husband, Jeffrey Yohai, whose real estate business filed for bankruptcy in December. Mr. Yohai faces a lawsuit by another   who claims he exploited his connections to Mr. Manafort "to meet numerous public figures and celebrities" and solicit investments from them Mr. Yohai denies the accusations. In an affidavit filed in the bankruptcy case, Mr. Manafort said he had decided to "assist with additional funding to protect my existing investments," totaling more than $4 million, in several luxury properties in California owned by limited liability companies controlled by Mr. Yohai. Why Mr. Manafort opted to go to Spruce Capital and the Chicago bank for the loans is unclear.
