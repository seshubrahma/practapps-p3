Trump has received now over $3 billion in free airtime. Strikingly, ya know that last 30 days, he had $500 billion dollars in free airtime, 90 percent of which was positive. To put that in perspective in the entire 13 months of the campaign, the aggregate coverage of my campaign was about $500 billion dollars worth. That has a dramatic effect on the polls when every network becomes effectively the SuperPAC for the candidate they want to win the nomination and weâ€™re about to see that same ferocious fury now turn against Donald in an effort to elect Hillary.
