The nation needs a     and   agenda that recognizes the tremendous value of the natural resources under our feet. While the rest of the world stumbles blindly in the grip of an   and   ideology, the U. S. can march ahead and regain its place as the world’s economic and technological leader. The nation’s environment is in terrific shape, thanks to early efforts by EPA and more recent efforts by state governments and businesses. The nation’s economy and environment will be even better if the federal government gets out of the way.
