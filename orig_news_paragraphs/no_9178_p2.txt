The problem for Ryan is that Trump, his supporters and his policies do not seem to be going anywhere, even if he loses spectacularly. Ryan’s favorability has fallen 28 points over the past two weeks, fueled by Trump turning his attention to the speaker and criticizing him for sowing division in the party, seemingly without any sense of irony. A Bloomberg poll conducted Oct.   showed that 51 percent of Republicans think the Trump’s view of what the GOP stands for better matches theirs, compared to 33 percent who said Ryan’s perspective more closely matched theirs. Ryan has set himself up for a confrontation with Trump after Election Day.
