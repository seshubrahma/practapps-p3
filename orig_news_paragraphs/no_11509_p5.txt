Israel does not consider most of the settlements illegal  —   except wildcat settlements set up in violation of Israeli law   —   since there is no prior legal sovereign in the West Bank (which Israelis refer to as Judea and Samaria). Much of the area was to have been an Arab state according to a UN plan passed in 1947, but the surrounding Arab states went to war against Israel, and Jordan occupied the territory until 1967. The Palestinians consider all Israeli development across the 1949 armistice line  —   including in East Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel shortly after winning the Six Day War in 1967
