A new study of college syllabi shows that Karl Marx’s "The Communist Manifesto" is one of the top three texts assigned to American college students, and that Marx is the most assigned author in U. S. economics classes. So Bernie Sanders can tell the CNN audience at this week’s Democratic town hall that "democratic socialism" is the "right to economic security," without talking about confiscatory taxes that "democratic socialism" is what they have in Europe, while ignoring Europe’s ongoing fiscal crisis that "democratic socialism" just means "creating a government that works for all of us, not just a handful of people on the top," as a room full of grownups applauds. They trust Sanders, because he was right about the Iraq War. They forget that he was wrong about the Cold War.
