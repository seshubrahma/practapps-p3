The ruling, by Judge William Orrick of the San   U. S. District Court for the District of Northern California, blocks a section of President Donald Trump’s February executive order authorizing the withdrawal of all federal funds from such jurisdictions. That authority will now be suspended while the lawsuit, launched by a group of California sanctuary cities, works its way through the courts. The ruling may not, however, effect Sessions’s demands for compliance.
