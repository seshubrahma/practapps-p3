The key role of the NSC in making national security policy and foreign policy was a pronounced feature of the Obama administration and it seems this will also be the case for the Trump administration.    Trumpâ€™s national security adviser Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster inherited an NSC team from his predecessor Michael Flynn that is quite formidable in three areas that are key to American national security interests: China (and by extension North Korea) the Middle East and Russia. This is fortuitous because the United States faces gathering foreign policy crises.
