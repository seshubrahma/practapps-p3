That means two polls from Colorado this month have Trump up by four points, while two other polls —  from CBS   and Quinnipiac —  have Clinton up one and two points respectively, negligible leads inside those surveys’ margins of error. The only reason why Clinton currently leads in the RealClearPolitics polling average in the state —  a meaningless lead of 0. 2 percent in the spread —  is an outlier poll from a couple weeks ago done by Rocky Mountain PBS that showed Clinton up 7 points. If Trump secures Colorado’s 9 electoral votes, along with everything else considered, he would win at least 275 electoral votes —  without even considering Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, New Hampshire, or even other places where he has been seen trending upwards in polls like New Mexico —  on November 8.
