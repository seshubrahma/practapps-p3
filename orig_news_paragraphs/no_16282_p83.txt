As for Indiana’s religious freedom law, it didn’t seek to mandate a particular point of view, but shield those holding certain beliefs from being legally liable. Furthermore, Jefferson was talking about the government discriminating against citizens. His Virginia Statue doesn’t say anything about protecting private citizens’ religious freedom from other individuals, which is what the recent crop of religious freedom laws are arguably about. At least, that’s what many state supreme courts have found, for instance in the case of bakers and florists who refuse to service   weddings.
