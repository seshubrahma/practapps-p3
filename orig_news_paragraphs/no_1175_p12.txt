The debate over Justice Fortas in 1968 also serves as an example of a successful filibuster, as noted on the Senate’s website. During hearings, Justice Fortas’s ties to the president, judicial philosophy and outside activities lost him support, and the Senate failed to invoke cloture by a   roll call vote. Nine Democrats and three Republicans did not vote. His nomination was then withdrawn.
