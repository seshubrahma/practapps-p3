In recent years, the United States has fallen behind other countries in the percentage of students who complete degrees, and there are sizable gaps in college completion between white students and students of color, who make up a growing portion of the nation’s young people. Less than 40 percent of students in New York’s   public universities and less than 10 percent of those at   public schools earned their degrees on time in 2013, according to the governor’s office, and average   debt in the state had risen to more than $29, 000 by 2015.    tuition in New York currently ranges from around $4, 300 to $6, 500 a year. There is no guarantee, though, that Cuomo will be able to convince state lawmakers to move his plan forward, and not all students would be covered.
