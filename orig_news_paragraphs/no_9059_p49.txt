Just as the kids of the 60s shocked their parents with promiscuity, long hair and rock’n’roll, so too do the  ’s young meme brigades shock older generations with outrageous caricatures, from the Jewish "Shlomo Shekelburg" to "Remove Kebab," an internet   about the Bosnian genocide. These caricatures are often spliced together with Millennial pop culture references, from old 4chan memes like pepe the frog, to anime and My Little Pony references.   Are they actually bigots? No more than death metal devotees in the 80s were actually Satanists.
