The President, perhaps unintentionally, has focused attention on a new and serious problem with the Mueller probe. If there is an obstruction case against the President, one of the chief claims would be that Rosenstein’s memo was a ruse orchestrated to shift attention away from the real reason for the Comey firing: the president’s opposition to  the FBI’s investigation of whether Trump campaign aides colluded with the Russians to influence the presidential election campaign.   Rosenstein will have to recuse himself from any supervisory role in the Mueller investigation due to this possible conflict of interest. He may actually be a witness in the investigation he is supposed to supervise and like Sessions will be compelled by legal ethics to assume a seat on the sidelines.
