" (North Korea) believes the only way to deter the US from attacking them, and maintaining the power of the Kim regime, is by the possession of nuclear weapons," said Joe Bermudez, an analyst with 38 North, a North Korean monitoring group. Bennett, the Rand analyst, said North Korea’s leaders look at states like Libya and worry they’ll go the way of Moammar Gadhafi if they accept US carrots in exchange for abandoning nuclear ambitions.
