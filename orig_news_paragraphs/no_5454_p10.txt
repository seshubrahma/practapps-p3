Representative Joaquin Castro ( ) questioned ICEâ€™s intent stating, "I am asking ICE to clarify whether these individuals are in fact dangerous, violent threats to our communities, and not people who are here peacefully raising families and contributing to our state. I will continue to monitor this situation. "
