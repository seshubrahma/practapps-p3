This was the situation I found myself in for filming a demonstration and facing a charge that was so minor that the bond was $250. This was also the same charges other protesters were facing, who were also going through a similarly   process that seemed designed to intimidate people, not deliver proper justice. It seems to me that the entire process could’ve been done quicker, more efficiently, and at less expense to taxpayers, but  —   and this is obviously conjecture   —   at some point, authorities made a decision to make the entire process laborious for people.
