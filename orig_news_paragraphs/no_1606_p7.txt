Zika appears to have reached Miami Beach. A handful of cases most likely transmitted by local mosquitoes has been identified in the popular tourist destination, said a health official who insisted on anonymity. Authorities are trying to decide whether to designate a section of the city as an active Zika transmission zone. The first local cases were discovered in July in a    area of the Wynwood neighborhood, also in Miami.
