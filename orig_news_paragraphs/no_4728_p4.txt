On April 11, the Washington Post cited "law enforcement and other U. S. officials" stating that, as part of its investigation into alleged Russian collusion, the FBI obtained a secret FISA court order last summer to monitor Page’s communications. The Post acknowledged it was reporting on leaked information, highlighting that the officials "spoke about the court order on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of a counterintelligence probe. " The Post further reported on the court order: The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page’s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.
