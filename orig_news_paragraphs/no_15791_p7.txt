Every new tweet,   interview and attack on the media has dug a deeper hole for Trump. Plans to create a   "war room" to reject   stories turned out to be a bust, reportedly because experienced lawyers declined to  staff it for the White House. That leaves an isolated President    a man with a penchant for lying    with the hopeless task of asking the public to believe him and not Comey. If heâ€™s wise, Trump will simply hunker down and try to stoically endure the storm of bad news coming his way, thanks to Comey.
