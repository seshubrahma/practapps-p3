WASHINGTON   —    The United States is sending an additional 400 troops to Syria to help prepare for the looming fight for Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State’s   caliphate, American officials said on Thursday. The increase, which includes a team of Army Rangers and a Marine artillery unit that have already arrived in Syria, represents a   of the number of American troops there.
