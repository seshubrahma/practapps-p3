I grew up in this city, and I am old enough to remember when loyalties and even major legislation crossed party lines  …    when civility was the norm and politics mostly ended at the water’s edge. That seems like lifetimes ago. But it wasn’t. We need to shake off this national funk and remember that, first and foremost, we are all Americans.
