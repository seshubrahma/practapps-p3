Developed during the Iraq War, the munition is an air   warhead that explodes before hitting the ground to project a massive blast from all sides. During the final stages of testing in 2003, military officials told CNN the MOAB was mainly conceived as a weapon employed for "psychological operations."  Military officials said then they hoped such a huge blast would rattle Iraqi troops and pressure them into surrendering or not even fighting. As originally conceived, the MOAB was to be used against large formations of troops and equipment or hardened   bunkers.
