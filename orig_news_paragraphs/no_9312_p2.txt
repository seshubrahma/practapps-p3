Their namesake nonprofit organization W. K. Kellogg Foundation has deep financial ties to   billionaire George Soros and has donated nearly a million dollars to   group Black Lives Matter. Understandably, more than 370, 000 individuals have vowed that when they buy groceries, they won’t hand their   dollars over to a company at ease with placating radical   agitators just because they’re making a little noise. Kellogg’s manufactures myriad products under several brand names, from Pringles to Eggo waffles, as well as Special K and Frosted Flakes cereals and many more.   As more Americans joined the #DumpKelloggs campaign, it’s worth listing all the Kelloggs brands you won’t find in Trump voters’ shopping carts.
