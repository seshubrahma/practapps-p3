The Hollywood Reporter‘s Daniel Fienberg was particularly harsh, calling the pilot the most "painful" episode of TV so far this year and criticizing its apparently overly enthusiastic studio audience. The series sits at 31 percent on ratings aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. " Probably more so than with any of the other recent television reboots, every reaction to Fuller House from both the studio audience and probably the home audience will be nigh on Pavlovian, and it’s a study in how little needs to be done to produce drool," Fienberg wrote.
