Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany ended her trip to Africa with talks in Ethiopia on Europe’s migrant crisis. She also expressed support for protesters demanding wider freedoms. At least 500 people have been killed in antigovernment demonstrations in the past year. Back in Berlin today, she is scheduled to meet with President Idriss Déby of Chad to discuss how to deal with Boko Haram and the waves of Africans trying to reach the Continent.
