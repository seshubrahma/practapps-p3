By way of comparison, a slightly older Monmouth poll covering October 10 through 12, with a sample size less than half what CBS News and YouGov used, reported Trump 34 percent, Clinton 28 percent, McMullin 20 percent, Johnson 7 percent, Stein 1 percent. Either these two polls are in significant disagreement about Trumpâ€™s strength in Utah, or Republican voters in the state are beginning to swing back to Trump. According to CBS   Utah voters are highly engaged in the presidential race, with 65 percent saying they have paid a great deal of attention to the campaign, and fully 91 percent saying they will definitely vote. The "negative vote" factor is strong in the state.
