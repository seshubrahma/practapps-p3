But Portland, Oregon, has been the site of the most violent   demonstrations with a shooting and the arrest of 71 people on Saturday.   Police reported that the march was much smaller Sunday night with no arrests.   After several days of violence, protesters struck a different tone on Sunday. They gathered for a peaceful vigil on Portlandâ€™s waterfront at the Salmon Street Springs Fountain.
