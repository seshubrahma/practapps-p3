It’s not his personality type. Also, Wisconsin is a predominately white state that has very few Mexicans in it (as of 2008, Hispanics made up only five percent of the state and were mostly found in clusters).

Don’t expect immigration to have anywhere near the impact in Wisconsin that it had in Arizona, where Trump won in a landslide.
