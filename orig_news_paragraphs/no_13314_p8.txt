The critic of "populist" immigration reform decries such results as evidence of selfishness or chauvinism, but for many people, it’s all about that fair shake. Fairness could be the best way to present sensible immigration reforms, rocking   advocates back on their heels as they fumble to explain why American citizens must be treated unfairly to make their agenda work. Quite a few people on the Left would be receptive to such arguments, especially when Hillary Clinton is babbling about   tax increases to keep the welfare state and Obama’s   economy afloat. If money is that tight, how can anyone justify expending vast resources on people who aren’t legal citizens, or importing huge numbers of legal citizens that will place a greater strain on the system?
