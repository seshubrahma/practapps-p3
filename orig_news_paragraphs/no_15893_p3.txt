It is safe to assume, however, that, eased by this decision, the number could soon increase    perhaps even before the new war strategy is presented to the President for review and approval, which defense officials now say wonâ€™t happen for another few weeks.      The current commander of US and NATO troops, Gen. John Nicholson, has made clear he needs several thousand more American troops to help Afghan security forces beat back the advances that ISIS and the Taliban have made in recent months.      Those advances have been real, and they have been lethal.     ISIS now has a branch in Khorasan province, al Qaeda is still present, and according to the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, the Taliban control about 15% more territory than they did in 2015.
