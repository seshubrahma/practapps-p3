Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) Ohio Governor John Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Carly Fiorina did not qualify for the debate though she, unlike Christie, actually won some delegates in Iowa. Expect plenty of fireworks because the campaigns of Messrs. Kasich, Bush, and Christie are on the line on Tuesday.
