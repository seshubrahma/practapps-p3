This was the old way of the Senate   —   one that began to fade in the late 1970s as the ideological consolidation of the parties accelerated, reducing their need and taste for compromise. By the time Schumer arrived in 1999, four years after the Newt   Republican revolution, it was fast becoming an anachronism, with meals in the senators’ bipartisan dining room giving way to   caucus lunches. By the time Reid became minority leader, amid the   polarization of George W. Bush’s second term, it was all but gone.
