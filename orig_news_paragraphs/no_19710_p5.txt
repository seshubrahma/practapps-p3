But, Cuomo said, rising college costs and the need for many families to take out costly student loans are making it harder to get a college education than it was in previous generations. He equated beginning college with debt to "starting a race with an anchor tied to your leg. " Just as society decided generations ago that it would fund public high school because the economy depended on it, Cuomo said, society should say the same about college today.
