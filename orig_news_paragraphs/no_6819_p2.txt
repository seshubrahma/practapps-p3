California is not short of new ideas for public transportation. Governor Jerry Brown continues to back the troubled California   Rail Authority, which intends to link Los Angeles to the San Francisco area through the Central Valley. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is developing the Hyperloop, a new technology that proposes to link the two cities along the Interstate 5 corridor using rail pods launched within a vacuum tube. However, Californians seem to prefer their cars regardless of available public transportation options.
