The midnight move is a slap in the face to the people of Utah, attempting to silencing the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes," said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah. He said Republicans "look forward to working with   Trump to follow through on his commitment to repeal midnight regulations. We will work to repeal this   decision and replace it with one that garners local support and creates a balanced,   solution. "
