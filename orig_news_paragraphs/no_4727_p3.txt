Cranley’s call to become a sanctuary city came just after the Trump Administration enacted an executive order to temporarily halt all refugee resettlement from select nations. Cranley said he supported Catholic Charities, which is contracted by the federal government to resettle refugees all over the country, citing that his wife’s family are immigrants from Jordan.
