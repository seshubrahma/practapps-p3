earthquake in Italy continues to grow, and rescue teams are becoming less hopeful of finding survivors amid the rubble. At least 250 people in central Italy were killed by the quake, which leveled buildings in several towns early Wednesday and has continued to jolt the region with hundreds of aftershocks. Myanmar is also sorting through the damage caused by a different earthquake on Wednesday: Though it was stronger than the one in Italy, only a few deaths have been reported.
