Trump has blamed the slow pace of filling his Cabinet on Senate Democrats, who have used procedural measures to force the full length of time allowed for nearly all nominees, slowing down the process considerably.   Unable to stop any nominees without Republican support, given the move to a   threshold by former Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid, two committees’ Democrats resorted to refusing to show up for a   vote to deny a quorum, forcing Republicans to reconvene and pass the nominee by suspending the rules the following day.   " I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet," Trump said during a   press conference on Thursday.
