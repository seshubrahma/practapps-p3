Fans who bought tickets for the   event at Minute Maid Park, home of MLBâ€™s Houston Astros, watched and listened on radios as the media interviewed members of the Falcons and New England Patriots. Both sessions consisted of photo and interview sessions with all players and coaches, the first time these teams met the media in Houston. In between sessions was a performance by rock band X Ambassadors. The event ended with a fireworks display.
