True, there are still a hard core of "Bernie Bros" who despise Clinton as a corporate   and warmonger. Some of them may opt for   candidates or stay home, but young voters’ antipathy to Trump will be a strong motivator to turn out in the fall, however tepid their enthusiasm for Clinton.   Nor does it make much sense for Democrats to compete with Trump in pushing   America’s hot buttons. In the first place,    whites have been voting predominantly Republican for a generation, more on cultural than economic grounds.
