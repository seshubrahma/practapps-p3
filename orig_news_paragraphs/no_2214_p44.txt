Christine Turner, a disabled nurse in upstate New York, said a friend persuaded her to spend "close to $500" to get started with the Trump Network, but that it "didn’t pan out" after she struggled to get others involved. She also paid to join Cambridge, attracted to the prospect of networking with other members, but that did not work either. " I didn’t have any good experiences with members coming or approaching me or asking for products," Ms. Turner said, adding that she did not hold her bad experiences against the Trumps.
