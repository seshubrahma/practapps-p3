We are not voting on health care this week," House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters late Thursday. Hours before a Friday deadline, Congress was working to pass a   spending bill to avoid a government shutdown while they worked on a broader deal to fund agencies through September. Republicans were readying to pass the   funding bill on their own after Democrats, who tend to back these   bills, threatened to oppose it if Republicans did in fact move a fresh Obamacare repeal bill. A top Democrat    House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer    issued a statement Thursday morning saying he would advise his fellow Democrats to oppose the   bill if Republicans tried to pass their latest version of health care reform.
