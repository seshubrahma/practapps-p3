Trump can pick up support from parts of the electorate usually associated with the Democrats and assigned to the Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton. [  of the electorate see America as either   or seriously off track, said Caddell, who reviewed the poll of 2, 832 likely voters conducted by Gravis Marketing, a   firm that used automated telephone calls and weighted the sample by voting patterns.
