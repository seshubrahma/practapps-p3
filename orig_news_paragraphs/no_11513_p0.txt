Breitbart News National Security Editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka, author of the   book Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, joined SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Wednesdayâ€™s edition of Breitbart News Daily to discuss security issues around the world. [The conversation began with Kassam asking Dr. Gorka for his take on CIA Director John Brennan, saying that if   Donald Trump keeps his campaign promise to exit from the Iran nuclear deal, it would be "the height of folly. "   " John Brennan, to be honest, was a man who was an intelligence analyst, worked through the system, tried his hand at being an operator, failed abysmally, was a very unsatisfactory chief of station, and then under the Obama administration became the wingman for the President, promoting his disastrous policies around the world," Gorka replied.
