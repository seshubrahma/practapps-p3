The question is whether these scores of what have historically been reliably GOP voters are separating this race from their distaste for Trump and sticking with Handel    or have been turned off more broadly by the Republican brand under Trump and are willing to back Ossoff.   The 36, 000 voters who did not participate in the primary are perhaps the most baffling to both parties. Both sides have placed major emphasis on turning out voters who participated in Georgiaâ€™s presidential primaries last year but did not vote in April    and there are more Republicans than Democrats in that pool of potential voters.   What it all means: No one is quite sure what to expect, aside from a close race.
