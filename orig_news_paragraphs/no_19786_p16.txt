This is a weak argument, as you might expect if you study what is publicly known about Meryl Streep and Donald Trump and ponder the former not having moral standing to criticize the latter. It presumes rather too much about why Streep clapped. And it is a peculiar form of weak argument for a social conservative, of all people, to indulge in a moment of convenience. Using its form, we need only identify one egregious moral failing, and presto, everyone attached to any associated entity lacks standing to condemn moral wrongs!
