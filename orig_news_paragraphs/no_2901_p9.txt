Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a longtime political ally of the Clintons, said that Mrs. Clinton could effectively throttle the Trump campaign by winning Virginia, where he is confident of her standing, and one other swing state. He named Florida as the most inviting option. " If you put a combination together of Florida and Virginia, itâ€™s virtually impossible for Republicans to win the presidency," Mr. McAuliffe said.
