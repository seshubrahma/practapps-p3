The primary calendar then moves back to the Midwest and Western States, where Ted Cruz has run competitively against Trump. Similar to Wisconsin, Indiana is the only state voting on May 3rd. It is the only contest on the calendar between the primaries of April 26th and May 10th. With a    prize of 57 delegates, Indiana offers a critical lifeline for the Cruz campaign and its strategy of blocking Trump from collecting the 1, 237 minimum he needs to secure a majority of pledged delegates.
