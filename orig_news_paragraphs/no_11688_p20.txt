Intelligence and law enforcement agencies constantly speak of the difficulty of detecting radicals and intercepting them before they can launch terrorist attacks.     officials frequently complain they lack the manpower to follow up on every lead.    For example, in a February 2015 interview with CNN, FBI   chief Michael Steinbach said his agency could not track all of the Americans who might journey overseas to fight with ISIS and return, and said it was simplistic to refer to the Islamist terror threat in America as "sleeper cells," because the threat was more complex and diffuse than that.   Steinbach also warned the FBI has seen children as young as 15 recruited by ISIS, sometimes with the encouragement of their parents.
