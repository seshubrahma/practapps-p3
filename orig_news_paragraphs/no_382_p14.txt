During the campaign, the sly and provocative Mr. Bannon played a paradoxical role   â€”   calming the easily agitated candidate during his frequent rough patches and egging him on when he felt Mr. Trump needed to fire up the white   base. The president respects Mr. Bannon because he is independently wealthy and therefore does not need the job, and both men ascribe to a    credo when put on the defensive, according to the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Mr. Bannon is a deft operator within the White House, and he has been praised by Republicans who view him skeptically as the most knowledgeable on policy around the president.
