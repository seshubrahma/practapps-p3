[Speaking to Breitbart London ’s     Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily, outgoing UKIP leader Mr. Farage said that the comments made by longtime Hillary Clinton confidante Neera Tanden were "slanderous" and that anyone using the epithet "far right" to describe people who believe in   democracy "have lost the plot".    Tanden, who served in the White House during both the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations and is president of the   progressive   Center for American Progress, made the comments during an interview for Politico’s "Off Message’" podcast.
