Donald Trump has decided to double down on his most small, nasty, and divisive instincts by turning his campaign over to someone who is best known for running a   news site that peddles divisive, at times, racist,     conspiracy theories," Mook said. Mook cited the leftist Southern Povery Law Center’s decision to condemn Breitbart News as a media arm of the racist " " to back up his statements. He argued that by choosing Bannon to join his campaign, Trump would be expected to push "more conspiracy theories, more wild accusations" about Hillary Clinton and would never pivot to the kind of candidate that the establishment Republicans wanted. Mook appeared frustrated by the website’s recent reporting on Hillary Clinton, but vowed that Breitbart News would not stop her from becoming president.
