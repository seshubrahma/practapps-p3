California Attorney General Xavier Becerra wrote a letter to U. S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke threatening legal action if the Trump Administration for "haste or greed" tries to revoke or weaken 6 designated national monuments in California. [President Trump issued an April 26 Executive Order instructing the Department of the Interior to review 20 to 40 Presidential designations or expansions of designations under the 1906 Antiquities Act made since January 1, 1996.   The President directed the review over the next 45 days to focus on designations that now cover 100, 000 or more acres or any designation or expansion where Secretary Zinke determined there was a lack of adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders. Secretary Zinke is to report his findings on June 14, which will then start the   regulatory clock that would lead to amending or rescinding designations.
