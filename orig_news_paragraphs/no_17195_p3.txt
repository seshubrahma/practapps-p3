To put the matter bluntly: They should give up that hope. There is essentially zero chance that the recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will change Trumpâ€™s lead, which number in the thousands, not hundreds, in all three states. Trump is winning Wisconsin by a little more than 27, 000 votes his lead in Michigan sits at around 11, 000 and his lead in Pennsylvania is insurmountable at over 68, 000. This is not Florida 2000.
