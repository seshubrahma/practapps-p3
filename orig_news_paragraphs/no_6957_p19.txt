it’s far better to have a good devout Catholic like Justice Scalia or a devout Episcopalian like Gorsuch than a lawless   on the Supreme Court of all places. So if we’re not careful here, if we don’t get Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, judicial tyranny will reign without mitigation to no end. So we are really hanging on the edge of a precipice. We came within a hare’s breath of this leftwing bunch, these lawless fools, we came within a hare’s breath of them taking over the entire country with this last election.
