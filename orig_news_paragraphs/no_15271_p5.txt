But, playing some hardball, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer objected.    He said Republicans must first agree to remove "poison pill" riders    or amendments that have    bipartisan support    in the   bill before getting an agreement to pass a   bill.   He did this to try to put pressure on GOP negotiators to cut a deal, according to a Democratic leadership aide. While talks will continue, senators who wanted to leave town for the weekend will have to stay in Washington Friday and possibly vote on this   bill sometime before the midnight deadline.
