A study last year by the Bowling Green State University professors David Jackson and Melissa Miller found that celebrity political statements were highly polarizing to a sample set of Ohio voters, and that no celebrity  —    not Trace Adkins, not Ted Nugent, not even Oprah   —   was likely to inspire net positive votes for his or her candidate of choice. These   aggregators make sure that any leftist celebrity’s political reach will be neutralized by a backlash from people who don’t idolize and agree with them.
