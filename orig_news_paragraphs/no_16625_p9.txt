Obama is just one of a cavalry of top White House Democrats    also including First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden    who are arguing Clinton’s case this week as the Democratic nominee herself is convalescing from pneumonia and absent from the trail. The timing is opportune for a campaign eager both to spotlight its most popular surrogates and to move past a rocky patch. While Obama’s Philadelphia stop was planned well ahead of Clinton’s declaration that half of her rival’s supporters were "deplorable" and new worries about her transparency, the campaign hopes the President’s rally can at least provide a new storyline. But even an appearance from Obama    whose approval rating reached a nearly   high of 58% in an   Post poll Monday    won’t necessarily cure all of Clinton’s woes as the campaign enters its busiest stretch.
