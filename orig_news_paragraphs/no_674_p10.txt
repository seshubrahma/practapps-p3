At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against "appeasement" of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine’s expense   —   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko’s.
