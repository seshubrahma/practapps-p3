Shah Bharara is now under investigation by the general counsel of the D. C. GOP regarding her delegate eligibility status after Breitbart News exposed that she is actually a resident of Virginia and not the District of Columbia.

C. delegates like Galvez and Blum are warming up to backing Trump at the GOP convention in Cleveland in July.
