During Stone’s visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. " They had a kind of bromance," Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and   Levitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil’s Cathedral.
