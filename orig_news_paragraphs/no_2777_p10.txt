It’s not a state like Wisconsin, where Mr. Trump was in obvious danger. That state is better educated than Indiana, it has higher marriage rates, and it has more voters with an ancestry rooted in predominantly Protestant countries in northwest Europe, all factors that have hurt Mr. Trump in prior contests. The problem for Mr. Trump is not that Indiana’s a tough state for him it’s that it’s a better state for Ted Cruz than many of the more liberal states in the Midwest.
