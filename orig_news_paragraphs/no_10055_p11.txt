‘ BREAKING WITH TRADITION’ Foreign Policy magazine’s claim to be "breaking with tradition" in endorsing Hillary Clinton is anything but accurate. Perhaps it has never written an editorial, but its entire editorial line and history is, in and of itself, a tradition of endorsing globalist, neoconservative, pro open borders policies and candidates. The idea that this is somehow a big deal is a total farce.
