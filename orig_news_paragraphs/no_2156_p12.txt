In her advertisements, particularly in New York, Mrs. Clinton has started to turn her attention toward Donald J. Trump, who is leading the Republican field in delegates. Her first ad in the state took unsubtle jabs at the Republican   and a week later, she ran her first ad directly targeting Mr. Trump, explicitly criticizing his statements. The Clinton campaign also created and ran a   ad, titled "Una Bandera," which recalled that Mr. Trump called immigrants criminals and rapists. The ad made no mention or allusion to Mr. Sanders or a Democratic primary until the end, when it asked people to vote on April 19.
