Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from Brooklyn, who is often spoken of as a potential challenger to Mr. de Blasio for   in 2017, said that because of Mr. Trump’s ties to New York a Trump presidency "may surprisingly yield less hostility than we’ve seen from other Republican administrations," especially on transportation and public safety. Councilman Joseph C. Borelli, a Staten Island Republican and Trump supporter who was helping to serve as a liaison between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Trump on Wednesday, said the   "looks at cities sort of the way a developer would" and would find common ground with the mayor. Mr. de Blasio planned to offer personal congratulations to Mr. Trump by phone, but as of late Wednesday had yet to do so. But gone for the moment was any sense of a liberal wave cresting across the country.
