Nothing stated by Assange in his reply shows that he has any admiration or love for   Trump. Assange â€™s description of Trump as part of the "wealthy ruling elite of the United States" who has surrounded himself with "a spectrum of other rich people and several idiosyncratic personalities" could even be seen as a criticism of the future president. Secondly, and perhaps even more offensively, Jacobs implies that Assange believes Russia to be too transparent and free a state to require a whistleblowing service such as WikiLeaks.
