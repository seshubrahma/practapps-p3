Some 11 million adults have gained coverage under Medicaid expansion.   Also, the bill would reduce federal funding for the entire Medicaid program, which covers more than 70 million   children, adults, disabled Americans and the elderly.   States would either receive a set amount of funding per enrollee, known as a per capita grant, or fixed funding in the form of a block grant.    Either option would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states.
