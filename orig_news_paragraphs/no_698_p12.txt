A few supporters of Mr. Rossâ€™s walked out of his meeting, saying they were upset that the congressman was unable to talk without catcalls. One protester tried to reason with the passionate crowd, urging people to let Mr. Ross speak and adding that if they were angry, the correct response was to vote. " But in the meantime, let him talk so we can hold him accountable," she added.
