He said he had been unaware of an FBI investigation into the matter until Comey announced it publicly at a House hearing in March. On Thursday, Clapper commended Comey’s testimony. During the   hearing, Comey answered questions about the FBI’s Russia investigation, his private interactions with Trump and how he handled the Hillary Clinton email probe.   When Cooper asked if it comes down to a "he said, he said" about the substance of Comey and Trump’s conversations, whom would he trust, Clapper answered that he trusts Comey over Trump.
