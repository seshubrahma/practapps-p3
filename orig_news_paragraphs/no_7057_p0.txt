On Sunday, polling firm Change Research placed outsider Republican candidate for Virginia Governor Corey Stewart ahead of establishment rivals Ed Gillespie and Frank Wagner among likely voters in Tuesday’s GOP primary. [The survey of 3, 232 Virginians shows a slim lead for Stewart among likely primary voters. The tally among those who will "definitely" vote for a given candidate, however, is more striking, with a   lead for Stewart at 28 percent over 19 percent and 9 percent for Gillespie and Wagner respectively.   Corey Stewart, President Donald Trump’s former Virginia campaign manager, has carved out a niche for himself as the populist challenger to   GOP operative and 2014 U. S. Senate candidate Gillespie.
