In the meantime it is not entirely clear which of the ten counts Judge Robart —  who was appointed to the bench by George W. Bush —   thinks the executive order violates. The U. S. Department of Justice can immediately appeal this ruling to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, though it will be difficult to do so before Judge Robart releases his written opinion. If that San   appeals court affirms the order, then the federal government can seek an emergency stay from the U. S. Supreme Court.
