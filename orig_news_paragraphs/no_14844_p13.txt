The decision made by the government to deploy THAAD was not democratic at all," said Baek   coordinator for the Center for Peace and Disarmament, which advocates for a   Korean peninsula.   She accused   Hwang of taking advantage of the political instability around Park’s impeachment to press ahead with THAAD’s deployment "without any agreement from the National Assembly and the villagers of Seongju," where locals have long protested the system’s installation.   Being opposed to THAAD does not mean people are against or even skeptical of the   Korean alliance, Baek said, but she warned that current rhetoric over North Korea risked an "endless arms race."  "It’s a vicious circle," she said.
