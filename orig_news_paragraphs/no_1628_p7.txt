For that matter, these books shed little new light on controversial stands taken by Mr. Trump which, many legal scholars and historians note, threaten constitutional guarantees and American democratic traditions. Those include his call for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" and the "extreme vetting" of immigrants his talk of revising libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations over critical coverage an   attack on a federal judge that raises questions about his commitment to an independent judiciary and his incendiary use of nativist and bigoted language that is fueling racial tensions and helping to mainstream   views on race. Some of these books touch fleetingly on Mr. Trumpâ€™s use of inflammatory language and emotional appeal to feelings of fear and anger, but they do not delve deeply into the consequences of his nativist rhetoric or his contempt for the rules of civil discourse.
