China has reclaimed more than 3, 000 acres of land in the Spratly Islands since 2014, turning reefs and sandbars into islands equipped with airfields, ports and weapons.    Yvonne Chiu, an assistant professor of politics at Hong Kong University, said that militarily the US would be able to kick China off the islands but doubted this was something the Trump administration really had the stomach for.    "I think the ultimate goal is to make sure the islands aren’t used to threaten other countries in the region," she said. North Korea, Tillerson, who said that he’d only spoken to the   about world affairs in general terms, did appear to depart from the views of his future boss on North Korea, which Townshend said would be the biggest challenge for the new president.
