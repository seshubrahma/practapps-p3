The reports about Mr. Xie, who is still in custody, were based on transcripts of his interviews with his lawyers. Xinhuaâ€™s report suggested that the account of the torture of Mr. Xie, who was formally arrested last year on a charge of inciting subversion of state power, was fabricated. " Investigations by reporters and an investigative team have showed that the accusations were nothing but cleverly orchestrated lies," the report said.
