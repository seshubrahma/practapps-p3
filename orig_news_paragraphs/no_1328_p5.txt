Mr. Trump has no   donor network and has given little indication that he is willing to tap into his fortune to give the party the hundreds of millions of dollars it will require to finance its campaigns in the fall. In remarks to committee members here Thursday night, Mr. Trumpâ€™s new top strategist, Paul Manafort, sought to allay these fears without being overly specific. " He is prepared to work with the R. N. C. and the committees to raise the money necessary so that we will be well funded," Mr. Manafort said.
