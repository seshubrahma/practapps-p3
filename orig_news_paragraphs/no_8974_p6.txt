(@TMannWSJ) January 19, 2016,   â€”    Laugh it up, but in 2016 pop culture matters, and even though he has been dead some 36 years, John Wayne matters more than most. In fact, according to the most recent poll done by Harris Polling just last year, when it comes to movie stars, only Denzel Washington is more popular than John Wayne. You read that correctly   years after his death in 1979, a full 40 years since he starred in his final film, "The Shootist," The Duke is the second most popular movie star in America, more popular than Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Tom Hanks, Clint Eastwood, Meryl Streep, and Angelina Jolie.
