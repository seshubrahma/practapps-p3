The Monmouth poll found that only 36% of Florida voters have a favorable opinion of Clinton, while 50% have an unfavorable opinion. Thatâ€™s only slightly better than Trump fared in the poll: 33% of voters there said they have a favorable impression of the GOP nominee, while 54% said they view him unfavorably.   Monmouth conducted the poll August   using phone interviews with 402 likely Florida voters.
