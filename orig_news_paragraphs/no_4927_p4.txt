You have people who are on the edge. When you dumb down or mainstream violence, these people become violent and they act out. Breitbart News compiled a list of 15 episodes of leftwing celebrities envisioning violence against President Donald Trump, including comedian Kathy Griffin’s shock "beheading" photo of the president, Madonna’s statement that she has "thought a lot about blowing up the White House," Joss Whedon’s tweet that he wants a "Rhino to F*ck Paul Ryan to Death," and Shakespeare in the Park’s stabbing "Trump" to death during a performance of Julius Caesar. Violence solves nothing.
