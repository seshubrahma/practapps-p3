At the close of polling, an estimated 75% of South Koreans had cast their votes, according to the National Election Commission, though that figure is expected to change. South Koreans were faced with a daunting list of 15 candidates however, two dropped out before Election Day. The hasty election came after Park, the countryâ€™s first female President, was impeached in a corruption scandal that also swept up top officials from business giants Samsung and Lotte Group.   Many voters said they were angry at Park and wanted greater transparency.
