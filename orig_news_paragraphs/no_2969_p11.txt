Mr. Trump and the party have gotten a late start on   for the general election and need as many of the party’s reliable donors as they can attract. At Mr. Romney’s donor retreat on Saturday, Mr. Priebus was more pointed, telling donors opposed to Mr. Trump that the party would "win with or without you," according to an attendee present for his remarks. A representative for Ms. Whitman did not respond Saturday to a request for an interview about her comments. Ms. Whitman, according to one of the people present, did not stop at comparing Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini.
