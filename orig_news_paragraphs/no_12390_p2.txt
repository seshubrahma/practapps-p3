The local group called the press conference to address their concerns about the alleged rape of a      girl on June 2 at the Fawnbrook Apartments in Twin Falls. The rape was conducted by two young refugee boys, which was   by a third young refugee boy, all of whom are being reared in   tribal Muslim refugee communities. The speakers at the press conference made three main points: They invited both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to come to Twin Falls to see what was happening to the community as a result of the influx of resettled refugees. They expressed concern that the young victim was not receiving fair treatment.
