Many Israelis argue that the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are too divided among themselves to ever be able to permanently accept two states. Some in the Israeli right advocate annexing all or part of the West Bank, and some rightists warned Mr. Netanyahu not to raise the possibility of two states in his meeting with Mr. Trump. At the same time, many Palestinians say the line has already been crossed   â€”   that Israeli settlements have already eliminated the possibility of creating a contiguous Palestinian state.
