The Republican nominee has also spent the week in a war of words with   former beauty queen Alicia Machado, who was mentioned in the debate as a woman who had been the victim of unflattering rhetoric by Trump. The feud plays into Clinton campaign charges that Trump harbors prejudice against women and Hispanics     two crucial demographics that could help decide November’s election. The issue could be next scrutinized at the vice presidential debate on Tuesday, forcing Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence    who has released his tax returns    on the defensive.
