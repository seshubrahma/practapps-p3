Trump repeatedly brought families who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens on stage at campaign rallies, and was the only candidate to respond to an open letter pleading for a campaign to acknowledge and deliver justice to victimized and suffering American families. The immediacy of his campaignâ€™s reply and the spotlight he shone on their plight was praised by an advocacy group that had fought for attention to the pressing issue for years. " Donald Trump is the only candidate whose office has responded to their open letter and that the candidate will support a national program to assist families of victims of illegal aliens. Their response was immediate and they have stated they will support our efforts in assisting our families," said Maria Espinoza, head of the Remembrance Project.
