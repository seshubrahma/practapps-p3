The   Center for Strategic and International Studies and the   Center for the Study of Democracy released a study in October. Called "The Kremlin Playbook," it characterized Bulgaria as the most deeply penetrated by Russia financially. Investment with Russian roots, direct and indirect, accounts for more than 22 percent of Bulgariaâ€™s gross domestic product, marking the country as a "captured state," said the study, of which Mr. Stefanov was an author. Increasing Russian penetration was also found in Slovakia, Latvia, Serbia and Hungary.
