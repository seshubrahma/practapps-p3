Youâ€™re lying on the beach trying to get some   rest. And then all of a sudden, a loud, buzzing drone comes out of nowhere, totally interrupting your nap. These kinds of incidents are becoming more common on beaches up and down the California coast, according to workers at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito. Laura Chapman, 26, a rescue coordinator at the center, said in an interview Wednesday that the drones were likely being used for sightseeing or taking pictures, and that their pilots might be unaware of the harbor and elephant seals they are disturbing.
