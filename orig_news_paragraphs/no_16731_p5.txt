Why would these officers say that Terence Crutcher was a "bad dude" and that it was "time for a Taser? " Why would an officer think this obviously unarmed man walking away with his hands in the air was a danger to anyone? He may have been reaching toward his car window, but why would that necessarily create an immediate threat to these officers or anyone else?
