" Not surprisingly, the threshold is driven not only by the air temperature, but also the relative humidity.   Sweating, the body’s main process to remove heat by evaporative cooling (think the process that makes your body cold after you get out of the shower) becomes much less effective as relative humidity increases, because the air is already more saturated with moisture.    The team was able to use this threshold to distinguish between deadly and   heat waves in the historical record, and then use the same threshold to observe how these conditions will play out in the future using climate models run with different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
