Multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials have told CNN that Trump associates or members of his team were in constant communication with Russian officials and other Russians known to US intelligence during the campaign. Lewandowski was ousted as Trumpâ€™s campaign manager in June and then became a CNN political commentator during the election but has since resigned from that position.   He said he has no idea whether former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort made contact with the Russians.   Lewandowski and Manafort were considered part of two rival powercenters in the campaign during the time they overlapped.
