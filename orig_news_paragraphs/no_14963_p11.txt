Prior to sentencing, Buryakov presented a letter to the court from a colleague at VEB, where heâ€™d worked since 2002, with stints in South Africa, Moscow and New York. The letter from Andrey Saratov, a bank executive, read like many others in a   white collar fraud case. Saratov praised Buryakov as a "man of integrity" who was "highly respected within VEB for his skills, knowledge and commitment. "
