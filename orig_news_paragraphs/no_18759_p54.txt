The rule that has probably gotten the most attention is Rule 40, which requires a candidate to have the support of the majority of at least eight state delegations in order to have his or her name placed into nomination. That rule was written in 2012 to deny Ron Paul supporters the chance to stage a protest in prime time; previously the nomination threshold only required that a candidate have the backing of a plurality of five state delegations, a significantly easier task. ’ ’ The   rule, though, will almost certainly be rewritten at a contested convention.
