Rubio finished an abysmal third place in Iowa, an even worse fifth place in New Hampshire behind the    Rubio mentor former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a distant second place in South Carolina, and an even more distant second place in Nevada. On Super Tuesday, Rubio missed the mark statewide in Texas and Alabama —  failing to get access to either state’s rich delegate count, only winning a handful of delegates across both thanks to his congressional district performances —   and he finished all the way back in third place in Arkansas and Oklahoma after his campaign predicted victories in each on election day, according to Bloomberg News.
