" I think there’s legitimate questions about the Clinton Foundation," former Barack Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said on NBC’s "Meet the Press" Sunday, though he added that Trump’s business dealings are more problematic and the foundation has done good work.   Pence blasted Clinton over those meetings, telling Tapper: "The simple fact is, this is becoming more and more clear through direct evidence in these emails that State Department officials under Secretary of State Clinton were extending access and special favors to major donors of the Clinton Foundation," Pence said.   Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, defended Clinton from criticism over the foundation’s influence Sunday on CBS’ "Face the Nation."
