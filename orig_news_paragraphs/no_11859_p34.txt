When asked about Jenner’s position on these issues regarding transgender people and public restrooms, and about how Trump said he would let Jenner use whatever bathroom —  men’s or women’s —  in Trump Tower than Jenner wanted to, Cruz didn’t even mention Jenner in his response. Cruz said: Adult men who are strangers should not be alone in the bathroom with little girls. That is basic common sense. It is remarkable that Donald Trump cannot see that.
