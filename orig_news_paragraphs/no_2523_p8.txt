Mr. Friedman, who donated a total of $50, 000 to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee in 2016, according to federal election records, had been openly saying even before the election that the job  —   one of the most sensitive and high profile in the diplomatic corps   —   would be his, according to friends. Israel’s conservative settlement supporters and their American backers rejoiced at the selection, while believers in a Palestinian state and the   peace process were perplexed and close to despair. Mr. Friedman is a staunch opponent of basic tenets of Washington’s longstanding approach to much of the ambassadorial portfolio.
