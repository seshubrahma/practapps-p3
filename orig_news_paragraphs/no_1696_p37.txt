During a building’s   to   construction phase, when there is no rental or sales money coming in, a   tax abatement can save a developer millions of dollars in taxes, because the property is taxed at the rate in effect before improvements are made. Once a building is completed and its apartments are sold, the benefits accrue to the buyers, significantly lowering taxes and making the apartments more appealing. In the 2004 offering plan for a new   penthouse at 120 Riverside Boulevard in the Trump   South development, which stretches from 59th Street to 72nd Street on Manhattan’s West Side, the estimated   property taxes were $617 because of the building’s   tax abatement. Without the subsidy, the taxes on the apartment, which was listed at $1. 6 million in 2004, would have been $32, 916.
