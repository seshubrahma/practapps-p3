After deciding to make the promotion of democracy a major theme of his presidency, Mr. Bush kept Mr. Mubarak at a distance and pushed him to release opponents and hold elections, although he made only halting progress and eased up later in his tenure. When Arab Spring protests erupted in 2011, Mr. Obama pressed Mr. Mubarak to step down and supported the election that led to Mr. Morsiâ€™s ascension. After Mr. Sisi ousted Mr. Morsi, Mr. Obama refused to call it a military coup but cut off some arms sales in hopes of moderating a crackdown. Ultimately, it yielded no results, so Mr. Obama lifted the arms freeze, but he changed some financing rules and declined to invite Mr. Sisi to the White House.
