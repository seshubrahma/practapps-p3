Can you commit to discuss with the committee in a closed session the reasons for your recusal from the Russia investigation?    If he says yes, it could be an indication there are additional reasons for his recusal, beyond a few meetings with the Russian ambassador, that are not known publicly.   If he says no, he will set off alarm bells across the Capitol, because it will indicate he may have something to hide. And if he disagrees with Comey and explains in a public hearing the reasons for his recusal, it will likely lead to more questions about why he didnâ€™t also recuse himself from the firing of Comey.
