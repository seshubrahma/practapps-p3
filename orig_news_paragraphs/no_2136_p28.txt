It never got that far. Despite scores of meetings between Mr. Kerry and his two main interlocutors, Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian president, and Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Kerry and his lead mediators, Martin S. Indyk and Frank Lowenstein, could not make progress. They blamed both sides for taking actions that undermined the process, but the continued expansion of the settlements was one of their leading complaints  â€”   an effort, in the American and European view, to establish "facts on the ground" so that territory could not be traded away. Mr. Netanyahu has accused the United States of "orchestrating" the vote, and his aides have said that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama effectively stabbed Israel in the back.
