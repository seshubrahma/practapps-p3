Former Bush official supporting Clinton: Trump could be economic ’disaster’ "Donald has been all over the place on ISIS," Clinton said, pointing to the contradictions in Trump’s past statements suggesting he was open to deploying US ground troops to fight ISIS, or that he would instead let ISIS and the Syrian government fight out their battle in Syria.    Biden also slammed Trump’s statement that President Barack Obama founded ISIS as "outrageous" and "dangerous," pointing to the head of the Hezbollah terrorist organization picking up on those comments.    Trump did not repeat his language calling Obama the "founder of ISIS," but blamed Obama and Clinton’s policies for the rise of ISIS.
