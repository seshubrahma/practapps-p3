On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Sen. Sanders, his supporters, and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email," the statement said. " These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not    and will not    tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates.
