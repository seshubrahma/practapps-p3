According to a report from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, less than half (48. 9 percent) of violent felony arrests in New York City result in conviction and sentence. Nationally, less than 2 in 3 murder cases result in the suspect even being arrested, let alone convicted. According to police data analyzed by the Washington Post, in Washington D. C. only 1 in 3 homicides results in a conviction. Experts have suggested that low    rates are even more exaggerated amongst immigrant communities â€”  and in particular, the illegal immigrant population.
