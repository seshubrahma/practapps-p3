Russian officials are considering sending the famed whistleblower Edward Snowden back to America as "a gift" to President Donald Trump, according to a report from NBC News. [Snowden, a former CIA employee, was granted asylum by the Russian government in 2013. He sought to escape charges of espionage, having leaked classified information concerning U. S surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA.)   However, a senior U. S official told NBC News that Russian authorities are now considering turning him over to the United States, where he would face trial, in order to "curry favor" with Trump and the new administration.
