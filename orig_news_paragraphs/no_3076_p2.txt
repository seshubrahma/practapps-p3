Obama’s move appears to have backfired, granting the incoming administration leeway to pursue the   restoration of  . S. relations that Trump has been advocating. NYT notes: Should Mr. Putin have chosen to retaliate harshly against the United States [as Obama expected] he would most likely have deepened the rift between the two countries and left   Donald J. Trump with a nettlesome diplomatic standoff from the moment he arrived in the Oval Office. But by choosing to essentially disregard Mr. Obama’s punitive measures, Mr. Putin can try to disarm his American critics, including members of Congress who consider him an aggressive foe of the United States.
