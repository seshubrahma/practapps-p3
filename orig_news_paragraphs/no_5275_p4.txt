In 2015, for example, almost 500, 000 people overstayed their visas and remained for some time as illegal immigrants. Also, the federal government annually invites 1 million people to legally immigrate to the United States, and provides work permits to a shifting population of up to 1. 45 million       plus at least 200, 000    . The immigrants and contract workers compete for jobs sought by the 4 million young Americans who join the workforce each year.
