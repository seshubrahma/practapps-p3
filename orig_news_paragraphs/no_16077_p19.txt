Clinton’s top aides believe North Carolina is the biggest   for Trump    and their best chance to flip a state that Mitt Romney won in 2012. Clinton first deployed general election staff to North Carolina in late April and their first ads in the state began running in June. Underscoring the importance both sides are placing on North Carolina, Trump also campaigns in the state Tuesday, appearing after Clinton during an evening event in Raleigh. The Clinton campaign and the White House also believe Obama can help galvanize the state’s large   population to vote in November.
