Kelly said he met a woman in Clinton Township who tried to vote three different times for Donald Trump, but her vote mysteriously switched to Hillary Clinton each time before the voting machineâ€™s screen went blank. She has no idea if her vote was counted and was very upset by the process. There are 18 different polling sites that have had similar problems taking place, Kelly said. The state party is looking into the discrepancies.
