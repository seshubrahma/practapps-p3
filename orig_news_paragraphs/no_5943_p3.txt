social media communications online and varied accounts of enforcement actions led a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson to make an statement as to the routine nature of the actions, an uncharacteristic move to take while a wave of enforcement actions is ongoing. Rayos’ deportation was made the face of the recent enforcement actions in the U. S. as her case made headlines, according to the Times. The deportation of Rayos fueled protests against immigration enforcement. Rayos’ case "underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court," according to an ICE statement cited in the Times.
