In the first joint press conference between U. S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the German leader claimed that a trade deal between the U. S. and the EU would be like a trade deal between two countries. [Trade was the topic of much of the press conference between the two leaders as President Trump has made the subject one of the pillars of his administration. During the press questions, a reporter from German paper Die Welt asked Ms Merkel if she thought that a trade agreement between the EU and the U. S. would be multilateral or bilateral.   Merkel said and agreement like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would be bilateral, indicating that she viewed the European Union as its own country, rather than a federation of countries.
