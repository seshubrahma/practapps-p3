The president specifically praised this reporter, and Steve Holland of Reuters, as two examples of journalists who do try to accurately report the news —  and made a distinction between "fake" media and the media as a whole. Trump said that the "fake" media has made a concerted effort to conflate his distinction between "fake media" and the media generally, and that "there’s a difference" between the two. He said that his comments about the "opposition party" and the "enemy of the American people" were specifically about the "fake media," not the media as a whole. This is a point that the president made in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union (ACU) last Friday in National Harbor, Maryland, just outside Washington, D. C. Hope Hicks, the director of Strategic Communications at the White House, joined in part of the conversation with the president.
