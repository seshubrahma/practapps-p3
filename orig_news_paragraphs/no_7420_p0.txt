The effort is in anticipation of   Donald Trump’s promise to enforce immigration laws. [Earlier this month, Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust wrote a letter to the Harvard community, sharing her concern at the likely effect of Trump’s policies on "students, scholars, and staff at Harvard, especially on students who are undocumented.
