Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was involved in firing Comey, recused himself from any role in the investigation in early March.   A Justice Department spokeswoman declined comment.   Rosenstein, on the job for just more than two weeks after a   Senate confirmation vote, has drawn criticism because the White House initially pinned the firing of Comey on Rosenstein, saying he had penned a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.
