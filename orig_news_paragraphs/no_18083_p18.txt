One of the "no" votes who did flip to "yes" on the AHCA is Rep.   Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania. Barletta’’s signature issue is   illegal immigration (he’’s opposed) and he said he couldn’’t vote   for the AHCA because he didn’’t have sufficient assurance that   unauthorized immigrants wouldn’’t get insurance tax credits.    Barletta changed his position once he was promised Trump would   support his legislation to address the issue. ’ ’
