Her trusted friend and adviser all these years was Choi   whose family had befriended her while her father was still in power. After becoming president, Ms. Park has said that she continued to rely on Ms. Choi to look after her wardrobe and other personal affairs. Prosecutors said Ms. Choi did far more than that, and they have indicted her on extortion and other charges. While Ms. Park cannot be indicted while she holds office, the indictment of Ms. Choi identified Ms. Park as a criminal  accomplice, a first for a president.
