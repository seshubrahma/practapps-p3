I like the point of America, that it is diverse   â€”   not a reactionary idea of an America that happened after the fact. When, say, you do a long segment on "Last Week Tonight" about the importance of the   fiduciary rule, and then Trump signs an executive order that could put a halt to it, does that frustrate you?
