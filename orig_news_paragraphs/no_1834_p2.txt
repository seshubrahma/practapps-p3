Research has shown that even in the digital age, endorsements by newspaper editorial boards still sway some minds. Their influence is greatest when the choice is unexpected, such as when The San Diego   came out in favor of Hillary Clinton, the first Democrat to be backed for president in the paperâ€™s   history. In such cases, roughly 5 percent of readers can be persuaded to switch their votes, said Brian G. Knight, a professor of economics at Brown University, who has studied newspaper endorsements. The effect is also likely amplified on questions further down the ballot, Dr. Knight said.
