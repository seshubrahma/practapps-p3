How’d you like to be running a presidential campaign dependent on Muslims not acting up again between now and Nov. 8? It’s getting awfully hard for the media to keep being indignant about Trump’s proposed Muslim ban, as long as Muslims keep blowing things up and shooting people. [I’m assuming here that The Washington Post has not already ruled the Muslims who blew up the Istanbul Airport to be   gays infected by America’s culture of homophobia.   It turns out, Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub shooter, also wasn’t a   gay, despite media excitement over that rumor.
