Cruz looks to be   in Texas. The challenge for him is that a lot of other states are also on the slate for Super Tuesday," said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a statement released with the poll. Additionally, almost half of respondents who said they voted early (44%) cast a ballot for Cruz. In a hypothetical   matchup against Trump and Rubio, Cruz beats them handily with 43% of the vote.
