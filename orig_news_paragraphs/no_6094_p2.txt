At the same time the White House announced Flynn’s resignation, it also announced that Flynn’s chief of staff at the National Security Council, retired Lt. Gen. Joseph Kellogg, is filling in for Flynn as the acting National Security Adviser. Kellogg is a former commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division and was the director of the Pentagon’s Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Directorate and was a senior leader in the Coalition Provisonal Authority in Iraq. He retired from the Army in 2003.
