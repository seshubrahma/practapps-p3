Police identified the woman as Alyssa Elsman, a resident of Portage, Michigan.   The driver of the 2009 Honda Accord    Richard Rojas, 26, of the Bronx    tested positive for PCP and told police that God made him do it, a law enforcement source told CNN. The suspect, who suffered from "psychological issues," told police he expected officers to shoot him, according to the source. Rojas has been arrested twice in New York    in 2015 and 2008    for drunken driving, New York Police Commissioner James Oâ€™Neill said.
