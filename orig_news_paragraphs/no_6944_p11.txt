I partner with brands I trust and with people who share my same values. That means a commitment to diversity, inclusion, community,   and some serious hard work. But it doesn’t mean that I or my team will always agree with the opinion of everyone who works there, including its executives. Great leaders inspire and galvanize the masses during turbulent times, they don’t cause people to divide and disband.
