Please note that being good for GE is not necessarily bad for America, but it also is not necessarily good. What is good for America is a vibrant, middle class with expanding opportunities where the people have hope that their children will have better lives than they had.   That is the American dream, and it is being squashed like a bug under the weight of taxes, regulations, and our nationâ€™s trade policy. Williamson and the National Review can somehow attempt to make the moral case for why countries like Vietnam and Malaysia should be given best on the card tariff rates to sell goods manufactured in a virtual slave labor environment based upon the cost savings to American consumers as is the case in the   Partnership.
