Trump has named New York lawyer David Friedman as his ambassador to Israel, pending Senate confirmation.   Among the options being considered are for Friedman to begin work Jerusalem, either from a hotel suite or a designated office in the US consulate.   Friedman, who already maintains a home in Jerusalem, has long been a proponent of moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and, upon being named, said he looked forward to working "from the US Embassy in Israel’s eternal capital, Jerusalem."  The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act calls on the US to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocate the embassy there. But the law allows for the move to be waived if the President deems it harmful to US national security interests.
