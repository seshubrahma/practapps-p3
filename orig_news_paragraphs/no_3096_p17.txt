Capehart did push the claim that white   support for Trump is based on mere nostalgia for prior decades, not on a rational hope that Trump’s   policies are better than the Democrats’   immigration policies, and might even revive struggling American communities in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and other states.   Gest did not suggest any political fixes for   immigration or global trade, saying: For many white working class people, and this is going to be controversial, for many white working class people, not all of them but many, you have a community of people who are advanced in age, whose skill set is for a different economy, who are living in communities that are losing population, losing resources, and so in many ways, the only way of addressing their plight is a form of political hospice care. These are communities that are on the paths to death, and the question is how can we make that as comfortable as possible   …     Gest inadvertently admitted that the targets of his pity, white   communities, actually have a broader,   view of their economic circumstances, saying: How can we truly ‘level the playing field’?
