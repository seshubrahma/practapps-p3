Clinton also pushed her goal of achieving a National Service force of volunteers, much like a civilian National Reserve, and said that those who volunteer to serve will be granted student loan forgiveness. Chelsea Clinton also said she hopes, as president, her mother will be able to bring about automatic voter registration when Americans turn 18 "to encourage more participation" in elections. Clinton said young people ask her continually about criminal justice reform, student loan debt, and climate change, and they should be able to automatically vote when they turn 18 for leaders who will do whatâ€™s right on these issues. With the emphasis still on mothers and children, Clinton and her daughter talked about the importance of federal investment in   care and pregnancy care, stating that more women are dying during pregnancy, labor, and immediately after childbirth.
