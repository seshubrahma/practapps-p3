While support for the deal crumbled within the Democratic Party, the largely   trade Republican coalition began to rally around Trump, who has for years railed against free trade deals and cited the US trade deficit as a cause for concern. Quickly after taking office, Trump pulled the US out of the deal. Several member countries said in turn that they would have to abandon the TPP on their end as well, and Trump has said he will pursue bilateral trade agreements as well as a review of NAFTA. Bringing jobs back, Trump has leaned into a few companies since the election, saying he is using his position to stop companies from   jobs and getting contractors to cut back on their prices.
