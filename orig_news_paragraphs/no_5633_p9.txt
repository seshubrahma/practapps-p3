The district is Republican leaning but not Republican invincible: Trump carried the district in 2016, but only by 1. 5 percentage points, compared to, say, the neighboring 9th Congressional District, which Trump carried by 58 percentage points. Ossoff does not live in the 6th Congressional District, but voters shrug. 84% of Democrats and 21% of Republicans say the residency doesnâ€™t bother them. Karen Handel does not have a college degree, but voters shrug.
