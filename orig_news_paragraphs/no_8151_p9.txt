NEW YORK, July 25, 2016  —    Milo Yiannopoulos’s planned trip to Sweden this week to participate in "Pride Järva," a gay pride parade through Stockholm’s Muslim ghetto, has been cancelled, following an intensive security review and threat assessment by Breitbart’s security team, comprised of former United States Navy SEALs and Intelligence community operatives. The security analysis found significant potential threats against Milo, especially in light of the recent wave of Muslim terror attacks across Europe.
