A senior administration official insisted Friday that the White House isn’t having trouble filling the role. The official said the administration is making a final decision and is talking to a few other people, saying there are one to two others beyond Kellogg and Petraeus who are in the mix. When asked why the administration won’t just name Kellogg, the official responded "there’s everything right with Kellogg."
