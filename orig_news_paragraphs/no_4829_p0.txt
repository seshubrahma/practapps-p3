Sunday on ABC’s "This Week," Trump senior advisor Stephen Miller said the White House had provided "enormous evidence" to make a case there was a "serious problem" of voter fraud in American elections.   Miller said, "I actually, having worked on a campaign before in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone working in New Hampshire politics. It’s very real, very serious. This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence.
