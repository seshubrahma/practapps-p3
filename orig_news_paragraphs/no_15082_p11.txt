Russia has claimed Tuesdayâ€™s deaths in Khan Sheikhoun were caused by a Syrian regime airstrike on a   chemical weapons facility.   Syria has given a murky account of what happened, but denies deliberately carrying out a chemical attack and blames "terrorist groups" for the deaths. Lavrov said he supported a "thorough and impartial" investigation.    tensions rise, Haley on Friday warned that the United States was prepared to take further action in Syria, but the Trump administration has refused to be drawn on what those next steps would be.
