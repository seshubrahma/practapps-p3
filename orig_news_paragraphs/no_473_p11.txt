The system, which China says is an American attempt to interfere with Chinaâ€™s nuclear deterrent, "will undermine the strategic balance," he said. China has threatened South Korea with economic consequences if it agrees to the deployment of the system, known as Thaad, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. With the South Korean government in disarray and a presidential election coming there, the Chinese government has been wooing the opposition Minjoo Party, which opposes the Thaad deployment. Officials of that   party have visited Beijing twice in recent months, offering reassurances that they oppose the system.
