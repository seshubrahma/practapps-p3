The tensions between police departments and the communities they serve have consumed much of the president’s time over the past week. He traveled to Dallas Tuesday for a memorial service held after five police officers were gunned down. Later he gathered law enforcement professionals at the White House for talks on how to improve relations between officers and citizens. In remarks following that meeting, Obama warned that the violence wasn’t likely to immediately end.
