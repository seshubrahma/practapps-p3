" s Alabama state prosecutors were trying Henry Hays, the segregationist turned   activist and Southern Poverty Law Center founder Morris Dees was hatching a plan to go after the United Klans of America as a whole, by trying them to the killing and suing them in civil court. The UKA was involved in many of the most infamous racist crimes of the   era, from the beating of freedom riders, to the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, to the assassination of the   activist Viola Liuzzo. The idea, Leamer wrote, was that Dees would accuse the UKA of having a mock military structure, meaning that the killing of Michael Donald was an act encouraged by the groupâ€™s leader Robert Shelton, making the UKA itself liable.
