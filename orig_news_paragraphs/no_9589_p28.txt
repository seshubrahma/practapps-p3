you name it, Donald Trump has made no bones about liking the phrase Merry Christmas, he said it in front of Christmas Trees as part of his victory tour. Contrast this with President Obama, whose traditional presidential Christmas cards donâ€™t even say Christmas on them this year. President Obama is also only the fourth President to have his own picture on the Christmas card. The previous ones are Herbert Hoover, FDR, and Bill  Hillary Clinton.
