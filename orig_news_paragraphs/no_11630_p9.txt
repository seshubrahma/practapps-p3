Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2016,   Reuters reports that Trump’s campaign message of railing against political corruption has been embraced at Trump rallies: Trump’s crowd chanted "Lock her up!" at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania after he declared Clinton a "corrupt globalist," a reference to campaign documents released by WikiLeaks in which Clinton was quoted advocating free trade and open borders. Yet beyond just his supporters, Trump’s message that the political system is rigged and corrupt has similarly been echoed by his detractors on the other side of the aisle. For instance,   progressive and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein and her party have repeatedly attacked the "rigged" and corrupt system that was stacked in favor of Clinton against Sanders.
