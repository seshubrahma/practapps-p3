After meeting Mr. Trump in November, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he was "especially pleased at his very positive reaction to the idea that Sir Winston Churchill’s bust should be put back in the Oval Office".   mayor Boris Johnson famously criticised Mr. Obama’s decision to remove the bust in an article for the Sun, suggesting the decision was fuelled by Mr. Obama’s "ancestral dislike of the British Empire". On Friday night, news reports circulated that a bust of Mr. Luther King had been removed from the Oval Office.
