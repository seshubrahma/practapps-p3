Mr. Trump and his family headed in the opposite direction of the march in Washington for the National Prayer Service, an inaugural tradition, at the National Cathedral. When he spoke at C. I. A. headquarters in Langley, Va. in the midafternoon, he told his audience that they were his "No. 1 stop" on his first full day in office, because they were "really special amazing people. " He also ruminated about how big the attendance had been at his inaugural speech, but he did not mention the large crowds of the womenâ€™s march, where demonstrators were challenging his administration on a number of policies, or even that the march was taking place as he was speaking.
