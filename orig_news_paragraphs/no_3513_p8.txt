After President Obama announced his "normalization" measures, however, Morales was arrested for setting up animated characters like Santa Claus and Mickey Mouse on the roof of his family home. Cuba is an atheist state that has persecuted and tortured Christians since the 1960s and only allowed leftist Liberation Theologists and Jesuit Catholics to operate unperturbed on the island in recent years. Evangelical Christians, Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses, and   Adventists are especially subject to arrest and other state abuse.   @CubanetNoticias,  January 2016
