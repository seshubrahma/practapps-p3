In the hours after the deadline, the authorities made 10 arrests but said they would not fully empty the camp on Wednesday night. Roughly 25 to 50 demonstrators were believed to remain in the mandatory evacuation zone, said Gov. Doug Burgum, who said cleaning crews planned to enter the camp Thursday morning. " Anyone who obstructs our ability to do cleanup will be subject to arrest," Mr. Burgum said.
