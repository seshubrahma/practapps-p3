As has been widely reported, donors to the Clinton Foundation asked for and received private meetings with Ms. Clinton while she was secretary of state. The Clinton Foundation also helped arrange multimillion dollar investments in an environmentally friendly business in which several Clinton friends and people with strong Democratic Party ties had also invested, according to the Wall Street Journal.   As has also been widely reported, the Trump Foundation made contributions to numerous charities favored by his personal or business associates including, ironically, the Clinton Foundation in 2009 and 2010. The Trump Foundation also has received all of its financial support since 2008 from people other than Mr. Trump and his family, and who have personal and business ties with him, including NBCUniversal.
