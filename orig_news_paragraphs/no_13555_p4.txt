Since October 1, 3, 542 refugees have been resettled in the United States from Syria, an annualized rate of more than 14, 000, an increase from the 12, 500 resettled in FY 2016. During that same time period, 3, 474 refugees have been resettled from Somalia, an annualized rate of slightly less than 14, 000, which is a significant increase from the 9, 020 resettled in FY 2016. The Obama administration has continued to place the greatest number of Syrian refugees in Michigan, a politically tone deaf act given the role opposition to refugee resettlement played in   Trumpâ€™s upset victory there in November. Three hundred and   Syrian refugees have been resettled in Michigan since October 1, more than in any other state in the country.
