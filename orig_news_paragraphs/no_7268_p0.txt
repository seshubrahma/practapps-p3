Dr. Sam Wang, founder of the Princeton Election Consortium, proved he is a man of his word on Saturday when he ate a bug on CNN. ["Itâ€™s totally over. If Trump wins more than 240 electoral votes, I will eat a bug," Wang tweeted on October 18.   On CNN last Saturday, three days before the election, Wang doubled down on that promise.
