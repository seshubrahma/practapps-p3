Spilling over to the campaign trail, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump posted his condolences to his Twitter feed Friday morning.   "Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country," the real estate mogul wrote, a somber and measured statement from a candidate who has been an outspoken advocate for law enforcement throughout his campaign. He later sent a longer statement citing, "senseless, tragic deaths of two motorists in Louisiana and Minnesota," a reference to the two black men killed earlier this week at the hands of law enforcement.   Others political figures blamed Obama for what they saw as rhetoric that led to police violence.
