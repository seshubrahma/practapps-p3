and it was Trump who barnstormed America giving perhaps one of the most detailed policy visions a presidential candidate has in generations. Trump toured the country during the GOP primaries and the general election giving policy speech after speech. In the general election, Trumpâ€™s policy speeches focused on everything from immigration to trade to healthcare to revving up the economy to rebuilding the military to infrastructure planning to inner city development to law and order crime combating measures to national security to foreign policy to the economy and more. Clinton gave exactly zero policy speeches in the general election.
