The contrast between the treatment of Egypt by the Trump and Obama administrations could not be more stark. Whereas President Barack Obama and his team did not hesitate to welcome the Muslim Brotherhoodâ€™s takeover of Egypt, while summarily dismissing former President Hosni Mubarak, the current administration is debating whether to go so far as to label the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. President Trump spoke on Tuesday night with King Abdullah II of Jordan, as part of his strategy to strengthen relationships with leaders of Muslim countries ahead of his Middle East visit, the Washington Times reported. In the phone call, Trump and King Abdullah reportedly reaffirmed the need for U. S.  coordination in   operations generally, the effort to end the civil war in Syria, and the shared fight against the Islamic State, the White House said.
