Washington (CNN) A recent Department of Homeland Security intelligence assessment found that most   violent extremists do not arrive in the US radicalized, but become radicalized after living in the US for several years. Such findings seem to undercut the Trump administrationâ€™s case for its travel ban and track with other studies, including one by the New America Foundation, that find no clear connection with violent attacks or attempts in the US and travel from certain countries. Work on the assessment, which was first reported by MSNBC Thursday night and confirmed by a DHS spokesman to CNN Friday morning, began in August.
