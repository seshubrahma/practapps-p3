American forces have so far refrained from engaging Russian aircraft after they’ve performed maneuvers like buzzing Navy ships. But Stoffer indicated retaliation could be possible in the future.

But he could see a scenario in which a US commander greenlights alternative responses like jamming the aircraft’s radar and avionics systems    which could cause the aircraft to crash.
