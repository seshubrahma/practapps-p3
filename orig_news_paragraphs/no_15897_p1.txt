Also known as persistent vegetative state, the syndrome’s symptoms include no voluntary movement or awareness of surroundings. Warmbier opens his eyes and blinks spontaneously but shows no signs of understanding language or responding to verbal commands, said Dr. Daniel Kanter, professor of neurology and director of the Neurocritical Care Program. The news shed light on the Warmbier family’s statement that their son suffered severe brain damage at some point in his 17 months of detention. His parents said they learned of their son’s condition    what North Korea called a coma    only last week.
