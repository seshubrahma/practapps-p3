Hameed, 39, lost his legs in 2009, when the Islamic State of Iraq    the precursor to ISIS    planted a bomb under the driver’s seat of his car.   Earlier that day he had attended a farewell ceremony for the US Marines outside his native city of Falluja. The blast was revenge for Hameed’s work with the Marines and Iraqi police in what, during the American occupation of Iraq, was Iraq’s deadliest city.   During his long recovery, Hameed realized he had to leave his homeland.
