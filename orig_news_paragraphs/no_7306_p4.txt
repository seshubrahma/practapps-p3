Fazeli, who also went by the names Abu Nawaf and Abu Abdullah   was killed on Jan. 23, 2015, in a battle near Ras Baalbek in Lebanon as part of an Islamic State attack force of about 150 that was thwarted by the Lebanese army. Those details, which were never revealed publicly before, were contained in an affidavit filed in U. S. District Court in Portland last Oct. 27 by Maine State Police Detective George Loder, who was acting as a member of an FBI task force investigating whether other people were aware of Fazeli’s plans to fight for the Islamic State, helped him travel to the    area or supported his efforts there. The affidavit remained under seal during the investigation, which ended with no criminal charges. The Press Herald reports that "[t]he affidavit gives the accounts of four anonymous informants for the FBI who described how Fazeli’s behavior began to change about a year after he came to the Portland area through Catholic Charities Refugee and Immigration Services.
