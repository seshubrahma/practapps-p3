Trump won over and above the number of electoral college votes needed to secure the highest office in the land. Schwilk told Breitbart News at the rally that he and others decided to organize the rally to counter the swell of   protests and in an effort to honor the military on Veterans Day. During his campaign, Trump criticized the shrinking size of the Army, Navy and Air Force under President Barack Obama and aging Air Force aircraft. He rolled out plans to rebuild the U. S. military, provide the Air Force with "the 1, 200 fighter aircraft they need" and increase the number of Navy ships.
