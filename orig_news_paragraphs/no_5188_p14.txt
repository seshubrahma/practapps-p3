"Any policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven with   …     the conduct of foreign relations, the war power, and the maintenance of a republican form of government. Such matters are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference. "  —    Shaughnessy v. Mezei (1953)
