This marks the first time in 36 years that a sitting president has not attended and spoken at the White House correspondentsâ€™ dinner. President Ronald Reagan missed the dinner while recovering in the hospital from an assassination attempt, but he still made remarks by phone. Richard Nixon was the last president to skip the dinner completely. The last time Trump attended the dinner was in 2011, when he was a New York real estate mogul and reality TV star who had just jumped into politics by getting involved in the "birther" movement, calling for President Barack Obama to release his birth certificate.
