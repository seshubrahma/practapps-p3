" I would like to express my hope that after the administration of Donald Trump assumes its duties, it will also join the efforts in order to channel this work into one direction basing on friendly and collective cooperation," Mr. Lavrov said during a meeting Thursday with Mr. Putin. A Trump administration could become involved in future diplomatic talks, from which Secretary of State John Kerry was excluded in recent months. It could "coordinate" with the Russians militarily, something Mr. Obamaâ€™s defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, has resisted.
