North Korea’s announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet. The test Tuesday was followed by a US show of force, as the Pentagon on Wednesday flew two   bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, setting the the stage for   Korea joint military exercises in October that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike. The heightened tensions, North Korea’s steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the Pentagon on notice.   "North Korea’s unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland," Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Maryland.
