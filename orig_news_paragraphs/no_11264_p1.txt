" Since the passage of TPA —  during which time the text of TPP was kept in a hidden basement classified reading room in the U. S. Capitol where only members of Congress could go to see it in person, without taking notes or copies of the text with them —  in 2015, TPP has been on hold.   and TiSA text, save for a leak of draft TiSA materials to WikiLeaks, have been unavailable even to members of Congress never mind the public.
