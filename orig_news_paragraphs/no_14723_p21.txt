Why Iraq was removed, But the new order was also delayed in part because of a debate within the administration over how to handle Iraq. Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and national security adviser Gen. H. R. McMaster had all advocated for Iraq to be removed from the Trump administration’s list of banned countries in the new executive order for diplomatic reasons, including Iraq’s role in fighting ISIS, sources told CNN’s Elise Labott and Evan Perez. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly also supported the move.
