Trump was also a   favorite, according to the prediction website FiveThirtyEight. There were signs that Trumpâ€™s Kansas lead was not as secure as pollsters suggested, given his decision to skip the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in order to campaign in The Sunflower State. Before Super Saturday, Cruz trailed Trump in total delegates, 319 to 226.   On Friday, at CPAC, Cruz made the case that he was the lone Republican candidate remaining who can take on and defeat Trump.
