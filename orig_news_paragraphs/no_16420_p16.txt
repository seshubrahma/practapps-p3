Previously, Trump had moved beyond his call to ban all foreign Muslims from the US and proposed barring all individuals from countries "compromised by terrorism"    though he has not specified which countries match that criterion. While his campaign staff and surrogates have sought to describe the ban on individuals from terror states as a rollback of Trump’s blanket ban on Muslim immigration, Trump characterized it on NBC’s "Meet the Press" as an "expansion" and has yet to refute his original proposal. While Trump had not been expected to list on Monday which countries’ citizens would be banned from the US, the senior campaign official offered Syria and Libya as examples of two countries that would be affected by the ban. The official called on the State Department to release a list of individuals who had obtained visas to the US since 2001 who have since "been charged, implicated or accused of terrorism" in order to determine which countries should be banned.
