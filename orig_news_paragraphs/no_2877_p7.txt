The drop in the unemployment rate from a recent high of 10 percent to 4. 6 percent was helped along by millions of people stepping away from the labor force entirely. The council notes that part of that is a result of people hitting retirement age, but also that there has been an enormous decline in the percentage of   men working, which goes back decades. In 1953, 3 percent of      men were neither working nor looking for work thatâ€™s now 12 percent.
