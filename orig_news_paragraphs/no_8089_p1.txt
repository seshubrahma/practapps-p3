Responding favorably to the names put forward by Trump, Klukowski began, "This list includes some incredible conservatives, from Diane Sykes on the federal Seventh Circuit, to Tom Lee on the Utah Supreme Court, to David Straus on the Minnesota Supreme Court, to Don Willet on the Texas Supreme Court. " The list included three former law clerks of Justice Clarence Thomas, the most conservative justice currently serving on the Supreme Court. Trump later told the public that he was going to add names to the list, which led some optimistic conservative legal experts to hope that he would add names such as Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Mike Lee, or former U. S. Solicitor General Paul Clement.
