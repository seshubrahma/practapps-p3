The only question is by how much. Easing some regulations could foster the building of oil and natural gas pipelines across the country. That, in turn, could stimulate more drilling in certain basins, like the Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania. In addition, relaxing restrictions on flaring methane and hydraulic fracturing on federal lands could help some producers increase production.
