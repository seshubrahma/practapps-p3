In Niger, where women have an average of seven children apiece, UNFPA works where few others do: The group runs "husband schools" to help educate men about getting their children in school, being respectful of their wives and spacing pregnancies so their wives and babies don’t die.   In Nigeria, UNFPA is in refugee camps, tending to girls who have been kidnapped, raped and often impregnated by Boko Haram militants. But despite caring for so many rape victims, a UNFPA spokeswoman told me last year, they don’t offer abortions.
