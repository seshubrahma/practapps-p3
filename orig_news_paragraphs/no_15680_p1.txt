Reuters first reported that Tillerson declined to host an event for Ramadan. Since 1999, Tillerson’s five Republican and Democratic predecessors have hosted either an Iftar dinner to break the fast during Ramadan, or an Eid   reception at the end of the   holiday. Many diplomatic posts overseas also host events during Ramadan’s month of fasting and prayer. The White House and State Department commemorate other religious traditions, including a Jewish Passover Seder, as well as Christmas and Easter holidays.
