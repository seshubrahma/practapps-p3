It was Rubioâ€™s largest haul of delegates since Super Tuesday on March 1st. Rubio is a distant third in the overall race for delegates and faces a    contest in his home state of Florida on Tuesday. Kasich faces a similar situation in Ohio that day. Both candidates will be happy to secure the delegates from DC.
