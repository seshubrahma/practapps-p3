Earlier, Mr. Obama and his aides also decided against eliminating one element of the "triad" of     and   weapons. The idea was to remove the missiles based in silos across the American West, which are considered outdated and vulnerable to a first strike. But the Pentagon argued strongly that the   missiles were the part of the system with which they had the most assured communications, and that it was too risky to get rid of them. In the past year, arms control advocates, including some of Mr. Obamaâ€™s former aides, have argued that Mr. Obama still has time to repair his reputation as an atomic visionary.
