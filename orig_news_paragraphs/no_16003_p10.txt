For the UK, it’s not just the EU exit that could cause Britain’s influence to wane. If Europhile Scotland now holds a second independence vote, the power of Washington’s old ally could be further splintered. Britain has been a traditional U. S. partner on efforts to stabilize Afghanistan and cooperate in the Middle East on issues ranging from Iran’s nuclear program to   peace and the scourge of ISIS. One outcome of the Brexit vote could be "less help from the UK and other NATO allies in the Middle East and elsewhere," said Daniel Serwer, director of the Conflict Management Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
