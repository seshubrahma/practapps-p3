Ahead of President Donald Trump’s birthday on June 14, we’re taking a #FlashbackFriday look at a very memorable presidential birthday from the past.   In the photo above from the the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum’s collection, you can see Roosevelt    or in the spirit of the festivities, Caesar Roosevelt    seated before a   birthday cake, draped in a cape and crowned with a laurel. Roosevelt is surrounded by   revelers, including his wife, Eleanor, and some soldiers. Casual.
