Among Libertarian Party activists, a number express hope that Johnson will mature and become more substantial at the Town hall and in the rest of the campaign, and that Governor Weld will provide an influence in that direction. Johnson has been known to engage in dramatic humor some of his supporters are hoping he tones that down during this campaign. Others are hoping the   campaign will release substantial white papers on issues including education, budgets and taxes, entitlements, and foreign and military policy. In 1980, Libertarian presidential candidate Ed Clark did that, with many papers written by people, like Peter Ferraro, who went on to become   experts in the conservative movement.
