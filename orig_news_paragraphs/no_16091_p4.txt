"  Defending the brutal Iraqi dictator who killed hundreds of thousands of his own people isn’t exactly fashionable. But if you consider the 13 years of war that have wracked the country    in which a quarter of a million have died    and add that Saddam brutally repressed all dissent, including groups such as al Qaeda, and also add to this that ISIS is itself a fruit of the Iraq War , it’s a far more defensible position.     Trump didn’t offer any evidence for his assertions about Saddam’s brutal repression of terrorist groups or of Saddam "killing terrorists," but his observations about the dictator are an implicit critique of the George W. Bush administration’s erroneous claims before the Iraq War that Saddam was allied to al Qaeda.
