Tuesday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," host Joe Scarborough suggested that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s remarks regarding her opponent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s being a "basket of deplorable" may have some truth to it.   According to Scarborough, Clinton’s comments might have been a purposeful strategy and explained why he thought so, citing polling data about what Trump supporters believe. " I said this at the end of the day could be strategic," Scarborough said.
