Oakland County, Michigan is one such ignored county government. The affluent suburb of Detroit, population 1. 2 million, has been inundated with refugees over the past several years without its consent. As Breitbart News reported previously, over 486 refugees from Iraq were resettled in Oakland County in FY 2015, and another 408 refugees from Syria (more than forty states) and 329 refugees from Iraq have been resettled in Oakland County in FY 2016 as of September 14, with two more weeks to go in the fiscal year. As Breitbart News reported previously, Michigan is the state with second highest number of resettled Syrian refugees in FY 2016 to date, and the highest per capita rate.
