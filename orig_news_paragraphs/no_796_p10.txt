brands from Gatorade to Tiffany have run campaigns on the social network, and the advertising titan WPP said at an industry conference on Wednesday that it spent $90 million on Snapchat ads last year. Snap has come a long way from its beginnings in a Stanford dorm room as a service used largely by young people enamored with sending their friends pictures and video that   after seconds. Based in the fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice, the company has since introduced ways for users to broadcast "stories" about their days to wider audiences and pioneered the use of   lenses that transform those users into dogs or Taco Bell tacos.
