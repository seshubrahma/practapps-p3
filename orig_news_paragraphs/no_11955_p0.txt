Conservative icon Sarah Palin quipped that paid   protesters show presidential candidate Donald Trump is creating jobs even before taking office as she called them out for false accusations at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado on Friday. ["Like a golden wrecking ball [Trump] shattered walls in the good ol’ boys club. He knocked out the hypocritical intolerance that dare stymie freedom of speech with intimidation and those false accusations of sexism and racism just to stop debate," said 2008 vice presidential nominee Palin. Alaska’s former governor pointed to the "silly protesters" at Trump rallies as those behind the accusations.
