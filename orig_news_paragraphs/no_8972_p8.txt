Mr. Maas’s SPD is facing its biggest challenge since the Second World War and are polling at all time lows, with SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel unsure if he will run for the position of Chancellor in federal elections next year. Mr. Gabriel was forced to deny allegations that he would be stepping down as leader following the resignation of his socialist counterpart in Austria, former Chancellor Werner Faymann, only days before. Mr. Faymann and his Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) lost huge numbers of voters, largely due to their migrant crisis policies. At the recent Austrian presidential elections the party saw one of its worst results since 1945 as Norbert Hofer, of the   migration Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) swept the first round of elections.
