Rubio has not made New Hampshire a focus of his campaign, but his campaign is under pressure to have a strong showing in an individual state somewhere. Rubio isnâ€™t intensively campaigning in any individual state, apparently choosing to run a national campaign, hoping to survive until other candidates drop out. The risk for Rubio is that he will fade in each early state as other candidates step up their campaign activity. At some point, Rubio will have to make a stand in one of the early states to show he has the fortitude and temperament to run a general election campaign.
