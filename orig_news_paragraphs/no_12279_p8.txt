The regulation also helps foreign professionals to change jobs, and it allows   professionals to stay longer than six years.

" DHS estimates in the [regulation’s notes] that there will be about 92, 600 dependent spouses and children that may be eligible for [one new feature, the] compelling circumstances employment authorization in the first year (the year with the largest number of eligible applicants) which represents approximately 0. 06 percent of the overall U. S. civilian labor force," according to the regulation.   Currently, at least 100, 000 new   workers arrive each year, and many thousands more get permanent Green Cards.
