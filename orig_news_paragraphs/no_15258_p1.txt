We’re working in a bipartisan manner, we’re going to be thorough, professional and meticulous," House Russia investigation leader Mike Conaway told CNN on Wednesday. Conaway added that he is in discussions to get access to the   intelligence typically reserved for the "Gang of Eight" in Congress, but he declined to elaborate. Conaway and Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead Democrat on the investigation, met and agreed on a likely witness schedule, culled from a witness list that investigators say includes   dozen names. Conaway told House intelligence committee members Tuesday that they should plan on spending more time in Washington as the investigation gears up.
