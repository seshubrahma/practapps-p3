None of our names sounded it, none of us fit that profile Islamophobes have    the maintenance guy from Montenegro, the waitress of Lebanese origin, the Turkish couple, the Egyptian siblings, the old black Muslim families who’ve been in Harlem for decades, the other Iranian woman who is a student where I teach. And of course, me, who passes for everything, with the additional complication of a Zoroastrian name. For the last few years, I’ve been joking I’m a Secret Muslim. Iranian nationalism and exceptionalism always steered my father    the man who named me "Porochista," after Zoroaster’s daugher    far away from discussions of Islam.
