Gladwell: In "Tipping Point," there’’s a chapter   trying to explain the fall of crime in New York City. I talk   quite positively about the broken windows theory [which states   that cracking down on small crimes prevents larger crimes]. And   that was written at a time, the late 1990s, where that idea was   very much en vogue.
