Vito Maggiolo, a spokesman for DC Fire, told CNN he was unable to provide further details about the incident. Majid Rafique, a spokesman for the chauffeur company, said it was not clear how much it was going to cost the company to replace the limo, saying he was waiting for the insurance companyâ€™s assessment. Villarroel, who has driven a limo for 25 years, only suffered a minor cut on his finger during the incident but was otherwise unharmed. By Saturday, he was back at work, driving a bus for the company.
