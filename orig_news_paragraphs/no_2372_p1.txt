Early this month, I went to Toledo, Ohio, to meet with Hillary Clinton, to sit down with her for a while and take the measure of her ordeal. It was five weeks before an unnervingly   Election Day. Every campaign produces candidates declaring that "the most important election of our lifetimes" is at hand. Usually this is true only for the person running (no doubt 2012 was the most important election of Mitt Romney’s lifetime).
