A 2011 email exchange between   of State Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin shows that both women had personal knowledge of reports from State Department that the Saudis and UAE were spending an estimated $100, 000, 000 a year funding the spread of the Sunni Wahhabism that drives all the world’s major Islamist terrorism. The email from Huma Abedin was dated Sunday, May 22, 2011, 08:04 AM and it quoted a Reuters story: Islamic charities from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates financed a network in U. S. ally Pakistan that recruited children as young as eight to wage holy war, a local newspaper reported on Sunday, citing Wikileaks. A U. S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks said financial support estimated at $100 million a year was making its way from those Gulf Arab states to a jihadist recruitment network in Pakistan’s Punjab province, Dawn newspaper reported. The November 2008 dispatch by Bryan Hunt, the then principal officer at the U. S. consulate in Lahore, was based on discussions with local government and   sources during trips to Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province.
