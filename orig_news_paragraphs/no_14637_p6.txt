For example, Section 5( b) of the current executive order    which remains on hold for now    arguably prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities. But if the new executive order strikes all or part of Section 5, how will the administration defend keeping that provision in the pending lawsuits over the first executive order?   In other words, legal experts question how the Justice Department will be able to successfully argue that provision is indispensable for national security in one court when the plaintiffs will be able to point to a new executive order in which it is missing or modified. Continued litigation over the original executive order will be further complicated by the fact that it remains blocked by several different federal courts, in different ways and on different grounds.
