The bill provides an exemption for any person who is a victim of or a witness to a criminal offense. The bill would also penalize the institutions for providing any public benefit including   tuition. " It is the sense of the Congress that providing the public benefit of   tuition to an alien who lacks lawful immigration status in the United States creates an incentive for illegal immigration and encourages and induces aliens to come to, enter," Hunter wrote in the bill.
