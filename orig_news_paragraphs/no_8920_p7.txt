Only Trump has shown the daring necessary to challenge Clinton’s   advantages. Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) who in theory is the most "electable" Republican in the field, for example, declined to target Clinton over her role in her husband’s scandals. Trump, in contrast, released an ad featuring not only Monica Lewinsky, but also Anthony Weiner. He claims credit for Hillary’s slump in the polls against Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) and he is partly right.
