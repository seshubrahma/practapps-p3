A spokesman for the   command in Baghdad said that the Russian airstrikes took place about 10 miles southwest of Manbij. The Russian bombing stopped after American military officers at the air war command in Qatar called their Russian counterparts in Syria. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry asserted that the United States had provided the coordinates of   forces in northern Syria before the airstrikes and that Russian and Syria warplanes had not struck any areas that had been properly designated.
