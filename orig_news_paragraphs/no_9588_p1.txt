The photo rather unsubtly reinforces the meme of "Little Marco," Donald Trump’s disdainful nickname for Rubio, who seemed to emerge as a    rival before a weak finish in Saturday’s electoral contests.   The headline links to an Associated Press analysis of the Super Saturday fallout, where Rubio gets some brief mentions —  primarily referring to calls for his campaign’s suspension. Trump himself said it is time for Rubio to exit the race, and Lindsey Graham said Rubio and John Kasich need to evaluate their chances realistically. The story also mentions that former Governor Mitt Romney declined to rule out his own nomination at a brokered convention during an appearance Sunday morning on NBC’s Meet the Press.
