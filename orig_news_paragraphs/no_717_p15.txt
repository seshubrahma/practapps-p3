The stories that Russia labeled "fake news" were certainly more mainstream fare. The initial offerings included five articles from various large organizations including The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Daily Telegraph and NBC News.

Seemingly borrowing a practice from President Trump, Russia appears to be labeling as fake any articles it dislikes.
