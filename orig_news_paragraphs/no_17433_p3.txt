Charter schools are publicly funded and independently run, in some cases operated by   companies. Sometimes, that means they don’t have to follow the district’s rules, even though they may receive funding from them. They often don’t hire unionized teachers    a distinction that has put them at odds with teacher unions.   Advocates say that freedom lets charter schools sidestep policies that lock troubled schools into a cycle of failure, and allows for a more flexible, innovative curriculum.
