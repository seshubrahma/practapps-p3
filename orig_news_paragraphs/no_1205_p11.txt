An official at Ivy Tech said on Tuesday night that it "respects and appreciates" the ruling and does not plan to appeal it to the Supreme Court. " The college denies that it discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of her sex or sexual orientation and will defend the plaintiff â€™s claims on the merits in the trial court," said the official, Jeff Fanter, the senior vice president for communication and marketing at Ivy Tech.
