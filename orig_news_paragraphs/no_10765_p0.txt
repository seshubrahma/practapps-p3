In August of 2009, tea party activists were instructed by Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Works to go to Congressional Town Halls and confront Democrat Congressmen over support of ObamaCare. [Tea Party Patriots even passed out an "action memo" to be used as a guide for tea party activists attending Congressional Town Halls.   The memo instructed activists to give Congressmen "reality checks" from "We the People" at the town halls. The activists that attended the town halls were there to intimidate Congressmen into changing their position on ObamaCare.
