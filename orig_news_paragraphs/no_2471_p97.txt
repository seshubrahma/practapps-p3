Mr. Bannon took over as executive chairman of Breitbart News in 2012 after Mr. Breitbart died, playing a   role in assigning, approving and sometimes dictating changes to articles, according to several former Breitbart employees.

They describe a decentralized operation overseen by Mr. Bannon in two conference calls a day.
