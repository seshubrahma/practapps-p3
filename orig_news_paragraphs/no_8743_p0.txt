Former U. S. presidential candidate and Senator for Kentucky Rand Paul has told Breitbart London that he believes Britain joining the European Union (EU) was a mistake from the outset. [Sen. Paul, who dropped out of the Republican nominee race in early February, made the comments as an increasing number of foreign politicians and leaders chime into the ‘Brexit’ (British exit) debate.   Britain’s EU referendum is to be held on June 23rd, and has already attracted the attention of figures such as Ambassador John Bolton, Republican front runner Donald Trump, U. S. President Barack Obama, and most recently, General David Petraeus. But unlike President Obama and Gen. Petraeus, the senator from Kentucky believes that Britain is better off out of the European Union, adding his voice to those such as Sen. Ted Cruz and Ambassador Bolton, who have questioned the consensus view that Britain is stronger and safer inside the EU.
