Breitbart News has obtained an email that Ted Cruz sent out to his supporters on the eve of the district conventions telling them to talk to the "Cruz team" at their respective convention sites to figure out their strategy for voting for Cruz delegates. Our campaign was honored to have the support over 300, 000 Georgians in the Georgia Primary on March 1st. If you supported our campaign, we humbly thank you. If you supported another candidate, I invite you to unite behind our campaign because we are the only campaign that can defeat Hillary Clinton and reignite the promise of America.
