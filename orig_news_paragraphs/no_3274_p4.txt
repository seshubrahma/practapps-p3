The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including "honor" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. The American public’s contradictory emotions slide in various directions, depending on minor changes to questions. For example, when asked by Reuters’ pollster if the U. S. should "open our borders to refugees of foreign conflicts," the percentage of respondents strongly supporting an apparently unlimited number of refugees jumped up to 19 percent, almost double the 10 percent in the prior "limit the number of refugees" question.
