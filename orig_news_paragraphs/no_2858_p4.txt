Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, called Ms. DeVos a "smart, principled   conservative who’s experienced in politics and versed in the relevant policy. " But to teachers’ unions, she is anathema. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, called Ms. DeVos "the most ideological,   education nominee" since the secretary of education was elevated to the cabinet level four decades ago.
