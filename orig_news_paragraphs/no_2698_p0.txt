Before dawn on a Sunday late last month, a battalion of pesh merga soldiers  —   about 600 Kurdish men, along with a few women   —   gathered in the shadow of Bashiqa Mountain, on the western edge of the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan. They were sons, daughters, fathers, grandfathers. They wore an assortment of camouflage fatigues and traditional Kurdish flowing pants, waist sashes and head scarves.
