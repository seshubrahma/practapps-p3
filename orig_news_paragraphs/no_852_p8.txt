Lilja Owsley uses Lyft to travel late at night from her job at a wine bar in Chelsea to her home in Bushwick, Brooklyn. " Iâ€™d rather just take an Uber or Lyft instead of waiting for the L train for 10 or 15 minutes," she said. And while   services predominantly serve Manhattan, they are spreading to parts of the city where public transit is limited and taxis are scarce.
