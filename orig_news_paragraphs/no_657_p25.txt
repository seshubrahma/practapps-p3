The group is planning a rally in Milwaukee on Feb. 25, the last weekend of the recess week, with Planned Parenthood patients from Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s district expected to testify how they would be affected if clinics lost funding. Mr. Ryan has said he would defund Planned Parenthood in any repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Still, said Nicole Safar, the group’s director of government relations in Wisconsin, "This is more about   than targeting Paul Ryan. " "
