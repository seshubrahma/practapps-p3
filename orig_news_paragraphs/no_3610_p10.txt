Other names that have been floated publicly but are not mentioned in this piece include House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and White House National Economic Council director Gary Cohn.

Cohn’s leftist tendencies, meanwhile   —   as exhibited by his comments bashing the coal industry while in Europe last month  —   are a sign that the selection of Cohn would be a setback to the administration.
