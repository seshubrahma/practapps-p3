Earlier on Thursday, Pence’s plane’s landing in Fort Dodge, Iowa, was rough and it appeared the plane bounced. The governor held a rally in Fort Dodge. After the rally, his plane had a delay because there was rain and high traffic at LaGuardia in New York City. The governor, his staff, Secret Service agents and reporters threw a football around during the delay until the plane took off again.
