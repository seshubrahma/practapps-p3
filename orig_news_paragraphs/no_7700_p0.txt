During a speech on the Supreme Court at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, MILO proclaimed that establishment conservatives who oppose Donald Trump "don’t care about America," the Supreme Court, or conservatism. [     " Even if you’re uncomfortable with some of Trump’s other policies, his rhetoric, and even his comments on the female reproductive system, this issue is the one that trumps all the others" declared MILO.
