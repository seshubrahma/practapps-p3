He strongly believes in American exceptionalism and will put American interests first. I believe Donald Trump will expand the tea party movement and will bring in millions of new activists that are needed now and for the future.   He has support among the different demographics which the tea party and conservative movement have been working very hard to attract. Because of his wide swathe of support, I believe he will easily defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
