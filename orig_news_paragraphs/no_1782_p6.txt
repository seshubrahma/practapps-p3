In the speech, Mr. Trump also accused the "Clinton machine" of wielding control over the news media, as well.

While the allegations were aimed at Mrs. Clinton, who is a Methodist, Jews have long been accused of conspiring to control institutions like banks and the media in order to amass wealth and power.
