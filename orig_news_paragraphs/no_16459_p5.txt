Trump also said in response to a question that he would not put undocumented immigrants in detention centers.   A Trump campaign source said the campaign decided to push back Trump’s immigration speech as it is still   its immigration policy and the speech’s language. As Trump prepares to wade once more into the heated immigration debate, the campaign is taking care to craft the critical speech, which the campaign absolutely wants to get right, the source said. Lydia Blaha, the spokeswoman for Trump’s Colorado campaign, also confirmed to CNN that Trump will not deliver a speech in Colorado on Thursday.
