Implementing this kind of strategy is complicated by the popular preference to rebuild at home rather than lead abroad.

A vacuum of US leadership in Asia filled by less benevolent players would take decades to reverse    and at a huge economic cost by way of lost markets and legitimacy.   Through smart and strategic economic policy, the incoming administration has the opportunity to build a firm foundation for America’s Pacific century.
