Washington (CNN) A new trade deal will allow US beef and natural gas exports to flow into China while opening up the US market for cooked poultry and Chinese banks, the US Commerce Secretary announced Thursday. The initial slate of commitments from the two countries marked the first sign of progress on the   action plan that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping called for during their meeting at Trumpâ€™s Florida estate last month. Trump made renegotiating trade terms between the United States and China a key plank of his presidential campaign, and said last month he hoped to make progress with China in the short term.
