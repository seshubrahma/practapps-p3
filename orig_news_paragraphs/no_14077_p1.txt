Ever since Franklin Roosevelt introduced the term in 1933 as he pushed through Congress one of the boldest domestic agendas that the nation had seen, 75 bills in total, these important weeks in the early history of a presidency have become a lens through which politicians and pundits view the effectiveness of a new leader.    The Hundred Day record for presidents is mixed. John F. Kennedy saw a Democratic Congress    deeply divided between conservative southern Democrats and liberal northern Democrats    stifle most of his domestic agenda, while the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba undercut the perception that many Americans had of his foreign policy competence. Ronald Reagan didnâ€™t get nearly as much done as FDR, as a Republican Senate could not overcome the opposition of a Democratic House, and in March the   assassin John Hinckley shot him, but the president was able to get a historic tax reduction moving through Congress and he deregulated oil markets through executive action.
