Two conservative students at the University of Michigan ruffled some feathers when they traveled to a Bernie Sanders rally in an effort to raise money for Donald Trump. [  Hunter Swogger and Aliceea Rice received some interesting reactions when they asked a crowd of Bernie Sanders supporters to contribute to Donald Trump’s plan to build a border wall to prevent illegal immigration. While most Bernie supporters were able to laugh off Swogger’s antics, others responded with anger and frustration. Swogger, who is the Executive Editor of the Michigan Review, remained upbeat and humorous throughout the video, despite some Sanders’ supporters spitting in his donation bucket and attempting to use it as a trash can.
