" Donald Trump has been in office for four days, and he’s already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be," said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. Mr. Trump made clear on the campaign trail that he saw Mr. Obama’s environmental policies as a threat to the economy and dismissed climate change as a hoax perpetrated by China. Myron Ebell, a climate change denier who headed Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency transition team, has drafted a   blueprint for how he could eliminate Mr. Obama’s climate change policies.
