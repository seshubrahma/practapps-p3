Now, four days later, it’s plus nine points —  after being plus four points on Monday.   At this time, 42 percent of the nation strongly approves of what President Trump is doing, while only 33 percent strongly disapprove —  and overall, 57 percent approve of the president, while just 43 percent disapprove.
