Wednesday marks the beginning of an intense day of diplomacy in Moscow for U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, notes CBS News. Russia and the United States have been condemning one another since the Trump administration bombed Assad last week. Putin has stood by allegations that the Assad regime was framed for the chemical weapons assault, that killed as many as 100 people, including at least 27 children, and wounded hundreds more.
