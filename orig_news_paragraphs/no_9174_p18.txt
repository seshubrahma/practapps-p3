You know, we’ve held the debates on college and university campuses, almost every single one since we got started in ’88.   This is a great opportunity to involve the young people in what is at the end of the day, the biggest civics education forum that’s going on.    A huge number of these seats will be given to the students of Hofstra University, which I think is just a great opportunity for them to be involved and to see this firsthand.   A live audience makes it different in terms of what the candidates are doing to whom they are speaking, and I think that it warms it up, but unlike the primary debates where there was audience participation, there is to be none here, and I think whoever is in those seats will respect that.
