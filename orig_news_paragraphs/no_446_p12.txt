The president’s actions came just hours after congressional Republicans voted to repeal an unrelated   rule, a sign that Mr. Trump will have some support on Capitol Hill to challenge a law he has called "a disaster," and promised to do "a big number" to reshape. Now emboldened, House Republicans are also moving legislation to "repeal and replace"   though they would need 60 votes to accomplish that, which seems unlikely. And they are considering potential ways to use the budget process to defund some aspects of the law, all of which comes on top of the president’s executive actions. While the president cannot unwind   with the stroke of a pen, his orders set the tone for the regulatory agencies enforcing the rules, including the Securities and Exchange Commission.
