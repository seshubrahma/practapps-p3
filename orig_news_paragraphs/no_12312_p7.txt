In the middle of the lecture, one student stood up with a sign that read, "Free Speech [does not not equal] Hate Speech," suggesting that Yiannopoulos’ lecture contained hate speech and therefore shouldn’t have been permitted on campus. In response to this, and a question from another student, Yiannopoulos told the crowd that universities should tolerate all speech and are no longer cultivating an environment where the free and open expression of ideas is promoted.   The entire event was periscoped and can be viewed here. LIVE on #Periscope:
