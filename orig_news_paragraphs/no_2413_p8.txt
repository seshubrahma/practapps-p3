The   advisory committee is made up of four women and 12 men. It will include several members of Congress Rebekah Mercer, a top Republican donor Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Anthony Scaramucci, a   manager and Trump supporter. Mr. Bannon will also serve on the committee. A political committee supporting Ms. Bondi received a $25, 000 donation from the Trump Foundation, raising questions because it was around the time her office was reviewing allegations against Mr. Trumpâ€™s   education programs.
