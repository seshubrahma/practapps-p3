They told me to get my stuff, they put me in the back of a van and sped toward the border. They took me to another facility while in transport to sign paperwork. I asked to speak with my attorney, but was told there wasnâ€™t time for that. At around 10 p. m. I was dropped off at the   border and walked into Mexico.
