In a letter to Mr. Trumpâ€™s lawyer, Ms. Glen said Trump World Tower was to be built on the site of a functioning office building, and denied him the tax break. Mr. Trump sued and a State Supreme Court judge ordered the city to review his application. After that suit stalled, he filed a second one that ended in 2003 with a settlement that granted Mr. Trump a   exemption worth $119. 5 million for the   condo, according to the Finance Department.
