By then, Mr. Panton had established himself in the private equity business in Atlanta where he is the chairman of the Jamaican Chamber of Commerce of Atlanta. Behind the scenes, Mr. Panton set up one of the first "super PACs" supporting Mr. Cruz’s campaign, donating $100, 000 to it, though it has been eclipsed by much larger ones. Since disassociating himself from the super PAC, Mr. Panton has aided his old debate partner by critiquing his performance at debate preparations, according to the person who has spoken with him. Mr. Panton also urged Mr. Cruz, with whom he remains in regular contact, to relate more emotional stories about his upbringing and his late half sister’s battle with drugs.
