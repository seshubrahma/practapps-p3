The Party Platform will be voted on in a much different way then it has ever been before. This year the Republican Party Platform will be submitted to state delegates on a Scantron sheet for voting. Delegates will also vote on the platform   . In the past, debate would center around five or six planks or so and voting on the Platform was a      proposition.
