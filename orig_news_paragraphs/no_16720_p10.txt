It is among a number of shootings in recent years that have spurred debate about how and when police should use deadly force and how race factors into whom police shoot.   Demonstrators on Saturday afternoon gathered for a fifth day in the cityâ€™s center. A diverse crowd of 200 to 300 people marched from Marshall Park after a short rally.   Even more people showed up for another protest later in the day.
