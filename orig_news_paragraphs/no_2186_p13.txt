Steven Lubet, a Northwestern University law professor and legal ethics expert, said that filing a motion to remove a judge was "rarely sought and rarely granted," not just in New York but across the country. The comments allegedly made by Justice Lowe, he said, would not be grounds for such a removal. " Those arenâ€™t remotely close to what would disqualify a judge," Mr. Lubet said.
