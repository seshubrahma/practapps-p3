Server investigation, On Wednesday, Judicial Watch released written testimony from Mills, in which she provides further detail on how Clinton’s private email server was set up to address potentially security concerns. Mills told the attorneys she spoke with a Clinton IT staffer in 2013, after learning the email account of a close Clinton confidante, Sidney Blumenthal, had been compromised by a hacker. " As I recall, these discussions involved whether this event might affect Secretary Clinton’s email," Mills said in   answers to an earlier deposition given to Judicial Watch.
