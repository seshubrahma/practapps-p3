A political newcomer, an impulsive provocateur, a man who likes total control: Mr. Trump is unlike any presidential nominee who has tried to organize and execute a convention before. For some Republicans, his fiery and   style has heightened their excitement about the   political pageant that begins Monday, while others are fearing whatâ€™s in store. These Republicans are queasy over the possibility of Mr. Trump going off   if a convention moment is not to his liking or rebellious delegates go ahead with a plan to try to block his nomination, while some are concerned that he will be   in urging speakers to attack the Clintons, immigrants or others with language that alienates undecided voters. With waves of protesters expected outside Quicken Loans Arena and more than 850 delegates inside the hall who are pledged to Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich, Mr. Trump will have only so much ability to influence the proceedings or keep the cameras away from his antagonists.
