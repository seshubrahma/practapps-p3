Republicans could retaliate by using the   "nuclear option" to lower the threshold to break a filibuster of a Supreme Court pick from 60 to 51 and easily fill this vacancy and others to come. In 2013, Democrats used the nuclear option over the objection of Republicans when they lowered the threshold to break filibusters for executive branch appointments and all other judicial nominations except the Supreme Court.   Yet some Democrats who oppose putting off a fight on Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee argue Republicans might not have the 51 votes they would need to approve the rules change, as some senior GOP senators may be reluctant to erode the effectiveness of the 60 vote filibuster, which famously preserves the power of the Senate minority.    Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,   who opposed the Democrats’ nuclear option, nevertheless has kept the option open for the Supreme Court.
