That’s a pretty close race against a candidate who has struggled in  many ways. Nate   I’d probably say 4 or 5 points, but that’s not very  . The newest data does provide reason to pause and wonder whether the race has gotten even tighter, even if the preponderance of evidence doesn’t point that way quite yet.
