Funding to states under the Brownfields program is set for a reduction of 30 percent, to $33 million from $48 million. The exact science behind, and health consequences of, a class of chemicals called endocrine disrupters remains unsettled. With the proposed cuts to research at the E. P. A. it could stay that way. The budget eliminates a $6 million research and screening effort targeting the chemicals, which are found widely in pesticides, plastics, shampoos and cosmetics, cash register receipts, food can linings and other products.
