Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Friday night that he was prepared to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Robart’s decision was met with swift denunciation by the White House    which originally called it "outrageous" before removing that word in a statement issued minutes later    and Trump himself, who blasted the judge personally Saturday morning. " The opinion of this   judge, which essentially takes   away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!" he tweeted.
