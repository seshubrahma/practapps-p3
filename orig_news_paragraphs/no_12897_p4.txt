It’s interesting that you would have Michael Moore and me both on the same show talking about this because I think there’s a lot of people that would claim that Michael Moore and Glenn Beck are responsible for a lot of this. I can’t speak for Michael because I honestly don’t watch much of what he does, and I’m sure he doesn’t with me, but I warned about this. You know, when they were mocking me for bringing up Nazis, the reason why I did many of the times was the warn about the rise of the uber right in Europe that would bleed into America. It’s happening.
