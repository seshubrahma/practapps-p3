I had Mike McCaul last year March 3, call me up and he was sponsoring this bill ‘Secure the Borders First’ Act, and that doesn’t sound very ambiguous, but I read some —  trying to incorporate some credible thinking —   I read what Sen. Sessions had to say about it and   …      [Sessions had] some pretty valid criticisms, but I listened to him [McCaul] anyway.
