this is the same america that eats at burger king and is baffled as to why it ends up obese and cancerous and dying  this is the same america who thinks that granting health care to 20, 000, 000 people is somehow treasonous.   and this is the america who has now elected a   racist, misogynist.   a   racist, misogynist who has ruined businesses and has no policy proposals other than ‘build a wall’.
