No Evil: 19 Hard Truths the Left Can’t Handle was released last year, while Schweikart’s Politically Incorrect Guide to the Presidents, Part 1 will be released next week. Pollak also serves as editor of Breitbart California and   counsel at Breitbart News. Schweiker’s A Patriot’s History of the United States: From Columbus’s Great Discovery to the War on Terror,   with Michael Allen, was a #1 New York Times bestseller, and captured the interest of the nascent Tea Party movement, which would soon come to fruition at the end of George W. Bush’s presidency and the beginning of Barack Obama’s.
