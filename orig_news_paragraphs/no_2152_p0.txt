From fish markets in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to coffee shops in Chappaqua, New Yorkers made Tuesday’s election, like so many other things, all about themselves  —   their personal idiosyncrasies, their campaigns for social justice, their immigrant journeys and their settling of old political scores. Eager to expound on a contest with opinions that until now nobody had really asked for, they described their preferences at the ballot box with a combination of New York    emotion and parochialism. A Manhattan actor was eager to punish Bill Clinton for the sin of mocking Barack Obama eight years ago in South Carolina.
