At about noon, based on the conversations Iâ€™d had, I thought we were due to be released at any minute, but the authorities had other plans. I believe things were happening to slow down the process of release. For the next eight hours or so, we were moved to a variety of rooms in the prison for short bits of processing, but endless amounts of waiting time. During this period, we had no access to phones and, therefore, no access to information from the outside world about what was happening.
