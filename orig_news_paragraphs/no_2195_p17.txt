Mrs. Clinton was also planning to give remarks Monday lacerating her rival. She had planned to speak about what she deems as Mr. Trumpâ€™s dangerous demagogy at an appearance in Ohio. It is unclear whether Mrs. Clinton will use her speech to forcefully confront Mr. Trump. Mrs. Palmieri, the campaign aide, said Mrs. Clinton would discuss "steps she would take to keep the country safe" in the coming days and another aide said the candidate intended to refashion her address Monday to focus on the terrorism in Orlando.
