The people who called the meeting were Adams, Smith and Curry. In the lead up to that Monday meeting, Martin —  at Schlafly’s direction with the involvement of her son John as well —  made several moves that further infuriated the   rebels. On the previous Friday morning, Martin fired Glyn Wright as executive director of Eagle Forum. Martin confirmed to Breitbart News that he fired Wright on Friday, and the reasoning was "disloyalty" to Schlafly.
