Cozy Bear focused on the DNC’s email and communication servers which it is believed to have had access to since last Summer. Fancy Bear seemed to focus on collecting information relating to presidential candidate and tipped off DNC officials in April when the first security breach was noticed. It’s suspected that phishing emails sent to DNC employees were used to access the system however officials say they have yet to find any hard evidence to back up this suspicion.   Crowdstrike will continue to investigate the hack and has installed detection software on all computers and servers in the DNC in order to detect and future hacking attempts and to alert security experts.
