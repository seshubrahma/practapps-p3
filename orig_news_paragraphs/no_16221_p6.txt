The number of apprehensions gives us a good idea, but it also assumes that border patrolâ€™s resources and effectiveness have remained somewhat constant over the years. There is also no way to know how many people crossing the border illegally eluded arrest or how aggressive Border Patrol agents are with apprehensions at any given time. In the early 1990s, there were more than 4, 000 Border Patrol agents and fewer physical barriers on the border. Today, the number of agents staffing the border patrol has risen to more than 20, 000.
