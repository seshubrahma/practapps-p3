The relatives finalized their paperwork, immigration interviews and medical examinations during a   trip to Jordan in late December last year. The Assalis have helped bring family members to the United States before. In 2013, they were able to bring in one relative, and last month they were able to bring the brothersâ€™ sister and her daughter. The brothers waited to join them until after they could pack up their homes in Syria, Sarmad Assali said.
