The expectation is that Bill English will be the new leader of New Zealand," Professor Levine said. Mr. English, 55, declined to comment. Mr. English was involved in Mr. Key’s initiative to partly privatize   utilities and, like the prime minister, was an enthusiastic supporter of the   Partnership, the multilateral trade deal that has been put in doubt with Donald J. Trump’s election to the presidency of the United States. Mr. Key was prime minister during the 2011 earthquake in the city of Christchurch that killed 185 people.
