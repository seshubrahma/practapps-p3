The grocery giant also reported adding over 12, 000 jobs in 2016, a number that doesnâ€™t include temporary jobs such as the construction jobs needed to build its new outlets. The number also excludes new employees brought on by several recent mergers. The   supermarket chain currently employs 430, 000 workers across the country, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. Kroger joins several other large American corporations by announcing plans to add new jobs as the Trump administration begins to deploy its America First agenda.
