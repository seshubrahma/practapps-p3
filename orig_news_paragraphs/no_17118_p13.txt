Sessions is certainly not the first senator to grapple with racial issues but still advance his career.   Sen. Robert Byrd,   Virginia, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan as a young man before serving 51 years in the Senate. Byrd repeatedly apologized for his membership in the group    calling it the "greatest mistake of my life"    and rose to become majority leader and one of the most respected members of the body.   Sen. Strom Thurmond,   Carolina, ran for president as a segregationist in 1948 and led a   24 hour filibuster of a civil rights bill in 1957.
