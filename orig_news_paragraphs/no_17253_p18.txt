On Sunday, after casting his ballot, Van der Bellen said the Austrian election was "of significance for all of Europe. "    "Outside of Austria, the election is perceived as something that does not only concern us Austrians," he said.   Following his victory in May, which was later annulled, Van der Bellen told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that Europe "shouldn’t dramatize" the growing popularity of   parties in Europe.
