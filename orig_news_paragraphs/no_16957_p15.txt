Georgia machine suspected of ’flipping’ votes, In Georgia, a voting machine in Bryan County was removed from service after the Atlanta   newspaper reported to election officials that it may have been "flipping" some voters’ choices for president. A voter told the newspaper that it took three tries Tuesday before his choice of Clinton was correctly recorded. The voter, who requested anonymity from the paper to discuss his experience, said the touchscreen initially selected Trump. He said his wife had a similar problem on the same machine.
