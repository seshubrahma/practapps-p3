Henry M. Paulson Jr. the Treasury secretary, was developing a bank bailout by which the Treasury would buy up to $700 billion in shaky   securities   —   "troubled assets "  —   a plan that eventually became the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. He needed votes, and Republicans weren’t going for it.
