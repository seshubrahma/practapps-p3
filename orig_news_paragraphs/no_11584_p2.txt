Philadelphia is nothing short of notorious for voter fraud. One of the most infamous examples of   violations in modern history was when The Justice Department secured a court judgment against the Black Panthers for a videotaped incident of voter intimidation, a case that after the government won but before enforcement could take place, Barack Obamaâ€™s   Attorney General Eric Holder to drop the case and let the Black Panthers go. Some polls are split regarding whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is likely to win Pennsylvania, with Republicans complaining that voter fraud is so rampant in Philadelphia that it could steal a victory from Donald Trump if the margin is close. Trump has been pounding away on the theme that aspects of the system are "rigged" urging his supporters to turn out in massive numbers to ensure victory when the polls close.
