Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, Sensenbrenner’s counterpart on the relevant subcommittee, brought up the reports of Kushner’s projects using   money, and whether the White House would be able to act without conflict on the subject.   " I think some research ought to be done on that, Mr. Chairman, to make sure that we’re getting unbiased participation by the executive," she said.   The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on where it stands, but a spokesman pointed out that Trump has separated himself from the Trump Organization and associated entities.
