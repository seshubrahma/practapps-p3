For weeks, rumors had swirled that the Trump administration was considering a sweeping executive order that would grant religious believers, schools and corporations extensive exemptions to federal laws they disagree with, from LGBT protections to reproductive rights. The   executive order Trump signed on Thursday wasn’t that    not even close, leaving many conservative Christians looking like the boy who wanted a BB gun for Christmas and instead got a pair of socks.   The Heritage Foundation’s Ryan Anderson, a proponent of strong legal protections for religious liberty, called the executive order "woefully inadequate."   The ACLU, with whom social conservatives rarely agree, agreed, saying the executive order wasn’t even worth a lawsuit.
