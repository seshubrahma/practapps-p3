Pompeo’s appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, among his first forays into the public eye since being confirmed CIA director, came several months after WikiLeaks’ publishing stolen emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta as well as the Democratic National Committee and just over a month since WikiLeaks published a trove of files it said were from the CIA. The CIA has neither confirmed nor denied their veracity. In his Thursday speech, Pompeo accused WikiLeaks, Assange and Edward Snowden, a former contractor who leaked NSA documents to journalists, of disseminating classified information to "make a name for themselves."   Pompeo has in the past called for Snowden to receive the death penalty.
