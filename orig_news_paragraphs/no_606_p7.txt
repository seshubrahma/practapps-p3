James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former NATO commander, said Mr. Harward was "someone who will find a way to succeed no matter how daunting the task. " "I have known him well for two decades, and have boundless admiration for his ingenuity, integrity and ability to navigate choppy seas   â€”   both operationally in the field and in the battlefield of Washington, D. C.," said Mr. Stavridis, currently dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
