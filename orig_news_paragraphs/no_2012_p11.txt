Alex Grey, a member of Mr. Trump’s State Department transition team, wrote an article, with another Trump adviser, Peter Navarro, in Foreign Policy magazine last month in which he described Mr. Obama’s treatment of Taiwan as "egregious. " " This beacon of democracy in Asia is perhaps the most militarily vulnerable U. S. partner anywhere in the world," Mr. Grey and Mr. Navarro wrote, declaring that the island needed a "comprehensive arms deal" with the United States to "deter China’s covetous gaze. "
