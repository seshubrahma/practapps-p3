Our government condemns this serious threat on the Korean peninsula and overall international society," the South Korean foreign ministry said in a statement.   If Sunday’s missile launch leads to a nuclear test or an ICBM launch, there would be "a powerful punishing measure that North Korean authority can’t endure," South Korean officials said. US Pacific Command said it tracked a missile launch at 5:21 p. m. ET and said the missile blew up almost immediately.   The missile was launched from the same point of the April 5 launch, a White house foreign policy adviser said.
