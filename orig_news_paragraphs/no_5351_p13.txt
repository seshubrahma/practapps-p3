This election sees one of the largest numbers of parties participating ever in Dutch national elections with 28 different parties on the ballot with 15 potentially getting seats in the parliament. The main rivalry has, however, come down to the party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the PVV of Geert Wilders. The two party leaders engaged in a debate on Monday evening with Wilders slamming Rutte, calling him a "prime minister for foreigners".
