That withdrawal date, of course, came and went    as did a number of others. It is in American and Afghan interests for the US to stay in Afghanistan so it doesnâ€™t turn into Iraq circa 2014, with the Taliban controlling much of the country while hosting a strong presence of ISIS and   as well as every other jihadist group of note. What to do? The Trump administration should publicly state that the US already has a strategic partnership with Afghanistan until 2024 that was negotiated by the Obama administration and that it promises to maintain a US military "train and advise"   mission for the Afghan army that will stay in the country until the Taliban are contained.
