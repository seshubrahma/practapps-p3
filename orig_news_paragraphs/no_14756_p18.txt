What the numbers show, Border apprehensions were down across the board    with the decline among families and unaccompanied minors even sharper. Family unit apprehensions were down 66% and unaccompanied children were down 55% last month. Itâ€™s the first time since at least 2000 that apprehensions at the Southwest border have dropped in February, according to CBP data.   Numbers had also dropped in January, by almost 30% total and roughly 40% among children and families.
