The scientists, among them J. Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, told the Clinton campaign they believe there is a questionable trend of Clinton performing worse in counties that relied on electronic voting machines compared to paper ballots and optical scanners, according to the source. The group informed John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, and Marc Elias, the campaign’s general counsel, that Clinton received 7% fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic voting machines, which the group said could have been hacked.    Their group told Podesta and Elias that while they had not found any evidence of hacking, the pattern needs to be looked at by an independent review. Neither Halderman nor John Bonifaz, an attorney also pressing the case, responded to requests for comment on Tuesday evening.
