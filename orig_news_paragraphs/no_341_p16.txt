Atoll nations in the Pacific are seen as uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise because they are often   and extremely narrow. One of them, Kiribati, has become an unofficial champion of a movement to call global attention to the threat. In an interview with The New York Times last year, Kiribati’s president at the time, Anote Tong, said he had commissioned experts from the government of the United Arab Emirates to study the feasibility of artificially raising Kiribati’s islands as a climate adaptation strategy. But he declined to provide specifics, and subsequent attempts to reach officials in Kiribati and the United Arab Emirates for details were unsuccessful.
