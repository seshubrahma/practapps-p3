The first president to visit Laos, Mr. Obama came with a pledge to double American aid, to $30 million a year over three years, to help Laotians find unexploded bombs in their forests and fields. The United States dropped more than two million tons of explosives on this country during its secret war from 1964 to 1973, a legacy Mr. Obama said too few Americans understood. " As one Laotian said, the ‘bombs fell like rain,’’u2009" he said to a polite audience at the Lao National Cultural Hall.
