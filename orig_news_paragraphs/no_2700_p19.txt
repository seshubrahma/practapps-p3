Mr. Ulyukayev was charged with extorting a   bribe, Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Investigative Committee, said on state television. Mr. Ulyukayev threatened to use his official standing to create future problems for Rosneft, she said, and was detained on Monday while accepting $2 million. Russian security services had monitored Mr. Ulyukayev’s telephone calls for a year, and Rosneft had put the $2 million in a safe deposit box, according to various news reports, but the accused had not touched it. Timofei Gridnev, identified by Business FM radio as Mr. Ulyukayev’s lawyer, said the minister denied all the charges, calling them a "provocation" by Rosneft against a government official.
