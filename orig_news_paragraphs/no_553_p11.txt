Nominees have been caught off guard by their need to sell or distance themselves from unusual holdings, like stakes in private equity and hedge funds, family trusts and even professional sports franchises to steer clear of conflicts before taking a government post. In the case of Wilbur L. Ross Jr. the billionaire and commerce secretary nominee, ethics monitors granted him twice the normal   period to sell off his assets, many of which are intimately tied up in private investment funds. Despite the vetting issues, few, if any of Mr. Trumpâ€™s cabinet nominees are expected to be rejected by the Senate. Some people close to the nomination process said that officials with the Office of Government Ethics, which works with nominees to decide how to deal with potential conflicts, lacked an understanding of some of the more sophisticated financial investments held by nominees, making the process more difficult.
