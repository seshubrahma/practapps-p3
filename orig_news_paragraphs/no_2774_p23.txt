The most uncomfortable moment for Mrs. Clinton came when the debate turned to the 1994 crime bill, which put 100, 000 more police officers on the streets, built new prisons and banned certain types of assault weapons. The bill, which Mr. Sanders voted for and Mrs. Clinton supported as first lady, has been widely criticized as contributing to the mass incarceration of   and to tensions between police officers and black communities. Mr. Sanders minced no words about Mrs. Clinton’s use of the term "superpredators" to describe urban gang members in a 1996 speech. And he explained why he had criticized former President Bill Clinton this week for standing up for Mrs. Clinton on the issue.
