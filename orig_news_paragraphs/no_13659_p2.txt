Financed by private backers, Breitbart is one of a number of digital   threatening traditional media. In the US, it is the 34th biggest news site, with 150m page views in July, according to rankings from Similar Web. Much of its growth has come from the careful cultivation of users on social media platforms, especially Facebook, where it now has 2. 2m followers. As Facebook’s importance grows as a platform for online news, so too does Breitbart’s reach and influence.
