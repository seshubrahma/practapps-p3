Intelligence sharing, South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense in a statement Wednesday highlighted the merits of the deal, saying "Japan’s investment in national defense is higher than South Korea’s which enables the country to monitor and detect military information. "    Seoul is hoping the data will help it to analyze North Korea’s ballistic missile launches and their trajectories as well as the country’s nuclear and submarine capabilities. North Korea has conducted more than a dozen missile tests since Pyongyang claimed to have successfully detonated a thermonuclear device in January.
