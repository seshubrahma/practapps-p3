This production pits a fully adrenalized Gillian Anderson, as Blanche, against Ben Foster, as her adversarial    Stanley Kowalski, in a riveting study of the survival of the fittest. Even if you are unfamiliar with the plot, you shouldn’t have trouble predicting its outcome. Mr. Foster’s slyly commanding Stanley  —   a performance that makes the specter of Marlon Brando, who created the part, temporarily retreat into the dusk   —   is obviously the younger, stronger and more confident of the two.
