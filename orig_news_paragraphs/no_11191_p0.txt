Megyn Kelly’s    Fox special just got a little starrier. [  actor Michael Douglas and former O. J. Simpson "Dream Team" defense attorney Robert Shapiro will join GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on the Fox News anchor’s primetime Megyn Kelly Presents program next month.   Douglas and Shapiro are the second and third additions to the program, after it was reported earlier this week that Trump would sit down for an interview with Kelly in what will likely be a ratings booster for Fox.
