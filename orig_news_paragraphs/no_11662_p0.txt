Tuesday on Fox Business Network’s "Mornings With Maria," Maricopa County, AZ Sheriff Joe Arapaio discussed the problems with illegal immigrants committing crimes in his community and why he thinks Republican presidential   Donald Trump is the best one to deal with this problem.   Arpaio also told host Maria Bartiromo of a statistic showing that over   of all the illegal immigrants he has incarcerated and turned over to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement wind up back in his jails. Partial transcript as follows: BARTIROMO: You are on the front lines, obviously, and your teams are on the front lines and you’re seeing what’s going and coming through the border.
