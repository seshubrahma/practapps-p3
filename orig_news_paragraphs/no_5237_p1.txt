The temporary ban blocks travel and immigration from six Middle Eastern countries   —   Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Trump’s second attempt at instating a ban was blocked in March by a federal judge in Hawaii, which was upheld by an federal appeals court in May. The president’s first attempt was withdrawn by the White House after it was also blocked by the courts.
