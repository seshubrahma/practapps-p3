Royal welcome, Air Force One touched down earlier Saturday at the King Khalid airport in Riyadh, where Trump was greeted on a red   tarmac by King Salman and other   Saudi officials. The grand welcome    which featured a military brass band and a fighter jet flyover     demonstrated just how highly anticipated Trumpâ€™s arrival was to this Middle Eastern kingdom. It also seemed designed to flatter a President famous for a gilded lifestyle.
