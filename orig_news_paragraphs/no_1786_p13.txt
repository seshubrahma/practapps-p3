Referring to Mr. Priebus, Mr. Sykes asked, "Is he going to allow Donald Trump to throw Paul Ryan under the bus?" For all Mr. Priebusâ€™s public expressions of loyalty, he has been deeply shaken by revelations about Mr. Trump and the rifts within the party, seeing years of Republican organizational work potentially being undone, according to multiple people who described private conversations with Mr. Priebus on the condition of anonymity. He has said he feels adrift, fearing that Mr. Trump is headed for disaster, and told one longtime associate that he was having sleepless nights. Mr. Priebus did not respond to requests for comment.
