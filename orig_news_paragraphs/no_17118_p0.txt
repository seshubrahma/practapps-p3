Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is preparing to face fresh scrutiny for a decadesâ€™ old charge he made   comments while a US Attorney in his home state of Alabama.   The allegations cost him a job as a federal judge in 1986 and have the potential to sink his nomination to be attorney general under   Donald Trump. To survive, he will need to carefully distance himself from the damaging charges and deftly manage how his Senate colleagues    and the public    react to them.
