The sequestered jury started deliberations Thursday morning.   Tensing testified this week that he was being dragged by the left arm when he reached up and shot DuBose.   Prosecutors told the jury that Tensing wasn’t being pulled by the car and didn’t need to fire the single shot at Dubose’s head. After the mistrial, Prosecuting Attorney Joe Deters said he will make a decision on whether to retry the case by November 28.
