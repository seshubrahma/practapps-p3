The Justice Departmentâ€™s national security division, which was already investigating the DNC intrusion, is handling the investigation because of the believed similarities, one of the officials explained.    There is strong evidence indicating the cyber intrusion of the DNC was the work of hackers working on behalf of Russian intelligence, US officials said this week. The alleged intrusion was first reported by Reuters. A person familiar with the Clinton campaign program described it as essentially a dynamic voter database    with voter participation, voter contact information and voter files that all campaign organizations use.
