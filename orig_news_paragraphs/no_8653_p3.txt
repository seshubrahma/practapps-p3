One of the things I liked about Donald Trump’s campaign was that he ran on a big, bold tax plan, that cut taxes for every American, and it was NOT revenue neutral. The government would get less money and every American would keep more. That’s the kind of plan I ran on too, and it’s the kind of plan we in Congress should quickly rally behind as we start our new session and the new Administration.   We have tried it before.
