But Mr. Bharara’s office never was able to file criminal charges against Mr. Cohen, who has gone on to run a large family office called Point72 Asset Management that manages more than $10 billion of his personal fortune. Mr. Bharara’s office secured convictions or guilty pleas against more than 70 hedge fund traders, analysts and consultants in insider trading cases. But he suffered a blow when a federal appellate court said his office had overreached and threw out the convictions of two former traders, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson. The appellate ruling led Mr. Bharara to vacate guilty pleas and convictions of at least seven other people.
