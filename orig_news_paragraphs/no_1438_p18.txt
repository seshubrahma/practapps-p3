I led Congress to establish an "Asiatic barred zone" starting in 1917, acting on the belief that Chinese, Japanese and other Asian immigrants could not assimilate into American society. In the 1920s, Congress also limited immigration from southern and Eastern European countries including Italy, Greece and Poland, on the theory that their citizens were inferior to Western Europeans and could import subversive socialist ideas. Because of the restrictions, during World War II many Jews and others fleeing Hitler were blocked from coming to the United States. Congress eliminated the national origin quotas when it overhauled immigration in 1965.
