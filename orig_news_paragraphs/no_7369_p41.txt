President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450, 000 troops —  which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States. It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system. In 2010, the US spent $554 billion on   base defense spending. In the current year, we are spending $548 billion  —   a cut of 10% in real   dollars.
