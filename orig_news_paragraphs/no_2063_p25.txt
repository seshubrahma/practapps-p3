The company has been both complimented and criticized in Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer. When Exxon, the precursor of Exxon Mobil, acquired Mobil’s operations in Nigeria in the late 1990s, it was given credit for righting misdeeds, including bribery and negligence, said Matthew Page, a consultant who until recently was the State Department’s top expert on Nigeria. " They came in with a much more rigid,    management culture and totally cleaned up Mobil’s operations there," he said.
