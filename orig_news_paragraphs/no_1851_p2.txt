The newspaper said Mr. Obama had urged the   to reconsider repealing his signature health care law, which Mr. Trump said had become "unworkable. " But in the interview, Mr. Trump said he told the president that he would consider keeping two provisions of the law: the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of a patientâ€™s   condition and the one that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance plans until they turn 26.
