Clinton says it’s very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, "Barack Obama, me, La Raza," the UFW, Dolores Huerta would have supported a bill that would have ushered in a program that was akin to modern slavery. She says that was just an excuse not to vote for the bill. Sanders points out that Clinton was against driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants [that issue derailed her campaign in 2008 —  see Russert’s questioning and Chris Dodd’s response.] Sanders also points out that Clinton wanted the illegal immigrant children who flooded across the border to be sent back.
