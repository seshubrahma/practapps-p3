When I met Petersen in downtown Washington, D. C. this week, he was the politico, and I was the sloppy journalist. His ruddy grey suit, crisp white shirt, and blue tie all said: "That me [in cargo shorts] was me when I wasn’t [running for office]. " In fact that is what he literally said as I quizzed him on his sharp new look at the famous Old Ebbitt Grill just a few minutes walk from the same White House that Petersen wants to occupy in 2017. But since he’s running to be the candidate of the Libertarian Party, that probably won’t happen.
