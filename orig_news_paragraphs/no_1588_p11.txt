Mr. Trump said Monday that he would spur economic growth by reducing taxes and regulation, and by renegotiating trade agreements to bring manufacturing back to the United States. He also outlined a plan to help some families offset the expense of child care. Mr. Trump said in July that he favored a $   federal minimum wage, but he has made contradictory remarks in other public appearances, the proposal does not appear in campaign materials, and he did not mention it in Detroit. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have said that they are focused on creating more and better jobs.
