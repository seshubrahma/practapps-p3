While managing relief sites along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, I saw how a country that was capable of "shock and awe" overseas failed to marshal and coordinate the awesome assets of this nation to help Americans during their darkest hours. The   autopsy pointed to many causes, including inept political appointees at the helm of agencies with   responsibilities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator is only as strong as   relationships, ability to lead under pressure, and understanding of how each of the hundreds of puzzle pieces of   and   stakeholders come to life from dense paper plans during emergencies. The position should not be a prize for loyalty it should be carefully entrusted to a professional with experience.
