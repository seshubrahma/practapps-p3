Several congressional Democrats released a letter Friday evening asking for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to grant a waiver for the child and her parents to come into the country for surgery. Though the babyâ€™s heart surgery is still in limbo, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo released a statement on Friday about the family being able to come to the US. " This evening we were pleased to learn that the federal government has now granted Fatemeh Reshad and her family boarding documents to come to the United States," Cuomo said.
