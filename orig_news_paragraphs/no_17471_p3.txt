US security agencies have been in agreement that   hackers deliberately stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief John Podesta, then moved to have the private emails made public in an effort to help Trump, Putin’s favored candidate, win the election.   Already in October, Washington formally blamed Russia for the attacks. Russia denied involvement, but US intelligence services said they were "confident" of Russia’s role, confirming what private firms had already concluded.   Obama, however, did not act, fearing he would be seen as trying to help his candidate, Hillary Clinton, win the election.
