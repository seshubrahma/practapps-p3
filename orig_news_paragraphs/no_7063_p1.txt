As the dissenting judges explained, the executive order is a constitutional exercise of the President’s duty to protect our communities from terrorism.   The President is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States. Earlier Thursday, the Fourth Circuit issued an en banc   decision to continue blocking the enforcement of President Trump’s order restricting travel and immigration from six   countries. The majority, over a forceful dissent, found that even though the order made no mention of disfavoring Muslims, the statements of Trump and his surrogates during the campaign rendered it a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.
