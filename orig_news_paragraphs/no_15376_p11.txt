And Colbert, a former cable comic, couldn’t resist saluting the 45th President of the United States with a special version of the Colbert "finger."   There may be a lot of legitimate reasons to criticize Trump for his attitude, his policies and his compulsive dishonesty but in the end, he remains the democratically elected President of the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy. The smug and smarmy Colbert demeans all Americans with his gutter language deployed at a sitting President on a regular   network show.   Americans are fond of   humor directed at their elected officials.
