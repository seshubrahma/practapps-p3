What defined Thursday’’s hearing, in fact, was the degree to     which Republicans downplayed obvious examples of     bad —  potentially illegal —  behavior and sought to exonerate Trump     rather than grapple with Comey’’s damning allegations about the     president. Sen. James Risch of Idaho, for example, pressed     Comey on his claim that President Trump had asked the then —  FBI     director to drop the investigation into Flynn, suggesting     that —  because Trump didn’’t give a direct order —   we ought to     ignore the clear subtext of the president’’s statement.
