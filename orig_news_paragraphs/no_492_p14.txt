Similar protests took place last week near an N. F. L.  park downtown. Atlanta, the capital of a solidly red state, was suddenly adopted as a darling of   football fans. One commenter on Twitter joked, "The Falcons respect an independent judiciary," a dig at the president’s criticism of the federal judge in Seattle who temporarily halted the refugee ban. Some Patriots fans, uneasy with their team’s link to the president, encouraged fellow fans to donate to organizations like the N. A. A. C. P. and Planned Parenthood each time the Patriots scored.
