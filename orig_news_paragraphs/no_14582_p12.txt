Right behind it are "Moonlight," a    story about a gay black man in Miami, and "Manchester by the Sea," which sounds like a snooty BBC drama but is actually about a depressive Boston handyman grappling with unspeakable family tragedy. Itâ€™s a laugh riot. Critics also love "Arrival," a   movie about linguists trying to communicate with space aliens who may actually not be trying to kill us. But the sentimental favorite may be "Hidden Figures," a true story about the unsung   women whose math and engineering smarts helped power the US space program in the 1960s.
