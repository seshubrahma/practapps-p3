There’s a Supreme Court case on   redistricting. I hope that the court rules and that the people   who were there win and they have to draw more reasonable lines.    We’re trying to do something about it in Ohio. On the   presidential side, I think because of the changing economy,   economics of America, people are very unsettled.
