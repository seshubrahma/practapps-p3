Dr. Kristin M. Huntoon, a    neurosurgery resident at Ohio State University in Columbus, said the group’s support for Mr. Price had increased the chances that the Affordable Care Act would be dismantled   —   and that has put her patients at risk. Ohio has extended Medicaid coverage to more than 600, 000 people under the federal health care law.
