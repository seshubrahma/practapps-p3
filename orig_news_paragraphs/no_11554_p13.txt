Mr. Tyrmand believes the chain of events above is far from accidental or coincidental. Another   Polish journalist Dawid Wildstein pointed out the irony in the establishment media suddenly becoming the hunted "sued by a Jewish New Yorker" he notes with reference to Tyrmandâ€™s   heritage. The case, he recognises, could turn into a global story overnight.   Tyrmand told TVP, a Polish national television channel, that he intended to take the alleged defamers to court in order to "open up a public debate regarding the role of the media in Poland as well as the influence of George Soros on the Polish media and, by extension, on the public opinion in Poland".
