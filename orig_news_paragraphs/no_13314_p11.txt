That only works when the people who suffer from open borders immigration are   and rendered invisible, much the way ObamaCare can only be presented as a "success" if everyone harmed by it is completely ignored.

Immigration advocates love to pretend that nobody is treated unfairly by their agenda, so all complaints about the results are peevish and pointlessly cruel.
