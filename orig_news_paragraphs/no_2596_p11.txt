â€”   to states that Mr. Sanders won, including New Hampshire, Wyoming, Vermont and Washington. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, was in a bittersweet but resolute mood on Tuesday, according to his advisers, as he took the stage with Mrs. Clinton. He was back in a state that once filled his campaign with hope after he crushed Mrs. Clinton by 22 percentage points in the February primary, and he came around grudgingly to supporting her, the advisers said. But he was also determined to make a strong case against Mr. Trump and, in doing so, champion Mrs. Clinton as the only chance to defeat him.
