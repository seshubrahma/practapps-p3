In his New Year’s speech, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said the country was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the US mainland.   A statement last week, released by the North Korean Foreign Ministry, seemed to offer an avenue to Trump for future negotiations, saying any future US leader "would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking."   John Delury, associate professor of international studies at Yonsei University said the statement was "definitely a message to the Trump transition team" not to follow the current administration’s tactic of imposing international sanctions on Pyongyang. If North Korea is hoping for a sit down meeting with Trump, as some analysts have argued, it’s "logical to assume" Kim will want to test an ICBM as soon as possible to strengthen his hand, said Tal Inbar, a North Korea expert at the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies.
