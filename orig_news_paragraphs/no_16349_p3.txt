Amid Republican infighting over its   nominee, the Clinton and Johnson campaigns have sought to grow their bases of support. For example, Whitman said she backed Clinton following a direct phone call from the former secretary of state.   Johnson said his campaign has reached out to Republican 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who has pointedly refused to back Trump and said he’s considering voting Libertarian.   A spokeswoman for Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican who hails from a competitive district in Colorado and recently put up a web video saying he "doesn’t care" for Trump, said the congressman had spoken with Libertarian vice presidential nominee William Weld.
