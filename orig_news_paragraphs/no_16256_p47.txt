Of the 19 countries for which Pew has data, U. S. favorability improved in 13 countries. But the United States actually became less popular in six nations during that same period: China, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, Poland and Lebanon. It would also be difficult to attribute the change in favorability, either positive or negative, to Clinton alone, as the 2008 election of Obama is widely seen as helping to boost U. S. standing globally. Additionally, U. S. favorability improved even more in 11 of these countries in the years after Clinton left office.
