The   race came close to crossing that line a couple of times, but never did because both candidates worked hard to repair the breach.   There should be robust debate about ideas and issues, about who would make a better president and leader of the party.

If that happens, it will be incumbent on the whole party    from President Obama on down    to call foul.
