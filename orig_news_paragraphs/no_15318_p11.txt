Amid the tumult in Washington, the USS Vinson aircraft carrier finally arrived at the Korean Peninsula on Saturday and began drills with its South Korean navy counterparts. The Vinson’s arrival in South Korea has long been anticipated after a messaging   between the Pentagon and the White House made it appear the carrier would arrive two weeks earlier. It was the second advanced US military vessel to arrive in South Korea in a week    earlier in the week, one of the US Navy’s most advanced submarines, the USS Michigan, docked in Busan. The sub has since departed but neither the US nor the South Korean military would confirm its movements.
