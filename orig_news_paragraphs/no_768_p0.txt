HOUSTON  —    The Justice Department on Monday dropped a crucial objection to Texas’ strict   law, signaling a significant change from the Obama administration on   issues. The   Texas Legislature passed one of the toughest voter ID laws in the country in 2011, requiring voters to show a driver’s license, passport or other   photo ID before casting a ballot. The Obama administration’s Justice Department sued Texas to block the law in 2013 and scored a major victory last year after a federal appeals court ruled that the law needed to be softened because it discriminated against minority voters who lacked the required IDs.
