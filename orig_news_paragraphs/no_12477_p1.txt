The petition was launched by a     activist in Scotland following remarks made by Mr Trump in which he called for a moratorium on Muslims entering the U. S. until the threat of Islamic extremism is better understood, The Telegraph has reported. In response, The Trump Organisation has issued a statement detailing plans for a £200 million investment in their Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire, and a further £500 million in Trump International Golf Links near Aberdeen, warning that any moves to block Mr Trump from travelling to the UK would "immediately end these and all future investments we are currently contemplating in the United Kingdom". The statement continued: "Westminster would create a dangerous precedent and send a terrible message to the world that the United Kingdom opposes free speech and has no interest in attracting inward investment.
