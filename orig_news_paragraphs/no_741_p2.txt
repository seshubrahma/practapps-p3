Several readers found headlines misleading in their descriptions of a new Trump proposal. The public editor’s take:   The head of the copy desk, Jill Taylor, agrees with the reader that "illegal" would have made for a clearer headline, though she pointed out that, for space reasons, the desk took a calculated risk that readers who’ve been paying at least a little attention would not equate "immigrants" with all immigrants. Two reactions from me.
