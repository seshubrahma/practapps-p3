The number of American Muslims who radicalize is small, especially when compared with other Western countries, said William McCants, director of the Brookings Institutionâ€™s Project on US Relations with the Islamic World.    Law enforcement experts estimate that about 250 Americans have tried to join ISIS, far fewer than the thousands who have flocked to Syria and Iraq from countries such as France and Belgium.    "I would argue that American Islam is doing something right in contrast to these other countries," McCants said.   Most American Muslims are integrated and feel content with their lives, in sharp contrast with many Muslims in Western Europe, according to the 2011 Pew Center report.
