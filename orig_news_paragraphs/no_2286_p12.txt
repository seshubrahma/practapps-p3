In 2013, the county sheriff was murdered  as he ate lunch in his patrol car. A year later, a senior judge was jailed on corruption charges ("Folks knew him as ‘the king,’" the manager said). More recently, the local coal magnate, Donald L. Blankenship, started a   prison sentence for breaching safety standards at a mine where 29 miners died in an accident in 2010. And in May, a wealthy coal executive was fatally shot in the town cemetery as he visited his wife’s grave.
