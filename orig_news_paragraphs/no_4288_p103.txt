Don’t say anything about Bill Clinton  …     without him we wouldn’t have had Sick Hillary’s hilarious campaign! I call on everyone in this room and the many thousands of people watching at home to reject the cultural conditioning favoring abortion that we are all exposed to. You have already rejected so much, like the lie of campus rate epidemics and the gender pay gap. I’m asking you to go a little farther  …     because Western Civilization needs more babies, not fewer.
