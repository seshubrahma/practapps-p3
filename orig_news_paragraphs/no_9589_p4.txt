I’ve rid their bathrooms of a dude in a dress! During my talk there, I drew attention to the case of Justine Kramer, a   transwoman who used Title IX laws to force his way into women’s locker rooms. Legislation created to protect women is now used to put men in their restrooms. Now, Justine Kramer is apparently upset, because I used his old name instead of his new fake one, Adelaide.
