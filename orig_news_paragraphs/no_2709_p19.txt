" It would cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars," said Rohit Chopra, a former adviser to Education Secretary John B. King Jr. as well as Hillary Clintonâ€™s defunct transition team. The president of the Association of Public and   Universities, Peter McPherson, who was a deputy Treasury secretary during the Reagan administration, also called the proposal "politically untenable" because of its cost.
