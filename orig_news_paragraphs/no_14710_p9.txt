Additionally, national security advisers to the campaign, J. D. Gordon and Carter Page, also met with Kislyak during the Cleveland convention, as first reported by USA Today. Gordon confirmed the report to CNN, adding that another national security adviser, Walid Phares, also met with Kislyak, but he denied any talk of collusion. " This is not any different than anything I said publicly and on panels," he said.
