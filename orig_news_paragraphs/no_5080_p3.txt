Most of the decline in refugees from these seven countries is due to a significant drop off in Syrian refugees, from 14. 8 percent of total refugees in FY 2016 (12, 587 out of 84, 994) to 9. 8 percent (1, 603 out of 16, 261) in the first four months and 11 days of the Trump administration. That drop off in Syrian refugees is accelerating in each successive month of the Trump administration. " The number of Syrian refugees admitted to the United States under the federal refugee resettlement program has declined for the fourth consecutive month," Breitbart News reported earlier this week.
