As of September 13, 3, 783 total refugees, 1, 217 of whom are from Syria, have been resettled in Michigan to date this fiscal year. At the accelerated run rate of the past few months, year end numbers are likely to hit or exceed the FY 2016 plan for 4, 000 total refugees in Michigan, of which over 1, 300 are Syrian refugees. The FY 2017 plans, obtained through Freedom of Information Act request made to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services by a local Michigan grassroots group (as were the FY 2016 plans) show that that these five resettlement agencies have proposed a 38 percent increase in overall refugee resettlement, up to 5, 606 refugees. This includes a 40 percent increase in refugees from the "Middle   Asia" region that includes Syria, to 3, 586.
