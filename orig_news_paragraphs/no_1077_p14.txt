Presiding over a committee hearing on Monday   —    when Mr. Comey took the extraordinary step of announcing the agency’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election  —   Mr. Nunes mustered deeper alarm over anonymous sources revealing an inquiry’s details to journalists than over the contents of the investigation. On Wednesday, he told reporters he had received information that Mr. Trump or members of his team may have been "incidentally" swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies.
