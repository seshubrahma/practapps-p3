  German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel [The Mirror] have published their weekend cover featuring a heavily stylised cartoon of the new American President, apparently in the style of an Islamic State propaganda video. [Showing President Trump holding the severed head of the Statue of Liberty in one hand and a blooded knife in the other, the cartoon was produced for the magazine by United   Cuban artist Edel Rodriguez. The design follows a number of other covers and articles by the magazine, one of Europeâ€™s largest, which have been highly critical of Trump, both during the election campaign and after his election.   Past covers have included a renditon of President Trump as a meteorite speeding towards Earth with the headline "the end of the world" and a picture of the   standing with former challenger Hillary Clinton covered in mud in a snipe at the   campaign.
