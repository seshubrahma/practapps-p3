Schools must be held accountable at the front and back ends. To give families quality private options, states must thoroughly vet schools that want to participate. States must also make those findings public so families can be as knowledgeable about their private options as they are of their public choices (which in many cases also donâ€™t present enough information about quality).   If private and   schools want public money and live up to the promise of providing options, they need to be more public.
