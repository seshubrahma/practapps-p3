Those battles are unwinnable: Publicly pressuring the president reduces influence with him and feeds into perceptions that agencies are irredeemably politicized. Acquiescing makes their politicization a fact. When, for example, Mr. Trump accused former President Barack Obama of tapping his phones, he forced the F. B. I. into an unappealing choice: Let the accusation slide, though it implies the bureau broke the law, or rebuke the president and risk the appearance of playing politics. Either way, the bureau loses some of its internal influence, public stature or, quite possibly, both.
