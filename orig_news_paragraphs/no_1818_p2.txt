Hours later, the European Union announced that the deal was back on track. Mr. Trudeau signed the pact on Sunday, joined by Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents the leaders of the member states Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, which holds the rotating presidency of the body that runs the bloc’s ministerial meetings and   Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm. The deal will help to demonstrate that "trade is good for the middle class and those working hard to join it," Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Brussels.
