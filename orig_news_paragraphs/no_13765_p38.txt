From there, Ali contacted Brandon Darby and the rest of the Breitbart News team. Once again, I want to say that I am grateful beyond words to the entire team at Breitbart News, and I thank both executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon and CEO Larry Solov for not just having my back, but reaching out to my wife, Lauren, several times and making sure she was okay. Meanwhile, back in prison, we were all put into orange jumpsuits and given a towel, a bar of soap, toothpaste, and a pamphlet about the rules and regulations. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t have my reading glasses, as they had been taken into property during processing, so I was unable to read the rules and regulations.
