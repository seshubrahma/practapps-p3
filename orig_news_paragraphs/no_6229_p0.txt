  Donald Trump continued excoriating the forces behind the published document of unsubstantiated accusations of compromising behavior, accusing his political rivals for leaking the document prepared by a private investigator. ["It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued," Trump wrote on Twitter Friday morning, adding, "Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans  â€”   FAKE NEWS!"   The Wall Street Journal reported that former British spy Christopher Steele, now the director of a private investigation firm, prepared the document. According to the New York Times, a wealthy Republican donor funded political opposition group Fusion GPS to investigate Trump.
