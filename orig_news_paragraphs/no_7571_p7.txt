I have strongly and consistently opposed the TPP.   For decades, I have warned about how our terrible trade deals are killing the middle class.   We are getting taken to the cleaners.   My message on trade has been consistent from the beginning, and if politicians had listened to me years ago we would have saved millions of jobs, rebuilt our crumbling infrastructure, and saved trillions of dollars.
