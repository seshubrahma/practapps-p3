Adding to the criticism was former Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan. Buchanan also served as a senior advisor to Nixon and Reagan and has warned for decades against mass immigration, religious free trade, and military adventurism. On Ingraham’s program, Buchanan slammed National Review’s writers as "Davos conservatives," referring to the World Economic Forum of global elites who similarly went on the attack against Trump. Since Buchanan lost the Republican Party’s nomination in 1996, more than 16 million immigrants have been permanently added to the U. S. population, not including their children.
