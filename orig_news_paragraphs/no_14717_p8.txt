Aegis does have the ability to link data between US, Japanese and South Korean warships, Schuster said. But it has limitations, too. While the US system can work with either Japan or South Korea, the three cannot work together because there is no one data encryption system that works among them, Schuster said. And Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst with the Rand Corporation, says the South Korean Aegis destroyers are not equipped with the interceptors necessary to take out enemy ballistic missiles.
