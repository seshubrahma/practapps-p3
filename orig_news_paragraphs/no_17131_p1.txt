Sarkozy came in third in the field of seven vying for the nomination for France’s   party.   The shock winner was Francois Fillon, who staged a remarkable late surge to win the vote. He’ll contest Alain Juppe in a   vote for the party’s nomination on November 27. It’s assumed the winner will be the one to contest the leader of the   National Front, Marine Le Pen, for the presidency.
