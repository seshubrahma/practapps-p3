Shortly after his election, a Muslim student was charged for falsely claiming that her hijab was pulled from her head by a Trump supporter. Meanwhile, a black female student from Bowling Green State University has been charged with filing a fake police report after fabricating a story that white Trump supporters had thrown rocks at her in a racially motivated attack.
