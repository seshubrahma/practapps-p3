National bombing protection is on the way," David Levy, a police officer based in the Nord region, told Aftonbladet Sunday night.   The man attempted to reach the hospital on his own after the incident and is thought to have thrown more explosives from the car on the way. He did not make it and was picked up by an ambulance. Police classed the incident as a disaster endangering the public, and the bomb squad was searching the vehicle and road overnight to make the area safe.
