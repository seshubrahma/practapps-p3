Trump has repeatedly twisted Khan’s words on Twitter.   Khan had told London’s citizens that there was no cause for alarm about increased police presence in the city in the coming days following an attack on the London Bridge that killed at least seven people.   But Trump seized on only a small portion of Khan’s remarks, tweeting Sunday: "At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ’no reason to be alarmed! ’"
