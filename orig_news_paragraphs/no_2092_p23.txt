The conciliatory reaction by the Philippines, even as the United States was making stern demands on Beijing, would complicate Washingtonâ€™s efforts to convince China that its actions were unacceptable, a senior American military official said on Saturday. In an important ruling in July, an international tribunal in The Hague decided against China, saying that the Scarborough Shoal was entitled only to a   territorial zone, not 200 miles as the Chinese assert. China has refused to recognize the ruling. Mr. Duterte on Saturday said he was ignoring the Hague ruling even though the case had been brought by the previous Philippines government.
