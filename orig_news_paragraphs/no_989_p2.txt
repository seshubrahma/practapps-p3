" It raises considerable red flags, especially due to the fact that this company was under investigation," said Scott H. Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan investigative group. Mr. Eitel, an Education Department lawyer under President George W. Bush, has been a stalwart critic of federal regulation of both   colleges and   education under the Obama administration. A department spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Mr. Eitel is part of a "beachhead" team, paid staff members who are temporarily helping to lead federal agencies as the Trump administration gets up and running but do not require Senate confirmation.
