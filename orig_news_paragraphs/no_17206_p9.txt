Messing notes that what we now know as civil offenses were criminal offenses at the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, or simply went unpunished. So it was not the Founding Fathersâ€™ intent to restrict pardons to federal crimes.      In fact, civil offenses did not even exist in the United States until the 1840s.   Prior to that, US presidents pardoned people for what would be considered civil offenses today.
