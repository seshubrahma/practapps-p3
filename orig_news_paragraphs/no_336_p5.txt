Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, expressed outrage the next day during a forceful statement at the White House in which he lashed out at the press and claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Trump had drawn "the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration. " Mr. Spicer later said he was talking about a combination of   television and online audiences. That same morning, before Mr. Spicer’s statement, Mr. Reynolds received a message from the White House that the president wanted to talk to him.
