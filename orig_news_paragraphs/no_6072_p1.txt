But let me say, Rita, this is a second message that’s being sent   —   and it’s to the North Koreans. The North Koreans, they have their tests, their atom bombs deep in tunnels, and I think what it is, is a message to them that we can get down in there and kill your people underground as well as    —    and so I would think that’s a message to North Korea as well.
