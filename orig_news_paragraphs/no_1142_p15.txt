Ms. Farkas was commenting on a New York Times article a day earlier that documented how in the days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Obama administration officials had sought to ensure the preservation of those documents in order to leave a clear trail for government investigators after Mr. Trump took office. In a statement she gave to The American Spectator, a conservative publication, Ms. Farkas said the furor over her remarks was "a wild misinterpretation of comments I made on the air in March. " She added, "I was out of government, I didn’t have any classified information, or any knowledge of ‘tapping’ or leaking or the N. Y. T. article before it came out. "
