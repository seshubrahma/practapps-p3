During our    meeting at Trump Tower, based on President Elect Trumpâ€™s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance. I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the   in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after    conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward.
