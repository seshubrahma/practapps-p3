This "Training Day" is a   version of the movie, which paired Mr. Washington with Ethan Hawke as the   rookie. The racial dynamic is glaring as nostalgic white guy Frank fights to Make L. A. Great Again against largely minority criminals. An episode that pits him against Japanese mobsters is almost parodic.
