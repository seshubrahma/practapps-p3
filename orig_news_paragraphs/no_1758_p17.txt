Another encouraging development was a slowdown in the huge round of job cuts in the mining and logging industries prompted by falling prices for oil and other commodities. After falling for 23 consecutive months, with 223, 000 jobs slashed during that time, employment in the sector was flat last month. " Instead of declining, jobs may start coming back to the sector," Ms. Swonk said, noting that the recent rebound in oil prices may spur new investment in exploration and drilling after a   drought.
