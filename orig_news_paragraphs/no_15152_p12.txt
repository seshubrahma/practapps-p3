A man in a red "Make America Great Again" hat, who resembles Heimbach, shoves her multiple times, putting his finger in the University of Louisville studentâ€™s face and yelling. Another man in a   uniform then continues shoving her through the crowd. CNN affiliate WDRB in Louisville reported in July that the Louisville Metro Police Department issued criminal summonses for Heimbach, Bamberger and Joseph Pryor of Indiana, charging them with misdemeanor harassment for making physical contact with Nwanguma.   Nwanguma alleged she was the subject of racist and sexist slurs during the incident, WDRB reported.
