Trump is compiling a Cabinet of   of largely aging, white, male business leaders who see the world in terms of the bottom line rather than grand theories of international relations.   They are not, I suspect, motivated by Slavophilia or a passion for Russian orthodoxy. Rather, they see Putin for what he really is: a strong man in a weak position. Russiaâ€™s economy and army are antiquated and not particularly strong    and the country is surrounded by a ring of NATO countries committed to mutual defense.
