Dave Besseling, a former deputy editor at GQ India, hosted an event at Sagar Chordia’s hotel during the 2016 presidential campaign and said Mr. Chordia expressed "elation" about Mr. Trump’s candidacy and the opportunities it would bring. The same week, Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka  —   an executive at the Trump Organization hotel chain   —   attended a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. The move drew criticism from former State Department officials, given that Ms. Trump does not have security clearance and is helping run the family business enterprises.
