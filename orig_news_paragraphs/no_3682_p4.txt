Trump made his remarks in an interview with Bloomberg News reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. He was asked about his campaign suggestion that he would implement a version of the   law that was passed in 1933. The law required consumer lending and investments to be separate, but it was repealed in 1999 under former president Bill Clinton. The idea was included in the Republican party platform and endorsed by   manager Paul Manafort in July 2016.
