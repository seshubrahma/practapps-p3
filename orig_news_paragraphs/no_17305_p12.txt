It’s obvious that the Republicans who control Congress can’t be counted on to conduct anything resembling a real investigation into this matter, since it may have delivered their candidate the White House (if it had something to do with Benghazi, then they might be interested).   So if nothing else, there should be a bipartisan commission like the one we chartered after   with the resources necessary to learn what happened and the independence to speak honestly about what it finds.
