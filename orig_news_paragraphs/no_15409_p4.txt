First, Clapper made clear he was not a talking point.   For several weeks, the White House and many of its supporters have used Clapper’s statement in previous testimony    that he had seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia     to argue that there, in fact, was no evidence of collusion. That original statement by Clapper, however, was tempered today with a major concession: he told the subcommittee that he did not even know of the FBI investigation that FBI Director James Comey disclosed, publicly, on March 10, into whether there was collusion to influence the election.    That’s quite a concession by Clapper, but one he wanted to make clear:  essentially, he was out of the loop.
