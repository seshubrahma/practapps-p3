The FBI used the dossier as part of the justification to win approval to secretly monitor a Trump associate, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. In some of his briefings to members of Congress in recent weeks, FBI Director James Comey has cited the dossier as one of the sources of information the bureau has used to bolster its investigation, according to US officials briefed on the probe. Trump mentioned Page as a foreign policy adviser to his campaign in an interview with The Washington Post in March 2016. Under pressure to name some national security advisers, campaign staffers produced a list of names for Trump to refer to, according to a US official close to the campaign.
