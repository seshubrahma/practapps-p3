As in, on the one hand, we have Trump asserting that the whole story of Russia’s attempts to influence the election via connections within his campaign apparatus is "fake news," and grasping at the idea that somehow, some way he will be eventually proven right in his baseless claims that   Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower. On the other, we have FBI Director James Comey, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the heads of both the House and Senate intelligence committees    both Republicans    and lots and lots of other prominent voices within the intelligence community insisting the Russian investigation is entirely justified and that no evidence exists for Trump’s claims. It’s not a fair fight    and shouldn’t be presented as one. And that has zero to do with partisanship and everything to do with the facts as we know them.
