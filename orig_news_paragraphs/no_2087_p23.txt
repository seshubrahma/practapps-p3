Our critics, who reviewed nearly 250 books this year, winnowed the list down to their favorites. The stories they recommend include tales of a   whaling expedition, a literal Underground Railroad, the Dublin Murder Squad’s crime investigations and the secrets of a small mining town. If you’re in the mood for nonfiction, follow along as authors explore America’s   housing crisis, hillbilly culture, a childhood in Syria, Queen Victoria’s reign and a terminally ill neurosurgeon’s final months.
