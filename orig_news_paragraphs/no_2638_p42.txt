Starring as Cher’s mother in the film was Olympia Dukakis, Mr. Dukakis’s cousin. Cher’s support for Mrs. Clinton started with her Senate campaign and, later, in 2008 with her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination against Barack Obama. The similarities between the two women struck me as something that must have affected Cher. They are just a few years apart in age.
