To pursue its   agenda, Michelle Goldberg is demonizing and vilifying the family of a    rape victim. Also, Goldberg tries to paint "Lori" as some kind of a nut. While leaving out statements that would make her sympathetic, Goldberg makes sure to include Loriâ€™s saying she has not been well, as if to imply that she is unbalanced, and her story false. The media is going to extraordinary lengths to kill this story, going so far as to target the family for character assassination.
