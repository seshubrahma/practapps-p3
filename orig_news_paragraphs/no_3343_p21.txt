During the same   period,   salaries, increased company profits, and sales have pushed the Dow Jones Index of stocks up by 60 percent.    If the   programs were sharply reduced, Americans companies would be forced to compete for the limited pool of Americans by offering higher salaries. The resulting "tight labor market" for Americans graduates would push up average salaries, give underemployed graduates an escape from   jobs (such as at Starbucks) boost recruitment of older professionals, spur   technology investment, and also greatly increase the opportunities for American teenagers, dropouts and the unemployed to study for college degrees. Even minor reforms of the   program —  such as   rules —  would boost salaries by 10 percent for the many U. S.  employees of   outsourcing companies, says the Goldman Sachs report.
