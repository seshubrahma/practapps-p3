Mr. Flores, an arborist, longs for the open air, but does not dare set foot outside. He was supposed to report to the immigration authorities last month to be deported to his homeland, Mexico, but one day before his report date, he took refuge in the church. His family is why he is fighting to remain, and when they visited him in the church recently, his    son, Javier Jr. parked on his lap. The boy often refuses to leave his fatherâ€™s side, and has ended up staying for days with him in the church.
