In 2010, Roger Grooters, 66, set out by bicycle from California to raise money for victims of the BP oil spill, and was just days away from completing his   trip when he was hit and killed by a pickup truck near Crystal Lake, Fla. The Pensacola News Journal reported. For Mr. Baumer, he had set up a crowdfunding campaign to draw attention to environmental problems and to benefit the FANG Collective, a   group that has opposed fracking. It has since raised more than $20, 000.
