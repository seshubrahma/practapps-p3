Democratic presidential candidate reappeared on the campaign trail and delivered a speech after taking three days off following her collapse in New York City. ["As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia," she said, referring her coughing and choking speech which she fought through on Labor Day. (At the time, her campaign blamed allergies for her struggles.)   Clinton admitted although she tried to "power through" her illness, she decided that three days of rest would be good for her.
