Tension is  . I’m hearing conflicting stories about what happened and different opinions on the police shooting. Some people are saying "y’all took some of ours, now we took some yours" and other people are saying "it’s sad" and that the police who got killed didn’t deserve it. The police are telling people not to protest tonight, but the folks I’m talking to say that they aren’t stopping.
