Several dozen demonstrators gathered outside the West Hollywood Sheriff’s Station on Thursday evening to protest Mayor Lindsey Horvath’s attempt to ban Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump from speaking in town. [Horvath argued on CNN earlier this week that Trump’s political speech is "hate speech," not constitutionally protected free speech.
