The other Americans killed were Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, State Department IT specialist Sean Smith, and former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty, who was also a CIA contractor but assigned to Tripoli.   Doherty led a team from Tripoli to assist the personnel at Benghazi, who were defending against multiple attacks, first to the American diplomatic compound, where Stevens and Smith were killed, and then at the CIA annex less than two miles away. Woods and Doherty were killed in the same mortar attack upon their rooftop position after eight hours of combat. Trump said he was honored to receive the endorsement from Woods.
