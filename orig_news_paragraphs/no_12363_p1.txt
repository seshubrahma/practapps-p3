[The State and Treasury Departments both told Breitbart News that the U. S. government transferred the remaining $1. 3 billion, which was part of the same settlement for which the $400 million was an initial payment in January. However, despite numerous requests, neither State nor Treasury would provide an answer on how the Obama administration allegedly transferred to Iran the remaining $1. 3 billion.   It is not clear whether the $1. 3 billion was similarly delivered to Iran in the same spy   fashion as the $400 million  —   in cash pallets of foreign currency.   If the money was not transferred in cash, that could raise questions about President Obama’s explanation that cash was necessary because there was no banking relationship.
