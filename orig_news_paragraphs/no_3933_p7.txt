Last summer, about 80 people joined the typical session in Orlando since January, the number now averages 170. There are now 350 people on a wait list for an   class in Phoenix, and the citizenship efforts there have more than doubled between December and February, climbing from 30 to 80 participants at each session. The Kochâ€™s LIBRE Initiative is also continuing to push for amnesty for the more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the U. S. with immigration hawks citing that there are most likely about 30 million illegal immigrants.
