The sale includes 50     737 planes and 30     777 aircraft. The first airplanes are scheduled for delivery in 2018, with the entire order being fulfilled over 10 years. In a statement, Boeing said the deal would support tens of thousands of American jobs directly associated with production and delivery of the airplanes, and nearly 100, 000 jobs in the broader aerospace industry in the United States. For nearly four decades, no American companies could engage in significant business with Iran, which officially considers the United States an archenemy.
