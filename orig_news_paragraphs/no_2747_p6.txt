Mr. Tillerson met with Mr. Trump for more than two hours on Saturday at Trump Tower in New York, and two of the   â€™s key advisers, his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his    Jared Kushner, have told Mr. Trump that Mr. Tillerson is in a "different league" from his other options. But Mr. Trump is famously mercurial and could change his mind before making his final decision public. A transition spokesman, Jason Miller, declined to comment.
