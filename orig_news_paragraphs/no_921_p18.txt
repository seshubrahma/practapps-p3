Mr. Bharara broadened the office’s global reach, prosecuting international terrorists, drug lords and money launderers. What might have been the biggest case got away in 2010 when the Obama administration dropped plans to bring five Guantánamo Bay detainees, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, to Manhattan for a civilian trial on charges of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks. But Mr. Bharara’s prosecutors won major convictions against terrorists like Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a    of Osama bin Laden and one of his spokesmen Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, the first Guantánamo detainee to be tried in the civilian system and Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani immigrant who in 2010 tried to detonate a car bomb in Times Square. All three men received life sentences.
