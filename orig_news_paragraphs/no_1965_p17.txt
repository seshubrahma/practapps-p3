The dilemma sharpened in the following months as   Somali government forces got into trouble and required "collective  " airstrikes to bail them out, even though no American advisers faced direct threat. The emerging pattern, officials said, brought to the surface an inherent conflict between two principles of Mr. Obamaâ€™s counterterrorism strategy: his effort to impose constraints on airstrikes outside war zones, as reflected in the 2013 rules, and his "light footprint" approach of building up and working with partner forces rather than using American forces to occupy countries. One problem, the officials said, is that the 2013 rules were written against the backdrop of operations at the time in Yemen, in which drones based abroad flew over the country, took planned shots and flew out again. But when American advisers are on the ground working with partners, as they are in Somalia, both the Americans and their partners attract fire or get into combat situations and need to be defended.
