 (CNN) A top North Carolina Trump staffer has stepped down amid allegations he pulled a gun on a fellow campaign staffer. In a civil case filed late Wednesday in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, former North Carolina Trump campaign staffer Vincent Bordini alleges that Earl Phillip, then the campaign’s state director, pulled a gun on him as the pair drove to a hotel near Greenville, South Carolina. They were in town in February to check on other campaign members during that state’s primary.
