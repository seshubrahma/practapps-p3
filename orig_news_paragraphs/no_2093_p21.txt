In July, the Justice Department released a report on its enforcement of the federal law since 2010, which detailed the growing proportion of cases involving mosques. It also found that while 84 percent of   investigations were resolved without a lawsuit, only a fifth of cases involving Islamic institutions were similarly resolved. In Bernards Township, much of the initial resistance to the proposed mosque centered on parking. According to the federal complaint, the local ordinance required 50 parking spaces for houses of worship based on a    standard ratio, or an average of three people arriving in one car.
