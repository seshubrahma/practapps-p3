In the first operation, eight Yemeni, Saudi and Ethiopian hostages were freed and seven al Qaeda militants were killed.   In the second raid, Luke Somers, an American photojournalist, and South African citizen Pierre Korkie were both killed during the JSOC rescue attempt. The   raid had been in the planning stages for months under President Obama, but Obama didnâ€™t authorize the raid because the first moonless night in Yemen came on January 28 after he was out of office.   Second question: Should the Trump team have waited for the next moonless night in Yemen, which falls on February 26 and gathered more intelligence on the target in the interim?
