On Monday, FBI Director James Comey testified to the House of Representatives on the ongoing investigations of Russian links to the Trump administration and attempts to influence the 2016 election, including the role of Manafort as Trumpâ€™s campaign manager.    In response, Manafort issued a statement denying "any involvement with Russian government officials to undermine the interests of the United States. " Manafort has previously suggested that the Ukrainian allegations of corruption were part of an attempt by Leshchenko to blackmail him with compromising information about him and Trump.
