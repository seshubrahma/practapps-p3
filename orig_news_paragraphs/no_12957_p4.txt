okay however, Bill Clinton is going to have to face the fact that he did sign a crime bill into law that got thousands of black men locked up where they couldn’t raise their sons or raise their daughters. They’re still in jail locked up today because of the harsh crime bill. I’m not giving anybody a pass to commit a crime, but in that crime bill you had people who didn’t even have a good ounce of marijuana still locked up today, but then you have people down there in Colorado selling drugs and they ain’t getting locked up.
