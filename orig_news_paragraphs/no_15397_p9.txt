Trump went on the offensive on Twitter Monday morning, hours before the hearing began, blaming the Obama administration for Flynnâ€™s security clearance and asking the committee to question Yates over leaking classified information to the media.   " General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration   but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that," Trump wrote, adding later, "Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W. H. Council. "
