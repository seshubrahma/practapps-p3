It could become a new version of the "Downfall" meme, also known as "Hitler finds out," which plays on the climactic scene of the 2004 biopic, showing the Führer in his bunker as he reacts to news of the perilous state of the German army in Berlin. The "Downfall" parodies use new subtitles to show Hitler "finding out" different kinds of bad news. The "Role Models" parody requires splicing clips into a video without dialogue   —   a task easily achieved with   software on most PCs.
