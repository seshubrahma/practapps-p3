A spokeswoman for Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, which will conduct confirmation hearings for Price, said: "Potential conflicts of interest and impropriety raise serious questions about any nominee’s fitness for the job, and Senator Wyden will consider those issues as a part of the Finance Committee’s thorough vetting process. " Phil Blando, a spokesman for Trump’s transition team, said Price "takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously. "
