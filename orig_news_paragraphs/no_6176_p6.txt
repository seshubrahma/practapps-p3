Another campus group, Baylor Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) dedicated to the founding principles of American exceptionalism, Christian ethics, and the best of Baylor tradition, shared a different perspective with Breitbart Texas. They oppose the sanctuary campus petition and "do not condone the actions of those who attempt to circumvent the law simply because it does not fit their ideology,"said Jathan Young, Baylor YCT chairman. He told Breitbart Texas they reject "any attempt by progressives to arbitrarily dismiss federal immigration laws. "
