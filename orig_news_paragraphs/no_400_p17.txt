At the other end of the scale are followers of Légitime Violence, a proudly fascist heavy metal band that announces its concerts to a vetted list of fans and performs songs like "Final Solution," which is as subtle as it sounds. Other extremist groups in Quebec include Atalante Québec Pegida Québec, which is an offshoot of a German group and Soldiers of Odin. Calling these groups "far right" may be a misnomer. The Fédération des Québécois de Souche says its members include people with different political beliefs, including socialists and libertarians.
