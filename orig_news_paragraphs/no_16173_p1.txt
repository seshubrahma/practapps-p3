The roster of speakers at the convention to officially nominate Donald Trump is a colorful mix of political leaders, entertainers, personalities and the candidate’s family members    in keeping with his campaign’s unorthodox style. The presumptive GOP nominee’s wife, Melania Trump, will speak on Monday, the convention’s opening night. Daughter Tiffany Trump and son Donald Trump Jr. will address the convention Tuesday evening. Trump’s younger son, Eric, will speak on Wednesday.
