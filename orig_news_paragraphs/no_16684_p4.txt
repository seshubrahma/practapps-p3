Have we ever witnessed a more compromised pair of candidates? How could such a great country not produce better options? These are two candidates whose spectacular failures and stark shortcomings are only overshadowed by the fact they have consistently evaded significant personal consequences while growing ever richer through calculated connections and deft manipulation of legal, political and financial systems.   Hillary is hobbled by her evasions and lack of transparency, deleted emails and haunting doubts about her   and role in complex fiascos such as Benghazi and Whitewater.
