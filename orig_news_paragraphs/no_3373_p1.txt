[The halt to the funding of the United Nations Population Fund  —   known as UNFPA   —   comes as Trump is scheduled this week to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the president’s    resort in Florida.   In January, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the "Mexico City Policy," which concerns U. S. aid for abortions overseas. The president updated the policy by directing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to implement a plan that expands the policy across all global health assistance funding.
