On Thursday, Kaine stopped by one of his   favorite spots in Herndon, Virginia: Jimmyâ€™s Old Town Tavern. Rolling up his sleeves, he poured a few beers for diners at the bar, only to once again be bombarded with questions. Following an interfaith panel in Sterling, Virginia, that same day, Kaine and an aide got into a white Kia sedan, sending reporters into a car chase through Northern Virginia neighborhoods and highways.
