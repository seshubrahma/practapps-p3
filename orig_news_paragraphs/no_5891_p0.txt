A spokesman for the Taliban terrorist group in Afghanistan told President Donald Trump in a recent letter it is time for the United States to withdraw its troops and leave the   country, noting that peace will be elusive. [Under former    Barack Obama, a top spokesman for the U. S.  mission in Afghanistan suggested to Pentagon reporters in October 2016 that the American military and their Afghan counterparts may never defeat the Taliban, adding that the ultimate goal is a "negotiated solution" and reconciliation between the terrorist group and the Afghan government.   The Taliban has repeatedly claimed victory over the U. S.  foreign troops and their Afghan allies. In the letter to journalists, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid warned President Trump that, as long as the U. S.  coalition remains on Afghan soil, peace will be difficult to attain, reports the Associated Press (AP).
