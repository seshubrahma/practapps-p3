Donald Trump said that we are facing a massive problem with Russia if Democrats continue to lead U. S. foreign policy. Trump proposed meeting with Vladimir Putin after he is elected but before he takes office in order to cool tensions. ["Frankly, if we got along with Russia, and knocked out ISIS, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said Monday on Michael Savage’s radio show, adding:  Now, if there’s anything with Russia, they say Russia loves Donald Trump. Putin loves Donald Trump.
