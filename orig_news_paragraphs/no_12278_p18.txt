" Eli Stokols, a national politics reporter for Politico, was registered as a Democrat when he lived in Colorado. His voter registration form from when he lived in Denver, Colorado, obtained by Breitbart News, shows he was registered as a Democrat for at least approximately three years â€”  from his registration on Dec. 5, 2005, until his last recorded vote on Nov. 4, 2008, when President Barack Obama was elected. Stokols has not responded to a request for comment from Breitbart News on the matter.
