The first call came from a woman with a phone number out of Galveston, Texas at 7:07 p. m. (transcript follows audio): [inaudible]   …    from the Ted Cruz campaign, calling to get to a precinct captain, and it has just been announced that Ben Carson is taking a leave of absence from the campaign trail , so it is very important that you tell any Ben Carson voters that for tonight, uh, that they not waste a vote on Ben Carson, and vote for Ted Cruz. He is taking a leave of absence from his campaign.
