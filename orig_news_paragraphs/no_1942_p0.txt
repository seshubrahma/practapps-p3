WASHINGTON   â€”      Donald J. Trump is expected to select as commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor who became known as the "king of bankruptcy" for buying, restructuring and selling off steel makers and other fading industrial companies, officials on the transition team said on Thursday. After choosing national security   for some of his earliest appointments, Mr. Trump is now turning to a group of ultrawealthy conservatives to help steer administration policy.
