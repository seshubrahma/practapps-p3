Calling himself "the greatest   that God ever created," Mr. Trump pledged to continue leaning on American companies to keep jobs in the United States. He took particular aim at the pharmaceutical industry, which he said "has been disastrous" and had been "getting away with murder" on drug pricing. Taking on a powerful lobby that Republicans have long defended, Mr. Trump said he wanted the federal government to use its purchasing power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid   â€”   a proposal long favored by Democrats.
