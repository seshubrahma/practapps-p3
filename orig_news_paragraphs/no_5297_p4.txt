After a week that has brought California’s crumbling infrastructure into focus —  as back to back storms threatened the nation’s tallest dam in Oroville, California, and forced Gov. Brown to request Federal Emergency Funds from President Trump —   Brown and Democrat legislators have come under scathing criticism for squandering money on benefits for illegal aliens and public sector unions at the expense of   infrastructure. Only California Democrats would launch a new social program with no specific details or any identifiable funding source in a state that is perpetually broke, and where ObamaCare is unpopular with over 46% of voters —  including a lot of Democrats. Calls for comment by Breitbart News were not returned. Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman.
