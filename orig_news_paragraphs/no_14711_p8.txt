And then, why did they behave so badly? I spend most of my weekdays in conversation with students, and I know theyâ€™re upset by the election of a bigoted man to the White House, someone who consistently derided Mexicans (among others) during his run for the presidency. That he is a   serial assaulter of women remains a point of agitation for many, even if he insists his account of this behavior was just   talk. His bullying tactics with anyone who opposes him or his ideas have rattled students, who see him as the antithesis of what people in the "academic village" consider appropriate in presidential behavior.
