The suspect had rented an apartment for one week, paying about $1, 830, in a   neighborhood just four subway stops from the Louvre. Two days after arriving in Paris, he bought two     knives at an arms store in central Paris for about $730, according to the authorities. France has suffered more terrorist attacks and attempted attacks in recent years than any other country in Europe, and security officials believe that the country and especially its police and military forces, remain a target of choice for Islamic extremists. Some of those attacks involve knives and were carried out by people who say they were inspired by the example of the Islamic State even if they had never traveled to Syria or Iraq or sworn allegiance to the organization.
