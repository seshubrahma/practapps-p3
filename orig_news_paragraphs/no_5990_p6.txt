The fashion world has been split over its reception to Melania Trump, after eight years in which nearly every designer in the world wanted to work with and create clothing for First Lady Michelle Obama. Shortly after Trumpâ€™s victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, American designer Sophie Theallet urged her fellow designers not to design for the future First Lady. " As one who celebrates and strives for diversity, individual freedom and respect for all lifestyles, I will not participate in dressing or associating in any way with the next First Lady," Theallet wrote.
