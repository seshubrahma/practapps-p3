The exception was 2000, when Democrats’ advantage among younger voters shrank, with Al Gore narrowly topping George W. Bush among voters under 30 by just 2 points. Younger voters were a key component of Barack Obama’s winning coalition in 2008, and while they generally broke in Obama’s favor again in 2012, Obama lost ground among younger whites, dampening his margin among the   voter set. The GenForward study, from the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the   Center for Public Affairs Research, drilled down into racial and ethnic divisions among younger voters, finding Trump’s support among black, Asian and Hispanic youth in the single digits, while he carries about a quarter of younger white voters. Black and Hispanic youth who back Clinton are far more likely to describe their vote as one of support for the former Secretary of State, while white and Asian young adults who favor her mostly say they are expressing opposition to Trump.
