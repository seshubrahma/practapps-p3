Somebody had slipped me a document I   had long coveted: the membership list of Harvard’s Committee on   University Resources. The university wooed more than 400 of its   biggest givers and most promising prospects by putting them on   this committee and inviting them to campus periodically to be   wined, dined, and subjected to lectures by eminent professors. ’ ’    My idea was to figure out how many children of these corporate   titans, oil barons, money managers, lawyers,     consultants and   heirs had gone to Harvard.
