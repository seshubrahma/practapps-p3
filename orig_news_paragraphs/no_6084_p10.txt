Buchanan, when he took the stage, noted there were over 5, 000 RSVPs to the town hall —  which originally was going to be in a local college auditorium but changed to this venue to accommodate the larger crowd size. The nearly 2, 000 people inside, with the exception of conservatives and Trump supporters mixed throughout the crowd, regularly shouted down Buchanan’s answers to questions, screaming their dissatisfaction with the GOP congressman’s ardent support of President Trump. For nearly an hour and a half, with a couple of exceptions, Buchanan was zinged with rough question after rough question —  all with the grand design of attempting to pit him against the newly elected GOP president. Repeatedly, the progressive activists packed throughout the venue shouted nasty,   pejoratives at Buchanan.
