After testy town halls for representatives like Utah’s Rep. Jason Chaffetz and Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa went viral, some GOP politicians are staying clear of town   events in their home districts.   California Republican Rep. Paul Cook is probably yearning for the old days of angry letters and phone calls. Missing congressman notices have been photographed on milk cartons and posted to the @WhereIsPaulCook Twitter account and website.   Even the lactose intolerant of Cook’s district have been alerted to his "disappearance" via almond milk containers.
