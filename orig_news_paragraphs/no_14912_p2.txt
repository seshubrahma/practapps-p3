" US and Israeli officials said that Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s special representative on peace negotiations, made clear during the talks, which built on another round of meetings in the Middle East earlier in the month, that the President wants Israel to slow settlement construction and doesn’t want such activity to jeopardize efforts to restart the peace process. The Trump administration has told Israel to build within the boundaries of existing settlements and not to establish new communities, according to the sources. Soon after Trump took office, Netanyahu announced that Israel would establish the first new settlement in some two decades.
