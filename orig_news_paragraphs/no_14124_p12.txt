Critics of the executive actions say President Trump doesnâ€™t have the constitutional authority to carry it out and that pressuring cities to deport illegal immigrants could tear families apart.    The other actions the president announced yesterday: add thousands of U. S. border patrol agents and thousands of other government officials to deport undocumented immigrants.   This would require congressional approval to pay for. And something the president repeatedly promised to do while campaigning    build a physical border wall between the U. S. and Mexico.
