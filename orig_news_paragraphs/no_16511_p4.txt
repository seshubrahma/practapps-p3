"Using broad search terms, we have identified approximately 30 documents potentially responsive to a   request," spokesman John Kirby said in a statement to CNN. " At this time, we have not confirmed that the documents are, in fact, responsive, or whether they are duplicates of materials already provided to the Department by former Secretary Clinton in December 2014."     The department is assessing 14, 900 documents it received from the FBI as part of the investigation into Clintonâ€™s use of her private email server while she was secretary of state.
