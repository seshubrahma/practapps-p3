Several members of the Yale College Republicans have resigned and set up a new organisation after the group officially endorsed Donald Trump for president. [In a statement on the Yale College Republicans Facebook page, the group said, "While not every member of our organization supported Trump in the primary, as an organization and branch of the GOP we support Republicans up and down the ballot. And yes, that includes supporting Donald Trump for president. We remain dedicated to achieving victory in the White House, here in Connecticut, and in our hometowns. "
