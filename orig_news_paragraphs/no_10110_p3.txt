Several local media outlets came out to cover the rally and one demonstrator said that a Reuters reporter came out to cover the event as well. Retired Marine Jeff Schwilk worked with other Trump supporters to plan the action in less than two days. Schwilk told Breitbart News: We were honored to rally for the Marines and Veterans at the main gate of Camp Pendleton today and to celebrate Veterans Day and the election of our new, strong Commander in Chief, Donald Trump. We were able to talk to several active duty Marines at the rally who told us that Trump had and has overwhelming support among active duty Marines.
