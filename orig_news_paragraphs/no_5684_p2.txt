Kushner may have thought firing Comey would be a "win" for Trump because Democrats blamed Comey for costing Hillary Clinton the election. But the media never granted Trump a honeymoon period and will not give him automatic "wins" because they consider him an illegitimate outsider. And, as Kushner is finding out, because he is regarded as Trump’s top adviser, Kushner will always be in the media’s crosshairs no matter how much he tries to "moderate" Trump or court and charm the media. After media outlets initially reported that a White House official in Trump’s inner circle was a "person of interest" in the FBI’s Russia investigation, the Washington Post last Friday dropped a supposed "bombshell" report naming Kushner as the "person of interest" who allegedly wanted a "back channel" to communicate with Russian officials.
