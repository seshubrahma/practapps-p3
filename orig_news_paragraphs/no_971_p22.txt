The Times has reported that law enforcement agencies are investigating contacts between some associates of Mr. Trump and Russian figures and had access to intercepted communications. Other news reports cited by Mr. Trump on Wednesday night and Mr. Spicer on Thursday repeated   claims that a secret foreign intelligence court had approved a surveillance order involving Mr. Trump in October. Reporters from The Times have not been able to corroborate the existence of such an order. The British assertions came from a Fox News commentator, Andrew Napolitano.
