Kaine and Pence emerge from the debate with near identical and   favorability ratings, but Kaine appears to have taken a hit among those who watched. Pence, meanwhile, boosted his numbers somewhat.   Pence was largely seen as the more likeable candidate on the stage, 53% to 37% and nearly all of the movement in Kaineâ€™s favorability rating   was toward the negative side: His unfavorable rating rose from 28% among this same group of debate watchers when they were interviewed   to 40% after, while his favorability number held about even at 55%. For Pence, his favorability rating bumped up 7 points to 57% from 50%  .
