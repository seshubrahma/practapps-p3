Matthew Haller, senior vice president for public affairs and communications at the International Franchise Association, of which Mr. Puzder is a board member, said Mr. Puzder saw "a role for government to provide advice to employers, rather than simply deterrence by ‘gotcha’ enforcement," an allusion to the Obama Labor Department’s enforcement of laws and regulations in the   industry. Mr. Haller and other allies of Mr. Puzder said that those who took the time to look beyond his most provocative statements would find the wisdom of a man who has toiled on labor issues for years. " His position on the minimum wage is more nuanced than people want to give him credit for," Mr. Haller said.
