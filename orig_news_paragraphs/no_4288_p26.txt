I know you feel the same horror as we do at these ludicrous feminist antics, with additional embarrassment on behalf of your gender. I do recognize it isnâ€™t your fault that you happen to share a gender, one of the actual two genders, with batshit crazy,     and deeply unhappy feminist harpies. There is even more to love about Cal Poly! You have a freedom of speech loving President named Jeffrey Armstrong, who has made the brave decision to take a stand against   crybabies, and follow the path of the University of Chicago instead of the University of Missouri.
