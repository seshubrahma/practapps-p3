 (CNN) As President Barack Obama prepares to turn the White House over to   Donald Trump, he’s offering some advice to his successor. " One thing I’ve said to him directly, and I would advise my Republican friends in Congress and supporters around the country, is just make sure that as we go forward certain norms, certain institutional traditions, don’t get eroded, because there’s a reason they’re in place," Obama told CBS News’ Steve Kroft in a taped interview for "60 Minutes."
