Gulen runs a network of charter schools in the United States and has come under FBI investigation for fiscal mismanagement. The last interaction between Trump and Erdogan occurred this week, when the heads of state spoke in a phone call regarding the Syrian civil war and President Trump congratulated Erdogan on the referendum victory. " I believe Trump will do what President Obama failed to do in this regard," Erdogan said in an interview on Thursday regarding Gulenâ€™s potential extradition.
