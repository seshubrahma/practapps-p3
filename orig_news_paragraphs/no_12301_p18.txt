But as Clinton Cash revealed, and as Wikileaks has now confirmed, the Clintons and their entourage  —   including Podesta   —   courted Russian business and patronage. Clinton allowed the State Department to approve the infamous Uranium One deal, which placed 20% of U. S. uranium resources in the hands of a Russian firm controlled by Putin  —   greased by a Clinton Foundation donation. It is horrific to watch Russia march across land frontiers in Europe as if international law simply did not exist, and to watc assist the Assad regime’s mass murder.
