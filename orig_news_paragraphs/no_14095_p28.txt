The Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey comes out every year.   What it does is compare median house prices with median household incomes in a given area.   The more than house prices exceed incomes, the more unaffordable a place is considered.    For the ninth year straight, Hong Kong came in as the most unaffordable place to live on a list of 406 major city markets.
