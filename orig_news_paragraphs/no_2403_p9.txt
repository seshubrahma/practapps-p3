For all of the limits to our access on the trail, Mr. Trump agreed to sit for portraits with me on three occasions over the course of the campaign. During those sessions he was always cordial and mostly agreeable, but he had very firm ideas about how he wanted to be shown. My biggest challenge was getting past his standard repertoire of poses and the   that he seems to favor the most. At a shoot in his campaign headquarters, his staff members lent a hand and cheered him on as we tossed pounds of red and blue confetti over him.
