Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, said that many conservatives felt Mr. Trump spoke to them with that line in a way that other Republican nominees, like Mitt Romney, had been too timid to pursue. Mr. Romney barely spoke about abortion at all in the 2012 general election and when he did, it was often in the context of how he did not support further restrictions. " If you feel like your side is being pushed around and then someone comes around and says, ‘I may not be one of you, but I’m going to defend your views,’ they see that as loyalty," Mr. Domenech said.
