The regulatory retrenchment is unfolding on multiple fronts. Congress, with Mr. Trumpâ€™s approval, has erased three   rules in the last month, lifting regulations related to coal mining and oil and gas exploration, as well as the sale of guns to the mentally ill. More than 25 more rules could also be erased in the coming weeks the House has already voted to eliminate nearly half. Mr. Trump has separately signed executive orders directing agencies to pursue the reversal of other rules, including a requirement that financial advisers act in the interest of their clients, and a rule aimed at protecting drinking water from pollution.
