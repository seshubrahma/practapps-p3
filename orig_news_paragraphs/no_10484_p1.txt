According to the Associated Press, about a dozen students of the nearly 120 in attendance began chanting "Trump, Trump!" after Dallas   lost in a   game to Perry. Steve Watson, activities director at DCG, said that the chant went on for only a few iterations of the candidateâ€™s name before school administrators shut it down. Citing privacy concerns, Watson also refused to identify any of the chanters or say whether or not there was to be any disciplinary actions taken against them. Perry coach Ned Menke said neither he nor his staff heard the chants but some of his players told him they had heard it and had taken offense.
