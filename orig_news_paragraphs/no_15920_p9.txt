Searches are being carried out at a residential address in the Cardiff area in Wales, a Met Police statement said.      Police said they believe the attacker acted alone, despite earlier reports from witnesses, who said they saw two other people flee the scene.     Extra officers have been deployed to "reassure communities, especially those observing Ramadan," according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan.     The Prime Minister said police decided to treat the incident as a terror attack within eight minutes of receiving the first emergency call.
