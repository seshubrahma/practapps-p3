While searching for the logging crew, two GEF members stumbled across a tractor used for hauling felled trees. A chain saw, still warm from being used minutes earlier, was left stuck in a tree, evidence of a hasty getaway. The unit set fire to the tractor and chain saw before resuming the search for the loggers. Nerves were on edge.
