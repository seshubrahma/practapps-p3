Cameron, 39, operates Texas Border Tours and runs a small fleet of   vehicles that take tourists on a rugged,   chance to see the   border up close.

He can’t say definitively that the men were smuggling drugs into the United States, but he’s says he’s seen enough to know that that’s probably what was happening. The Rio Grande Valley in South Texas is one of the country’s busiest drug smuggling and crossing points for undocumented immigrants.
