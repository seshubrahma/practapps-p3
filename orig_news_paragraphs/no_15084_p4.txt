The new initiative comes on the heels of a meetings between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the President’s    resort, where trade and North Korea’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons were at the top of the agenda. The proposed executive order is Trump’s latest attempt to follow through on his campaign pledge to go after other countries that take advantage of US trade policies. In late March, the President signed two executive orders aimed at combating foreign trade abuses that contribute to the United States’    trade deficit. Those orders initiate a   review of the causes of the US trade deficits with some of America’s largest trading partners and also require stricter enforcement of US   laws to prevent foreign manufacturers from undercutting US companies by selling goods at unfair prices.
