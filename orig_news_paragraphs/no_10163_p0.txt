Being Donald Trump’s running mate "extremely undesirable to me, as is any government post"    @RealBenCarson https:  .   Monday on CNN’s "New Day," former Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson, a former candidate for the Republican nomination now supporting presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, discussed Trump’s search for a running mate for this fall’s general election.   Carson said he had been misrepresented in a report that alleged he had revealed Trump’s potential running mates. However, when asked if he was interested in being Trump’s VP pick, Carson dismissed the suggestion.
