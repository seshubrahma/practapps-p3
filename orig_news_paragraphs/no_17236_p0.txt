Washington (CNN) Democratic senators are pressing the Obama administration to more forthrightly state, based in part on new intelligence information, that Russia’s meddling in the US election was intended to help Donald Trump, multiple sources tell CNN. Multiple sources with knowledge of the investigation into Russia’s hacking say the US intelligence community is increasingly confident that Russian meddling in the US election was intended to steer the election toward Trump, rather than simply to undermine or in other ways disrupt the political process. The sources say there is some new information but would not specify due to the classified nature of the intelligence.
