In 2016, Clinton has received 12, 437, 734 votes so far. In the states that have already voted this cycle, when she ran and lost back in 2008, Clinton received 12, 727, 221 votes. Specifically, the data shows, Clinton has seen a decline of 273, 321 votes from 2008 to 2016 among states that have already voted this cycle. That 2. 15 percent decrease nationally is exacerbated in several key states that Clinton would need to win to secure the presidency in a general election, suggesting that she’s extraordinarily weak on the electoral college scale nationally —  and that whoever wins the GOP nomination will likely be able to thump her in the general in November.
