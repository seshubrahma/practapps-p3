New York (CNN) A Russian lawyer investigating an alleged $230 million   scheme nearly died in March after he fell from his fourth floor apartment in Moscow. Itâ€™s unclear what caused the fall, but more than a year earlier, American prosecutors had feared that someone would try to "threaten or harm" that man, Nikolai Gorokhov, according to a recently unsealed federal court document. American investigators are preparing for a trial in May that will examine how stolen Russian cash allegedly made its way into New York City real estate, and Gorokhov, 53, was to be a witness.
