Despite never actually proving in any way, shape, or form that Hillary Clinton ever won the election, Mohajer then goes on to claim that the court system must now intervene to take away the presidency from legitimate   Donald J. Trump —  who will be inaugurated later this week. " It is   that in shaping equity decrees, federal courts are vested with broad discretionary powers, and a plethora of case law exists stating that courts may intervene to protect the integrity of free and fair elections," Mohajer writes. He cites a variety of court cases arguing that the courts have precedent —  and authority and duty —  to overturn Trump’s legitimate election as president.
