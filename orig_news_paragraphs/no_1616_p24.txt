Mr. Weisselberg, the Trump Organizationâ€™s chief financial officer, said that neither Mr. Trump nor the company were responsible for the debt associated with the limited partnerships. Still, as with all of the properties in which Mr. Trump holds an interest, the value of the buildings as well as the terms and magnitude of their debt could have a major impact on his personal fortune. Mr. Trump, Mr. Weisselberg added, was liable for a "small percentage of the corporate debt" listed on the federal filing but would not elaborate. Other instances in which Mr. Trump could be personally responsible can be found in public filings.
