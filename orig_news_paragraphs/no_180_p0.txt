In the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama is waging a final battle  â€”   not over legislation or a Supreme Court seat, but over how he will be remembered.

The president is aggressively telling his version, through a major speech broadcast on   TV, interviews and a forthcoming book. But   Donald J. Trump is telling a very different version, through tweets, speeches and news conferences.
