It sounds like a whole lot of signaling is going on here. Progressives are slipping into the "bargaining" stage of the grief process over Bernie Sanders, flexing their muscles and letting Clinton know they expect some concession, or else they’ll make trouble for her all the way through the convention.    The "beyond" part is a bit more of a stretch, and progressives might be fooling themselves by thinking they can do real populist damage to Hillary "$350, 000 Speech" Clinton by carping about her veep’s alleged bias toward Wall Street, because of a mortgage program not many voters truly understand. Also, the spectacle of banks buying mortgages isn’t exactly shocking to anyone who ever took out a mortgage.
