Like my Mom, the first in her family to go to college, and my Dad, who’s here tonight, who fled prison and torture in Cuba, coming to Texas with just $100 sewn into his underwear. And it is love that I hope will bring comfort to a grieving    girl in Dallas   —   and, God willing, propel her to move forward, and dream, and soar . . . and make her daddy proud.
