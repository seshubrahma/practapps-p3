In the summer of 2008, just before the real estate market crashed, Mr. Trump found his buyer: Mr. Rybolovlev, a former medical student who took his fertilizer company public in 2007 and later moved to Switzerland and Monaco. He had toured several homes in Palm Beach but hadnâ€™t found what he wanted. " I showed him five big oceanfront homes," said Carol Digges, a real estate broker representing Mr. Rybolovlev at the time.
