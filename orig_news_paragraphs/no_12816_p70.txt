Thanks to the hard work and heroism of Gen. Mattis, Gen. Mike Flynn, and all the other military officers in Trump’s orbit —  along with, of course, the efforts of all other   personnel and veterans —  those who don’t agree with Haidt are free to express their contrary opinion.    Yet in the meantime, those who agree with Trump, Mattis, Flynn, et al. are equally free to express their opinion. (Except, of course, on PC college campuses.)
