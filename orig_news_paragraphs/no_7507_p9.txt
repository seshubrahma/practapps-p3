Tillerson is a native of Wichita Falls, Texas. He attended University of Texas at Austin where he completed a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering just before joining Exxon Company, U. S. A. When Sarah Palin took office as governor of Alaska she took a hard stance with oil companies. Palin had beat out prior governor Frank Murkowski after news broke of sweetheart deals for oil companies under his leadership and several of his negotiators were indicted. Fortune reported that Palinâ€™s decision to not show up when Tillerson came to Juneau to meet with her early in her term shocked oil lobbyists.
