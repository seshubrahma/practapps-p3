Hillary Clinton arrived 37 minutes late for her speech to the American Legion conference in Cincinnati today, after rocking the night away at a fundraiser with Jimmy Buffett, Paul McCartney, and Jon Bon Jovi in the Hamptons in New York. [Conference organizers were forced to fill the time gap with music and videos while military veterans waited in the audience for her arrival. Clinton was scheduled to take the stage at noon, but it wasnâ€™t until 12:37 p. m. that a conference organizer introduced her.   She immediately launched into a series of speeches condemning Trump, a candidate who is popular with many military families.
