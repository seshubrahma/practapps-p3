Friedman said in a statement issued by Trump’s transition team announcing his nomination that he was looking forward to relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a provocative move that could threaten US relationships with Arab allies.   Friedman made the comments to Israeli TV in June, when he was advising Trump on Israel.   " What Mr. Trump believes is that any solution that Israel will propose, whether it’s a   solution or it’s some other creative, out of the box solution, which was designed to bring some incremental level of peace or tranquility to the region, he will be guided by what the Israelis want to pursue," Friedman told Israeli station Channel 2.
