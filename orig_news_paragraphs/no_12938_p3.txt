In border states, drug cartels have been able to work with impunity setting up their criminal empires that continually sent ton quantities of narcotics into every major U. S. city. As Breitbart Texas revealed, a study by the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration revealed that drug cartels have managed to have a presence and influence throughout the nation.   Mexico has seen a large increase in cartel violence and activity during Peña Nieto’s tenure leading to severe consequences for the United States in the border state of Tamaulipas. In the border city of Reynosa, the Gulf Cartel has been able to overwhelm the detention capabilities of the Department of Homeland Security thus creating a humanitarian crisis as thousands and thousands of Central American illegal immigrants are brought over the Rio Grande.
