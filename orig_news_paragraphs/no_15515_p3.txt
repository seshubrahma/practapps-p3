It was taped on Monday morning, prior to an explosive report by The New York Times that Trump had asked ousted FBI Director James Comey to end the investigation into Flynn.   Earlier this month, Yates testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism regarding the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, particularly Flynn’s contact with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.   Prior to Trump taking office, Flynn had discussed sanctions with the official.   During her testimony she said that, at the end of January, after reading the details of a Flynn interview with the FBI, she had called McGahn and warned him that Trump’s national security adviser could easily become a blackmail target for Russians based on the answers Flynn gave to the FBI.
