Providing   updates will be a drastic departure from standard election reporting that television networks, national newspapers and The Associated Press have rigidly adhered to for decades. Many news organizations refrain from publishing exit poll data about the likely winners in a state until a majority of polls there have closed. (Exit polls are based on surveys of voters as they leave polling stations, and they are considered a polling gold standard because only people who voted are questioned.) Though not legally bound to do so, news organizations have kept this information under wraps for fear of suppressing turnout and affecting   races if the presidential election were called before voting in most states had ended.
