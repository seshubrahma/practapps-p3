The four percent number comes from a sample which excluded the one or two percent of heterosexual Americans who say theyâ€™ve had relations within the last 12 months with a woman or a man who is trying to change sex.   The February survey of 2, 191 adults also showed that transgender people are often unwelcome in the much smaller gay and lesbian communities, which together comprised only 5 percent of the survey. Only eight percent of lesbians and just 10 percent of the gay men say they did have sex with a transsexual in the prior 12 months. Just   percent of gay men who have not had a relationship with a transsexual said they would be "very open" to dating a transgender man, and only 47 percent of them would be willing to tell their parents, said the survey.
