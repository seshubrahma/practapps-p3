McGinty launched attacks against opponent Sen. Pat Toomey    whom she will battle in November for a Pennsylvania seat    spotlighting his financial policy on a national stage. Given the big audience, our team decided McGinty’s claims deserved a   Reality Check. Former WH staffer becomes first transgender woman to address DNC, McGinty first emphasized Toomey’s   investment career, claiming he had "made his millions on Wall Street" before launching into specific criticisms of his economic policy. While Toomey has certainly benefited from the stock market, how much he’s made remains unclear.
