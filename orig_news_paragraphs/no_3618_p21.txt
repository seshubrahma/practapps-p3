Mr. Trump wore a yarmulke head covering when he became the first sitting U. S. president to visit the Wall. There are three main reasons we saw a brief shower of "Veil But No Headscarf" headlines: reporters noticed people were popping off about it on Twitter, they were hoping for a cheap "Islamophobia" hit, and they remembered Donald Trump criticizing Michelle Obama for not wearing a headscarf in Saudi Arabia. Try Googling stories about Melania and the headscarf from May 20th, and youâ€™ll see a string of stories from virtually every mainstream media organization recalling that Trump "attacked" or "slammed" Mrs. Obama for declining to wear one.
