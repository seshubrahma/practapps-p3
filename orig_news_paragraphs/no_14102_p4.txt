The reappearance of a controversy the Trump camp had thought was in the past was another sign of one of the Presidentâ€™s most dominant traits    an inability to accept any suggestion that he was unable to pull off a complete and total victory in any area of his life. The   controversies in the first five days of his presidency    including one about the size of his inaugural crowds     also hints at a deeper and consuming need to be demonstrated as legitimate that has driven Trump for decades and has sometimes been an Achilles heel. As so often, the steps Trump takes to try to satisfy his craving for respect and to be seen as a spectacular victor threaten to make that recognition ever more elusive. In this case, his refusal to accept that he lost the popular vote fair and square, despite winning the electoral college and the presidency, threatens to detract from another far more significant story    his sweeping use of executive power to live up to campaign promises and begin to change America.
