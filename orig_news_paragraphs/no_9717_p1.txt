["In short: Our invasion created the atmosphere for a Jordanian to start a Muslim sectarian war, which ultimately created ISIS," states an October 2, 2014 memo from Mike Ryan, policy director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).   The memo, titled, "ISIS Backgrounder," was clearly attempting to first blame the creation of the Islamic State on the Bush administration â€™s invasion of Iraq in 2003, a war supported by Clinton. IS did not exist as an organization until about June 2014.
