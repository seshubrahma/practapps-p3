What is the Justice Department’s inspector general probing?   The investigation will focus on how the FBI handled the Clinton email server investigation, particularly the agency’s public disclosures about the investigation in the middle of the presidential election. The review will examine whether Comey followed Justice Department and FBI policies when he took the unusual step of delivering a public statement explaining why his agency wouldn’t pursue criminal charges against Clinton. It was in that public statement that Comey said Clinton was "extremely careless" in her handling of emails.
