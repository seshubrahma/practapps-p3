We have   advantages because we have a community [at our hotels]. You’’re   not alone in somebody’’s extra bedroom or house that they’’ve left   behind. You’’re around folks you can see in the lobby or at the   bar or restaurant. You can talk to people who are there who   will say, "Here’’s my favorite restaurant," or "What kind of   restaurant do you want to go to?"
