With the ringing of a bell, the thousands who gathered in Lower Manhattan fell silent on Sunday, and all that could be heard was the water cascading in the reflecting pools where the World Trade Center towers once stood. It was 8:46 a. m. the moment when, 15 years earlier, a plane struck the north tower. Family members of the victims bowed their heads, some crying and embracing, while others stood tall, looking up at the overcast skies. About 8, 000 people crowded the National September 11 Memorial plaza at the World Trade Center for what has become an annual ritual: the reading of the names of the 2, 977 people killed in the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, and of the six killed in the bombing of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993.
