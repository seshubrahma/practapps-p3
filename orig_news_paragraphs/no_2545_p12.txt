Israelâ€™s settlement project, once a scattering of houses across the   Green Line marking the borders before the 1967   war, has grown substantially over the years. In 2009, the year Mr. Obama took office, 297, 000 people lived in West Bank settlements and 193, 737 in East Jerusalem. That increased to 386, 000 in the West Bank by the end of last year and 208, 000 in East Jerusalem by the end of 2014, according to Peace Now, a group that opposes settlements. Israeli officials note that when Mr. Netanyahu acquiesced to a   settlement freeze sought by Mr. Obama in 2009, the Palestinians still did not agree to negotiate until just before time ran out.
