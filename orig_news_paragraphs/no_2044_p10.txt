But in the center of the gallery, set up as a cross between throne room and a chapel, she sits, nearly   carved in pale stone, looking youthful and lithe in a sleek sheath dress. Works melding features of goddess and queen stretch across cultures and account for some of the Met’s most glamorous images. Dash upstairs to Gallery 240 in the Met’s Asian Wing and you ’ll find another in a fabulous South Indian bronze temple sculpture of the goddess Parvat, her arms like vines, her hands like flowers.
