COLUMBUS, Ind.   â€”    Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, the Republican   nominee, suggested Saturday that he might release his tax returns before Election Day, even as his running mate has shown no inclination of doing the same. Breaking with campaign custom, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, has refused to release his returns.
