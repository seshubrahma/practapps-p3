Donald J. Trump was officially declared the winner of the presidential election in Michigan on Monday amid calls for a recount there and in two other states. Mr. Trump, a Republican, defeated Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, by 10, 704 votes in the state, or less than a quarter of a percentage point, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers announced, nearly three weeks after the Nov. 8 election. The results, should they hold, bring his Electoral College vote total to 306, well beyond the 270 needed to win. Mrs. Clinton has 232.
