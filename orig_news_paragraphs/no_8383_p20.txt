Zuckerberg has a lobbying arm that aggressively pushes a radical leftwing open border immigration agenda. As Breitbart’s Julia Hahn reported: In 2015, Zuckerberg threw his support behind an immigration bill known as the Immigration Innovation Act, which would have allowed for a virtually unlimited expansion of Muslim migration. Rutgers University Professor Hal Salzman has also explained that the   bill would flood the labor market with enough foreign workers that employers could fill at least 100 percent of their   tech hires with foreign workers instead of American workers. In fact, Zuckerberg has even used his lobbying firm to try to hoodwink conservatives into signing on to his leftwing immigration agenda: In the past, Zuckerberg’s lobbying firm has sought to influence conservative voters who oppose Zuckerberg’s immigration agenda.
