Earlier Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that "the president is evaluating the situation" about Mr. Flynn’s future. By Monday evening, Mr. Flynn’s fortunes were rapidly shifting  —   his resignation came roughly seven hours after Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump had "full confidence" in the retired general. And when he did step down, it happened so quickly that his resignation does not appear to have been communicated to National Security Council staff members, two of whom said they learned about it from news reports. Officials said Mr. Pence had told others in the White House that he believed Mr. Flynn lied to him by saying he had not discussed the topic of sanctions on a call with the Russian ambassador in late December.
