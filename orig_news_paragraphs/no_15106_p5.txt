Feere also has been a strong critic of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program enacted by President Barack Obama via executive action that has granted protection from deportation to young immigrants brought to the country as children.    In one article published by CIS, Feere questioned whether children brought to the United States at an early age were sufficiently assimilated or loyal to this nation to be granted any type of legal status.   In a 2013 interview with The Washington Post, Mark Krikorian, executive director of CIS, worried about growing "multiculturalism" and contended that a "lot of immigration pushers donâ€™t like America the way it is" and want to change it.
