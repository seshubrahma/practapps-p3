So when Maher faced Yiannopoulos on Friday, did the HBO host press him on his view that college rape culture is a fiction and that women are often lying when they report being raped? Did Maher ask him about his   comment that "Jews run the media,"   or did he ask why Yiannopoulos wore a Nazi Iron Cross when he was younger?   Did Maher press him on his demonization of transgender people as, in essence, sexual predators?   No.
