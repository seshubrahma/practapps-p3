Read the complete   poll results, About   of blacks and   of whites feel the system favors whites. Whites are sharply split by education level on this question, with 62% of whites who hold college degrees saying the system favors whites over blacks vs. just 42% among whites who do not have college degrees. And urbanites are more apt to say the system is discriminatory than are suburban or rural Americans: 62% who live in urban areas say so, above the 53% of suburbanites and 38% of rural residents who say the same. The share describing discrimination against blacks generally as a very serious problem has inched up from 37% last June to 42% now, a high point during Obamaâ€™s time in office.
