It’s a disgrace. And everybody who was   involved in that culture should be held accountable. And there is   no way they should walk out of that place with millions, tens of   millions, tens and tens of millions of dollars, when innocent   people who actually flagged this culture of conceit and culture   of rip off should’ve been fired while the people who were doing   it somehow are able to just resign and reap the big reward. It’s   just an outrage.
