I now know that Panda was Seth Rich. Panda advised me that he was working on voter analytics tools and other technologies that the Internet Party may find helpful. I communicated with Panda on a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics. I was referring to what I knew when I did an interview with Bloomberg in New Zealand in May 2015.
