After talking to experts, I have the sense that there’s considerable confidence that Russia is the culprit, but more doubt about whether Putin gave the order and about whether the aim was to benefit Trump or simply to create havoc. " I think the most likely explanation is that someone in Russian intelligence, probably very high up, decided to help Donald Trump," said Benjamin Wittes, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, but he added that there’s no solid evidence for this. One reason for caution is that history shows that "intelligence community" is sometimes an oxymoron.
