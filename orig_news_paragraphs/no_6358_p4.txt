A poll conducted by the University of California Berkeley in January found that in the state of California, where sanctuary cities are particularly prominent, 74 percent would like to see them abolished. In February, the stateâ€™s   legislature proposed a bill to make California a "sanctuary state," although it could risk the loss of federal funding if it does so. The issue of "sanctuary cities" was a major theme in the 2016 presidential election. On July 1, 2015, a young woman, Kate Steinle, was shot and killed while walking on a pier with her father by an illegal alien who had several felony convictions and had been deported several times already.
