I poured all my energies into my studies, becoming a   student and scoring at the highest levels on standardized tests. I can speak six languages. I held internships with Sen. Marco Rubio,   who has been a supporter of immigration reform, and I am a member of McKinsey   Co. â€™s Leadership Development Program.
