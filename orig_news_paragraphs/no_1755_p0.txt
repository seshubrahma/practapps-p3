The artist Pedro Reyes is a biting social critic whose pieces often hold out hope   —   in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary   —   that things will get better. In "Palas por Pistolas" ("Shovels for Guns") in 2008, he set up a program that allowed residents of Culiacán, Mexico, a city devastated by shootings, to trade in their guns for food stamps or household appliances the guns, more than 1, 500 of them, were melted down and turned into shovels.
