Yiannopoulos is typically invited to speak by conservative student organizations such as College Republicans and Turning Point USA.   He claims he charges no speaking fees and that his travel expenses are paid for by Breitbart News and wealthy donors. A handful of people also have started GoFundMe pages to cover the costs of hiring extra security for his events. Tickets usually sell out fast.
