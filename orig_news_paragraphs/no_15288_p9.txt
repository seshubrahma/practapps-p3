But while the two recent stories are alike in one way    exhibiting the exploitation of valued and ubiquitous platforms for nefarious and unwanted purposes    they represent quite different types of challenges for the social media companies that seek to patrol their own platforms to ensure that they fulfill their intended vision, and for all of us who use those platforms. There is no disagreement on what should happen to a violent video uploaded by a murderer: it should be taken down, as quickly as possible to prevent its viewing and reposting. The video violates every reputable social media platformâ€™s terms of service and no voice in our society calls for its protection.    When Americans, weary of seeing such violence online, ask tech companies to "fix this," the challenge for each platform is, in a sense, simple: to implement this consensus as effectively as possible.
