Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s team maintains there is no evidence that Russia hackings favored him in the presidential race, but a top adviser also said the   would not "interfere" in any congressional investigations into what happened. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Monday that Trump remains unconvinced that any breaches were part of an attempt to push Trump into the White House. She charged that media reports of a   attempt to boost the GOP nominee were based on unnamed sources and were unproven and partisan.
