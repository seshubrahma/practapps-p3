Thursday on CNN’s "Anderson Cooper 360," Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called into question the purpose of the Department of Justice naming Robert Mueller as a special counsel to investigate Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.   Dershowitz argued Mueller’s appointment would benefit Trump given that "collaborating with the Russians" to get elected wasn’t illegal and Mueller’s role would be to investigate illegalities. " [I] think he will be the beneficiary of the special prosecutor," Dershowitz said.
