This is not Washington 2004, where a recount reversed the result, handing Democrat Christine Gregoire a   win over Republican Dino Rossi after he initially had a   lead on election night. This is not Minnesota 2008, where a recount gave Democrat Al Franken a   win over Republican Norm Coleman, reversing Colemanâ€™s initial lead of 215 votes. All of these recounts had one significant fact in common: the margin of victory was in the hundreds, not thousands. And the shifts in vote totals after the recounts were very small.
