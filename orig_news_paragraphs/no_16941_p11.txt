(Trump has bragged as much, claiming he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would stand with him.)   And even if Trump never went that far, his attacks on "SNL" could have a chilling effect. Comedians, fearing both his social media presence and the wrath of the millions of his Twitter followers, could remain silent on all   matters.   I pray "SNL" will not let Trumpâ€™s tweet deter it in its comedic mission.
