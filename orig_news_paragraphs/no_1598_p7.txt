—    when a Republican collapses into single digits among   and struggles with other minorities, it reduces the number of white votes a Democrat needs to win the presidency. That is what worries Republicans this year, particularly in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania with heavily black cities, where an NBC   Street   poll last week showed Mr. Trump receiving only 1 percent of the black vote. (The poll’s three percentage point margin of error among all voters suggests that his support could be slightly higher.)
