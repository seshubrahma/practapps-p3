Trump may be avoiding Canada    a traditional first foreign trip for a new president    for similar reasons. He’s not popular among Canadians, both in government and outside, though Prime Minister Trudeau has worked toward establishing pragmatic working ties. One person close to Trudeau said the liberal leader doesn’t feel slighted by Trump’s late RSVP to the invite he extended in November, despite the practices of past US presidents to visit Canada early in their tenures. Trudeau himself visited the White House on February 13 and put forward a show of comity, despite his deep differences with Trump on most policy matters.
