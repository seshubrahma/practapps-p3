The meeting will take place following an unexpected phone conversation between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first such conversation between the two world leaders. While the Chinese government has been repeatedly threatening Japan to cease seeking support abroad against the Chinese colonization of the Senkaku Islands, reports indicate the topic did not surface when Trump and Xi spoke, the two instead agreeing on the Chinese position dismissing the sovereignty of Taiwan, the "One China" policy. The official added that President Trump "believes he can get the measure of the people through more informal settings" and will likely "from time to time" invite other world leaders to spend time with him at   . Abe was the first world leader to meet with Trump in November following his election victory and has expressed extreme confidence in the Trump White House.
