After Trump first floated the idea of a Muslim ban during the campaign, Erdogan suggested his name be removed from the buildings. Those suggestions stopped after candidate Trump later said Erdogan shouldn’t be criticized for his crackdown after the failed coup. A senior State Department official characterized Tillerson’s meeting with Erdogan and his foreign minister as "a continuation of a series of   engagements with Turkey" by Trump and other members of his government.   Tillerson also discussed Iran, Syria, Iraq, trade and investment, and offered condolences on the Turkish loss of life to terrorism and appreciation for their work to defeat ISIS    raising the prospect of an uncomfortable exchange over the participation of the Kurds in Syria in this fight.
