We don’t make money’ Steve Deese, owner of Encore Boat Builders in Lexington, South Carolina, confirmed firing 21 employees who didn’t show up Thursday. Deese said they broke company policy by not giving notice and not calling in to say they would be away from work. The employees were given an opportunity to provide a doctor’s note, but failed to do so, he added. The company does not tolerate violations, no matter who the employees are, he said.
