His views on politics and war, In their concluding essay, in which Mattis and Schake variously quote the jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes the novelist Phil Klay founding father Samuel Adams and the Roman poet Juvenal, they make several key observations: First, since   American political leaders such as Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have deputized military leaders to make the political case for America’s wars. Bush left it to General David Petraeus to make the case to Congress and the American people that the 2007 "surge" of US troops into Iraq was turning the tide of the war. President Obama, in Mattis’ telling, "has been mostly silent on the war in Afghanistan since 2009 the case for continuing American troop presence has been made entirely by the military. "
