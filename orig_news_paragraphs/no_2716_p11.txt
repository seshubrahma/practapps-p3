" Actors and theater managers were held accountable to a vocal public  —   a public that did not vote merely with its feet but with eggs, rotten apples, peanut shells, pumpkins and even, according to one account, the occasional sheep carcass that was tossed onstage. Debate was allowed  —   between sections of the audience and between the audience and the actors   —   because the audience was understood to be a reflection of a diverse public, a public that had space to cheer, jeer, sing and debate together.
