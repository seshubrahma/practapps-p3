Cheryl Mills, a longtime confidant who is taking a lead role in the vetting process, and James Hamilton, a veteran Washington lawyer who is overseeing the teams of lawyers researching the candidates, joined Clinton last Thursday as she met with teams of lawyers researching the candidates. Clinton is leaning toward announcing her decision immediately after the Republican convention ends on July 21. But aides say she is leaving open the possibility of waiting until Democrats are already gathering for their convention in Philadelphia the following week to disclose her selection, hoping to stoke drama and build interest in the Democratic ticket. Clinton has been coy about her possible VP pick, pointing to the preparedness for the job, diversity and competence as top priorities.
