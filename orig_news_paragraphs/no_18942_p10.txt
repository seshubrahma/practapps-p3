Every     American stands in strong solidarity with the people of France,     and we say with one voice: we will not be intimidated. We will     never allow terrorists to undermine the egalitarian and     democratic values that underpin our very way of life. This     cowardly attack only strengthens our commitment to our alliance     and to defeating terrorism around the world. Our thoughts and     prayers are with the families of those killed and injured, and     with all our friends in France.
