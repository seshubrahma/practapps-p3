Miami’s Little Havana celebrates Castro’s death, "Sam suggested they not resort to firearms, but if he could be furnished with some type of potent pill, that could be placed in Castro’s food or drink," according to a "Secret   Eyes Only" CIA cable that was released in 2007 as part of a Freedom of Information Act request.   Cyanide pills were delivered via the mob’s contacts to the former Hilton Hotel in Havana, now nationalized and renamed the Hotel Habana Libre, the CIA documents show. It served chocolate milkshakes that Castro adored.
