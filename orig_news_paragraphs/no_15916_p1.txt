another indication of   turnout in the closely watched runoff for a House seat between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel.   And that’s leaving neither side confident of victory in what is likely to be a tight race for Georgia’s 6th Congressional District seat. The pool of early voters includes more than 36, 000 who did not participate in the April primary contest for the seat, which was vacated when former Rep. Tom Price became President Donald Trump’s health and human services secretary, according to the Georgia secretary of state’s office.   The early vote total soared past the 57, 000 who voted early in the primary, where Ossoff reached 48% just shy of the majority that would have avoided the runoff entirely.
