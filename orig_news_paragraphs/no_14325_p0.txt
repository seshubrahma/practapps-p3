Trump, who was outspoken on the campaign trail about the role    and upkeep    of the security pact, spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Sunday night.   During the call, the two leaders "reconfirmed the importance of the Alliance in troubled times," according to a statement from NATO.
