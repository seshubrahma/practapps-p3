In his tweet, Trump voiced support for the regional blockade of Qatar and cited Qatar’s funding of terrorist groups. The Qataris have rejected the   accusations.   Hours after Trump’s tweets, the US State Department said Qatar had made progress on stemming the funding of terrorists but that there was more work to be done. US and European authorities have complained for years about funding for extremists from Saudi Arabia and other nations in the Gulf region.
