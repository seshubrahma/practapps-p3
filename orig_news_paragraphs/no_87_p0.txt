Leading women from politics, the arts and other fields urged   Donald Trump on Monday to support a new national women’s museum in Washington that would be affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. At a meeting in New York to give momentum to the idea, the group cited the report of a bipartisan Congressional commission in November that urged construction of the museum. " It’s tremendously important," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who first proposed the project in the late 1990s.
