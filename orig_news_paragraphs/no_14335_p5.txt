The general strike is a tactic born among   political movements where groups of people all leave their places of work to demand political or economic action. The statement from the Women’s March indicated the general strike would also include boycotting certain businesses. The Women’s March may be the most   announcement of a general strike during the Trump presidency so far, but many others    often on the political left    have also called for strikes. Writer Francine Prose called for one, writing in the Guardian following Trump’s executive order suspending the refugee program and temporarily restricting travel from seven   countries.
