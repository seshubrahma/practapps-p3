"With the announcement today that both the 65, 000 and 20, 000   visa caps for fiscal year 2016 have been reached, Business Roundtable CEOs made a renewed call for Congress to fix a broken immigration system that keeps U. S. companies from hiring the top world talent they need," one 2015 press release claimed. The U. S. Chamber has pushed the   program strongly, but has mentioned the cap exempt program only once in a dense   report about the 2013    bill. The same pattern repeats at the Brookings Institution, with 37 mentions of   and 65, 000, but only one 2009 mention of the cap exempt side. Brookings did describe the cap in this long report, but offered no data.
