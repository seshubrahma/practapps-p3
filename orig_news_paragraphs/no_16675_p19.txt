The effects of this shift are showing in recent   polling. Trump’s best chance to win the presidency comes by flipping   states where Democrats have had natural advantages in recent presidential elections and which have larger than average blocs of white   voters    Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin among them. In each, Trump has cut into Clinton’s advantage with broad support from the white working class. In the pure battlegrounds, Ohio and Iowa also appear to be shifting Trump’s way on the strength of his support among white   voters.
