Smerconish pushed back on the certainty that Spicer articulated. " I’m casting doubt on whether Sean Spicer can definitively know the answer to the question of the extent of the Russian hack and my frustration is at the idea that until this thing is fully developed already   Trump is saying, ’Move on folks there’s nothing to see here,’" he said.   Smerconish went on to express his frustration that Trump quickly dismissed Intelligence reports about Russian involvement in the election before seeing the results of an investigation on the matter.
