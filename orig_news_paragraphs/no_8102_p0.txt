California Republicans are turning out to volunteer for Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign by knocking on doors in local communities, even though the Republican presidential nominee is thought to have no chance of winning the state. [Indeed, while Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton is sending busloads of California volunteers to   Nevada, the East Bay Times reports, the Trump campaign is keeping volunteers in liberal strongholds in the hope that "closeted" supporters will turn out to vote.   The   Golden State has not cast its electoral votes for a Republican since George H. W. Bush in 1988. The latest poll average from RealClearPolitics shows Clinton ahead of Trump by 22. 2%.
