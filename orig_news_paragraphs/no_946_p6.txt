As Adam S. Posen, an American economist who has served on the Bank of England’s   Monetary Policy Committee, told me, "The sense that the Fed’s independence could be taken away by a simple act of Congress is very real. " The pressure is already on. Mr. Posen, who now heads the Peterson Institute for International Economics, points out that the Fed already lost powers it deployed to counter the recession spawned by the financial crisis a decade ago: The   financial reform legislation stripped it of its authority to lend freely to nonbanks, which it used to keep money market funds, insurance companies and others that had bet on the wrong side of the housing bubble from imploding and taking the economy with them.
