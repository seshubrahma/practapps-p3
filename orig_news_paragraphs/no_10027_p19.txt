Clintonâ€™s private speeches to foreign financial groups came up, as well. Pence referenced the WikiLeaks release of the emails of John Podesta, a close adviser to President Obama. Podesta was also chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton and current Chairman of Hillary for America. He spoke of the hemispheric market with "Open trade and open borders," documented in the emails, the accuracy of which the Clinton campaign has not refuted.
