Both of these claims are provably false within The Guardian’s own article and are a blatant misrepresentation of Assange’s statements.    Jacobs’ article is comprised of quotes from an interview that Assange did with La Republica, an Italian newspaper which published the full transcript of the interview online. Either Jacobs or an editor then mixed and matched quotes in order to construct the desired narrative. Assange never once actively praised or stated his support for   Donald Trump.
