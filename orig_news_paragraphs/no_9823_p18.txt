It was Mark Fuhrman’s fault! In defiance of everyday experience, known facts and common sense, we are all required to publicly endorse the left’s religious belief that whites are always racist, but women and minorities are incapable of any form of bias.

At least when we’re talking about American blacks, there’s a history of white racism, so the double standard is not so enraging.
