As the man continued his tirade, he was removed from the flight and could be heard screaming, "Youâ€™re kicking me off for expressing my opinion," as he was taken by security. In a statement, the airline running the flight, JetBlue, said, "The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly. If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight. Our team worked to   the party on the next available flight.
