Last week, Breitbart News reported on the first part of Clinton’s interview on "Aaron Klein Investigative Radio," in which she discussed some of the most infamous scandals to rock the Bill Clinton White House. Tripp possesses insider information on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster’s office the morning after he was found dead in an apparent suicide. Foster was heavily involved in defending the Clintons in the Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater cases.
