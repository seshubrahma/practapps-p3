Though President Obama has proposed resettling a maximum of 110, 000 refugees in FY 2017, Congress has not yet approved of that ceiling, nor has it appropriated 52 weeks of funding for the fiscal year that began on October 1. Instead, Congress has approved interim funding to cover just the first 10 weeks of FY 2017, which begin on October 1 and end on December 9. It is unclear whether that funding is at the 85, 000 refugee annual level of FY 2016  or at the 110, 000 annual level proposed by President Obama for FY 2017 but not yet either approved or rejected by Congress. During the first six days of October, the Department of State, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, and the VOLAGs have far exceeded their current budget authority to bring in refugees.
