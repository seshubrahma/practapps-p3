Mr. Paul: He has already threatened to filibuster Mr. Trumpâ€™s cabinet picks, and he previously raised the alarm about the reach of government surveillance programs, which could put him at odds with the new administration. He has urged restraint with American military power, putting him distinctly at odds with Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham in that area. Mr. Sasse: A persistent detractor of Mr. Trump throughout the campaign, he seems most likely to challenge Mr. Trump in cases of perceived abuse of executive power. In a Nebraska   article after the election, he urged a search for common ground with Mr. Trump, but warned that there would be disagreements.
