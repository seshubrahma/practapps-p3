Richards also accused the women in President Donald Trump’s administration, including his daughter, Ivanka Trump, of not doing enough to promote women’s interests in the White House. " Anyone who works in this White House is responsible for addressing why women are in the crosshairs of basically every single policy that we’ve seen out of this administration," she said. Richards made her comments at the eighth annual Women in the World Summit.
