[State officials reported that the recount effort will begin on December 1 in a race against time to meet the December 12 deadline to confirm the stateâ€™s vote tally for electors to be eligible for inclusion in the final Electoral College vote. Officials also said that no recount will occur at all unless Stein pays the $3. 5 million recount fee ahead of that time, the Journal Sentinel reports.   The Wisconsin Election Commission reported on November 25 that Stein had successfully filed her challenge to the results. The Commission has received the Stein and Del La Fuente recount petitions.
