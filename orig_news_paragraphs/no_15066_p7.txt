Rival factions have emerged, pitting those aides who consider themselves the nationalists    including Bannon and policy adviser Stephen Miller    against a more   wing led by Kushner, economic adviser Gary Cohn and deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Both Cohn and Powell    who both came to the administration directly from Goldman Sachs    are viewed internally as close to Kushner, a dynamic that rankled those in the White House close to Bannon. Bannon’s faction has come to refer to Cohn as "Globalist Gary," an insult for those aligned with Bannon’s populist views. Bannon, meanwhile, has told associates that he feels an extended battle with Kushner    and by extension Trump’s daughter Ivanka    is "unwinnable" given Trump’s loyalty to his family.
