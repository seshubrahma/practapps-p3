Mr. Skwirczynski comments: "Given Gazeta Wyborcza is without a doubt THE establishment newspaper in Poland, such reckless behaviour in running a highly emotional, badly or   unsubstantiated hit article is unacceptable in a free society where rule of law regarding infringement of personal rights proliferates". GEORGE SOROS, On June 8th the news broke that George Soros had invested in Gazeta Wyborcza by way of a fund he supports, buying shares in the newspaper’s parent company, Agora. The   Media Development Investment Fund (MDIF) now owns an 11. 22 per cent stake in the newspaper’s holding company.
