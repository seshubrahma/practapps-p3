If Trump can avoid his worst instincts and if    or    scandals don’t bring down his presidency, there is reason to believe that a rightward Republican Congress will stand by him as long as he sends tax cuts, deregulation and defense spending their way. With Jeff Sessions as the attorney general and Scott Pruitt at EPA, what’s not to love if you are sitting on the Republican side of the aisle?   It remains to be seen if this strategy will work in the long term. Thus far, it did get Trump the Republican nomination and the presidential election.
