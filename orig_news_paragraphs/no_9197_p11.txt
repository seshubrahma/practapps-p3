In March of this year, 4, 930 people crossed the   border illegally, just 10 per cent of the figure for the same month last year. Again, while some of this can be attributed to the decline in crossing attempts, that decline itself was prompted by the erection of the barriers. Migrants stopped attempting to use the route, and thus the "pull factor" was eradicated, when they found out that walls stood in their way. WALLS AROUND THE WORLD, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey have all built walls which have scarcely been referred to as "racist" or "xenophobic" in the same way Mr. Trump, or indeed Mr. Orban or Mr. Netanyahuâ€™s walls have been.
