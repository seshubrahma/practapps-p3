Chris Sacca, a prominent venture investor, said there was only one path for those attending next week’s meeting: defiance. " If an attendee wants to maintain their integrity and preserve their company’s ability to recruit the best talent, then there is only one purpose for a trip to Trump Tower: to deliver the message that our industry will not be complicit in the systematic disgrace of our democratic institutions, the establishment of an authoritarian kleptocracy nor the oppression of citizens, including the minority of Americans who elected him," Mr. Sacca said. Or perhaps everyone will get along fine.
