" The Washington Post story did not say specific sources or methods were discussed, but does cite officials who said Trump revealed the city within ISIS territory where the US ally had detected the threat Trump had discussed. CNN had previously broken the story on the intelligence that Trump reportedly discussed    that ISIS had been devising ways to plant explosives in large electronic devices and defeat screening systems intended to keep them off aircraft. At the time, CNN agreed to withhold key details, including the name of the city where the threat was detected, at the request of US government officials, who were concerned that if it was revealed, it could also reveal intelligence sources and methods.
