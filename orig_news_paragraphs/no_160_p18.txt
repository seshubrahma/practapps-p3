The administration is racing to secure the release of American hostages in Afghanistan, including an American woman and her Canadian husband, who were abducted in 2012 by the Haqqani network, a powerful faction of the Taliban. The couple later had two children in captivity. The terrorist group is also suspected of abducting an American professor and his Australian colleague in Kabul in August. American Special Operations forces tried to rescue the two men several weeks later but they had been moved.
