Hamilton actor Brandon Victor Dixon says he does not plan to apologize to Vice   Mike Pence for lecturing him from the Broadway stage on Friday night. ["Thereâ€™s nothing to apologize for," Dixon said during a Monday appearance on CBS This Morning.   " The producers, the creators, and the cast, we recognize that Hamilton is an inherently American story told by the definition of an American community we are men and women of different colors, creeds, and orientations," Dixon said.
