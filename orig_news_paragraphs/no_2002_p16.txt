Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a commitment by 195 countries to take concrete measures to reduce   carbon emissions.

A recent Harvard and Columbia study estimated that the fires caused at least 100, 000 premature deaths across Southeast Asia. The World Bank estimates that the fires cost Indonesia’s economy $16 billion.
