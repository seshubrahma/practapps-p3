Last year, Canada implemented a policy that created a new class   of milk prices for   milk   â€”   a liquid ,     concentrate sometimes used to make products such as cheese and   yogurt. Canada lowered the prices for this milk class to   incentivize domestic   milk and better compete with   the   imports.
