The rise in the number of   groups mirrored the 67 percent surge in   hate crimes reported by the F. B. I. in 2015, the last year for which the agency has statistics. There were 257   episodes reported to the police that year, the highest number since 2001, when more than 480 hate crimes were reported in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In the first 10 days after Mr. Trumpâ€™s election, the center said, it documented 867 bias incidents, including more than 300 that targeted immigrants or Muslims.
