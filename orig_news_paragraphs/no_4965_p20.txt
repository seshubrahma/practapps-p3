Even though the postal service generates revenue by charging for certain services, it still loses money that is absorbed by the taxpayer. The U. S. Postal Service has fallen on hard times given more efficient means of communication have replaced the need for the agencyâ€™s   mail. For FY 2012 alone, the USPS lost $15. 9 billion.
