LOS ANGELES   â€”    Shortly after dropping off his youngest daughter at school, Romulo   saw lights flashing from a black car following him, signaling for him to pull over. The car was unmarked and Mr. Avelica, along with his wife and another daughter, who were also in the car, did not know why he was being stopped.
