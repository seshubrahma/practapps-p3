Black doll hung from rod at college, At Canisius College in west New York state, students posted photos of a black doll hanging from a dormitory curtain rod on social media, and one student created a meme with language about "Trump fans," college President John J. Hurley said. Students who saw those photos notified campus police, who investigated, Hurley said. Some students have been suspended and may be expelled, he said. An outside investigator will be hired to determine if any students should be prosecuted for possible hate crimes, as several parents and students urged, Hurley said.
