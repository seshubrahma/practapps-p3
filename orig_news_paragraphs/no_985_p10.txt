And the agency began sending 40 percent of its money directly to states arts agencies to decide how to distribute. The result is that the arts endowment now sends grants to every Congressional district in the nation: In 2016, the agency said, it recommended 2, 400 grants in 16, 000 communities. That could make it harder for members of Congress to kill it, since doing so would cost their districts money. But the new paradigm also means that the money is spread so thin, with the awarding of many small grants, that it could bolster the arguments of opponents of the endowment who say the lost money could be made up elsewhere.
