The bad: A huge construction crane collapsed on the Tappan Zee Bridge, north of New York City, shutting down traffic on major highways. The good: No one was killed. " It’s a miracle that the boom fell across six lanes of traffic, cars that are doing 60 to 70 miles an hour, and not one car was hit by the boom," said an official with the crane operators’ union.
