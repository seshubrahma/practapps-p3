Freedom Partners chairman Mark Holden said that the group does not plan to get involved to support any candidate in this current race. Freedom Partners said that the groupâ€™s position on that front is "unchanged. " " If during the general election cycle, a candidate were able to garner support from the public with a positive message in support of the issues we care about, and did not engage in personal attacks and mudslinging, we would consider potentially getting involved.
