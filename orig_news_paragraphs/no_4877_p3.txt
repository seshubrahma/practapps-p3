The lawsuit by was brought by Muslim plaintiffs, backed up by a huge array of establishment progressive corporate lawyers, against President Trump’s Executive Order, which merely temporarily blocked or curbed Muslim immigration from six of    countries around the world.   The temporary block is intended to help officials institute new safeguards against   attacks by the growing inflow of Muslim immigrants, refugees, and their future   children, into an increasingly diverse, chaotic and divided nation.   The judges’ deference to the Muslim plaintiffs comes after 16 years of deadly, repeated and destructive attacks on Americans motivated by the Islamic religion, starting on   2001. Since then, U. S. forces have gone to war in several   countries to curb terrorism, and more than 101 people named after Islam’s primary   have been arrested and convicted by domestic courts for various jihad and   offenses.
