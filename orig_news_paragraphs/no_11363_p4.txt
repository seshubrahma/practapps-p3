What has infuriated Trump and Cruz supporters alike is that several of the Trump delegates appointed today have gone on the record as vigorous opponents of Donald Trump. As the Rocky Top political blog posted today: At least two people on the establishment’s slate who would be assigned to serve as "Trump delegates" have trashed Trump on social media. They are SEC members Melissa Gay and Ken Gross. There are believed to be other "Trojan Horse" delegates who will try to be selected to represent   but who will instead vote with the party establishment on rules and credentials, etc. to hurt Cruz’ and Trump’s efforts at the convention.
