The Trump campaign said Friday that Rick Gates, Manafort’s deputy, would now serve as its liaison to the Republican National Committee. The Clinton campaign looked to use Manafort’s resignation to tie Trump and Vladimir Putin together. " Paul Manafort’s resignation is a clear admission that the disturbing connections between Donald Trump’s team and   elements in Russia and Ukraine are untenable," Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.
