At one time I thought he was the future of the Republican Party. Then, in 2015, Indiana’s Religious Freedom and Restoration Act happened.   The problem wasn’t that the law    which allowed a business owner to raise religion as a defense when an   lawsuit is presented    was so odious, despite Hillary Clinton, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Miley Cyrus’ contention that it was.   Religious freedom laws were already on the books in liberal states like Rhode Island and Connecticut, and a federal RFRA was passed and voted for by Rep. Chuck Schumer and Sen. Edward Kennedy, and signed into law by President Bill Clinton.
