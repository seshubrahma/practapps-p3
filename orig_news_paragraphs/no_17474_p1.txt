After decades of   diplomacy, the idea of a   solution looms anew, as conservative elements in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition see the arrival of Donald Trump and his new ambassador to Israel as an opportunity to push their agenda. If it is realized, it would reduce Israel’s Palestinian population to a permanent underclass and mean, in the    future, that a Jewish minority would be ruling a Muslim majority, with the world on the side of the oppressed majority.   The United States would be its only friend and ally    relegating Washington to a role equally isolated from mainstream opinion throughout the region and far beyond. This seems to be the role that   Trump is carving out for America, and the role that Netanyahu is skirting perilously close to for Israel.
