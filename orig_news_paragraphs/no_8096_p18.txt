Caddell agreed that Trump’s path to victory was "tighter," because Clinton can count on   electoral vote jackpots like New York, California, and Illinois, "big population states"  —   but added that in states like Illinois, he suspected the race was "closer than anyone expects it to be. " He explained: If you take the states where Trump has moved ahead in more than one poll   —   Florida, Iowa where he’s eight points ahead, which was a big Obama state, helped spring him to the White House in the caucus, it was twice for him, in Ohio where he’s now up there in three polls at least, all consistently showing Trump ahead.
