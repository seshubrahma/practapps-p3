I saw their helicopter land in a clearing, like a scene out of some Hollywood movie," said Francinaldo Martins Ara√∫jo, 43, who was arriving in his truck to buy scraps of discarded timber from the sawmill as the unit swooped down for its raid. Members of the squad, some hiding their faces behind balaclavas out of fear of retribution if their identities are made public, quickly went to work. They set the sawmill on fire and destroyed two domed furnaces used to make charcoal, before setting out again in the helicopters for their next target. A few minutes later, they hit pay dirt again when one of the pilots observed a truck on a logging road.
