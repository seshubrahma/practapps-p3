On Tuesday, voters did away with prohibitions against marijuana, raised taxes on cigarettes, extended an income tax on the wealthy, toughened gun control laws, loosened parole rules and overturned a law that restricted bilingual education in schools. Californians also sent the first black woman to the United States Senate since Carol Moseley Braun in 1999. Attorney General Kamala Harris easily defeated Representative Loretta Sanchez in the state â€™s first   race, the result of the   primary system.
