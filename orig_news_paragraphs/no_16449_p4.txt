The Republican nominee has earned the ire of many Hispanics due in part to his comments about Mexican people and undocumented immigrants. A new Fox News Latino poll released earlier this month found him trailing Hillary Clinton by 46 points, 66% to 20% among registered Latino voters. Among his signature policy proposals is the construction of a border wall along the   border, which he has said Mexico will pay for. He has also called for the deportation of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country and said a judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University is unfit for the job because he is of Mexican heritage.
