Married, with children, is one of the most determinative factors in predicting how someone will vote. While most political chatter is obsessed over the alleged "gender gap" that leaves Democrats with  a large lead among women, the reality is that any gap in how men or women vote is determined by marriage and parenting. White women who are married, generally, vote exactly the same as white men who are married. Any perceived "gender gap" is due largely to martial status and race, with majorities of both sexes voting overwhelmingly for Republicans.
