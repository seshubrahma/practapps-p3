At the end of 2015, Speaker Ryan had ushered through Congress an omnibus spending bill that funded all of Obama’s policy initiatives, including ObamaCare, and broke the spending caps that had been implemented five years ago. Speaker Ryan has also been one of the leading voices among Republicans for comprehensive immigration reform, Washington code for greatly expanding immigration into the U. S. Ryan has also emerged as a leading critic of Trump’s proposals to curtail refugee resettlement from   Syria and explore a temporary ban on Muslim migration into the U. S. Ryan has also been a vocal defender of pending trade agreements negotiated by the Obama Administration under a veil of secrecy. The NBC survey suggests that Trump’s rise isn’t merely a reaction to Ryan’s leadership of the House, but a complete takeover of the Republican party. In exit polling during the primary campaigns, around a majority of Republicans said they were "angry" at Washington and felt "betrayed" by Republican party leaders.
