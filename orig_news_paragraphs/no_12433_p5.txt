Some significant examples of where those policies led to and how she handled her secretary of state duties follow: Ironically, Secretary Clinton and her allies are suggesting to voters in campaign ads, on the campaign trail, and in media that her prime presidential opponent, Donald Trump, is advocating dangerous policies that would harm the U. S. and world and therefore is unfit to lead this great nation. Time will tell whether American voters will look through that smokescreen and see the harm that President Obama and Secretary Clinton "smart" foreign policies may have done to U. S. and global peace and security, and how she behaved in office. As America’s 2016 presidential election approaches its final stage beginning on Labor Day, American voters will have a clear choice on whether to elect someone like Secretary Clinton who offers a continuation of President Obama’s globalist policies or a successful international businessman and   Trump who seeks to "Make America Great Again" by turning the country in a new direction, placing American interests first and away from  ’s globalist policies. The world will be anxiously awaiting their decision.
