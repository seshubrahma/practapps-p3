The message officials will be looking to hear from Mr. Pompeo is, "I’m going to protect you from these guys," said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency. " Every television set in Langley is going to be on for that hearing," Mr. Hayden said, referring to the town in Northern Virginia where the C. I. A. is based.

A. and the revelation that intelligence chiefs briefed Mr. Trump last week on the dossier of unsubstantiated reports is likely to deepen the divide.
