Instead, we got Trump shouting insults and   interrupting Clinton, trying to take over the conversation. Shockingly, Trump admitting to the world: He was "smart" not to pay his federal income taxes he supported a return of "stop and frisk" policing, even though it was ruled racial profiling and unconstitutional by the courts and he defended his family’s housing discrimination practices against blacks and Latinos, essentially saying it was just something everyone did back then.   Clinton’s       strategy was frustrating at times but it worked. She could, however, show more passion when discussing her policies.
