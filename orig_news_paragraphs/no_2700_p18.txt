On Tuesday, the Kremlin cranked its information machinery into high gear to paint the arrest as part of a continuing anticorruption crusade that has included the arrest of three governors in the last two years. A report called "Fight Against Corruption" was the top one for much of the day on the main   television news network. A caravan of politicians appeared on screen to praise the arrest as evidence that nobody was above the law. Mr. Ulyukayev was charged with extorting a   bribe, Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for Russiaâ€™s Investigative Committee, said on state television.
