Washington (CNN) South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, tapped by   Donald Trump to be UN ambassador, questioned Wednesday at her Senate confirmation hearing whether the US’s funding of the world body is worth it.    And she diverged sharply from many of the foreign policy views Trump has expressed, telling senators that she expected the  ’s views to evolve under the counsel of his national security team. Haley rapped the UN for its treatment of Israel and indicated that she thinks the US should reconsider its contribution of 22% of the annual budget.
