I think what is necessary to make this work, for this to unify, is to actually take our principles and advance them. Ryan’s public invocation of Kemp’s immigration principles shows that he’s still wrapped around Kemp’s utterly idealistic vision   —   even though Kemp’s high    principles converted his home state, the once Golden State, into political lead for the GOP because poor voters elect Democrats to heavily tax the state’s corps of millionaires and billionaires. Kemp’s principles invited the immigrants who helped elect Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and welcomed the   immigrants who have   U. S. productivity and   and   wages since at least 2000.
