That gruesome case has become newly relevant with the nomination of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to run the Department of Justice. Sessions was the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District when the Donald case was tried. In 1986, Session’s nomination for a federal judgeship was rejected after one of his former subordinates, Thomas Figures, alleged that Sessions called him "boy," made remarks disparaging   organizations, and made jokes about the KKK, even as his office was investigating the Donald lynching.    groups have harshly criticized Sessions’s nomination, arguing that he is hostile to federal   and   law.
