Egyptâ€™s byzantine justice system seemed to be assiduous in sweeping up toddlers. Last February, a military court found    Ahmed Mansour Qorani Sharara and 115 others guilty of killing three people and damaging private and public property during a   Brotherhood demonstration. Ahmed was sentenced to life in prison, but the verdict was later thrown out of court. The police insist that it was a case of mistaken identity and that the real culprit, a teenager, is still being sought.
