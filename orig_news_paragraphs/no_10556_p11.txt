The convention will also highlight religious leaders such as Jerry Falwell Jr. son of the famed televangelist, and Haskel Lookstein, the New York rabbi who converted Trump’s daughter, Ivanka to Judaism. Trump does not forget his business relationships, giving speaking slots to real estate investor Tom Barrack, PayPal   Peter Thiel and even the general manager for Virginia’s Trump Winery, Kerry Woolard. And in a nod toward party unity, Trump will feature several former presidential competitors, including Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Ben Carson and Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Two finalists in Trump’s search for a running mate made the list as well: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich.
