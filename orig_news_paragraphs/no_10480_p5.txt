If a President Clinton were to add 65, 000 Syrian arrivals on top of that number, then you could potentially see more than 6 million new immigrants added during her first term alone," Camarota explained. " Further, if Hillary Clinton were able to pass a bill that were similar to the   bill, then it would likely add another one million legal immigrants on top of that figure annually," Camarota said —  pointing specifically to previous analysis Camarota conducted on the   Gang of Eight bill, which demonstrated how the plan would have doubled legal immigration. This means that Clinton could add 10 million new immigrants to the U. S. during her first term alone —   in addition to the 11 million illegal immigrants Clinton has said she plans to amnesty within her first 100 days in office.
