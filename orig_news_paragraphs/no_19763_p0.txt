This story was updated on Monday, January 9 at 11:27 pm, Senate Republicans have delayed the confirmation hearing for   Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of education amid mounting criticism from Democrats that the GOP is rushing to install Trump’s Cabinet without sufficient vetting. The Senate hearing for Betsy DeVos will now occur on the afternoon of January 17, the leaders of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee announced late Monday night. DeVos, a conservative education activist and wealthy philanthropist, was set to testify on Wednesday along with four other Trump nominees even though she had yet to sign a certified ethics agreement detailing how she planned to resolve potential conflicts of interest —  a step that traditionally occurs before a nominee receives a confirmation hearing. Senators Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said the change was made to accommodate the Senate leadership.
