In other words, people are voting for their chosen candidate for the nomination, but not completely the ballot by voting for delegates. Its also important to note that Ohio Gov. John Kasich has many members of Illinois Republican Gov. Bruce Raunerâ€™s political team assisting his campaign. While this may not help Kasich win the state overall, it should help him rack up delegates in individual Congressional Districts. It is not unlikely that Trump could win Illinois, with its 15 delegates, but Cruz and Kasich split the remaining 54 delegates beween them.
