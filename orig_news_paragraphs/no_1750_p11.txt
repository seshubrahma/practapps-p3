Senator Kelly Ayotte, the Republican up for   in New Hampshire, demonstrated the vise she is in this week when she said at a debate that Mr. Trump would represent a good role model for children, only to recant a few hours later. Sensing new opportunity, Democrats intend to redouble their efforts to tie Republican candidates to Mr. Trump in states and districts with large numbers of   voters and minorities. " I think itâ€™s quite effective in New Hampshire, in suburban Philadelphia and in Nevada," said Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat.
