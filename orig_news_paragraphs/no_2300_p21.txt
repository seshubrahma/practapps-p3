Thatâ€™s how the most recent tunnel in San Diego was discovered in April. Its exit was in a   area in the heavily industrial Otay Mesa warehouse district, about 500 yards from the border. According to Wendi Lee, a Border Patrol agent, business owners across the street alerted the agency to what they said was suspicious activity. The tunnel, hidden under a trash bin, was about 800 yards long.
