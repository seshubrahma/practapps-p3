Mercatus researchers documented that the annual cost to the U. S. Gross Domestic Product for regulatory expansion since 1980 has averaged a negative  .8 percent per year. On a per capita basis, that almost equaled the entire one percent slowdown for average annual economic growth in the period since 1980. Increased "regulatory drag" also explained why income inequality that shrank dramatically from 1946 to 1980, as the 60 percent of Americans who called themselves "middle class" saw wages grow by two percent faster than inflation, has since bolted higher as the top one percentâ€™s share of all income jumped from 22 to 35 percent. President Franklin D. Roosevelt consolidated the first 161 volumes of U. S. regulations into the Code of Federal Regulations in 1935.
