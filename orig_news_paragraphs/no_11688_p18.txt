Government and military personnel have been subjected to countless lectures on the topic, sometimes with a very poor choice of lecturer. The distinction between "radical" and mainstream Islam is also a matter of official policy, repeated by nearly every politician in both major parties.   Trump’s comments would suggest he thinks the radicals are much more numerous than the "tiny minority of extremists hijacking the Religion of Peace" talking point familiar in the    era, and he’s bluntly asking if something about Islam makes radicalization easier than other religions.   He is hardly the only person to ask that question, but major political figures rarely do it, nor do they use such indelicate language.
