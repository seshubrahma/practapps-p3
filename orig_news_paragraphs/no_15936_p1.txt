And on Tuesday night, Democrats came up short in the   winnable special election of 2017: The suburban Atlanta 6th District of Georgia.   CNN called the race for Republican Karen Handel shortly after 10 p. m. ET, with her holding a lead of more than 10, 000 votes over Democrat Jon Ossoff. The race, which was to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in a seat Donald Trump carried by just a single point in 2016, was the most expensive in history    as both candidates, national parties and their associated super PACs dumped tens of millions into a seat widely seen as a barometer of the national mood.
