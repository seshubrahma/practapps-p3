Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press,"   Donald Trump’s campaign manager and transition adviser Kellyanne Conway argued if the race had been for the popular vote, the Trump campaign would have won that as well.   Conway said, "We’re the ones who understood America. The idea that we’re going to talk about the popular vote answers your questions about sore losers. The idea that Donald Trump doesn’t have a mandate after he got 100 more electoral votes than Mitt Romney did, he got 306, it wasn’t close.
