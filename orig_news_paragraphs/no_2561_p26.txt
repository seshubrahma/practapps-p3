Mr. Trump, who delights in mocking scripted candidates who use teleprompters, delivered his speech with the help of two teleprompters, and aides said he had practiced with them over the weekend. The New York billionaire worked on his foreign policy speech for more than a week, according to an aide, with the help of some advisers his campaign would not identify. " The speech is his words and his thoughts," said Paul Manafort, Mr. Trumpâ€™s newly installed campaign chief.
