minutes later, Mr. Trump was convinced: "I’m not going to give you any recommendations in L. A. I’m going to hire you," Mr. Trump told Ms. Carlson, who went on to spend almost four years as his assistant general counsel, often working   days with a small team of lawyers while taking on other responsibilities in the real estate division. Andrew Weiss, a Romanian immigrant who grew up in Brooklyn, was hired straight out of graduate school in 1981, just as Mr. Trump was starting to make his mark.   years later, having weathered many highs and lows with Mr. Trump, including the spectacular failure of his Atlantic City casinos, Mr. Weiss is still by his side, as executive vice president for development and construction. Mr. Calamari, who started out as a bodyguard, also saw his role expand as he remained committed to his boss.
