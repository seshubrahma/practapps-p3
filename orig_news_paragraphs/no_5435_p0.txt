On Friday, Tom Van Flein, chief of staff to Rep. Paul Gosar ( ) and   legal counsel to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, discussed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam the recent effort to overhaul the House ethics system. [Flein said the problem with the reform package presented, and then withdrawn, this week was that "it lacked transparency, so it was sort of dropped on the American public without any hearings, without any discussion, and that ultimately led to its failure. "   " It was a failure of process and the lack of transparency," he emphasized.
