Some leading Republicans have expressed hope that Mr. Trump can at least stabilize his campaign by Labor Day, when many voters begin paying attention to congressional races. But with such an erratic and belligerent candidate leading their ticket, many in the party have long seen a     strategy as inevitable. David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a group that advocates small government, said the organization was studying how to get Republican voters who may dislike Mr. Trump to turn out for the partyâ€™s   candidates. Mr. McIntosh said the Club for Growth intended to convince voters that they would need a "strong voice in the Senate and House," regardless of their feelings about the presidential race.
