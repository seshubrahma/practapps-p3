Aya Hijazi grew up in Falls Church, Virgina, and is a graduate of George Mason University. Rather than spending money on a lavish wedding, the couple used their money to launch the Belady Foundation to help children who live on the streets in Cairo, human rights advocates wrote in a piece published by The Huffington Post. Instead, the couple was arrested, and months later, they were told they had been charged with sexually assaulting the children in their care. A hearing was delayed seven times during the course of three years.
