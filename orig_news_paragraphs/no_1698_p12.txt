This problem is built into the C. P. S. because it changes its boundaries once every 10 years, while the A. C. S. makes its changes incrementally. These differences were so large that the Census Bureau actually warned against comparing the C. P. S. estimates of geographic mobility between 2014 and 2015 because they "do not accurately reflect the actual respective populations. " The census did post a "User Note" on Friday, after the centerâ€™s report was released, directing people to use the A. C. S. for comparisons between metro and nonmetro areas.
