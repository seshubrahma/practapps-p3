Over the past several weeks, Republicans in Congress and members of their staffs have privately complained that Mr. Trump’s Twitter comment on March 4  —   the one where he called Barack Obama "sick" and suggested that the former president had ordered a "tapp" on his phone  —   had done more to undermine anything he’s done as president because it called into question his seriousness about governing. The problem, from the perspective of Mr. Trump’s beleaguered political fire brigade, is that the president insists on dealing with crises by creating new ones   —    so surrogates, repeating talking points the president himself ignores, say they often feel like human shields.
