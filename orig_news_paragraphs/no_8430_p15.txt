But let me clear. It’s not enough to win the nomination by personally beating down your opponents with such vulgar and ruthlessness, espousing conflicting or   beliefs, trashing the establishment one day yet bragging about working with them the next, that is playing both insider and outsider, and then expect these dispirit parts of the Republican Party and the conservative movement, having been exploited and turned against each other, to suddenly rally to your cause. Levin came to his final plea to the CPAC aucidence saying: Obviously it is a daunting task to defeat the Republican establishment in a race like this. But it’s still not enough.
