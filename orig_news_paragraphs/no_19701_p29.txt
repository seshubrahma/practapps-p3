Race and ethnicity play into the geography of the recovery too: Black and Hispanic families are more likely to live in urban areas than white families, and their representation in the workforce has grown through the recovery. As of 2015, there were 66 million white   workers with   jobs, down from 72 million in 2007. In contrast, according to Department of Labor data, the number of black   workers with   jobs remained roughly the same for Hispanic and Latino workers, it grew to 15 million from 13. 6 million. More than half of the job gains since late 2007 have gone to Hispanics, who make up 14 percent of the labor force 29 percent of the job gains went to Asians, who make up 5 percent of the labor force and 25 percent of the job gains went to blacks, who make up 11 percent of the labor force, according to an analysis from the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.
