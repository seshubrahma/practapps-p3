Washington (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions captivated Washington Tuesday, beating back rumors of a private meeting with Russia â€™s ambassador to the US and mounting a defense for President Donald Trump, one week after former FBI Director James Comey artfully unloaded on both men.   Sessions routinely said he would not answer questions regarding his conversations with Trump, but he delivered more than enough answers over two and a half hours of testimony Tuesday afternoon.
