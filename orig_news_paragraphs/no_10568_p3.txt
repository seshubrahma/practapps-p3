The protesters wanted to see if they could make it to the main entrance to the convention and how the police would react. The law enforcement response was to insert a thick column of officers on bikes through the crowd and then to separate again and divide the crowd into quadrants. Unfortunately, what today showed was that the current police strategy being used in Cleveland would result in reporters, convention goers, and curious citizens being locked into crowds with anarchist protesters. This means innocent attendees could end up receiving the same treatment as the protesters without a method to extricate themselves.
