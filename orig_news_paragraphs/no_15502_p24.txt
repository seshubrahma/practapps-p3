It’s an open question whether the White House is helping    or slowing down    the Republican Party’s legislative agenda. Take, for example, tax reform. The House was set to release a full plan before Memorial Day, but the administration’s tax reform principles released last month actually created confusion between the White House and Congress, a Republican tax lobbyist said. The White House has ideological divisions between Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and some of Trump’s former campaign advisers.
