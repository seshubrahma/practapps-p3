one those people. I don’t mind if you’re a petulant,     of lunatic from Black Lives Matter. I don’t care if you’re a socialist, or a communist, despite the fact that your chosen political philosophy is responsible for more suffering than any other political philosophy in the history of our species. I don’t care if you’re a white supremacist.
