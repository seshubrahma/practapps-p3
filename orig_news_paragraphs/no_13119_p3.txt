Police said demonstrators could face arrest for obstructing the movement of vehicles and people, refusing to obey lawful orders by a law enforcement officer, vandalism and refusal to disperse after unlawful assembly is declared. Those under the age of 18 could also face arrest for curfew violations. Students in the San Francisco Bay area already staged demonstrations against Trump last week. Both Los Angeles and San Francisco have seen continuous protests.
