" My experience serving with General Mattis in Iraq was one of the most formidable times in my   service with the U. S. Navy SEALs. I learned a lot from the ‘Warrior Monk’ and can think of no other man or woman who is as   to serve as the next Secretary of Defense at this point in time," continued the former commander at the fabled Navy SEAL Team Six. Given his personal experience on the battlefield, Gen. "Mad Dog" Mattis is a man who would understand "war and the warrior ethos" better than any civilian appointed to the Pentagon chief post, argued Zinke.
