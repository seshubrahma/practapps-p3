McCain has argued for more aggressive military involvement in the Syrian Civil War. This was his first visit to the   nation since 2013. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report McCain’s trip to Syria, citing unnamed officials who said the senator spoke with US military members and Kurdish fighters there. McCain’s trip came weeks after Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat, made a secret trip to Syria as well.
