Rubio also, on Oct. 7, skipped final passage of the final NDAA conference report version that was sent to President Obamaâ€™s desk. Then again on Nov. 10, on another matter related to the NDAA and specifically defense spending levels, Rubio skipped another defense bill vote. Cruz also missed that vote. All in all, the astonishingly high 18 national security votes on the NDAA defense bill alone that Rubio skipped are far more than anyone else in the U. S. Senate.
