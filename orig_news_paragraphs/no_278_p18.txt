This is a perfectly valid strategy, in politics and in TV. And in practice, Mr. Trump has embraced the politics of   not just in the campaign but in his inaugural speech, which made no effort to reach beyond his base. But as much as Mr. Trump has adapted to modern media, he is still a    man who came of age in the era of three TV networks, when there were no niche hits. Just as he could not be satisfied with the niche success of "The Apprentice," he seemingly cannot bear being a niche president.
