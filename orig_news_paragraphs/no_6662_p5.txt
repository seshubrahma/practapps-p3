The establishment media is playing up the enforcement actions. " Federal agents conduct immigration enforcement raids in at least six states," declared the Washington Post, which continued: U. S. immigration authorities made a series of arrests in at least half a dozen states across the country on Thursday and Friday, sweeping up an unknown number of undocumented immigrants, immigration lawyers and advocates said. The raids, which appeared to target scores of people, including those without criminal records, mark the first largescale episode of immigration enforcement inside the United States since President Trumpâ€™s Jan. 26 order to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally.
