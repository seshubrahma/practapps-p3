Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton’s campaign Saturday night seized on a New York Times report about Donald Trump’s 1995 tax records, in which the Times showed he declared a $916 million loss that could have allowed him to legally skip paying federal income taxes for years. The revelations threatened to put the controversy over Trump’s refusal to follow recent precedent and release his tax returns at the center of the presidential campaign less than 40 days before the election, after a week in which the Republican nominee has struggled to bounce back from a debate in which most analysts and scientifically conducted polls scored Clinton as the winner. His campaign vehemently pushed back on the Clinton campaign’s effort to turn the report into an "October surprise" moment, saying Trump has a "fiduciary responsibility" as a businessman to pay no more tax than legally required.
