So while I understand that describing the Brexit victory as Magna Carta 2. 0 is inexact, I think it makes a key point: Britain will regain its political freedom, its autonomous   and its independence from an EU that is spinning out of control under the power of establishment elites, unelected and unaccountable socialist bureaucrats, and a judicial court that is increasingly making legal decisions that replace Britain’s powerful common law.   The EU’s tax and regulatory policies,   and welfare spending, and free immigration even in wartime are gradually ruining Europe. That’s why I believe Brexit is good for British freedom, political autonomy, and the survival of democratic capitalism.   The business elites told British voters that leaving the EU would lead to economic catastrophe.
