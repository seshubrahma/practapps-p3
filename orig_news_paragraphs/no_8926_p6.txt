If Hillary won we would have a woman who, as a lawyer in Arkansas, defended a child rapist while accusing that rapist’s    victim of asking for it by alleging she had a history of seeking out older men. Hillary later laughed about the case, audibly, on tape. Hillary Clinton ran a war room to deal with the "bimbo eruptions" that arose from her husband’s serial philandering, and alleged rapes and sexual assaults. She literally created a program that suppressed women harmed by someone who habitually objectified women at best, an outright criminal at worst.
