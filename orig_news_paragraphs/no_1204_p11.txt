Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York have pledged to fight any cuts that could jeopardize the tunnel plan, known as the Gateway project. In 2010, Mr. Christie, a Republican who once led Mr. Trumpâ€™s transition team and had been in the running to be his pick for vice president, canceled a plan to build a new tunnel and a train station just east of Penn Station. It is not lost on many commuters that the new tunnel had been scheduled to open next year.
