Israel said it was taking steps to "significantly rein in the footprint" of the settlements, allowing construction within all its existing settlements in the occupied West Bank but limiting, "wherever possible," their expansion into new territory.

The Palestinians, like most of the rest of the world, oppose any Israeli construction in the occupied territories. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestiniansâ€™ chief negotiator, furiously rejected the Israeli settlement policy.
