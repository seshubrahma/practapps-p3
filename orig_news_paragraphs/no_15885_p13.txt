Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said on CNN that bullets were flying everywhere and that a congressional staffer climbed a   fence in three seconds and flopped down beside him near a big oak tree behind a batting cage. " The gunshots were going into the warning track about five or 10 feet from us and at some point Iâ€™d say 50 or 60 shots at least had been fired from the shooter," Paul said.
