This week’s "Saturday Night Live" on NBC opened with hitting GOP   Donald Trump surrogate Scottie Neil Hughes and Trump himself over his issues with women with a parody of Hughes’ CNN interviews.   Cecily Strong, playing the role of Hughes, lampooned Hughes while defending Trump. She called the retweeting of the photograph of fellow GOP candidate Ted Cruz an "accident," using the excuse that Trump’s hands are "so big" that he cannot see what he retweets. The interview later cut to a live Trump rally where Trump was punching a supporter, and "Hughes" defended him saying the supporter had a bee on his face.
