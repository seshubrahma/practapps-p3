In the past, what economists call the "factors of production" were typically defined as land, natural resources, and capital. It was these tangible inputs that, when combined together by brainy and   people, created new kinds of output. Yet today, much of the economy has been virtualized, and so the old tangibles have been supplanted by new intangibles indeed, one could even say that the most important factors of production today are highly intangible: IQ, adrenalin, and caffeine. Of course, no advance in productivity happens automatically.
