We are a country of laws and those officials who think they are above the law need to be removed from office and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The money and time spent on people that are here illegally comes out of the pocket of taxpayers and needs to be used on citizens and their needs. I can’t just walk into the mayor’s home with my family and demand he now has to take care of me because I don’t like where I live.
