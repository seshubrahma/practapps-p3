The Russian Federation remains in violation of its INF Treaty obligations not to possess, produce or   a   cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5, 500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles," acting spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement issued Tuesday. Russia is believed to have tested one such missile in 2014. " We have made very clear our concerns about Russiaâ€™s violation, the risks it poses to European and Asian security, and our strong interest in returning Russia to compliance with the treaty," Toner added.
