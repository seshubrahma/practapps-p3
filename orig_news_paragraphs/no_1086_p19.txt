Mr. Navalny called for the protests after Russia’s Parliament, which is dominated by United Russia  —   a political party loyal to Mr. Putin   —   ignored demands for an investigation into accusations of corruption by senior government officials. By dusk on Sunday, the protests in Moscow had wound down after sporadic scuffles between the police and protesters. Russian news media reported at least one police officer was taken to a hospital in Moscow with head injuries.
