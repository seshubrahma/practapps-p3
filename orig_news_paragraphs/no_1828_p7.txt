Excedrin, on the day of the third and final presidential debate last month, promoted the hashtag #DebateHeadache on Twitter, saying, "Debates bring headaches Excedrin brings fast headache relief. " The brand tweeted out statistics from a survey it conducted throughout the day, including one that said 73 percent of Americans would experience   headaches this year. The product, given its focus on relieving head pain, doesnâ€™t generally have the opportunity to "speak on a larger scale," especially during a presidential election, said Scott Yacovino, a senior brand manager for Excedrin and the United States pain business at GlaxoSmithKline.
