In its newly released final report, the House Select Panel observed, "Medicaid accounts for 75% of U. S. public expenditures for ‘family planning services,’ up from 20% in 1980. " "During fiscal year 2015, 43% of Planned Parenthood’s revenue derived from ‘government health services grants  reimbursements,’ at a price tag of $553, 700, 000," the panel added, continuing: Further, while abortion providers are not permitted to receive reimbursement for abortion from Medicaid, former employees of Planned Parenthood have testified that Planned Parenthood would separate out charges for services and products rendered in connection with abortions, such as office visits, ultrasounds, Rh factor tests, lab work, general counseling, and abortion aftercare, and submit those "fragmented" or "unbundled" charges as claims for Medicaid reimbursement. Additionally, the House panel notes documentation of external reviews of Planned Parenthood affiliates’ financial data and practices and federal audits of state family planning programs that show Planned Parenthood affiliates have overbilled $132.
