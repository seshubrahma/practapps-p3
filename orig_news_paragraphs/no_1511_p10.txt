But Mr. Trump wrestled on Thursday with the final arrangements for a rollout. He expressed fury to campaign aides over news reports that his advisers were informing political allies of the Indiana governorâ€™s selection, and bristled at the idea that he was locked into the choice. In a phone call with members of the campaign leadership, Mr. Trump questioned whether Mr. Pence really was the right choice, and Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, reiterated the case for choosing Mr. Pence, according to a person briefed on the call. Reached by phone on Friday, Mr. Manafort said Mr. Trump had never wavered on Mr. Pence once the decision was made.
