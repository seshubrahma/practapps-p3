Then there is the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) a club for the worldâ€™s worst human rights abusers, which President George W. Bush wisely avoided, but which Obama enthusiastically forced the U. S. to join. The UNHRC exists for only one purpose, which is to let dictators cover up real human rights abuses by attacking Israel and the U. S. Disgracefully, Obama reported his own country to the UNHRC, allowing Iran the opportunity to bash the U. S. for   human rights abuses. Now, the Obama administration is running for a seat again on the UNHRC, which will hold its elections next month. His goal is to bind the next president to a   term, so that the U. S. has to participate again in that charade no matter who wins.
