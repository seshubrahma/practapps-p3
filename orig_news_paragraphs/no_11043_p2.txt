Nobody paid attention. When I was at Fox, I warned Democrats, please understand if you let the balance of power go out of whack the next guy who can get in could be calling himself a Republican and he will take that same power and use it at the same level or expand it. That is a very bad thing. We need a Constitutional restraint on the executive branch.
