A lone assailant plowed a vehicle into pedestrians on the Westminster Bridge, killing two and injuring 40 others, before crashing into a railing. One of the injured later died at a hospital. He then left the vehicle and fatally stabbed a police officer outside Parliament, before he was shot and killed. The police are investigating it as a terrorist attack.
