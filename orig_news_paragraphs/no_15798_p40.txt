The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members    or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them    aware of the President’s request. Shortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the President’s concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened    him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind    was inappropriate and should never happen.
