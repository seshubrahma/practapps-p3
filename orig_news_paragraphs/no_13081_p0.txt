An Hispanic construction worker in Canada hung a Mexican flag from the Trump International Hotel in Vancouver, Canada.   Diego Saul Reyna took the demonstrative action to take a stand against Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump’s policies on border security and illegal immigration. The flag was draped from the top of Trump’s hotel on Saturday, ABC news reported. Reyna made the move "because from the concrete pouring, finishing, drywall, taping, wood forming and general labor, Mexicans were there, building it, doing good work," ABC News quoted from his Facebook page.
