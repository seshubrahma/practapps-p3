The House of Representatives sued the Obama administration in 2014 over the executive branch’s authority to reimburse insurers for the   reduction authorized by Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act.   Last May, a federal judge ruled that reimbursements for the "cost sharing" provision in Obamacare were not properly approved of by Congress. The provision requires insurance companies offering health plans through the law to reduce    costs for policy holders who qualify, and the government offsets the added costs to insurance companies by reimbursing them. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ordered that the lawsuit filed against Obamacare by lawyers for the House be put on temporary hold until after Trump’s inauguration.
