Malcolm seemed to think that Brexit voters, including former industrial workers in Britainâ€™s   cities, were moved by the same   principles that had made him a convinced Brexiteer. I had my doubts. Resentment about Polish, Romanian and other European Union citizens coming to Britain to work harder for less money played an important part. As did the desire to poke the eye of an unpopular elite, held responsible for the economic stagnation in busted industrial cities.
