Already, President Trump has granted a Pentagon request to declare parts of three provinces of Yemen to be an "area of active hostilities" where looser battlefield rules apply. That opened the door to a Special Operations raid in late January in which several civilians were killed, as well as to the   series of American airstrikes targeting   Qaeda militants, starting nearly two weeks ago, the officials said. Mr. Trump is also expected to sign off soon on a similar Pentagon proposal to designate parts of Somalia to be another such   zone for 180 days, removing constraints on airstrikes and raids targeting people suspected of being militants with the   group the Shabab, they said. Inside the White House, the temporary suspension of the limits for parts of Yemen and Somalia is seen as a test run while the government considers whether to more broadly rescind or relax the   rules, said the officials, who described the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
