I wish that would change, just as I wish more than 80% of all Americans would vote in elections, as they do in Denmark. There are ample reasons for this, of course, from apathy to voter suppression. Iâ€™d add to that list the Electoral College, which many of us see    and have long seen    as an undemocratic bastion of a racist era. If you want to encourage everyone to vote, truly make every vote in every state matter equally.
