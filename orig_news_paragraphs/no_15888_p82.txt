when I ran into the dugout, helped apply a tourniquet with my belt to one of our staffers, who was shot in the leg. And then about 5 feet from my head, I hear another shot.   I did not know if it was a second shooter until I saw that it was one of our security detail. And thatâ€™s when I looked up.
