Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the accusations as "nonsense" on Friday, according to the Russian Interfax News Agency. Even so, the US has sent Russia a "very clear" message about "the unacceptability of interference with democracy in the United States of America," said Kerry. He warned that "we will and can respond in ways that we choose to, at the time of our choice." In light of the tensions, Gorbachev urged a "return to the main priorities" between Russia and the US.
