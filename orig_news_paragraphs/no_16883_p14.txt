In what is now commonly referred to as the "Saturday Night Massacre," Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate burglary. Richardson resigned rather than follow the Presidentâ€™s request. When Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus was asked to do the same, he too refused and left the administration. Nixon ended up outsourcing the deed to Robert Bork, who formally fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox.
