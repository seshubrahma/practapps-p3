Kanye West likened himself to Donald J. Trump at a concert on Saturday in California before tumbling into a     speech addressing radio programmers, MTV, his friends and collaborators Jay Z and Beyoncé, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg and more. After getting an array of grievances off his chest  —   from   politics to   politics   —    Mr. West ended the performance with a microphone drop, having played only three songs, leaving fans bitter and upset, according to reactions on social media.
