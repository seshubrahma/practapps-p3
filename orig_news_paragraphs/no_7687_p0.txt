Protesters disrupted a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday afternoon that met to discuss expanding the city’s "sanctuary city" policy. [Minutes after the meeting began, two activists stood up and began shouting at San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee as he was speaking. They called for the ouster of San Francisco police chief Greg Suhr, who has been accused of being too lenient on racism within the police force, and tolerant of excessive force against black and Latino residents of the city.   Protesters also disrupted Mayor Lee’s inauguration ceremony earlier this year.
