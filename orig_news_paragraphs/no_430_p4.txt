On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed President Trumpâ€™s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil. Exxon had argued that forcing American oil companies to reveal payments to foreign governments would put them at a competitive disadvantage. Full disclosure could also have made it trickier for Exxon to pursue business deals in countries like Russia, where the state plays a central role. Both the coal and   rules were made final in the last days of the Obama administration, putting them in the cross hairs of the   Congress, together with other   Obama regulations yet to take effect.
