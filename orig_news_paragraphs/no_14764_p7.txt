Sessions also interacted with Kislyak in Cleveland at a Heritage Foundation event held during the RNC in July. The revelation of the meetings, which ran counter to his denials during his confirmation hearing that he had met with Russian officials, led Sessions to recuse himself from any investigation involving the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia. Sessions says he doesn’t recall discussing the campaign with Kislyak at any of these meetings.   Kislyak was also present at a VIP reception last April for a foreign policy speech delivered by Trump at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington.
