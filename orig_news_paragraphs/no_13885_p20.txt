Women’s clothing brand the Limited announced Saturday it was closing all of its stores nationwide.   Its website will stay up, though.   These closings add to those of Sears and Kmart, who planned to shut down a combined 150 more stores.   And Macy’s is closing in many places, cutting more than 10, 000 jobs.
