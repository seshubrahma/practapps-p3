Nearly 180, 000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens," said Trump. Trump likely got that number from a congressional hearing last December, when Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said there were 179, 027 undocumented criminal immigrants awaiting removal and at large. While the statistic is more than six months old, and we can’t confirm exactly how many of those criminals have been deported, we rate Trump’s claim as true. Trump then conflated criminals with families apprehended at the border.
