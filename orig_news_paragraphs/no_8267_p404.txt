Voters heading to the polls Tuesday are twice as likely to say they want a president who is a "strong leader" than in 2012, according to Morning   exit data. More than   (36 percent) of 2016 voters said being a strong leader was the most important quality when picking a president, compared with 18 percent of voters who said the same during 2012 election. Itâ€™s an opinion held regardless of partisan leanings: 35 percent of Democrats, 34 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans said that was most important.
