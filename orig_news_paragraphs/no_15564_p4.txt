" There is no reason he can’t testify before both the Intelligence and Judiciary committees, particularly given that the Judiciary committee is the FBI’s primary oversight committee with broad jurisdiction over federal law enforcement, FISA and the nomination of the next FBI director," the senators said. House oversight committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz also announced a hearing next week in which he had invited Comey to testify, but he did so before making contact with Comey, and it’s unlikely the former FBI director plans to attend. A Chaffetz spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request to comment on whether Comey had indicated if he would testify.
