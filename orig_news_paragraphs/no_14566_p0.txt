Washington (CNN) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg offered a dark assessment of the country’s current state in a pair of interviews Thursday, but said there was reason to hope for better in the long run.   Although she didn’t mention President Donald Trump by name, she said the country was not mindful of "what makes America great" while stressing the importance of a free speech and "the idea of our nation being receptive to all people, welcoming all people." "For the most part, those are our ideals, our treasured First Amendment and the notion that in our nation we are many and yet we are one," she said in a discussion moderated by NPR’s Nina Totenberg and   by the Newseum and the Supreme Court Fellows Association in Washington.
