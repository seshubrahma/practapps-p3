Years of calling Gingrich the "former House speaker" as his title in articles is somewhat anachronistic. He has been, for a Republican generation that elected virtually the entire 2016 presidential field, more like Washingtonâ€™s most active citizen attendee of government ethics and reform hearings. He can be seen on the Hill sometimes doing things like blocking new Section 1332 regulations on Obamacare by the Department of Health and Human Services. He also runs a media production company on the Virginia side of the Key Bridge.
