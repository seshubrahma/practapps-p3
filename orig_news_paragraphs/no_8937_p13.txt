When the Catholic Church criticized communists during the Cold War, it described them as "Satanic and  poisonous" but not irredeemable, Kengor said. " In Christianity, everybody who is alive and walking  on the planet can be redeemed," he said.   Symbolically, getting exiled as a "irredeemable" is "worse than being exiled to Siberia [by the Soviet government] because you have the hope some day of being let out of Siberia   …     even in Siberia, hope didn’t die," he said.
