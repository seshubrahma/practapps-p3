The hostile atmosphere in the race has been worsening by the day. In the past 48 hours, several women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct following reports of a tape in which the Republican nominee talks about grabbing women by the genitals. Protestors have been interrupting Clinton to accuse her husband of rape, after Trump brought women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second debate. Trump is increasingly warning of a "conspiracy" that he says is being waged against him by the Republican Party, corporate interests and the mainstream media.
