Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed President Obama’s order that 35 Russian diplomats leave the country, in response to assertions by the intelligence community that Russia had hacked into Democratic email accounts. [In a statement, Putin said that Obama’s actions were a provocation, but said he would not respond in kind, in spite of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ’s proposal that he expel 35 diplomats from Russia.   "Reserving the right to retaliate, we will not resort to the level of irresponsible ‘kitchen’ diplomacy," Putin said in a translated statement, calling it "regrettable" that Obama was choosing to end his administration with the provocative action.
