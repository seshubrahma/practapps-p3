The timing of the ban seemed intended to reset the White House political narrative, after a turbulent week that began with Mr. Trump’s   address to Congress. That success was quickly overshadowed by the controversies over Mr. Sessions ’s failure to inform the Senate of his contacts with the Russian ambassador and Mr. Trump’s unsupported accusation that President Barack Obama tapped Mr. Trump’s phones during the 2016 campaign. Critics say that Mr. Trump’s vow to impose "extreme vetting" on migrants, especially those fleeing the war in Syria, disregards already stringent screening measures, and the fact that none of the recent terrorist attacks or mass shootings on American soil were perpetrated by people from the nations listed in the ban.
