Days before the Iowa caucuses this year, The Washington Post published an unflattering report on the   Caribbean investment fund Mr. Panton founded with Mr. Cruz. Mr. Panton was mortified that the article would do harm to his friend, according to a person who discussed the matter with him but declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak for the campaign. A year after Mr. Cruz and Mr. Panton went into business, Mr. Panton married Lisa Hanna, a former Miss Jamaica and Miss World who is now a member of Jamaica’s Parliament, in a New York ceremony during which Mr. Cruz gave the toast. Mr. Panton soon made the move to politics, leading a youth wing of the Jamaica Labour Party, which Mr. Cruz addressed in 2001, and taking a seat in the country’s Senate.
