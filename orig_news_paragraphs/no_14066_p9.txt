My first went on to earn a doctorate, but she still tells me stories about encountering barriers for females in the professional world. My teenager, the one from my second marriage, attends a racially mixed high school and already sees the   disadvantages some of her friends face. I want her to grow up in a world where a woman controls her own body and determines her own future.   All this took a long time to sink in over the years.
