One person who attended a classified briefing on the intelligence said that the investigators had explained that the malware used in the cyberattack on the D. N. C. matched tools previously used by hackers with proven ties to the Russian government. That sort of "pattern analysis" is common in cyberinvestigations, though it is not conclusive. But the intelligence agencies had more: They had managed to identify the individuals from the G. R. U. who oversaw the hacking efforts. That may have come from intercepted conversations, spying efforts, or implants in computer systems that allow the tracking of emails and text messages.
