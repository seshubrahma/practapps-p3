But the headache it caused Mr. de Blasio on Monday might not have been worth the trip, as a photograph and a video of the copter incongruously parked in the middle of a city park ricocheted around the internet, and reporters waited outside City Hall to ask him about it. The attention to his flight presented a   situation for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who has been criticized for arriving late to events and now finds himself justifying his attempts to arrive on time. The mayor, like his predecessors, has occasionally availed himself of the Police Departmentâ€™s helicopters to get to important events. Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an experienced helicopter pilot, did not hesitate to use city helicopters when necessary, or his own private helicopter.
