Nearing the end of the rally, three young people came out of the building, announcing that they had been kicked out. One of them identified the group as supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.   Inside the rally, Trump supporters were enthusiastic and positive. Only a few protesters had to be removed from the crowd.
