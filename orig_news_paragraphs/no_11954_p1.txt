The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country," Trump explained during his speech addressing the terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida that killed roughly 50 people.   The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate. I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.
