A CNN piece that ran Friday describes his "precision" antics: Marco Rubio is running a presidential campaign marked by precision, caution and discipline   —   so much so that the Florida senator delivers the exact same speech, jokes, quips and   wherever he goes   …      When he addresses the media, his aides select the reporters who can ask questions, often shutting down  . Another rival, Gov. Jeb Bush, has pointed to Rubio’s alleged lack of experience, saying the Senator has done very little in life other than work as a professional politician.
