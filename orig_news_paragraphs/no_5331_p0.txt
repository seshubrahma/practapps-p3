MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance reacted on "AM Joy" to the report that President Donald Trumpâ€™s    Jared Kushner is a focus of the investigation into possible Russian interference with the 2016 election.   Although Nance admitted that it is not known if the Russians "penetrated" the White House, he said we have to assume they have. " We should be taking this seriously," Nance told host Joy Reid.
