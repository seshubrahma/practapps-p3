Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, vigorously defended his newspaperâ€™s coverage of President Trump on Monday, rejecting suggestions that The Journal had not been aggressive enough. Facing tough questioning at a    meeting with the staff, Mr. Baker denied that The Journal had been too soft in its coverage, according to several people who participated in the meeting. He suggested that other papers had discarded objectivity, and that anyone who wanted to work at an organization with a more oppositional stance toward the administration could find a job elsewhere, these people said.
