Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to call out Jordan, the former chairman of the conservative House group, as well as its current leader, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and fellow member Raul Labrador of Idaho over their opposition to the   GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care program.   On Saturday, the White House’s social media director, Dan Scavino, also went after another Freedom Caucus member, Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, saying Trump’s supporters should drive him out of office in the next primary election. Amash responded shortly afterward by tweeting that Trump had become like the very political establishment that he campaigned against and the caucus has opposed. Jordan defended Amash on Sunday and said he would come to his aid in a primary challenge.
