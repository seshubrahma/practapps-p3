Markman wrote a scathing dissent from a 2011 Michigan Supreme Court decision that held illegal aliens could be considered a "vulnerable victim" class. The majority, which included Justice Robert Young, now on Trump’s "short list" for the U. S. Supreme Court, held that criminals who victimized illegals could be sentenced more harshly than those who harmed American citizens, because illegal aliens, due to their own crimes, would be reluctant to go to the police. The majority refused even to use the term "illegal alien" as Markman did, preferring the academic and media left’s "undocumented. "
