International Organization for Migration in Tapachula director Claudette Walls says the influx is due to economic hardships in Brazil and an international migrant crisis, in addition to Trumpâ€™s November victory. Trump has reiterated his proposals, most recently, to close the southern border with a wall, as well as cracking down on criminal illegal immigrants living in the country who have yet to be deported. With those prospects, migrants are trying to gain access into the U. S. to "reunite with relatives," according to Reuters, before Trump takes the oath of office. Breitbart Texas reported back in September 2016 how African migrants, specifically from   terror hotbed Somalia were being helped across Mexico via special permits that allow them to continue to the U. S. unimpeded.
