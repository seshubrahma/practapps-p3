Trump met with Abbas on May 3 in Washington and is due to meet him again next week in Bethlehem during his visit to Israel. According to Levin, Trump "may not be informed" and instead has been placing his trust in people like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and "military bureaucrat" H. R. McMaster, Trumpâ€™s national security advisor, both of whom, Levin argued, are "pushing the agenda" that a two state solution is still possible. Levin said, "So quickly and easily has the president of the United States fallen into the lap of the leftists, of the bureaucrats, of the State Department, of the swamp. "
