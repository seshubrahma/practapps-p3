This 6. 7 percent popular vote advantage translated into an 11 percent advantage in the number of representatives elected. Due to the redistricting after the 2010 census, the same vote margin in the same precincts in 2018 might not be sufficient for the Democrats to obtain the desired 218 vote majority.
