CIVIC staffer Tina Shull runs the organization’s "storytelling projects," while also being a recipient of the Soros Justice Fellowship, a   grant department that gives out anywhere between $58, 700 to $110, 250 to specific individuals for social justice advocacy. CIVIC’s   director Christina Fialho told Mother Jones in an interview that California potential ban on detaining illegal immigrants was a "powerful first step" in the state ’s overall agenda to oppose President Trump’s agenda. This is not the first California initiative this year that   organizations have pushed.
