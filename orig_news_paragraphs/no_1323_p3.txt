That makes it more substantial than   and   cases against imports from a single country. The European Union objected to President Bushâ€™s use of Section 201, which resulted in American tariffs on a wide range of steel products, until the administration dropped them in late 2003. But Section 201 cases are also harder to win. They require proof that a domestic industry has been "seriously injured" by imports, a harder test than the mere proof of "injury" from imports that is required for other trade cases.
