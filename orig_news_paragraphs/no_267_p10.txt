The Syrian government and the Russians have long argued that the Geneva framework, calling for a transitional body with full governing powers, does not require President Bashar   to step down, while the opposition has insisted that it does. But as a practical matter, an increasing number of Western countries, including the United States, and even some of the rebelsâ€™ backers in the Middle East, like Turkey, have moved toward the Russian position. With Turkey mainly concerned about checking Kurdish militants within its borders and in Syria, and the United States focused on battling Islamic State militants, they have stopped pushing loudly for Mr. Assad to step down ahead of a settlement, instead signaling that they could accept some role for him in a transitional political arrangement. There were signs on Monday of Russian willingness to apply pressure on the Syrian government to keep the talks on track.
