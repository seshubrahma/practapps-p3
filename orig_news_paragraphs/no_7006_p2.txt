But not, apparently. The New York Times is urging President Trump to ignore the facts and the evidence, and instead listen to the siren voices of his daughter Ivanka, his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the various assorted members of the Climate Industrial Complex who would prefer the U. S. to remain shackled to one of the most stupid and pointless agreements in American history. They want him to keep the U. S. stuck in the disastrous and   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At least George H. W. Bush, who nodded through the deal at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, had the excuse that he was going with the flow of the popular mood and acting in accordance with the known science of the time.
