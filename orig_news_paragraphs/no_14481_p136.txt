I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.    But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?    That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story.
