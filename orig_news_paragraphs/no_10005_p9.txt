The Palestinian Authority has reportedly been lobbying President Obama not to veto a potential UN resolution regarding the creation of a Palestinian state or criticism of Israelâ€™s settlements that could be introduced some time early next month before   Donald Trump takes office on January 20. Speaking to the Saban Forum in Washington earlier this month, Secretary of State John Kerry refused to confirm that the U. S. would veto a UN resolution intended to set guidelines for the establishment of a Palestinian state, allowing only that the Obama administration would veto a resolution "if it is a biased, unfair resolution calculated to delegitimize Israel. " Congress last month issued a nonbinding resolution opposing UN action, instead highlighting the importance of direct negotiations between the parties.
