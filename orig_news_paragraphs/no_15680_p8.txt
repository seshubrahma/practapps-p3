The decision to invoke the act of terrorism that took 22 lives and injured dozens more in a routine holiday statement was a break from the Obama administration, which did not mention terrorism in its annual statements on the Muslim holiday. Muslim groups and advocates have criticized Trump as being   citing his rhetoric on the campaign trail and his call for additional surveillance of mosques. As President, he has attempted to ban citizens of several   countries from traveling to the United States. But this past week in Saudi Arabia, the President tried to make clear the US does not stand against Islam, drawing a distinction between the religion as a whole and its violent, extremist adherents.
