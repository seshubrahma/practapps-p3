Washington (CNN) Former CIA Director James Woolsey downplayed his role Thursday in   Donald Trump’s transition, days after he publicly disputed the  ’s views on Russia’s role in the 2016 election. In a statement, he formally announced he would no longer serve as an adviser to Trump. But he insisted in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett that the move had nothing to do with his comments on Russia, only that he wanted to avoid any confusion about his role with Trump.
