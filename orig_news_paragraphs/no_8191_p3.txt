Bill Clinton made the same promise to an audience in California. From Vida en El Valle: Using the plight of undocumented immigrants and farmworkers to draw a stark contrast between a United States led by his wife or one led by billionaire Donald J. Trump, former President Bill Clinton made the case in a   address to an audience of about 3, 000 at Rabobank Arena Sunday afternoon to close the United Farm Workers Constitutional Convention.    â€¦      The former president spoke comfortably and was greeted with applause during parts of his speech, especially when he said his wife would make sure that, within the first 100 days of her presidency, she would introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation.
