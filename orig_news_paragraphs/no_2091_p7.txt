Significantly, the Chinese grabbed the drone not only in international waters but outside even the "  line" that China uses as a marker for its claims in the South China Sea. In so doing, analysts said, Beijing was making the point that the entire sea was its preserve, even though it is entirely legal for the United States to conduct military operations in waters within 200 miles of the Philippines, an area known as an exclusive economic zone. In the last dozen years, China has steadily showed off its growing military prowess to the countries around the South China Sea, which carries trillions of dollars of world trade and which China values for its strategic access to the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. As China has built up its navy and its submarine fleet in the last decade, it has also emphasized what it calls its "inherent" right to dominate the regional seas, and to challenge the presence of the United States, its allies and partners in Asia.
