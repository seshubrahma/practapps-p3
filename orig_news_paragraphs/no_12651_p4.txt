In one direct jab, Obama stated that a president does not cry foul as she began to tap her microphone and smile, referring to the microphone troubles that Trump had during the first debate. This technical problem was first played off as Trump "crying foul," but was ultimately proven to be true. Obama also attacked Trump on the birther issue, claiming that her husband was indeed born in this country and the hurtful, deceitful claims were only used as a way to undermine his presidency. She went on to say that the damage caused could not be undone by an insincere statement at a press conference.
