Friday on Fox News Channel’s "Tucker Carlson Tonight," host Tucker Carlson took on Roll Call columnist Jonathan Allen, a former Democratic operative, for a column he wrote declaring Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) "unfit" to serve in   Donald Trump’s cabinet.   Throughout the segment, Carlson and Allen debated the merits of the column on the grounds of Sessions being a racist, as Allen had insinuated. Allen insisted there was sufficient evidence for such a discussion about Sessions on those grounds.
