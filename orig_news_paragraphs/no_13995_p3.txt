In 1968, the Mobilization Committee to End the War in Washington came to town, with some of the activists throwing bottles and food at the presidential motorcade and holding signs critical of the new president. About 200   protesters were able to obtain bleacher seats on Pennsylvania Avenue, from which they waved flags of the National Liberation Front. In January 1973, following Nixonâ€™s landslide reelection victory against George McGovern, the protests were back. Almost 100, 000 protesters massed at the Washington Monument, with some marching toward the Lincoln Memorial.
