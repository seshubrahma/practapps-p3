Speaking to the news agency, Podesta described in general terms some of what he said he was his work for the Centre. Reuters reported: Podesta said in a phone interview that he and his counterparts at Mercury have been contacting U. S. legislators to argue that approving the   measures would only complicate efforts to improve relations between Ukraine and the West, including the European Union. Podesta was referring to calls from some in Washington for Ukraine to release from prison the countryâ€™s former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, an opposition figure who opposes Russian influence and strives for Ukrainian integration into the European Union. At the time, John Podesta was reentering the White House as counselor.
