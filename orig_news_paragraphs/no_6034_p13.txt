I envision a California much like the country that our founding fathers envisioned   â€”   a country where all are treated equally under the law a country that provides for the common defense, promotes the general welfare of its people, and a country that secures our liberty from foreign and domestic threats. This campaign is at its heart a very American campaign, if by "American " we mean the America that was originally established and in a time period when its Constitution was actually followed.
