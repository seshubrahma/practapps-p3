 (CNN) Hillary Clinton’s campaign is warning Americans of a future in which Donald Trump is in control of the US’s nuclear arsenal in a new ad featuring a former nuclear missile launch officer. The   ad, which is running on national cable TV and in six battleground states, according to a Clinton official, marks the campaign’s most direct warning yet to voters that Trump is too erratic to be    and could endanger the country and the world’s safety and security as president. It includes an image of a missile inside a silo as an alarm sounds in the background.
