Immediately after describing his version of discussions with Comey, Trump sent out a tweet warning Comey he "better hope there are no tapes" of their conversations. Why would Trump say that before Comey had a chance to respond to Trump’s version of the meetings? Was it because Trump must have known his version was not the truth and wanted to launch a   strike against Comey before Comey could respond.   That’s the same approach the White House is using now to question Comey’s credibility before his upcoming testimony.
