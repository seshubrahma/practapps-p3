But by Thursday evening, Mr. Trump was using Twitter to complain about demonstrations against his victory, saying they were being mounted by "professional protesters, incited by the media," and branding them as "very unfair!" The social media sniping  —   unparalleled in the history of presidential communication   —   suggested that Mr. Trump plans to bring his confrontational style of speaking to Americans to the White House, working to undercut news outlets that do not comport with his views, silence his critics and elevate his own standing. On Sunday, he selected Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a site known for its nationalist, racially charged and   coverage, to be his chief strategist and senior counselor.
