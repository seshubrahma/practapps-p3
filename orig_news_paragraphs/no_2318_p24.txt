In talking points given to surrogates on Saturday, and obtained by The New York Times, the campaign advised anyone speaking about the "deplorable" issue in the news media to reiterate that while Mrs. Clinton intended to say "some" instead of "half," Mr. Trump, as she had pointed out in the past, "has clearly brought the  ’s hate into his campaign and into the mainstream. " The talking points advised that anyone who is pressed on the "deplorable" remarks should assert that the news media was holding Mrs. Clinton to a different standard than Mr. Trump, with this suggested rejoinder: "Are they going to make more out of this story than they made out of the racist, misogynistic Trump comments that got us here in the first place? " Prof. Jennifer Mercieca, an expert in American political discourse at Texas AM University, said in an email that the "deplorable" comment "sounds bad on the face of it" and compared it to Mr. Romney’s 47 percent gaffe.
