Alice Fisher, Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ Criminal Division under President George W. Bush, and Michael Garcia of the highest New York State Court, also reportedly interviewed for the directorship over the weekend, but no further progress on their consideration has been made public. It is also possible current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a career Bureau man, will be put in the position on a permanent basis.   Some FBI officials have expressed serious concerns over this possibility, pointing to McCabe’s failure to report $467, 500 of donations to his wife’s state senate campaign from Democratic Virginia Governor and close Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe’s Political Action Committee. McCabe also refused to recuse himself from the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails over the scandal.
