["The U. S. statesmen should be very wise and avoid threatening Iran, because the entire world has admitted this fact that the Americans cannot do such a thing," said Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour, chief of the IRGCâ€™s ground forces, according to the   Fars news agency.   Pakpour was referring to alleged threats of "military aggression" against Iran, Fars reported.   " Hence, they are unlikely to do such a move because it is unwise," he added.
