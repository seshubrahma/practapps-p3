The Mayor of Berkeley and the University of California Police Department (UCPD) union blamed the administration of UC Berkeley on Friday for not preparing for the violent riot that forced the cancellation of a speech by Breitbart News tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos, according to Bay Area public broadcaster KQED. [The UCPD reported that out of 1, 500 demonstrators, about 150 masked individuals, using paramilitary tactics, led the violence by hurling Molotov cocktails, setting fires, throwing fireworks at police, pushing barricades into windows, and damaging campus and city property. They estimated that the protestors caused about $100, 000 in damage to the campus, and significant damage to downtown businesses along Telegraph Avenue, including Bank of America.   Despite claims that outside agitators took over the event, the call to shut down Milo was advertised in a January 31 editorial in the Daily Californian student paper by first year Boalt Hall law student Mukund Rathi.
