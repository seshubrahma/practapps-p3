According to the World Bank, if Chinaâ€™s currency were trading at a rate that actually reflected the cost of buying goods and services in China, it would cost 3. 5 yuan to purchase 1 dollar but instead it costs about 6. 7. American businesses face similar problems with other major trading nations such as Japan, South Korea and Mexico but with globalized supply chains and the benefits Americans enjoy from   imports, no one wants to turn to blind protectionism and shut down trade. Instead, the next president should renegotiate and better enforce existing agreements to ensure more balanced trade. That would boost exports, redirect U. S. consumer demand to American factories, substantially increase GDP growth and tax revenues, and reduce budget deficits.
