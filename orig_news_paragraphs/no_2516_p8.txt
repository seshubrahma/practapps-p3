The average interest rate on a mortgage this month is 4. 3 percent, according to LendingTree, and the average loan on a     mortgage is worth about $237, 000. If the borrowing rate were to rise by, say, another percentage point in the coming year, this would mean an additional $138 a month on the average mortgage   â€”   leading to nearly $50, 000 in added interest over the duration of the loan. As mortgage rates go up, people are a little less likely to buy a house, and those with   mortgages are less likely to refinance (because they probably will not end up with a better deal).
