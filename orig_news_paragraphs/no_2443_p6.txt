There is almost universal agreement that the  ’s penthouse suite in Trump Tower poses more formidable security challenges than most presidential homes. Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who has protected both President George W. Bush and President Obama, said that compared with the residences of past presidents "the penthouse is going to be tough," particularly if, while president, Mr. Trump decided to spend significant time there. Mr. Trump’s residence, at the top of the   building, is generally reached by elevator, which poses problems in terms of getting in and out quickly. Some surrounding buildings have clear views to Trump Tower, which will need to be monitored by the Secret Service.
