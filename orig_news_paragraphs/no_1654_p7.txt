In Florida, the scene of the Pulse nightclub massacre, Representative Patrick Murphy, a Democrat, is using the issue in his Senate campaign against Marco Rubio, the incumbent Republican, noting that Mr. Rubio was endorsed by the N. R. A. soon after the shooting. But nowhere is the issue being pushed more than in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Ms. Giffordsâ€™s group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, has spent nearly $1. 5 million hammering Ms. Ayotte on her record, which has left the incumbent moving quickly to support legislation aimed at preventing gun purchases for those on terror watch lists. Ms. Giffords has endorsed Mr. Toomey, who after the Sandy Hook school massacre sponsored legislation with Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, to stiffen laws on background checks of gun buyers.
