That’s more than Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. But Trump hasn’t signed any "major legislation"    a bill that delivers on a campaign promise or has a nationwide impact. Eleven of the laws Trump signed overturn   regulations, like rules about the Internet and Social Security. Four of the laws are purely ceremonial and rename memorials and VA clinics.
