Trump, in contrast to the pope, lives in a manner more redolent of prosperity theology, also known as the "health and wealth" gospel, which is much closer to my beliefs. Although it was originally a Protestant doctrine, some Catholics have adopted a modified version of it. Sensibly, this doctrine asserts that in order to help others, you first have to help yourself. Impoverishing a country by flooding its borders with unskilled workers is no way to help anyone.
