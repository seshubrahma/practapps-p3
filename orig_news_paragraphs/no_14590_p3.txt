My mother worked really hard to ensure that I had black dolls (of all hues) black books by black authors, and my personal favorite: a poster from the 1975   Great Kings and Queens of Africa collection (of course, she removed the beer logo).   She would regularly have me name family members and friends who looked like each of the queens and kings on the poster.    My mother would always emphasize that we were related to the royalty on that poster because EVERYONE originated from Africa.   Not only did I always know I was black, I always knew we were and are beautiful, culturally rich, and creators of everything from the sciences to the arts.
