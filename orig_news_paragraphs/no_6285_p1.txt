The Department of Justice will fulfill our responsibility to uphold and enforce our nationâ€™s immigration laws, including 8 U. S. C. 1373.   Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice required certain grantees to certify compliance with federal law, including 8 U. S. C. 1373, as a condition for receiving grant funding. 8 U. S. C. 1373 prohibits local jurisdictions from preventing the Immigration and Naturalization Service from getting immigration status information on people they detain. At least two leaders from such jurisdictions attended the morning meeting with the Attorney General, Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, and Mayor Steve Adler of Austin.
