Some lawmakers have claimed there are safeguards against such a case. In light of   Donald Trump’s promises to secure the border and enforce immigration laws, illegal aliens and California legislators have already begun working on contingency plans. Former Assemblyman Luis Alejo, author of AB 60, offered reassurance to illegal aliens that he had spoken with Gov. Jerry Brown’s office, the DMV, and state legislative leaders who are all "committed to protecting all the information submitted to the DMV by AB60 applicants," according to the Mercury News. Alejo pledged to fight against the Trump administration on illegal immigration and to do "everything possible" to maintain AB 60.
