"We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity   —   so important," Mr. Trump said, noting that the status of most illegal immigrants was no longer a "core issue" for him. Mr. Trump also invited a group of Americans to the stage who, one by one, shared the names of relatives who they said were killed by illegal immigrants and insisted that only Mr. Trump could protect the country by securing its borders and moving swiftly to deport immigrants with criminal records.
