Part of the problem surely lies in the conventional wisdom that tells writers to "write what you know," and what most writers in television and cinema know is a world in which women smack their heads against the glass ceiling, repeatedly, and hard. Maybe Sorkin and Beau Willimon, one of the original writers of "House of Cards," don’t write female political characters who are as complex as their male counterparts because there aren’t enough prominent female figures in politics to draw from (see figure A from Trump’s overwhelmingly white and male ’focus group’ on health care).   I empathize with the limitation, really, I do.
