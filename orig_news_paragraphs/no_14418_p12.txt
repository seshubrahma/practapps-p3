First lady Melania Trump and Abeâ€™s wife, Akie, remained seated across from their husbands, speaking quietly through a translator amid the activity. Earlier in the day, the women had toured a nearby Japanese garden and visited the gothic     church, where Trump and his wife were married in 2005. Eventually Trump and Abe, along with their collection of aides, stood and moved from the dining terrace and toward a   ballroom, whose gilded columns were concealed by more   black drapes. Standing in front of an American and Japanese flag, a   Abe called the launch "absolutely intolerable," and insisted North Korea adhere to United Nations Security Council resolutions barring it from testing of ballistic missiles.
