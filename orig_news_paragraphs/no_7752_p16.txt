" Both of the campaigns should fight for the nomination within the existing rules and shut down all efforts to change the rules to suit the elites who have been shut down at the polls," Gill concludes. Gill also offers an interesting social media tactic Cruz and Trump delegates could use to independently coordinate alliances in other states: Everybody has a hashtag these days, so maybe the Cruz and Trump folks need to unify under the banner of #allrulesmatter to make our point. If the Cruz and Trump delegates don’t come together on this issue, even while still battling for who gets the nomination between them, then we are likely to show up at the Convention with the fix being put in place and both groups being outraged over what was done because we didn’t take the steps to stop it when we could.
