I fell into conversation with Nawazâ€™s mother and little sister and lost track of time as the space filled up all around us. There were whites, blacks, Persians, Arabs people looked devout and nondevout, gay, straight, young and old. Standing next to me was a man with the voluminous beard of a cleric, turned out in an   djellaba, ironed as crisply as a bedsheet at the Ritz, a pair of Nike Air Force 1s and a   New Era cap printed with a   expletive. He looked like a cross between the leader of Hezbollah and the Bay Area rapper Lil B.
