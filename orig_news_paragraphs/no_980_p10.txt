This presentation is also an important bookend to the 1993 Biennial, a raucous, untidy show unforgettable for the   issues it threw in viewers’ faces   —   and for often overly didactic, hectoring and visually dry art. The current Biennial reflects the emergence of artists committed to political subject matter but unwilling to limit themselves artistically or to lecture viewers. Mr. Marshall, who presides here in absentia, has lots of company.
