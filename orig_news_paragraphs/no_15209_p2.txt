Trump has repeatedly asserted, without providing any evidence, that three to five million people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election    similar to the margin of Clintonâ€™s popular vote victory over Trump. " In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," he tweeted in late November. Trump was initially set to sign an executive order looking into the alleged voter fraud on January 26, a few days after taking office.
