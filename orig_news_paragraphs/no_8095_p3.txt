Although a few student protesters showed up with posters to chant outside of the auditorium, their presence was dwarfed by a significant number of students wearing "Make America Great Again" hats and carrying "Socialism sucks" signs. White Auditorium at Emory University wasn’t enough to contain the students who came out to see Yiannopoulos on Wednesday night. About a dozen students were lined up at the door, just so that they might get the chance to see Yiannopoulos on his way out of the auditorium. For those who wished to watch the lecture, but weren’t able to get a seat, a live video feed of the event was played in a nearby classroom.
