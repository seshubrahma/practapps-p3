Marco Rubio ( ) according to a new poll. [With former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly considering a presidential run as an Independent, a Morning Consult Poll found that he would draw from Clintonâ€™s support in a   matchup among Bloomberg, Clinton and Trump.   Trump received 37 percent, Clinton had 36 percent and Bloomberg snagged 13 percent, according to the results. However, Clinton wins in the   match ups when Cruz and Rubio replace Trump.
