WASHINGTON   â€”    On April 3, 1962, President John F. Kennedy nominated Byron R. White to the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed him by a voice vote less than two weeks later, after a perfunctory   hearing during which the nominee smoked cigarettes and doodled while senators praised his legal skills.
