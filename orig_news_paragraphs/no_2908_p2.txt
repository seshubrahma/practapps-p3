I’m at Plan B, the film production company Pitt   in 2001 and now owns, and I’ve decided to impress him with my knowledge of architecture, something he learned about while helping to rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I figured I’d introduce him to Shigeru Ban, famous for his Cardboard Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand, and other   projects around the world. But there, sitting on Pitt’s bookshelf, is an entire monograph of his work.
