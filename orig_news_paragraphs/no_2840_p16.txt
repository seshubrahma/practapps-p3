How and why exactly all this transpires is hard to say, mostly because Ensign never really says. As if under a gag order, she skates over the details of her divorce and parenting arrangement and takes the reader headlong into a phase where she is, by turns, suicidal, addicted to exercise and sexually promiscuous. If "Catching Homelessness" doesnâ€™t quite work as a memoir, it succeeds rather heroically on the level of document. Ensign takes us back to a time when   psychiatric facilities had only recently attempted to integrate patients back into the community and "street people" were a relative novelty in some cities.
