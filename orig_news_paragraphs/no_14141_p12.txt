The Senate committee also said it would review "the intelligence that informed" the intelligence report. On Thursday evening, after Trump said he was considering allowing intelligence agencies to resume the use of torture, the seven Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee urged Trump to read the committee’s report, which found that the CIA’s program of torture and indefinite secret detention was ineffective at gathering intelligence. Both committees are hoping to receive records at their Capitol offices instead of being forced by the CIA to travel to the agency’s suburban Washington headquarters for review. The CIA imposed such a restriction when the Senate intelligence committee investigated the agency’s detention and interrogation program in the early 2010s.
