The embassy in Baghdad did not disclose the number of Iraqis affected by the change in the Trump administrationâ€™s visa ban. Only 19 such visas were issued to Iraqi interpreters and their families during the past three years, according to State Department figures. Mr. Trump said when he issued the executive order that it was intended to allow American officials to vet Iraqis and others more thoroughly. But the interpreters had extensive security vetting before they were permitted to accompany American forces.
