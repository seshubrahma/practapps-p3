Meanwhile, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) claimed that Bannon was "the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white   propaganda mill. " The SPLC is a   group that works furiously to silence dissent and impose a totalitarian straitjacket on the public discourse on these issues, only allowing voices that toe their propaganda line about Islam being a religion of peace and Muslims as the victims, rather than the perpetrators, of terrorism. The SPLC uses its hate group listings to demonize conservatives and anyone who dissents from its statist, authoritarian agenda.
