WASHINGTON   —   President Trump, seeming to relish a fight with Democrats over his nominee to the Supreme Court, encouraged the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on Wednesday to invoke the   nuclear option and abandon the   threshold for confirmation. " If we end up with that gridlock, I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,’" the president said.
