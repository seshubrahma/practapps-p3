Often Iâ€™d try to pollute the immaculate individual haftsin bowls with Cheerios and MMs, anything obviously American.    But I also relished all the cultural "abnormalities" that could feel like American transgressions    for instance, my parents waking us up in the middle of the night on a school night to celebrate "tahvileh sal," the exact moment of equinox, a given ritual no matter what horrible hour it came.   We grew up with few luxuries, so I usually felt so excited that Nowruz was also a time of treats.
