According to the Department of Education, "In its investigation of Corinthian Colleges, the Department found numerous causes for concern with practices throughout the Heald College system  …     for example, one campus classified a 2011 graduate of an Accounting program as employed in the field based upon a food service job she started at Taco Bell in June 2006. " "In February, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced $480 million in debt relief for students it deemed were ‘harmed by Corinthian’s predatory lending scheme,’" Bloomberg writes. Yet Corinthian is not the only predatory   school with financial ties to Sen. Rubio. Reports show that Sen. Rubio also received money from the owner of Dade Medical College, Ernesto Perez —  who last year pled guilty to illegally making more than $159, 000 in campaign contributions.
