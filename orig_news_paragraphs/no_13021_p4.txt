David Duke IS a random person: The KKK has not been an organization of any significance since the  ’60s (outside of Southern Poverty Law Center fundraisers) and David Duke hasn’t been a member of this meaningless group since 1980. Also, David Duke has never been accused of rape. Hillary’s most prominent supporter has. Will she be asked to disavow Bill Clinton?
