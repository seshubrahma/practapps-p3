The College Fix reports Denison University, a private institution in Ohio, is sponsoring a bus trip to the march via the school’s women and gender studies program. " We don’t want participation in these experiences to be available only to those who are sufficiently privileged that they can find a way to make the   trip to our nation’s capital and back," said Dr. Gill Wright Miller, director of the Women   Gender Studies program.
