There are worse insults in the English lexicon than calling someone a "total arse" —  as I was reminded by the large number of responses I got from Hope Not Hate   telling me as I was a "c ***". My view on this remains as it was when I tweeted it: that if you’re going to express suspect opinions in the public arena, then you should expect to be called on them, no matter how tragic your personal circumstances.
