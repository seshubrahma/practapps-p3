The federal government spent hundreds of millions of dollars more than that on refugees, however. The Department of Health and Human Services also provided a number of "entitlements" to these refugees,"   Breitbart News reported in 2015: Much of this $1 billion in annual revenue goes to voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) several of which are Christian   such as Catholic Charities, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, World Relief Corporation, Church World Service, and Domestic and Foreign Missionary Service of the Episcopal Church of the USA. (also referred to as Episcopal Migration Ministries) who are contracted on behalf of the government to help these refugees get settled in their new homes in America.
