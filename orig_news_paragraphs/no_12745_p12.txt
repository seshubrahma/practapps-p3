Although Pence’s faith impacts every aspect of his life, his political philosophy is broader than his Christianity. " I’m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order," Pence would often say in speeches, making it explicit that he considered conservative principles more important than party loyalty or partisan politics, and that his faith in Jesus Christ trumps everything. His declaration horrifies liberals, but made Pence a darling of the Right earlier in his congressional career.
