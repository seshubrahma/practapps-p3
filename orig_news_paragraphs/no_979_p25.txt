The Fed’s move to raise rates puts it on course for a   collision with President Trump, who has repeatedly promised to increase economic growth through policies including cuts in taxation and regulation and more spending on infrastructure and defense. Fed officials have emphasized that the economy is already growing at roughly its maximum sustainable pace faster growth would therefore lead to faster increases in interest rates. Some economists and liberal activists argue that the Fed is raising rates too quickly. Narayana Kocherlakota, an economist at the University of Rochester and a former member of the Fed’s   committee, noted that strong economic growth continued to pull people into the job market while wage growth remained relatively weak.
