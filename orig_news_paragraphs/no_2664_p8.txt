The United States formally suspended its talks with Russia about the war in Syria. Secretary of State John Kerry threatened to do so last week as Russia and Syria carried out a brutal bombing campaign in   parts of Aleppo, where 275, 000 civilians  —   including about 100, 000 children  —   are trapped. Plans for jointly targeting jihadists have also been shelved. _
