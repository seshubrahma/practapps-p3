 (CNN) Last week was the anniversary of the announcement of President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which gives unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the United States as children temporary protection from deportation. Thursday, Obama’s attempt to expand that program to millions of immigrant parents and others was dealt a crushing setback.   A deadlocked Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling on a suit brought by 26 states that blocked the program, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA.
