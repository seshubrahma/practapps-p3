What distinguishes American conservatives from conservatives everywhere else is what, precisely, American conservatives wish to conserve: namely, liberty, as defined by freedom’s greatest idealists in the late 18th century. That liberty implies an openness to diversity, to debate, and to economic innovation   —   even though these are sometimes in tension with the traditional values that define us as individuals in the first place. American conservatism, at its best, is open to new ideas and new people.
