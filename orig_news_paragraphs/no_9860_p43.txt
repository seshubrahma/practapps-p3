â€”    Berlin Christmas Market Reopens, Three days after the attack, the Berlin Christmas market where 12 were killed will reopen today. The festive huts and street sellers will this time be accompanied by hundreds of tons of reinforced cast concrete barriers, unloaded at key points around the market by to harden it against unwanted vehicle incursions. As reported by Breitbart London, these   devices as commonly deployed outside government buildings in the West and military bases in places like Afghanistan and Iraq were deployed to many British Christmas markets weeks ago following intelligence of planned attacks.
