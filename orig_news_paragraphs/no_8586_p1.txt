I absolutely believe he should serve time behind bars," said James Flaiz, the Geauga County prosecutor. Prosecutors say Mahvi illegally collected $45, 000 in Medicaid benefits and about $8, 400 in food stamps, although Mahvi maintains his innocence. Investigators raided Mahviâ€™s home in September for evidence that he collected food stamps and received Medicaid benefits while having millions of dollars in his bank account. Mahvi, who claims that he has ties to Iranian royalty and owns 70 percent of a resort in St. Lucia, estimates his worth at about $120 million.
