In Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro  —   one of Mr. Trump’s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake   —   is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project. Several of Mr. Trump’s real estate ventures in India  —   where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America   —   are being built through companies with family ties to India’s most important political party.
