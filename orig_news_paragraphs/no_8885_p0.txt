The UKâ€™s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will prosecute web users who impersonate others or use fake online profiles to "harass" them under new guidelines for England and Wales published today. [The CPS advises prosecutors to act when "fake online profiles and websites" are created to "damage and humiliate victims. " The CPS also warns that information could be shared "in such a way that it appears as though the victims themselves made the statements," adding that this "may amount to an offence, such as grossly offensive communication or harassment. "
