Rubio, in fact, cancelled campaign events scheduled this week in Kentucky and Louisiana, to focus his efforts on his   home state Florida.   While other candidates are on the ballot, at least three of these races come down to a contest between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Kansas, Kentucky, and Lousiana are all closed elections, meaning voting is only open to individuals who are already registered with the Republican party. Maine is also limited to registered Republicans but, like the Iowa caucus, voters can register to vote with the party on caucus day.
