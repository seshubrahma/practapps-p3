Prime Minister Narendra Modi worked closely with Mr. Obama on climate change policies, but he did so against internal domestic pressures to prioritize economic development   —   including the provision of cheap   electricity to India’s rural poor. Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. Modi by telephone on Tuesday, but aides declined to say if they discussed climate change. Harsh V. Pant, a research fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi, said Mr. Trump’s order would give the Indian government political space to delay some of its climate commitments.
