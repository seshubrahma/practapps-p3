A new report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy research group, spotted the issue: In 2015, the Census Bureau changed what it defines as metro areas in the C. P. S. That changed the number of people who were considered to be living in rural areas. In 2014, the C. P. S. â€™s estimate of rural America was 50 million. After the boundary change in 2015, that number fell to 44 million.
