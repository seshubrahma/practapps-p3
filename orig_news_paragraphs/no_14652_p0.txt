Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump warned of "radical Islamic terrorism" in his address to Congress Tuesday night    despite pushback from his national security adviser. Newly minted national security adviser Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster urged Trump to leave the reference to "radical Islamic terrorism" out of the speech, according to a senior administration official. The two men had a discussion about it but Trump decided he would do it anyway.
