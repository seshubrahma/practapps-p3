From 2002 to 2004, the Howard government resettled refugees on Nauru in Australia, and this did not lead to a resumption of boat arrivals. The threat of offshore detention is an enormous disincentive. Furthermore, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has been very clear the US arrangement is a   deal. Anyone who subsequently arrives on Nauru or Manus will face the uncertainty of if and when they will be resettled.
