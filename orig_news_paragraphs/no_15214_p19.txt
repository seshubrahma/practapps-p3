Broader visionâ€™ Scientists and their supporters were urged to turn out in force in London as well as other marches in France, Ireland, Finland, Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands.   David Johnson, 35, a doctoral student in London, said he was marching because he felt climate change was being sidelined by the US administration and that science was being demonized. Another London marcher,    student Rachel Denley Bowers, said science was important and that budget cuts affected research.
