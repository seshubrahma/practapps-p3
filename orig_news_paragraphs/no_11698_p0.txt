President Barack Obama acknowledges that Democrats were seen by many Americans as "Latte sippin’" elites and need to get to work on the ground. ["I think the thing we have to spend the most time on, because it’s the thing we have the most control over, is how do we make sure that we are showing up in places where I think Democratic policies are needed, where they are helping, where they are making a difference," Obama said during a press conference on Friday.   He acknowledged that people in the areas of the country that voted for Trump, "feel as if they’re not being heard and where Democrats are characterized as coastal liberal latte sippin’ you know, politically correct out of touch folks.
