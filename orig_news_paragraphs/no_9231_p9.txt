Brown said the Quinnipiac University Poll finds Rubio in a very strong position. " The breadth of Senator Rubioâ€™s lead against Rep. Patrick Murphy, who has the backing of the Democratic leadership, is impressive. He has a   margin among independent voters and scores 10 points better among Republicans than Murphy does among Democrats," Brown said.
