LeBron, who has openly stated his goal is to chase Jordan’s "ghost," has   his own activist history by participating in the political activism that Jordan shunned. How much of LeBron’s political activism stems from what he believes, and how much is the result of his attempts to "right Jordan’s wrongs," no one knows. All we do know is that LeBron will somehow make minorities safe by wearing a giant safety pin. That should make everything better.
