Things were not always smooth: In 2003, ExxonMobil tried to acquire a stake in Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Yukos, the country’s largest private oil firm, just before the firm was nationalized and Khodorkovsky was arrested.   As Steve Coll writes in his book Private Empire, ExxonMobil during this time was helping broker stronger ties between the Bush administration and Vladimir Putin, since "the Bush administration had decided that American foreign policy would embrace and promote the direct ownership of Russian oil by U. S. corporations. " In 2011, the company entered a $  joint venture to drill on the Arctic shelf and Black Sea, and another   deal in Siberia.
