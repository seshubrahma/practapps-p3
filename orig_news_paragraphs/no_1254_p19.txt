Anxious for a victory, Mr. Priebus hastily convened a meeting with Mr. Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan and others in his corner office on Wednesday night and pressed for a quick vote on the health care repeal package, or some element of it, before the House left for its spring recess on Thursday. Mr. Ryan, who is close to Mr. Priebus, rejected the idea, explaining that the Republican leadership needed more time to secure votes to pass anything. Similarly, Mr. Bannon has told associates that he has been frustrated by recent setbacks and has resolved to dig in hard. He has been prodded by his longtime financial patron, Rebekah Mercer, the conservative philanthropist and political donor, according to White House insiders.
