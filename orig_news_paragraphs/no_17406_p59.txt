" About 4, 000 hectares of land have been purchased on the West Coast by a private buyer, though "not an official part of Oraniaâ€™s strategy," James Kemp, spokesman for the Orania Movement, told CNN. Neither Kemp nor Boshoff will confirm the intentions for this plot of land, nor reveal the buyer, but there is speculation that another Afrikaner community could be in the pipeline, with the hope they might one day be joined.   The latter told CNN that "if close   can be reached and a common interest in [a] bigger   region be cultivated, [a land] corridor can become part of the project."
