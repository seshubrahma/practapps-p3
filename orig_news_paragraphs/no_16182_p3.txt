And the super PAC this week will begin a   advertising campaign nationally and in swing states, significantly easing the disparity on television between   and   Clinton forces this summer.

One of the spots, "Outsourcing," hits Clinton for speeches she gave abroad while her family foundation accepted cash from foreign countries.
