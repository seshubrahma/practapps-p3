Trump’s crass tweets and objectionable comments may not be comfortable reading for   conservatives who appreciate decency and good manners, but they are helping to break the language codes that were primarily set up by the left, for the left.

If Republicans learn anything from the unbelievable failure of Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign, it should be that "presidential" and "nice" don’t go together.   Isn’t it strange that elections follow the same rules as dating?
