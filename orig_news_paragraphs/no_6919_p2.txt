As mentioned by NumbersUSA’s Jeremy Beck, the move by U. S. companies directly contradicts the open border lobby’s and tech industry ’s longtime claim that there are not enough   Americans to fill jobs in the country. According to Beck, the   visa "has become part of the domestic hiring problem," with big businesses and outsourcing firms often times using the foreign guest worker visa to fire American workers and have them train their foreign replacements, who end up costing the business less in compensation. Trump’s legal review will include tracking down abuses within the   visa program where more than 85, 000 Americans are either replaced or passed over for jobs by foreign nationals.
