I thought that if a person of color could be elected president of the United States, a boy born in Colombia could do anything in America.   Yet I feared that going to college in the United States would be impossible, because many colleges donâ€™t provide financial aid to undocumented students or refuse to even admit us. My family was too poor to pay my way. Fortunately, the scholarships I earned through hard work and good grades enabled me to come to Columbia University.
