The question:   Does the White House believe in a "Deep State" that is actively working to undermine the president? And here’s Spicer’s answer:   I think that there’s no question when you have eight years of one party in office, there are people who stay in government —  and continue to espouse the agenda of the previous administration.   So I don’t think it should come as any surprise there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration and may have believed in that agenda and want to continue to seek it.
