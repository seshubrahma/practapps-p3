Washington (CNN) Rep. Tom Price last year purchased shares in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics concerns for   Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary.   Price bought between $1, 001 to $15, 000 worth of shares last March in Zimmer Biomet, according to House records reviewed by CNN.   Less than a week after the transaction, the Georgia Republican congressman introduced the HIP Act, legislation that would have delayed until 2018 a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulation that industry analysts warned would significantly hurt Zimmer Biomet financially once fully implemented.
