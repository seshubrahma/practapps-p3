Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer, a Breitbart News editor and head of the Government Accountability Institute, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Fridayâ€™s Breitbart News Daily to discuss the election and what Marlow described as the defeat of "the most powerful family, relative to their corruption" in modern American history, the Clintons. [Schweizer pointed to a few key strategies that helped Donald Trump overcome the powerful political and media forces arrayed against him.   "Number one, he articulated an outsider message about Washington, D. C. but Number two, he really did make this a referendum on the Clintons, and also frankly on Washington, D. C. I mean, the Clintons are kind of the alphas of corruption, creating a political machine, running that machine with peak efficiency, dominating our politics, excluding ordinary Americans from how they operate," said Schweizer.
