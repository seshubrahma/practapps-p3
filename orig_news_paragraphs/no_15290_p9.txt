Meanwhile, in the face of the looming threat from North Korea, Japan begins to hold evacuation drills to prepare for any potential North Korean missile launched aimed at the country.   The North Koreans launched another missile just days after the engine test, but it exploded "within seconds of launch," according to US Pacific Command. As March wound down, Pyongyang once again went back to its engine tests    technology could possibly be used in an eventual ICBM.   In a separate move, the US announced that the US Marines deployed   aircraft to South Korea for the first time as part of an exercise.
