Those who are voting for and even "endorsing" Trump are supporting something so much larger than the very flawed "man," the red herring, we see before us. Maybe Trump himself doesn’t even realize that, but it’s the truth. What we are endorsing is a complete shift in the Republican party, a move toward secure borders, limited foreign entanglements, and a sensible trade policy that actually puts Americans first instead of sacrificing our middle class on the altar of globalism. THOSE are the real issues.
