We mentioned something called a   solution last week, when U. S. President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House.   The U. S. and Israel are allies and for decades, American leaders have promoted peace between Israelis and Palestinians, with one major part of that being a proposed   solution.    President Trump suggested he was open to a   or   solution, saying he likes the one that both parties like.   But the next day, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations said the Trump administration is absolutely committed to a   solution.
