" "I don’t think David Brock has been helpful to the party to date, and I don’t think he will be a big part of its future,"a former Clinton campaign official also told the news site, while another said that they "did not want to deal with Brock’s bullshit," describing his   campaign efforts as "useless," adding that "you might as well have thrown those [tens of] millions of dollars down a well, and then set the well on fire.
