’ "Research conducted by the University of California at Berkeley found that switching California teachers from pensions to a 401( k) plan would increase the burden on the taxpayer and hurt retention rates. The research concluded that the taxpayer’s burden would increase because teachers would receive less money from a 401( k) than a pension, causing the need for more public assistance. About 75% of California teachers have at least 20 years of service time and around 50% will work for at least 30 years. "
