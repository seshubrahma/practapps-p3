Mr. Guterres has not stated publicly whether he intends to push for a mandatory assessment in the budget negotiations now underway at the United Nations. Privately, however, diplomats and United Nations officials said he had shelved the idea, partly because of strong resistance by some powerful members, including the United States. Diplomats said part of the problem could be traced to simple donor fatigue, as well as to many countriesâ€™ reluctance to make financial commitments without certainty that the money will be used effectively. The donor challenge was acknowledged by Dr. David Nabarro, a United Nations special adviser who rose to prominence running its mobilization to fight the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and who has been leading its   efforts for Haiti as he seeks to become the next director general of the World Health Organization.
