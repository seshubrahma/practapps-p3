 (CNN) CNN’s Brian Stelter opened his show "Reliable Sources" Sunday with a critique of new White House press secretary Sean Spicer.   On Saturday, just one day after Donald Trump was inaugurated, Spicer attacked the gathered media in his first White House press briefing, telling them that they had misreported the number of people who had attended the inauguration.   Though aerial photos showed that Barack Obama’s first inauguration had attracted a bigger crowd, Spicer was furious, saying that the pictures had been "intentionally framed" to make Trump’s crowd look smaller.
