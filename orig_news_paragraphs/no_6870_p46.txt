Nationally, the inflow of illegal and legal foreign labor annually shifts $500 billion from Americans   over to investors and Wall Street. The illegal immigration costs taxpayers cities and states more than $100 billion per year, according to the Federation for American Immigration Reform.   Nationwide, roughly 10 percent of American "prime age" men, or 7 million men aged 25 to 54, have stayed out of the nation â€™s workforce of 160 million amid the glut of cheap immigrant labor.
