Cameron negotiated with European leaders this year to secure improved terms of membership in the bloc if Britain stays in the EU. European Commission President   Juncker warned Wednesday there will be no further renegotiation. " We have concluded the deal with the Prime Minister he got the maximum he could receive, and we gave the maximum we could give so there will be no kind of renegotiation," he said.
