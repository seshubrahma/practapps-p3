these crazy judges do not believe the president has this authority even though he just won a nearly   national political campaign explicitly promising the American people that he would do exactly as he has done. This is incontrovertible proof that these judges, and far too many other judges, simply do not believe that the American people have the right to govern themselves. Of course, these   judges have long been aided and abetted by Democratic politicians who grew weary after years of losing policy fights in the political arena. So they took their fights to the judicial branch and invented the notion that the Constitution is a "living document," meaning it doesnâ€™t actually mean what it says.
