Two senior White House officials suggested on Monday that President Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama had tapped his telephone was not meant to be taken literally, arguing that Mr. Trump had been referring more broadly to a variety of surveillance efforts during the 2016 campaign when he made the incendiary accusation. " He doesn’t really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally," said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. In fact, Mr. Spicer said, when Mr. Trump charged in a Twitter post last weekend that Mr. Obama "had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower," he was referring generally to surveillance activities during the 2016 race  —   not to an actual telephone wiretap.
