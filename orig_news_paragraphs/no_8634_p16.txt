The Egyptian government has also addressed the ideology by banning thousands of radical clerics from preaching in the mosques that are not licensed. Recently, the government of President   introduced a textbook for Egyptian public schools that requires Egyptian pupils to memorize the provisions of the 1979   peace treaty and delineate the "advantages of peace for Egypt and the Arab states". This is a major reform taken from the Egyptian government in normalizing and strengthening relations between Israel and Egypt. President Sisi should be considered a key ally of America as he is leading Egypt towards democracy and also is leading the fight against global jihad, both militarily and politically, in countering radical Islamic ideology.
