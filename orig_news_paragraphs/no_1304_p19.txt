In addition to the money he gave his daughters, Mr. Manafort also began acquiring a number of real estate assets during the years he worked in Ukraine, several of them costing millions of dollars and bought with cash. Among them is an apartment in Trump Tower in Manhattan, bought in 2006 for $3. 7 million, and a Brooklyn brownstone bought in 2012 for $3 million. Being able to cite his Trump Tower address came in handy when he pitched his services to Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign early in 2016. By then, Mr. Manafort had been out of American politics for many years, but he expressed a desire to get back in the game and offered to work free, suggesting that he did not need the money.
