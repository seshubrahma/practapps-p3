In 2013, the RJC led the fight against the nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel ( ) as Secretary of Defense, based on Hagel’s track record of   statements and his support for what critics called a posture of appeasement toward Iran. As Breitbart News noted Thursday, Mattis has come under criticism for remarks about Israel that he made during a speech at a conference in 2013. The Zionist Organization of America has opposed Mattis’s nomination the Jewish Institute for the National Security of America has supported it. On the left, the National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC) has criticized Mattis’s nomination (using it as an opportunity to take a gratuitous swipe at Breitbart News and Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, who is on leave from the company as he takes up a post in the Trump administration.)
