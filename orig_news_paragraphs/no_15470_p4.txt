One may reasonably argue that the warfighting capacities of Afghan security forces have improved considerably in recent years, and that these   servicemen, aided by US troops, will have more success tackling the Taliban this time around. And yet, to assume that more robust military force alone will put the Taliban on the defensive is to badly underestimate the groupâ€™s strength and to underappreciate the many different sources of that strength. The Taliban leadership has safe havens in neighboring Pakistan, and insurgencies never die so long as they enjoy   sanctuaries. The Taliban has also received periodic military support from Tehran.
