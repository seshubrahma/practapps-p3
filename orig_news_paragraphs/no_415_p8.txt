Even though a midwife eventually assisted in the birth, Sham’s mother "did not receive the health care she needed and I’m sure all the stress hurt," Mr. Aldaher recounted. When Sham was born, her father tried to calm his wife by pretending Sham was keeping one eye shut, even though he could see that she had no eyelid and a misshaped face. " Before the birth of Sham, my worries were how would I support my family, without any work in Jordan and without money," Mr. Aldaher said.
