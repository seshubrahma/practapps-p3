Democrats are banking on Republicans falling short —  that the party unity on display in Ryan’s election on Tuesday will quickly fade, that the slim GOP majority in the Senate will stumble and bicker, that an inexperienced and impatient president will grow frustrated with his party’s struggle in Congress. And most of all, Democrats are waiting for Republicans to overreach, to interpret a narrow presidential victory as an endorsement of conservative dogma and push forward with   changes to entitlements, the tax code, and consumer protections. That, they believe, would invite a public backlash —  much like the one that greeted Republicans on Tuesday after their   ethics maneuver. Republicans may have learned that the law of political gravity still applies to them.
