Almost as in response to Trump’s racially charged fantasies of black lawlessness, poverty, and violence, Attorney General Loretta Lynch reiterated the federal government’s need to "defend the constitutional rights of the citizens in this great country" by holding law enforcement accountable when they violate their sworn duties to serve and protect.
