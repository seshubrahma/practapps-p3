 (CNN) Donald Trump will live to fight another day    but it took the nastiest, most bitterly personal presidential debate in recent memory for the Republican nominee to stanch the downward plunge. Trumpâ€™s campaign was in free fall when he entered the debate hall Sunday night, reeling from the revelation of a 2005 video in which he spoke of women in lewd and sexually aggressive terms. The video sparked a dramatic rebuke of Trump, with dozens of Republicans in Washington and around the country saying the billionaire should step aside and let his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, lead the GOP ticket.
