This letter certifies that the conditions of Section 135( d)(6) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) as amended, including as amended by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (Public Law  ) enacted May 22, 2015, are met as of April 18, 2017. Notwithstanding, Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror through many platforms and methods. President Donald J. Trump has directed a National Security   interagency review of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that will evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States. When the interagency review is completed, the administration looks forward to working with Congress on this issue.
