The new batch of documents indicated that in one particular case, a senior State Department official, Patrick F. Kennedy, pressed the F. B. I. to agree that one of Mrs. Clinton’s emails on the 2012 Benghazi attack would be unclassified   —   and not classified as the bureau wanted. What remained unclear from the documents was whether it was Mr. Kennedy or an F. B. I. official who purportedly offered the "quid pro quo": marking the email unclassified in exchange for the State Department’s approving the posting of more F. B. I. agents to Iraq. Officials at both the F. B. I. and the State Department said Monday that no deal had been struck, or even offered, over the classification of Mrs. Clinton’s private emails.
