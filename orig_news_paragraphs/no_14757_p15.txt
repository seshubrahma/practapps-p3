Richard Painter, the chief ethics lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, said Trump should consider potential conflicts of interest in his policy toward the program. Painter has been a chief critic of potential conflicts of interest in the Trump administration.   " This is a program that’s been around for a long time, but we shouldn’t have a president making decisions about that program when he himself stands to benefit from the investments that these people are making because, once again, what this program is all about is telling people you’re going to get residency in the United States if you bring a lot of money along with you and invest it in American businesses," Painter told CNN.
