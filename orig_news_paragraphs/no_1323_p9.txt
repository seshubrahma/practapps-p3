Chinese exports of aluminum jumped more than 27 percent in the past two years, Chinese customs figures show. A spokesman for the   China Aluminum Association, who gave his family name as Zeng, said aluminum’s increasing use in   railway equipment, aerospace and electronics justified China’s expanding production capacity and rising exports. Smelters in Canada and elsewhere, having been displaced in their traditional international markets, have stepped up shipments of raw aluminum to the United States. American imports of raw aluminum from Canada, the biggest supplier, jumped 10 percent by tonnage last year, United States customs data shows.
