The resulting $529 billion trade deficit destroyed 4 million jobs that were not replaced by exports and that overwhelmed the gains from trade. On net, lost demand for U. S.  goods and services directly reduced GDP by $289 billion and another $170 if we count in lost spending by idled workers and shuttered businesses. The cumulative effects of persistent trade deficits are even more devastating. Americans have to borrow from foreigners or sell U. S. real estate, intellectual property and businesses to finance the trade gap.
