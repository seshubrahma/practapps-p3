House Speaker Paul Ryan said at a news conference that the House would act when Republicans feel they "have the votes" to pass their bill, though he gave no indication of a time frame. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wouldn’t directly confirm whether there was a Democratic strategy underway to block the   bill. She said her party was still pushing to resolve "outstanding areas of concern" in the   bill, but she insisted Democrats "don’t even have the power" to shut down the government. The uncertainty has spread renewed alarm on Capitol Hill after tensions had already eased earlier in the week.
