The drone itself, known as an unmanned underwater vehicle, was not a particularly important piece of equipment. Such drones are deployed to gather military oceanographic data and are available over the counter for about $150, 000, the Pentagon said. Data from the drone would no doubt be used to help track China’s growing submarine fleet, naval experts said. More important than the equipment was the principle of freedom of navigation in international waters, and whether China was in the process of imposing its own rules in the South China Sea  —   more than 800 miles away from its coastline, said Alexander Vuving, a specialist on Vietnam at the   Center for Security Studies in Hawaii.
