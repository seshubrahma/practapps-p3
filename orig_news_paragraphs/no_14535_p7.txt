Right now, the Pentagon is drawing up new and dusting off old recommendations for Syria at the Presidentâ€™s behest, recommendations that may include deploying conventional ground troops inside the country to join special operations forces already there.

John Nicholson testified before Congress last week that the Pentagon is likely to seek more US troops to advise Afghan forces in the battle against both an emboldened Taliban and the looming threat of ISIS.
