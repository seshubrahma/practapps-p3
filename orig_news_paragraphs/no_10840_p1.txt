Earlier this month, Clinton topped Trump in Michigan by roughly 11 points.   Independents accounted for 19 percent of the survey, while 42 percent of those polled identified as Democrats and 36 percent identified as Republicans. The Free    poll questioned 600 likely voters and has a plus or minus four point margin of error. A Fox 2   poll shows Clinton with a six point lead over the Republican nominee.
