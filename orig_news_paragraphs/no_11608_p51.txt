Abood also admitted that on April 14, 2015, FBI special agents advised him that lying to a federal agent is a crime. He further admitted that on that date, he falsely told FBI special agents that he had never pledged allegiance to   and that he was aware that the agents were investigating a matter that they suspected could involve international terrorism. What the Justice Department doesn’t say in this release, or a prior one, is how this Iraqi man got into the United States —  and obtained U. S. citizenship —  in the first place. For that, we turn to The Dallas Morning News, which details how Abood helped U. S. armed forces in Iraq as a translator during the Iraq war —  and then took advantage of a special program for such translators.
