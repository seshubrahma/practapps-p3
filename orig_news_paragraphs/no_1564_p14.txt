During his remarks, Mr. Trump drew interruptions from the demonstrators who silently held up miniature copies of the Constitution, some of them with the logo of the American Civil Liberties Union on the back. As they were escorted out, the protesters faced jeers from Mr. Trumpâ€™s supporters several said they had been jostled or had their pocket Constitutions snatched away. Julia Legler, one of more than a dozen demonstrators, said the group objected to "Islamophobic,   garbage" emanating from the Trump campaign. She said their inspiration was Mr. Khan.
