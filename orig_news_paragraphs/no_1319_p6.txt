The stationâ€™s dining concourse, on the lower level, with its popular food kiosks and ample seating, attracts diners as well as several dozen homeless people. At Penn Station, the busiest public transportation center in North America, serving more than 600, 000 passengers a day, some homeless people panhandle from Amtrak customers waiting for   trains to Washington and Boston. Others sell "loosies," individual cigarettes, to one another outside an entrance on Seventh Avenue. And others try to nap on benches alongside waiting passengers.
