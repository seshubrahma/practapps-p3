While WikiLeaks has not said how it obtained the emails, Guccifer 2. 0 claimed in a blog post last month to have sent them to WikiLeaks. Cybersecurity specialists have pointed to an array of forensic and technical evidence suggesting that Guccifer 2. 0 might not be a Romanian as claimed. That evidence included metadata hidden in the early documents indicating that they were edited on a computer with Russian language settings. American intelligence officials believe that Guccifer 2. 0 is a front for the G. R. U. Russiaâ€™s military intelligence service, according to federal officials briefed on the investigation.
