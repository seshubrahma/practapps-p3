 (CNN) The Republican and Democratic leaders of the House intelligence committee have voiced divergent goals for their investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, suggesting possible discord over how deeply Congress will examine any links between President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia. The committee announced Wednesday that it is investigating Russian cyberattacks in a parallel probe to the Senate intelligence committee investigation announced two weeks ago. The House committee said it has already received "important documents" and that staff members went to CIA headquarters on January 19 to review records.
