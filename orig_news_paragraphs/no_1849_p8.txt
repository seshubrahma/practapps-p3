Mrs. Clinton won by a record margin, amassing 87 percent of the vote to Mr. Trump’s 10 percent. Around the country, she won a majority of voters over all, harvesting the country’s growing and densely packed big cities and a plurality of the suburbs. But Mr. Trump won   white voters to the Republican ticket, reversing a partisan divide along class lines that is as old as the Democratic and Republican Parties  —   a replay of the "Brexit" vote in June, when the old bastions of England’s   voted decisively to leave the European Union. His breakthrough among white   voters in the North not only erased the Democratic advantage but reversed it, giving him a victory in the Electoral College while he lost the national popular vote.
