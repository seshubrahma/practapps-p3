In recognition of National Catholic Schools Week, I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation to all of the dedicated Catholic school administrators, teachers, priests, and support organizations who work tirelessly to build and sustain quality Catholic schools across the Nation. The theme of this year â€™s National Catholic Schools Week is "Catholic Schools: Communities of Faith, Knowledge, and Service. "
