Now, the ringside seat is the First Congressional District of Wisconsin, where House Speaker Paul Ryan uses phrases like "conservative principles" that don’t exactly inspire a country song. He’s being challenged in the August 9 primary by Wisconsin businessman Paul F. Nehlen III, known as the Wisconsin Trump. Nehlen originally supported Ryan until he became disenchanted with his globalist positions on immigration, borders and trade.   Trump, in a show of party unity, has, of course, endorsed Speaker Ryan.
