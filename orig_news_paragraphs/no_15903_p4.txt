A more pressing concern for Patton will be the multiple    questions raised by her appointment. A recent Forbes investigation revealed that more than $1 million in funds from the Eric Trump Foundation    overseen by Patton    actually ended up in the coffers of the   Trump Organization, which collected inflated fees from the foundation for hosting charitable events at Trump golf courses.    A spokesman for Eric Trump called the report "disgusting," adding "Contrary to recent reports, at no time did the Trump Organization profit in any way from the foundation or any of its activities."   NY State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is examining the question, meaning Patton will enter office under a cloud.
