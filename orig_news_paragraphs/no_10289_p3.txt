" Cruz "helped engineer a shutdown of the government and has alienated virtually the entire chamber, both of which he bills as accomplishments since he lacks real ones," The Times Editorial Board writes. The "greater worry" is that Cruz would actually "follow words with action" by making good on his promises to promote a flat tax and revamp the war against the Islamic State, the Editorial Board adds. Paragraph five of the endorsement focuses on the shortcomings of other Republican candidates, such as Jeb Bush and his failure to "ignite much support," Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and his "embracing of alarmist views," Dr. Ben Carson’s "inability to grasp the world," and Gov. Chris Christie’s pledge to "bar refugees" from Syria.
