My average duration in a job is more like six months, because I’ve done crisis and turnaround stuff for two decades. I’ve been in a lot of companies and    and institutions that were really on fire in a lot of ways, the Senate is the least urgent, least serious institution I’ve ever worked in. There’s this constant fighting. You should agree on what you’re arguing about before you argue: We are either going to work at our house tonight or we’re going to make dinner together and play music in the living room or we’re going to go out to eat and go to a movie.
