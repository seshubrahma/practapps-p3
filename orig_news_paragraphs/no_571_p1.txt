(Dave Wottle’s 1972 Olympic   victory might still be number one) including the Super Bowl two years ago. But, this is in the top three somewhere. The poise, the coaching, the team spirit and personal achievement that lets a comeback like this happen without really any one big sensational long td play (although Edelman’s catch  —   one of the greatest ever) or unfair call in their favor, cannot be touched in the    history of the SB. Without slighting any of the amazing players on their team, I couldn’t be prouder today to be a [Tom] Brady and [Bill] Belichick fan.
