I believe most of the people who voted for Trump are not racists, are not filled with hate. But there is no denying that Trump has supercharged the bigots. And despite growing signs that the racists,   homophobes, Islamophobes and misogynists are coming out in force, we have heard nothing from the man in whose name they are acting. Is it too much to expect that Trump repudiate them?
