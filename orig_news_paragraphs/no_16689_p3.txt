Poroshenko said he didn’t take the lack of a meeting with Trump as a snub, citing bipartisan support in for his country in Congress. Earlier Wednesday a Ukrainian official confirmed to CNN that Poroshenko’s office requested a meeting with both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton but only received a response from Clinton, who agreed to the meeting. A message left with Trump’s campaign Wednesday was not immediately returned. Trump did meet Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   during which the two discussed "the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt," according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.
