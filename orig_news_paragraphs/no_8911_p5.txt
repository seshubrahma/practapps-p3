The campaign to distort the public’s perception of Goldwater culminated in an infamous 1964 article in Fact Magazine, which surveyed members of the American Psychiatric Association, or APA, on Goldwater’s mental stability, though none of the psychiatrists had personally examined the presidential candidate. The New York Times reported on the Goldwater smear: The survey, highly unscientific even by the standards of the time, was sent to 12, 356 psychiatrists, of whom 2, 417 responded. The results were published as a special issue: "The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater. "
