It is customary, though not automatic, for the countryâ€™s 93 U. S. attorneys to leave their positions once a new president is in office. The Obama administration allowed political appointees of President George W. Bush to serve until their replacement had been nominated and confirmed. The federal prosecutors are nominated by the president, generally upon the recommendation of a   senator. One U. S. attorney appointed by Bush, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland, remained on the job for the entire Obama administration and is the current nominee for deputy attorney general.
