Also in the official Palestinian rag     Omar   asserted that "Trump suffers from megalomania and narcissism stemming from unbelievable arrogance. This dangerous tendency does not bode well for the U. S. and its people. " He added that the new president was "a reckless, arrogant and racist man for whom tact and respect for the other are foreign concepts. " "That the billionaire Trump has been elected U. S. president poses a tangible danger to [Americaâ€™s] status and role [in the world, and endangers] the capitalist West, since his positions and statements reveal that he means to divide the capitalist West and turn the world and its international institutions upside down,"   concluded.
