Donald Trump stood with us on ObamaTrade, while at the same time you put Constitutional principles on the shelf and bowed down to Wall Street and the donor class by advocating very strongly for ObamaTrade. You even said Sen. Jeff Sessions was wrong on ObamaTrade before you finally decided to oppose it near the end. Mr. Trump has also attracted independents as well as Democrats with his policy on the trade imbalance. You would find among Trump supporters people that cherish the U. S. Constitution and The Bill of Rights.
