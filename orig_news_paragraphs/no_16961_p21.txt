Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, faced heavy criticism from Senate Democrats at the time for blocking President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. While the sharp criticism on the Senate floor may have stung, Republicans in Iowa backed Grassley’s tough stance and his candidacy.   Iowans also are impressed by his reliability and durability, reflected in 7, 653 consecutive votes he has cast in the Senate dating back to 1993.
