Moscow was in the midst of a construction boom, which transformed the capital from a drab,   expanse into a sparkly modern city. Yuri M. Luzhkov, Moscowâ€™s mayor at the time, said in an interview that he had met with Mr. Trump and showed him plans for a massive underground shopping mall just outside the Kremlin gates. Mr. Trump suggested connecting it to the Metro, "a very important observation," Mr. Luzhkov said. Today, visitors to the Okhotny Ryad shopping center can go straight from the Metro to the Calvin Klein store without venturing into the cold.
