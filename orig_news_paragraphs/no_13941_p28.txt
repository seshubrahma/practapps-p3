One of Democrats’ top targets, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, emerged from his confirmation hearings largely unscathed, facing tough questions about his past and saying that as attorney general, he would eschew the more partisan posture he has taken as a policymaker.   On question after question from Democrats about   issues, Sessions emphasized that his job in the Department of Justice would be to enforce the law, not change it.   On the topic of prosecuting Hillary Clinton, a theme of Trump’s campaign that he backed off after the election, Sessions pledged to recuse himself, citing potentially inflammatory comments he made on the topic on the campaign trail.   Sessions defends self on race, pledges to uphold law, "I believe that would be best for the country because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute," Sessions said.
