The Miami Herald reports: Coffey is a prominent lawyer and former federal prosecutor who, as national political reporters discovered Tuesday afternoon, resigned from his U. S. attorney gig in 1996, a few months after being accused of biting a stripper on the arm. He had lost a big drug case (a federal jury surprisingly acquitted Willie Falcon and Sal Magluta of smuggling 75 tons of cocaine). One night, he headed to the Lipstik Adult Entertainment Club in Kendall to soften the blow. He ordered a $900 champagne bottle, paid $200 for a private dance and then allegedly bit the dancer.
