In a Friday interview with NBC Sports Network’s "Dan Patrick Show," Ohio governor and former Republican presidential candidate John Kasich said he is still undecided on who he will vote for, but it will not be for the GOP’s Donald Trump or the Democrat’s Hillary Clinton.   " I haven’t decided, but I am not voting for Trump or Clinton. Maybe I will write you in, Dan," Kasich told host Dan Patrick.
