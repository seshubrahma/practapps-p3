The town has a long history of Nonconformism, a form of Protestantism that dissents from the established Church of England, but   Lewes seems more attached to the trappings of sectarianism than its reality. In the book "Burn Holy Fire," Jeremy Goring recounts an episode in 1981 when Ian Paisley, a   Protestant lawmaker from Northern Ireland, came to Lewes on Bonfire Night "and tried to fan the flames of conflict by distributing   leaflets. " " His intervention backfired badly, for the following year he himself was burned in effigy," Mr. Goring wrote.
