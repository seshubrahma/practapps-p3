And who better to tend to that, in his own mind at least, than Nigel Farage, the        of the U. K. Independence Party. Mr. Farage, known for his noisy role in promoting Britain’s exit from the European Union, was the first foreign politician to meet with   Trump, three months after joining him on the campaign trail. On Monday, a photograph of the two men inside Trump Tower, all grins and thumbs up, dominated the front pages of newspapers in Britain. As some in Mr. Farage’s party suggested him as the next ambassador to the United States, Prime Minister Theresa May’s office on Monday was quick to slap him down, saying that there would be no "third person" in her relationship with Mr. Trump.
