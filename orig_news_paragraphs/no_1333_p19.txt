The suicide rate in the U. S. is at its highest level in nearly 30 years, with women and   Americans hit especially hard, federal data analysis found. The overall rate rose by 24 percent from 1999 to 2014, increasing to 13 deaths per 100, 000 people. " Itâ€™s really stunning to see such a large increase in suicide rates affecting virtually every age group," a health care adviser said.
