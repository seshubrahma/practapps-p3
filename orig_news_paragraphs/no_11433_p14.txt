At CNN, Trumpâ€™s character was under the microscope in a piece that highlighted "how Donald Trump sees himself" as it explored his writing, speeches and interviews over the past three decades. CNN writes: The GOP candidate has relentlessly mocked his opponents, lashed out at reporters and scorned the status quo. He has trusted his instincts, refused to apologize amid controversy, stood by his allies and sought to destroy his foes. He has focused on the big picture ("Make America Great Again") rather than on details such as abortion policy.
