Washington (CNN) FBI and Justice Department prosecutors are conducting an investigation into possible US ties to alleged corruption of the former   president of Ukraine, including the work of Paul Manafort’s firm, according to multiple US law enforcement officials.   The investigation is broad and is looking into whether US companies and the financial system were used to aid alleged corruption by the party of former president Viktor Yanukovych.   Manafort, who resigned as chairman of Donald Trump’s campaign Friday, has not been the focus of the probe, according to the law enforcement officials.
