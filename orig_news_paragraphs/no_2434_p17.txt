Even in Estonia, a country that has always counted itself as a particularly robust friend of the United States, domestic political quarrels recently led to the collapse   —   just a few hours after Mr. Trump’s election  —   of a solidly   government. This opened the way for negotiations over a new government with the Center Party, a   group popular with   voters. The Center Party had been kept at arm’s length because of its alleged links to Moscow, but has recently sought to recast itself as a mainstream force that supports NATO and recent decisions by the alliance to establish battalions of 800 to 1, 200 troops in each of the three Baltic states and in Poland.
