Update #2: Jonathan Swan at The Hill reports that aides to Ted Cruz pleaded with him to endorse his former rival, but the Texas senator refused: Just hours before Ted Cruz took the stage for his convention speech Wednesday night, senior members of Cruzâ€™s team were still pushing him to endorse Donald Trump. Cruz never wanted to endorse Trump and is still furious about the personal attacks the GOP presidential nominee made on his family during the primary campaign, sources familiar with the speech preparations told The Hill. But top aides had concluded he needed to formally endorse Trump at the Republican National Convention. For Cruz, it was always personal.
