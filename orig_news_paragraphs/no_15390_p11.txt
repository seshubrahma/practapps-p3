In March, former Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced he would be voting for Macron rather than his own party’s candidate, and after the results of the first round were announced, defeated Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon and Republicans Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe pledged their support and asked their voters to do the same. Crucially, Macron managed to attract a number of   voters of all ages. En Marche! which was only created in September, now has more than 200, 000 members and his meetings have attracted vast crowds. With his strong support base boosted by Republicans and Socialists, Macron was propelled into the Élysée Palace.
