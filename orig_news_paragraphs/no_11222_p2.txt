Only members of the Republican party can vote in the primary, but any voter can become a member of the Republican party on election day. Trump has generally done well in primaries that are open to Democrats and Independents, as well as Republicans. If a large wave of Democrats or Independents vote in the Republican primary, Trump could outperform his poll numbers and win the Buckeye State, but that is a very large hypothetical. The Democrat Presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is very close as well.
