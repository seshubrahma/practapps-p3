Activist groups have called on outgoing President Obama to free thousands of illegal aliens in the U. S. trying to claim asylum before   Donald Trump takes office. [There are some 4, 000 illegal aliens, many of them children, who flocked to the U. S. after leaving Central America, now waiting in detention facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania, said one activist group. Another   alien activist group said there are "a record" 41, 000 illegals in detention facilities.   The 2016 influx of illegal aliens from Central America exceeded 117, 000 by Oct. 1, hitting a new record, as Breitbart News reported earlier.
