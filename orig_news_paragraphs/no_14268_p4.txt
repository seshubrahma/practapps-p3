The civilian casualties were "caught up in aerial gunfire that was called in to assist US forces in contact against a determined enemy that included armed women firing from prepared fighting positions, and US special operations members receiving fire from all sides," US Central Command, which oversees military forces in the region, said in a statement Wednesday. " The raid resulted in the seizure of materials and information that is yielding valuable intelligence to help partner nations deter and prevent future terror attacks in Yemen and across the world," the statement continued.   The Pentagon said 14 al Qaeda fighters were killed in the battle.
