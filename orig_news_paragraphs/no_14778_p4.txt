The Crossroads groups are in the midst of a broader $3 million campaign supporting repeal efforts, and AAN on Thursday announced a $500, 000 television campaign set to air in a number of districts represented by the Houseâ€™s more conservative members, who are inclined to vote against a bill they see as insufficiently curative. The Chamber of Commerce, which organized much of the spending effort in 2009 to beat back the White House push, is also expected to spend heavily this time around. A Chamber spokesperson said Thursday that it has no plans to announce yet. Some of the biggest players in the advertising fight may not yet be known, however.
