Marlow assured him that the journalists and commentators who got the 2016 election wrong, every step of the way, clearly intended to go on being wrong for the foreseeable future. " I think probably the only people in the universe that covered and worked on both Brexit, in any level of detail, and this election last night were Raheem Kassam, Alex Marlow, and the one and only   Caroline Magyarits," said Bannon, prompting what Marlow described as "maniacal laughter" from Magyarits  . Bannon returned to a point he made during his   Breitbart News Daily appearance, on the first anniversary of the show, about how the smug mainstream media assumed Trump voters were xenophobic and ignorant of world affairs, when, in fact, they were fully up to speed on the Brexit drama.
