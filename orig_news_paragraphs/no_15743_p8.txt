Trump was also fiercely criticized by Brendon Cox, the husband of former British lawmaker Jo Cox, who was murdered by a   fanatic in November 2016. " You represent the worst of your country, @SadiqKhan represents some of the best of ours," Cox wrote on Twitter. In the US, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said on CNN’s "State of the Union" that he had also been troubled by Trump’s tweets.
