The rooms in Trump hotels are adorned with furniture and products   that have traveled farther than most guests. Sets of toiletries   in the bathroom were imported from Central America, shipped to   the US from the Trump Hotel in Panama City. Headboards, tall and   grand and often covered in velvet or leather, came from Jiashan,   China. Light fixtures were brought in from Kamenický Šenov, a   town in the Czech Republic.
