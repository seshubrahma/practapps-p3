The United States refused.   years ago, Iran and the United States agreed that a commission set up at The Hague would sort out that claim, among others. In recent years it became clear that the United States would lose the case and the only question was how the interest would be calculated. The $1. 7 billion the United States paid included accumulated interest on the original $400 million owed to Iran. Mr. Kirby pointed out that the United Statesâ€™ paying back only $1. 3 billion in interest rather than the billions more Iran had sought was one of the reasons the January deal was good for the United States.
