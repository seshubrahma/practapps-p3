And so that one has been haunting me.   The Langston Hughes poem, "Let America be America Again," which I think reclaims the language that has been taken from us with "make America great again"    which is in a certain way a very negative statement. It assumes something is direly wrong with America, and what Langston Hughesâ€™ poem is saying is that America was always America , just let it be, just open yourself to all the possibilities of America.
