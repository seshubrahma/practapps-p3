The GAO report does not conclude fencing has proved ineffective   â€”   rather , it states CBP has not implemented a way to measure the effectiveness of the current fence on slowing down illegal entries.   CBP officials say efforts to measure the effectiveness of fencing were stopped in 2013 due to "funding shortfalls," according to the report.
