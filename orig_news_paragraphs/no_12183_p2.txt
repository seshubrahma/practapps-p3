Ultimately, Braun  —   who hosted a   fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Hollywood last August   —   reportedly told Bieber that he would no longer represent him if he accepted the money. TMZ also reports that the promoter told Bieber that Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James would be at a similar   event in the city during the Republican convention, but when Bieber’s people contacted James’ people, they advised him not to do the performance. Bieber’s band also reportedly did not want to perform in Cleveland.
