The   Huffington Post stooped to innuendo, slurs, and outright fabrication to manufacture out of whole cloth a dark conspiracy by Donald Trump’s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon against Pope Francis. [Piggybacking on a baseless New York Times article by Jason Horowitz that imagined close ties between Bannon and "traditionalists in the Vatican," Huffington Post writer Michele Somerville goes still further, alleging that Bannon is aligning himself "with the   fringe of Roman Catholicism" in order to wage a war on Pope Francis.   In her breathtaking ignorance, Somerville bases her entire thesis on an outright error. She mistakes Steve Bannon’s 2014 reference to the "Church militant" —  a common Catholic expression referring to Christians on earth as opposed to those who have already died —  for a traditionalist website by the same name.
