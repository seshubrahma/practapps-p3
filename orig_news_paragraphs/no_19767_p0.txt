Updated on January 9 at 5:27 p. m. Jared Kushner is a man who has been in the right place —  or more precisely, the right families —  at the right time, and been willing and able to bend the rules to move forward. In the latest instance of that pattern,   Donald Trump will reportedly name Kushner a senior White House adviser, CNN and The New York Times report, placing his    in a top post but setting up a potential showdown over the reach of federal nepotism laws. That would end weeks of speculation that Kushner would receive a top job at the White House, and it would represent a continuation of his role on the Trump presidential campaign, where Kushner gradually grew in influence, ultimately becoming one of his   ’s closest aides.
