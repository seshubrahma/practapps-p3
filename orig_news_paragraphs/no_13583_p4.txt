Note to the Trump campaign: While it may seem studly that Hillary’s best performance versus Trump’s worst ends in a draw, on Nov. 9, no one wants to say: We almost won   —   and our guy didn’t prepare! The media’s excitement over Hillary successfully "baiting" Trump is revealing   —   of the media, of what this election is really about, and of what Trump needs to do now.
