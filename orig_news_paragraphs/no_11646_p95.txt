The American people see the state of our union much differently than our President, and perhaps that is why this Administration continues to be a disappointment. The unfortunate reality is that for too many Americans, our country and the world is in a worse situation today than we were 7 years ago. The good news is that the sun is setting on the Obama Administration, and the country has an opportunity to set a new course. While the influence of this Administration is already notably waning, I will continue to vigorously hold the Administration accountable and oppose unilateral executive actions that weaken our democratic institutions.
