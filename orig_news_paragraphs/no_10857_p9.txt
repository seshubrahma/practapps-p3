Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, is a deeply entrenched barnacle of the Washington establishment and federal bureaucracy. He has, last I checked, been in Congress for 573 years, first as a member of the House and now the Senate. His greatest (only) accomplishment was "reforming" the Veterans Affairs Department. Truly, its never been the same ever since.
