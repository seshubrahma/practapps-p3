This year, enough suburbanites leaned right toward their rural counterparts    especially in a handful of the most competitive swing states    to give the Republicans the presidency and continued control of Congress. That wasnâ€™t widely expected. Many suburbs are becoming more diverse demographically and politically, with a surge of new immigrants and other minorities turning these places from red to purple, if not blue    and doing so in local and state elections, as well as national. These places should not have been hospitable to Trump.
