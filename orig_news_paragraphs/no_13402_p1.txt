The renewed conflict between the pair could dismantle their longstanding coalition, Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.   The CSU leader stated that the comments made by Ms. Merkel at a regional conference earlier this week in MÃ¼nster "surprised" him, were "unnecessary" and were ultimately a "setback" in negotiations. Now that Merkel had brought the issue into the public limelight, Seehofer claimed that his party would hold to their position on having a cap on migrants. Seehofer has previously threatened to withdraw support from Ms. Merkel and refuse to form a coalition with her party after the federal elections next year should they not come to an agreement on migrant caps.
