CNN journalists followed this announcement by reporting that one proposal was to send combat forces to Syria. (Only small teams made up largely of Special Operations forces have operated there, providing training and assistance to   opposition groups on the ground.) Is there a disconnect?   How can the Pentagon say it is considering a "number of measures" when a news organization reports a proposal to send additional troops?
