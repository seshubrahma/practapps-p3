(Worse yet, poor Pence will face the challenge of worrying his putative boss will contradict every serious pronouncement on foreign policy unless it parrots his own sloganeering style.)   And there’s more trouble: Trump is consistent only in his inconsistency on national security issues. He has excoriated Clinton for her vote to approve the Iraq War, but has indicated he is untroubled by Pence’s identical vote (not to speak of his own previous support for that war). He has called for pulling out of NATO, but demanded NATO do more, including join his "unpredictable" fight against terrorism.
