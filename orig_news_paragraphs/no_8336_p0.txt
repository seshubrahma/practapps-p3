Sunday on CNNâ€™s "State of the Union," while commenting on a reports that said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump possibly reversed course on some of his immigration policy at a Saturday meeting with Hispanic leaders in New York, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said nothing was said that differs from what he said previously.
