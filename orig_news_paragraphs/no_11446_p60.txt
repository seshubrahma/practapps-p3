Todd says we may look back at tonight and say it was "beginning the end" of the primary battle.   Todd says a Cruz operative told him that they would be able to hold Trump under 1, 000 delegates before the convention but notes that Trump can possibly reach 1, 000 tonight. Todd says if these numbers hold, Trump has a "clear" and not a "narrow" path to the nomination.
