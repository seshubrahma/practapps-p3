Yet Flake’s longstanding support for expanding immigration levels is well documented. Most notably, in 2013, as a member of the   Gang of Eight, Flake worked with Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer to pass President Obama’s immigration agenda. The bill, which would have granted amnesty to the illegal population "on day one" of its enactment, would have also massively expanded immigration levels —  dispensing 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade. Similarly in January of 2015, Flake joined Rubio in   an extreme immigration expansion bill —  known as the   Act.
