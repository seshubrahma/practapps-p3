Let’s say a private real estate developer builds a rental property that costs $100 million, but he only puts down 10 percent or $10 million of his own money, and finances the remaining $90 million with a 5 percent loan from a bank or investors. Then, let’s suppose the annual rent payments minus expenses for maintenance generate $5 million a year before interest. Annual interest on the property would be $4. 5 million, leaving a net cash flow of $0. 5 million. For tax purposes, however, the developer can take depreciation deductions over a period ranging from 27 to 40 years, depending on the type of property, for the full $100 million value of the property, which will produce a tax write off of $2.
