almost everything in our economy is built off of some use of natural resources, and the risks they face are substantial," said Mindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with some of the worldâ€™s largest investors on climate change issues. But some companies, including Exxon, contend that the economics of climate change are unpredictable and that global growth will continue to create demand for resources, making it even more difficult to come up with hard numbers. Representative Posey is among those who say the federal government has no business forcing businesses to try. He accuses the financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, of pursuing a political agenda by pressing companies to quantify climate risks.
