The amount leaving the U. S. economy annually in remittances rises and falls with the health of the economy, but today it is about $54 billion, $25 billion of that going to Mexico. A 10 percent tax would raise $7 billion in three years, enough to pay for the wall on the southwest border and a couple of thousand additional Border Patrol agents. The billions of dollars in cash going to millions of individuals in a hundred foreign nations ought to be a concern for another reason as well. There is a strong likelihood that millions of those dollars are helping finance Islamist terror groups.
