James Pittman Jr. pastor of New Hope Community Church, an evangelical congregation of about 50 active members in Palatine, has become a regular, along with members of his church, at school board meetings and candidatesâ€™ forums where transgender policy is discussed. Pastor Pittman has become a particularly effective foil against the argument often made that the transgender rights movement is heir to the civil rights movement. " I am black my family members are black," he said in an interview in his church.
