People who feel there has been such a hardship can apply for an exemption, and employees in the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service can decide on their case.

Current law requires them to provide documentation supporting their claim that they have recently filed for bankruptcy, for example, or been evicted, and they must legally attest to their honesty.
