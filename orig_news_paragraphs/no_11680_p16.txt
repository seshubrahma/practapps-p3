This reporter worked with Fields at Breitbart News and also with Weinstein at The Daily Caller. I questioned Fields’ initial account of events when the Lewandowski story was developing, sensing that her account was too outlandish to possibly be supported by video evidence, and also perceiving Weinstein’s undue influence on the case. For this, I was "indefinitely suspended" from Breitbart, effective immediately, by full senior management at Breitbart News in a statement drafted by   publicist Kurt Bardella. I accepted my uncertain fate and waited for more information to come out that could decide the course of my career.
