Trump continues to use the media as a foil, now blaming them for pouring out "fake news" that covers up every one of his alleged accomplishments    from the crowd size at his inauguration, to the "real" outcome of the election, to his policy "success" in the First Hundred Days. Trump appointed Michael Flynn to be his National Security Advisor even though Flynn had regularly retweeted all sorts of conspiracy theories that came from crackpot broadcasters and social media contributors. Trump argued that the press has refused to cover terrorist attacks He hinted of horrors in Sweden that never happened. He has accused refugees of flooding onto the U. S. shores with the intention of conducting massive terrorist attacks against the country.
