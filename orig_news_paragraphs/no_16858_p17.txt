Hillary Clinton was hunkered down and preparing for Sunday’s debate with her top aides at the Doral Arrowwood, a Rye Brook, New York, hotel and spa, when The Washington Post published the bombshell video of Trump casually talking about sexual assault on Friday. The tape changed Clinton’s debate prep as the small group of advisers with her focused on how to prepare her on how she will respond. Based on those efforts, Clinton’s top aides decided Saturday that the Democratic nominee will not respond to Trump’s suggestive comments before tomorrow’s debate and instead address them "early" in the debate, possibly in her opening statement. Clinton’s senior advisers made the decision after watching dozens of Republicans rescind their endorsements and feel there is no rush to get something out Saturday.
