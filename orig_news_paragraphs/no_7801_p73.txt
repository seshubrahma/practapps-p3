March 4, 2016,  3:38: On CNN, Jamiel Shaw Sr. whose son was murdered by an illegal immigrant (not "undocumented" as host Brooke Baldwin said) talks about his support for Trump. Shaw, who is a black American, points out that his son was being recruited by schools like Stanford and Rutgers to play football and was a good student. He says his son was on the cusp of doing something really good when an illegal immigrant gang member shot his son in the head a day after he was released from jail.
