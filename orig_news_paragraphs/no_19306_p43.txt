I was struck by Hart’s cynical take on how Clinton             herself would have viewed a focus group like this,             where not one participant could admit to liking her but              where several said they would reluctantly vote for her.              Hart believed Clinton would have seen this as a             "success": She had achieved the goal of making her             opponent look worse than her to enough people in order             to win the election. Clinton’s the type of person who             can take a task that’s right in front of her, he said,
