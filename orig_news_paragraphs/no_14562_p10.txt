WATSON ( ):   As evidence, Karlsson points to a riot that erupted in the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby Monday night.    A police spokesman says officers fired at least two shots when dozens of rioters attacked police officers during the arrest of a crime suspect.   Ten cars were torched in the unrest and one police officer suffered a bruise to the arm from a thrown object.
