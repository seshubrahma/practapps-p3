["I will tell you that on the surface it makes sense that we would want to have adequate resources to fund our forward presence there," said Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis at a press briefing this week.   The Pentagon’s leaders have endorsed a plan to invest nearly $8 billion to bulk up the U. S. presence in the   region during the next five years by upgrading military infrastructure, conducting additional exercises, and deploying more forces and ships, according to the Wall Street Journal. The plan is seen by supporters as a way to signal U. S. commitment to the region, amid concerns over North Korea’s illicit nuclear weapons program.
