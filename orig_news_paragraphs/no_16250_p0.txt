Philadelphia (CNN) Michelle Obama cast the presidential race as one between a positive role model for children    in Hillary Clinton    and a damaging one    in Donald Trump    in the marquee speech on the Democratic National Conventionâ€™s opening night.   The first lady never mentioned Trump by name, but leveraging her popularity, she made a rare, if not unprecedented, foray into partisan politics to knock the Republican nominee.   Obama condemned "the hateful language that we hear from public figures on TV," saying that "our motto is, when they go low, we go high."
