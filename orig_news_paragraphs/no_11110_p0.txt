Ken Vogel reports on a gathering of major progressive donors and politicians to "lick wounds [and] retrench" after Donald Trump’s presidential victory which also left both houses of Congress under Republican control. [From Politico:  George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton are gathering in Washington for a   closed door meeting to retool the   left to fight back against Donald Trump. The conference, which kicked off Sunday night at Washington’s pricey Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club, and will include appearances by leaders of most leading unions and liberal groups, as well as darlings of the left such as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Congressional Progressive Caucus   Keith Ellison, according to an agenda and other documents obtained by POLITICO. The meeting is the first major gathering of the institutional left since Trump’s shocking victory over Hillary Clinton in last week’s presidential election, and, if the agenda is any indication, liberals plan   trench warfare against Trump from Day One.
