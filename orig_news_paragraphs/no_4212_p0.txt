During the 2017 NRA Annual Meetings in Atlanta, Daniel Defense president and CEO Marty Daniel affirmed his conviction that Second Amendment rights come from God, not from government. [This is the same position our Founding Fathers held the same position they all supported with their signatures when signing the Declaration of Independence, which says:  We hold these truths to be   that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. â€”   That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
