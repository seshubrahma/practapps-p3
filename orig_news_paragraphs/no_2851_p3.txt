Even as Facebook has outwardly defended itself as a nonpartisan information source  —   Mark. Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive, said at a conference on Thursday that Facebook affecting the election was "a pretty crazy idea"  —   many company executives and employees have been asking one another if, or how, they shaped the minds, opinions and votes of Americans. Some employees are worried about the spread of racist and     memes across the network, according to interviews with 10 current and former Facebook employees. Others are asking whether they contributed to a "filter bubble" among users who largely interact with people who share the same beliefs.
