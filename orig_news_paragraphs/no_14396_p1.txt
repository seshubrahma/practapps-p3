Garcia de Rayos, 35, emerged from her seemingly ordinary life after a yearly   Wednesday at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix.   It was her eighth visit since her 2008 arrest and conviction for using a fake Social Security number. After each meeting, she was released and returned to her family in Mesa.   This time, Garcia de Rayos was detained and deported to Mexico within 24 hours in what her attorney claims is a direct result of Trumpâ€™s crackdown.
