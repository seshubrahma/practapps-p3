Rubio was the establishment’s ambassador to conservatism, not its conservativm’s representative. I would also note that Ted Cruz is doing very well in the Republican primary without anyone having dark thoughts about his "heritage"  …     except for that business about his alleged Canadian heritage. That’s about legal technicalities, not serious concern that Cruz is the Manitoba version of the Manchurian Candidate. There is no invidious racism against Canadians in the United States, although Justin Bieber is working on our last nerve.
