After Trump reaffirmed his support for a Muslim immigration pause, debate moderator Maria Bartiromo put the question to all candidates: According to Pew Research, the U. S. admits more than 100, 000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our Homeland Security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?
