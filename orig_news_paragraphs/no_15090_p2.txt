The Pentagon sent the   USS Carl Vinson with an escort of a   cruiser and two destroyers after the latest missile test by North Korea last week. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the deployment was routine. Speaking to reporters in Moscow, he said there was "no particular objective" to its current course, adding that he "would not read too much" into its recent deployment to the waters near the Korean Peninsula.   At the same time, the deployment is a military show of force, signaling to North Korea that the US military can operate at sea in areas where the regime might engage in ballistic missile operations or other military provocations, according to US military officials.
