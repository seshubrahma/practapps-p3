Rep. Phil Roe ( ) talked about his vote in favor of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily. [Kassam observed that the Breitbart News Daily audience appeared to be leaning "about 60 percent against" the AHCA because they do not see it as a full repeal of Obamacare or a bold enough step toward getting government out of the health insurance industry.   " A yes vote was an obvious vote for me because the ACA is failing," said Roe, referring to Obamacare by its legislative name, the Affordable Care Act.
