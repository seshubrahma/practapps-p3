The power brokers’   game is clear stall Trump just short of the magic number of delegates needed to be nominated on the first ballot with the knowledge that many delegates bound on the first ballot by Trump primary and caucus victories would be unbound on a second ballot. Much in the way the RNC stacked the galleries with   partisans in at least two debates,   quislings are being planted in various delegations that will be free to betray Trump on subsequent ballots. Unlike 1980, when the GOP Establishment recognized that Reagan was both unstoppable and electable and decided to   him by saddling him with George Bush, this year the Insiders will stop at nothing to halt Trump’s coronation. The Wall   Hill combine is petrified by the prospect of a Trump presidency.
