In recent weeks, Mr. Trump retweeted several people who were bashing the CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny, and he has been critical of "Saturday Night Live" and the show’s Trump impersonator, Alec Baldwin. Whether Mr. Trump will continue to use Twitter as president is unclear, though few people inside or outside Mr. Trump’s orbit believe he will give up his digital connection to millions of followers. Two spokesmen for Mr. Trump did not respond to emails seeking comment on his Twitter message about Mr. Jones. If he continues to tweet, Mr. Trump may discover that his words carry new weight and are given new meaning when they come from the White House.
