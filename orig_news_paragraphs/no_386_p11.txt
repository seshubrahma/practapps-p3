The man said he had seen at least three buildings being struck before he fled. He did not want to be identified because he feared that speaking out would endanger his life. A Yemeni government official in Bayda Province said the targeted buildings belonged to the Dhahab family, which is known for its ties to Al Qaeda. Two male members of the family have been killed in drone strikes over the past two years.
