Now Spencer, a    white supremacist and founder of the     movement, is taking his rhetoric on the road   â€”   giving a speech on the Texas AM University campus Tuesday evening. To be clear, the university did not invite him. He was brought to campus by a man who attended AM briefly and as any private individual would be allowed to do, he rented space on campus in a meeting room.
