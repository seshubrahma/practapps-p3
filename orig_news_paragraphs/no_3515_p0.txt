The United States military is "not in a position" at the moment to "collaborate" with their Russian counterparts, U. S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. [During the press conference Thursday, a reporter asked the secretary, "What does Russia need to stop doing in order for the U. S. to work with it?"  President Donald Trump’s Pentagon chief responded: We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward where Russia, living up to its commitments, will return to a partnership of sorts here with NATO. But Russia is going to have to prove itself first and live up the commitments they have made in the   agreement. Secretary Mattis also noted that "there’s very little doubt" that Russia has "either interfered or they have attempted to interfere in a number of elections" in the United States and other democracies.
