Scenario #2: Cruz wins. While it may seem unlikely, given the current news cycle and the polls, Cruz could pull off a huge upset in California by mobilizing a committed core of activists throughout the state. In addition to holding the dozen or so districts in the Central Valley, he will need to maximize his ground game advantage in the   districts on the outskirts of Los Angeles and San Francisco. He will also need to poach districts from Trump in areas where the billionaire is currently leading in the polls, including Alameda County in the norther, and parts of Orange and San Diego counties in the south.
