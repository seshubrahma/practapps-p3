Part of the problem with this "implicit bias" theory is that it’s so unwilling to come to terms with the idea that everyone makes judgments. In fact, that’s the essence of being human   —   the ability to understand data, share experiences, calculate probability and respond rationally to best protect themselves and their loved ones.   Liberals are trying to clutter up that reality by inventing ever more esoteric justifications for giving themselves more power over everyone’s lives.
