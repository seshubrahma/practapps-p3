 (CNN) Democratic Sen. Chris Coons slammed President Donald Trump’s tweet Saturday about North Korea’s latest missile test, saying Twitter is no place to conduct diplomacy. Trump took to Twitter shortly after the ballistic missile blew up over land in North Korean territory. He decried the test, which the US military called a failure, while giving a nod to China, one of North Korea’s only allies and a nation seen by the Trump administration as a potential US ally in efforts to quash Pyongyang’s nuclear program.
