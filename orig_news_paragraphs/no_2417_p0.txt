BUFFALO   —   Immigration enforcement agents were supposed to be targeting the restaurant owner. But Antonio Ramos Salazar, a cook, was the one with guns pointed at his head. One morning last month the officers burst through the back door at La Divina, a   Mexican market and taco counter in suburban Buffalo, capping a   investigation into the labor practices of the restaurant’s owner, Sergio Mucino.
