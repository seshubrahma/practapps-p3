 (CNN) According to a report in the New York Daily News, Donald Trump has appointed the spectacularly unqualified Lynne Patton to run the Region II office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which covers New York and New Jersey    thus confirming the Trump administration’s haphazard treatment of the problems facing American cities. Patton, who has been an event planner and personal aide to members of the Trump family (she planned Eric Trump’s wedding) has no experience in housing or urban development.
