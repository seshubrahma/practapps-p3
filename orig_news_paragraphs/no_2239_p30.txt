Eli Fletcher, 56, a musician who strolls the market in a caped crusader costume and calls himself "Guitar Man" ("I save Cleveland one song at a time") can no longer afford to live in Ohio City, where he grew up, the son of a former coal miner who left West Virginia for Cleveland seeking factory work. " This whole gentrification thing forgets that this is a   city, and not some posh resort," Mr. Fletcher said. As both cities look toward their moment in the spotlight, John Grabowski, a historian at Case Western Reserve University here, cautions against too much nostalgia cities, after all, are living things.
