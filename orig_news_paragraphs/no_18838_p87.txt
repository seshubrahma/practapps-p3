In terms of rounding up those who do remain, you can give local police additional resources in terms of money and manpower. If theyâ€™re already overwhelmed, then they could use the new officers even after the immigration problem is finished or at least reduced. I do see the need to prevent the rise of an SS sort of force, so you could try using the military to assist, especially those trained as MPs, or various   contractors that would not be unionized and could be disbanded after the crisis and find new employment. But this would mostly be to process the illegals and send them back to Mexico or other Central American states, and less about checking individual American ID cards.
