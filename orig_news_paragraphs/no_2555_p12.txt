The F. B. I. and the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday also released samples of malware and other indicators of Russian cyberactivity, including network addresses of computers commonly used by the Russians to start attacks. But the evidence in a report, in which the administration referred to the Russian cyberactivity as Grizzly Steppe, fell short of anything that would directly tie senior officers of the G. R. U. or the F. S. B. the other intelligence service, to a plan to influence the election. A more detailed report on the intelligence, ordered by Mr. Obama, will be published in the next three weeks, though much of the information  —   especially evidence collected from "implants" in Russian computer systems, tapped conversations and spies   —   is expected to remain classified.
