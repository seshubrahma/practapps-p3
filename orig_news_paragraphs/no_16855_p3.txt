: As of Friday, the Paris Agreement    which calls for this   of net carbon pollution by the end of the century    had been ratified by 75 parties, including China, the United States and India, the top three polluters. Those 75 parties represent 58. 85% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Resources Institute. Both of those numbers are critical because the Paris Agreement "comes into force"    basically, becomes international law    30 days after at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of emissions have ratified it.
