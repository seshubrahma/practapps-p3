Trump raised $26 million via   fundraising, and $25 million from 22 fundraisers for his joint fundraising committee, the campaign said. The lion’s share of the online money will go to Trump’s official campaign, and a heavy majority of the joint committee cash will head to the RNC.   The campaign did not specify how much would go to each group, or how much was raised in June as opposed to the last week of May. The RNC spends its cash not purely on presidential politics    as Trump’s campaign would    but rather on helping the entire Republican ballot.
