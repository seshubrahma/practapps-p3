I followed the trial closely at the time and later visited personally with Ignacio Ramos after his incarceration in a federal prison in Ohio. Earlier while in a Mississippi federal facility, he had been beaten by five Hispanic inmates who recognized him from news accounts of the trial.   In July of 2007, both Senate and House committees investigated the matter.    Senators Diana Feinstein and John Cornyn asked Bush for a commutation to time served and release from prison.
