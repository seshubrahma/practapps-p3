Although the House members did not confront Mr. Trump about his policies, one did ask him how he could help the party maintain control of the Senate and the House, suggesting some concern about Republican losses in the House in the November elections. Representative John Mica, Republican of Florida, emerged from the meeting saying Mr. Trump had been greeted favorably by House Republicans, who gave him "two or three" standing ovations while he was present. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said the meeting was "great" during his weekly news conference and declined to discuss the controversy over Mr. Trumpâ€™s recent Twitter post of  a Star of David shape in an image suggesting that Mrs. Clinton is corrupt. There were also signs of skepticism.
