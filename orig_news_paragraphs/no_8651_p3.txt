Three delegates will be allocated in each of the state â€™s 27 Congressional Districts (for a total of 81) on the same 50 percent majority winner   basis. In any district in which Trump wins less than 50 percent, he would receive only two, rather than three, delegates if he wins with a plurality. The second place finisher would receive one delegate (provided he clears the 20 percent threshold).
