Homestay, another   site, has fewer options but bills itself as providing a host family, meaning that all stays will be with another person or family. $50 to $150 per night. The New York Moore hostel, in a    Williamsburg loft, offers   and   dorm rooms, as well as   private rooms with baths. Most visitors can expect to pay $40 to $60 per night, but pricing is annoyingly dynamic depending on demand (the highest rate Iâ€™ve seen was $104, lowest was $33).
