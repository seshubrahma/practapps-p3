What charges, if any, Mr. Vafadari and his wife face have not been disclosed. The couple have been described by friends, including foreign diplomats, as prominent in Iranâ€™s artistic and cultural communities. Mr. Shahini was sentenced in October to 18 years in prison on charges similar to those in the case of the Namazi father and son, and is believed to be on a hunger strike. Iran also is holding Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen and internet freedom advocate with permanent United States residency status.
