We have fought for this country. We have bled for this country. We have struggled for our nation that was entrusted to our leaders who have been quietly serving their own   of the ruling and intellectual elite, forgetting what this country was built upon and who it was built for. While we were protecting Americans and the values of this country we have come to realize that our greatest threat was here at home.
