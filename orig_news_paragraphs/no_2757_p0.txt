Vanessa Luna arrived in New York as a    from Peru, and grew up as an undocumented immigrant. While her parents worked at cleaning jobs, she hid her status in high school until a guidance counselor helped her get into the State University of New York at Binghamton to study American history. She was a junior there when, in 2012, President Obama gave Ms. Luna  —   and hundreds of thousands of other young people like her —   temporary permission to stay and work in the United States. She could become a teacher.
