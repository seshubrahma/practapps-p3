White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at the White House that President Donald Trump asked his national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn to resign in response to an "erosion" of trust between the two. ["The issue pure and simple came down to a matter of trust and the president concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security adviser, " Spicer said during the White House press conference on Tuesday. He also revealed that there was "a series of other questionable instances" that also contributed to the erosion of the presidentâ€™s trust.
