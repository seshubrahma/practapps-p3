Should the Chinese attack a Japanese aircraft within the ADIZ for not identifying itself to Beijing, the United States would be   to retaliate and engage in military action with China.

The Japanese, meanwhile, have exercised their sovereignty over the region, even sometimes to the benefit of China. In a rare gesture of diplomatic solidarity with China, the Japanese Coast Guard rescued Chinese sailors whose ship sank near the Senkaku Islands in August 2016, receiving statements of gratitude from the Chinese Communist Party leaders.
