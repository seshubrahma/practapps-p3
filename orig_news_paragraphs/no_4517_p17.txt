At my UC Berkeley show last week,   set college property on fire, smashed up bank windows and ATMs, jumped on peopleâ€™s cars, and looted downtown stores, including the   liberal Starbucks. They also assaulted dozens of my fans, who were falsely accused of being "Nazis. " The San Francisco Chronicle reports that   rioters caused around $600, 000 in damages that night, with the riot starting at the college before spreading to downtown Berkeley.
