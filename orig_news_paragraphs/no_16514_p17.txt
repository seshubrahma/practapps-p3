Florida is another battleground state where the Senate GOP candidate is outperforming Trump.   A poll earlier this month from Monmouth University showed Trump trailing Clinton in the Sunshine State by 9 points, but Rubio beating his presumed Democratic opponent Patrick Murphy by 5 points. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Trump and Senate incumbent Pat Toomey may end up riding on each other’s coattails    just in different parts of the state. GOP State Party Chairman Rob Gleason said he thinks the candidates "will help each other" and that it all comes down to "a tale of two Pennsylvanias"    his way of describing the disparate nature of the state’s electorate.
