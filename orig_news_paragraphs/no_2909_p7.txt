Dr. Bardack did not indicate what sort of pneumonia Mrs. Clinton had or elaborate on the nature of the examination last week, whether Mrs. Clinton had a fever today, or a host of other issues that could offer more precise insights about her condition. Late Sunday night, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign said she was canceling her plans to travel to California on Monday for what had been a planned   trip there. A video of Mrs. Clinton taken by an attendee at the ceremony captured what appeared to be her legs buckling as she struggled to steady herself and walk to her van. She required assistance from two Secret Service agents, who held her on either side, to move off a curb and into the van.   images revealed that her feet were dragging as she was hoisted into the vehicle.
