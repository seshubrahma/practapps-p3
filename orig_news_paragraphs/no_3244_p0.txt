Friday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," host Joe Scarborough criticized the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on President Donald Trump’s executive order halting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.   Scarborough said that although he thought the executive order was bad policy, the appeals court’s ruling was "laughable" and he said it will be overturned. " Our law professors always told us  —   bad facts made bad law," he said.
