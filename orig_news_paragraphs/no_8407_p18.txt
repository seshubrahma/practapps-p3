Several   texts from three former San Francisco police officers were discovered to include slurs against various groups of people. For example, the Los Angeles Times notes that minorities were referred to as "barbarians" and "cockroaches" Middle Easterners were referred to as "rag heads" and the term "beaners" was used to describe individuals of Hispanic descent. However, efforts made by police officers to start a constructive dialogue with members of the Black Lives Matter movement have also been futile in Northern California. Last month, the Oakland Police Department extended an invitation to followers of the Black Lives Matter movement to participate in a barbecue to start a constructive dialogue between the two groups.
