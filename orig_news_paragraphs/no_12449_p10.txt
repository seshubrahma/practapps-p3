Shakur and the group robbed several banks as a "revolutionary act" and eventually killed a New Jersey State Trooper with his own gun after a highway stop in 1973. After her conviction, Shakur escaped prison when other Black Liberation Army members visiting her pulled a gun and took guards hostage. Shakur lived on the lam for several years, as her associates refused to cooperate with authorities, until fleeing to Cuba in 1984. Shakur has also been lionized by ’60s radicals like the Weather Underground’s Kathy Boudin, who had named her son Chesa after Shakur’s real name, JoAnne Chesimard.
