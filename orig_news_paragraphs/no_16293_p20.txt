The night before, supporters of Clinton primary opponent Bernie Sanders, many of whom still havenâ€™t fully reconciled themselves to Clinton winning the nomination, interrupted former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta with cries of "no more war!" While Clinton might hope to draw in moderates and even some Republicans with her   rhetoric, she could also further turn off the progressive wing of the party that has long seen her as too close to the center. Still, whatever the risks to shoring up her support with the Democratic base, Clinton did not shy away from striking   appeals during her nomination acceptance speech. Clinton laid out her strategy for defeating ISIS, emphasized the US commitment to protecting European allies from a bullying Russia and called for standing up to China.
