The Post further reported on the court order: The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Pageâ€™s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials. The newspaper allowed that Page had not been accused of any crimes. It reported that the FISA court renewed the   warrant on Page more than once, according to the officials. The U. S. government has not responded to a Freedom of Information Act request from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) seeking information on why Page was surveilled.
