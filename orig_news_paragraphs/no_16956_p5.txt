Otis said Wednesday he plans to sell parts of Trumpâ€™s star and donate the proceeds "to the women who have been sexually assaulted by Mr. Trump."   " I know I can sell it. I think I can get over $1 million for this star, to be distributed to these women and many others that will be going forward," he said.
