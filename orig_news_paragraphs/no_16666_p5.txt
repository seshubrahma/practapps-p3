Ahmad Khan Rahami: What we know about the bombing suspect, Rahami’s family lives above First American Fried Chicken in Elizabeth, according to the city’s mayor, Chris Bollwage.   His family has a history of clashing with the community over the restaurant, which used to be open 24 hours a day. Additionally, in 2011 the Rahami family alleged discrimination and harassment in a lawsuit filed against the city and its police department, arguing that officials conspired against them by subjecting them to citations for allegedly violating a city ordinance on hours of operation. Trump added: "Who knows what the reason is."
