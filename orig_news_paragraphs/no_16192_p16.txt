Who is Christie? Christie himself was once seen as the partyâ€™s    presidential  . A former U. S. attorney under the George W. Bush administration, Christie became known for his brash style, taking on teachers unions in New Jersey and critics who dared to confront him in public    from town halls to boardwalks. Despite being heavily courted to run, Christie passed on a bid to challenge President Barack Obama in 2012 and instead served as a top surrogate for nominee Mitt Romney.
