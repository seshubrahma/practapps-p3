We can take this reality —  economic stagnation on the one hand, economic dependence on the other —  a step further: If the Democrats can find the votes they need from the plutocrats and the poor —  or   plus public employees —   then they can make a strategic choice: They can ignore the interests of   people in the private sector, and they can still win. So for this cynical reason, the Democrats’ decision to stiff the working stiffs who might have worked on the Dakota pipeline was an easy one. We can sum up the Democrats’ strategy more concisely: In socioeconomic terms, they will go above the working class, and also below the working class.
