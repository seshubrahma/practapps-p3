Less than a year after Mr. Brown’s death in Ferguson, on June 17, 2015, nine   parishioners, including a pastor, were gunned down by a    white supremacist during a church meeting in Charleston. Two days later, the victims’ families addressed Mr. Roof, the gunman, at a court hearing, where one by one they forgave him. " You took something very precious away from me," Nadine Collier, the daughter of    Ethel Lance, told Mr. Roof, as her voice rose in anguish.
