you offer these   an olive branch and they bite off your hand. The next thing I knew, the Cruz cult was accusing Trumpâ€™s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski of criminal battery for brushing past a female reporter. Anyone who claims this video shows a "battery" is as big a liar as the liberals who lined up to say Clinton did not commit perjury when he denied having "sexual relations" with Monica Lewinsky. If James Carville and Paul Begala had a baby, it would be a Cruz supporter.
