The department issued a short response after an arts group called Indecline hoisted a   naked Trump statue in Union Square park Thursday. " NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small," said Sam Biederman, a parks spokesman. Indecline, described by The Guardian as an anarchist group, installed nude Trump statues in other cities around the country, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland and Seattle, the paper reported.
