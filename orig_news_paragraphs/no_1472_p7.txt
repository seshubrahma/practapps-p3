The government has blamed Islamic State militants for the attack on Tuesday. If the group is responsible, it would be the first time any   members have attacked a major Western target   —   and would indicate that Turkey is no longer protected from the group’s violence. One of the victims killed was in Turkey to find and save his son from ISIS.
