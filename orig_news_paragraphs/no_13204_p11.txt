Hillary Clinton was the driving edge for the invasion while Robert Gates and others were skeptical. Look four years later, four years of Clintonâ€™s foreign policy, what do you have. Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapon, Libya in chaos and disarray, controlled by ISIS. Syria, a failed state, now you see the rise of ISIS and 200, 000 dead and 4 million refugees, Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapon, more belligerent and hostile North Korea, you see chaos, death, destruction everywhere you look.
