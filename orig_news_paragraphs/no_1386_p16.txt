Fascist comparisons are not new in American politics. A Google search of "Barack Obama and Nazi" or "George W. Bush and Nazi" produces many images of the last two presidents as   fascists. But with Mr. Trump, such comparisons have gone beyond the fringe and entered mainstream conversation both in the United States and abroad. President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico criticized Mr. Trump’s plans to build a wall on the border and to bar Muslims from entering the United States.
