Stone, who is being investigated by the FBI as part of its investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians, spoke to Trump after Comey testified at a hearing on Capitol Hill earlier this month, the source said. Trump pushed back against these reports, denouncing them as "fake news" and tweeting that he had "not spoken to Roger in a long time."   A White House spokesperson reiterated the Presidentâ€™s assertion that he has not spoken to Stone in a while, adding, "The President has not spoken to Roger Stone in many months and any reports suggesting otherwise are categorically untrue.
