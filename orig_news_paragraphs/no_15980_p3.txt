The setup shows how unusual Trump’s campaign is    presidential candidates generally don’t own buildings or resorts in multiple states or companies that could be used as contractors. He’s paid $420, 000 to    the private Florida club where Trump has led many an Election Night celebration, and $4. 6 million to TAG Air, so he can use his private jets. Even about $5, 000 to Eric Trump Winery Manufacturing LLC, the Virginia producer owned by his son. That spending has created fodder for Hillary Clinton.
