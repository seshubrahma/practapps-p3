Should either Cruz or Trump be the nominee, expect Black Lives Matter’s army to take to the streets and try to shut them down at every opportunity. For that reason, the current political season is set to be even more divisive than either of the last two election cycles, which had already set a very high bar for vitriol.

The one thing the left has not counted on, however, is a dogged, active conservative media culture that can bring real information straight to the American people without being filtered by Black Lives Matter’s journalism school comrades.
