Gen. Votel noted that the U. S. had assigned a general officer to dig up the facts of the incident and help the American military address the situation, adding: While we consider and establish accountability over our actions in this incident, I think is also important to clearly recognize that the enemy does use human shields, has little regard for human life and does attempt to use civilian casualty allegations as a tool to hinder our operations. And so they bear responsibility for this as well. Nevertheless, Amnestyâ€™s report suggests that a loosening of American military combat rules under President Donald Trump are to blame for the high number of civilian casualties in Mosul. "
