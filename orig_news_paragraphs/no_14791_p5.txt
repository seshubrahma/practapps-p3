Trumpâ€™s first two weekends in the White House were free of visits to his properties. But since February 4, Trump has visited one of his properties for six straight. On February 4 and 5, while in Florida, Trump golfed at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The next weekend, on February 11 and 12, Trump brought Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to his estate in Florida and golfed at both the Trump International Golf Club and the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida.
