That voters under age 30 tend to lean Democratic isn’t a shock    the group hasn’t backed a Republican for president since 1988, according to network exit polls    but their turnout and strength of support for the Democrat can sway the outcome. Neither poll suggests Clinton holds the backing of a majority of younger voters. The Harvard IOP poll finds Clinton topping Trump by a 45%  % margin among those most likely to vote in the fall, with 13% behind Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and another 19% unsure who they’d support.
