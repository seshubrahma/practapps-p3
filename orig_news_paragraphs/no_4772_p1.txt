Nunes briefed President Donald Trump at the White House this afternoon, speaking to reporters immediately after the meeting. He confirmed that the new intelligence had nothing to do with the FBI investigation into Russia, but that it was picked up in normal intelligence efforts. " What I’ve read bothers me, and I think it should bother the president himself and his team, because I think some of it seems to be inappropriate," he said.
