It was around this time that I got phone calls from a mysterious,   adenoidal sounding character who said his name was Joe Cinque, a   very close friend of Donald, or so he said. Cinque was then, as   he is now, a controversial figure in Trumpland. A 1995 New York   profile described him as "a small time mobster, a scam artist,   and an art fence" who was known to the authorities as Joey No   Socks. ’ ’    The magazine reported that Cinque had survived an attempt on his   life, was a former pal of mobster John Gotti.
