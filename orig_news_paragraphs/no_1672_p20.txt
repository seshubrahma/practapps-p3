Internally, the Clinton campaign believed the backlash against NBC could ultimately be beneficial, if the moderators of the coming debates are on eggshells about ensuring equal treatment and holding Mr. Trump to account. Mrs. Clinton, for her part, was already in a motorcade to her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. when Mr. Trump appeared with Mr. Lauer. While the Democratic nominee did not consider Mr. Lauer’s questions out of bounds, she did relish the subsequent coverage of the event that suggested Mr. Trump had gotten off easy, said a person familiar with her thinking. On Friday, the chairman of NBC News, Andrew Lack, sent an upbeat memo to his staff that declared the forum a success, noting that the event had generated days of headlines about Mr. Trump’s praise of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and criticism of the American military leadership.
