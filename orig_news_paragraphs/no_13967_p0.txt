 (CNN) Tom Price made his name in Washington as a critic of Obamacare    in fact, he has a plan to dismantle it. But he may not want to talk about that much when he testifies before Congress this week as   Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. Price, a Georgia congressman and orthopedic surgeon, does not want the sole focus of his appearance before the Senate Health Committee on Wednesday to be his own proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare, according to a Trump transition official.
