The US intelligence community said Russia attempted to influence the 2016 election to hurt Hillary Clinton and boost Trumpâ€™s candidacy. Former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired last week, said in March that the bureau was investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump and those associated with his campaign have denied any collusion. Pelosi also warned her fellow Democrats against promoting hearsay on this matter, and said Democrats discussing impeachment were doing so without any case to make.
