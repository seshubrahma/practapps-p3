" Gabriel Schwartz, a lawyer and Trump supporter who helped organize the   protest at the Colorado State Capitol after the caucus fiasco, told Breitbart News that the delegation should be unseated if it will not back the party’s presumptive nominee. " My take on it is pretty simple, the people across America have spoken, and they want Donald J. Trump, not Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or anyone else, and if you didn’t have a rigged system you’d have seen a Trump delegation from Colorado," Schwartz said, noting that he received an email about the   plan but has not been actively involved in it.
