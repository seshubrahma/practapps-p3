Like Jeb Bush, Skandera is a proponent of the Common Core standards. She is head of the governing board of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) one of the two federally funded test consortia that developed assessments aligned with Common Core. President Donald Trump campaigned on getting rid of the Common Core standards, and a   network of grassroots citizens across the country are vehemently opposed to the federalized program that was introduced in President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2009 stimulus bill.
