Science entertainment television program "MythBusters" investigated Hollywood heist scenes and tested whether it was possible to scale an air duct using suction cups in episode 54, which aired in July 2006. Presenter Jamie Hyneman found suction cups were able to hold his weight but the noise of his contraption, which included a vacuum, was too noisy and blew his cover. The man appeared to be relying on a series of NV11 Fairs Air Powered Suction Cups, which retail at $280. 22 each.
