David E. Kirkland, an education professor at New York University who has studied Ms. DeVosâ€™s impact in Michigan, said he feared she could badly hurt public education and pull resources out of schools in need of federal funding. " Her extensive conflicts of interest and record of diverting money away from vulnerable students and into the pockets of the rich make DeVos completely unfit for the position she was just confirmed to," he said. Ms. DeVos has focused on expanding parental choice in education and on embracing charter schools and vouchers.
