Without verifying the authenticity of the emails, Mr. Podesta said that he had spoken with the F. B. I. "as a victim" of hacking. The Obama administration, like Mr. Podesta, believes the Russian government has been trying to help Mr. Trump with its hacking, including the theft of emails of the Democratic National Committee this year. Mr. Podesta said Mr. Trump had "essentially adopted lock, stock and barrel" a foreign policy that would favor the interests of President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Podesta also cast blame on Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks and an avowed critic of Mrs. Clinton.
