Originally, under the section of the questionnaire specifically calling for all nominations and public offices held, including any "unsuccessful nominations for appointed office," Sessions detailed his record as a federal prosecutor and senator of Alabama, but failed to list his failed bid for a federal judgeship in 1986. He supplemented his initial response on Wednesday to include the "withdrawn" judgeship. Sessions was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to be a judge on the US District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, but the appointment was scuttled after an   former colleague testified Sessions had called him "boy" and expressed past sympathies for the Ku Klux Klan    allegations that Sessions vigorously disputed. Sessionsâ€™ new supplemental responses have done little to satisfy the civil rights community.
