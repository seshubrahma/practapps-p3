American officials have attributed the rising number of strikes and the danger to civilians to the urban battlefields in Mosul and Raqqa and the high concentration of civilians in areas held by the jihadists. They say they try to avoid civilian casualties while the Islamic State deliberately kills anybody who stands in its way. This month, American officials also said they would send an additional 400 troops to Syria to help prepare for the assault on Raqqa, the Islamic Stateâ€™s   capital, nearly doubling the total there.
