The Des Moines Register poll, released two days before the caucuses, gave Trump a 5 point, 28 percent to 23 percent lead over Cruz in Iowa, but that poll dramatically   evangelicals, which it showed supported Cruz over Trump by a 14 point margin, 33 percent to 19 percent. That poll, however, did add this caveat: If evangelicals turn out with the same force as in 2012, the race will be closer. This poll shows 47 percent of likely Republican caucusgoers identify themselves as evangelical or   Christians. Entrance polling four years ago measured 57 percent.
