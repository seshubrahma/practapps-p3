As the crisis deepened in the region, Bahrain’s foreign ministry said it was suspending diplomatic relations "in order to preserve its national security," according to a statement. Qatari diplomats had 48 hours to leave and airspace and ports between the countries would be closed within 24 hours of Bahrain’s announcement, it said. Bahrain said its decision was based on what it said was Qatar’s destabilizing actions.   In further developments Monday, Egypt said Qatar had taken an "  course" and that Cairo had been unable to dissuade it from supporting terrorism.
