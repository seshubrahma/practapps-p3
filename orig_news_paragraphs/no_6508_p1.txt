Judge Gorsuchâ€™s nomination process was among the most contentious in American history. After assembling the pledges of 41 Senate Democrats to iniate the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) sought to prevent a vote of the full Senate. This set up a showdown over Senate cloture rules that resulted Thursday in Republicans invoking the "constitutional option" and abolishing the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. The partisan animosity of the nomination continued into the vote.
