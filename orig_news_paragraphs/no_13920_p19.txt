The report did not address the issue of possible contacts between the Russian government and any American politicos. Itâ€™s critical to have as complete an intelligence record on Russian disinformation at the Obama Presidential Library as possible and as full a collection of key   raw material as possible on relevant covert Russian contacts with Americans during the campaign, if any existed, should also be preserved for the Obama Library. None of these highly classified materials is likely to be released to individual private researchers for some time, but as part of the Obama presidential collection, they would be protected forever by statute and by impartial federal archivists. Not only that, but should a Congressional committee begin an inquiry into Russian influence in the 2016 election, they would be more readily accessible than if Congressional investigators had to request documents agency by agency.
