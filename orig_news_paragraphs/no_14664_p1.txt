Daniela Vargas, 22, was arrested Wednesday after sharing her family’s story    including her father and brother’s arrest last month by ICE officers     during a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi.   Moments before her arrest by ICE, Vargas had advocated for young people who, like herself, were brought to the US illegally as children, then qualified for a temporary reprieve from deportation under the   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA.
