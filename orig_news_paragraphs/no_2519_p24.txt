Forecasters warned of high winds, surging waterways and the potential for flooding in places throughout the state into Friday. On Thursday, heavy rain was poised to soak the northern half, especially along the coasts and in the Sierra Nevada, where up to five inches of rain could fall, said Brooke Bingaman, a forecaster with the National Weather Service’s Sacramento office. From there, it was expected to spread to Southern California, where officials circulated warnings about the possibility of flash floods and mudflows on slopes stripped bare by wildfires. At the same time, the anticipated rain was seen as more welcome news for the state’s lakes and reservoirs, depleted by five years of drought.
