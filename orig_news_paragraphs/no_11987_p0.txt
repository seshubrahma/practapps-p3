On Wednesday, Senate Democrats successfully and predictably blocked what many conservatives described as Paul Ryan’s "Show Vote’"on refugee admissions. [It has been called a show vote because the Ryan plan, even if the President signed it, would still allow the President to bring in an unlimited number of refugees from an unlimited number of countries.

Ryan’s decision to   Obama’s immigration agenda arguably ceded any leverage he may otherwise have had over Democrats and ensured the   migration into America would continue and grow.
