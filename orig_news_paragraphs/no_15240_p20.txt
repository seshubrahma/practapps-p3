As with Trump’s travel ban, the judge looked at Trump’s own rhetoric and statements of his surrogates    saying those contradicted the "new, narrow interpretation" that government lawyers presented in court.   The judge used specific statements by the President and his administration against the government’s lawyers, saying they left no doubt about the intent of the executive order.   " If there was doubt about the scope of the order, the President and Attorney General have erased it with their public comments," Orrick said.
