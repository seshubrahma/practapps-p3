Besides the   kill switch, Wired zings the gang for careless handling of their bitcoin payments, poor communications with copies of their virus in the field, and a ridiculously low profit margin for unleashing a global pandemic that turned them into some of the most wanted criminals on Earth.   Apparently, the gang is manually tracking who pays the ransom and issuing decryption keys, rather than configuring the virus to automatically know if they paid the money. That is a lot of work to collect a measly $300 payment, and theyâ€™re leaving Bitcoin footprints for investigators to follow. Far more subtle, less risky ransom capers have brought in   paydays.
