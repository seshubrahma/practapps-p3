(A family Passover photo from the White House posted by Trump on Monday appears to have been taken during the inaugural weekend.) The Four Seasons Resort is hosting "Pesach on the Mountain," a   kosher ski vacation, billed as "an exclusive Pesach vacation that offers supreme accommodations" on its website. The 2017 accommodations were sold out. Passover tourism is common, as the holiday requires the observant to remove all leavened products from their homes, use separate dishes that only come out once a year, and deep clean their cooking equipment.
