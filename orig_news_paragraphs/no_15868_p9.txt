A true claim of a Comey "conflict of interest" would require proof  that Mueller and Comey had a longstanding personal friendship that would clearly impede the impartiality of the special counsel. The public record  generated to date does not reveal a relationship of this nature between the two men.

There is no question that as long as Mueller is investigating the possibility of  the Trump campaignâ€™s collusion with the Russians and obstruction of justice in the firing of James Comey, a black cloud of adverse publicity will hover over the Trump administration.
