The dead include Sultan al Dhahab and   ’ uf   two longstanding AQAP operational planners and weapons experts. An official at Central Command, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East, described the clips as excerpts from "al Qaeda terrorist training videos," saying the release offers "a first look" at what the military recovered. The information was seized from a staging area, propaganda center and logistics hub for AQAP’s terrorist network this past weekend.
