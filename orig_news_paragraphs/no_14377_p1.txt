So far, the GoFundMe effort for the new campaign has raised $186, 767 of the $500, 000 goal, according to the groupâ€™s GoFundMe page. The funds will go toward supplies for the North Dakota protest camp, transportation of veterans to and from Standing Rock Indian Reservation and operations. The Facebook page sites increased "turmoil and uncertainty"  as a motivation to continue efforts.   After raising $1, 155, 780 on GoFundMe in December to provide transportation and supplies for the thousands of veterans who volunteered to travel to Standing Rock and support protesters, some veterans formed Veterans Stand, with the mission to "unite citizens and all peoples through our shared military service, to fulfill the promise to defend America from enemies, foreign and domestic, by combating the oppression of our fellow human beings and working to create a better future through continued sacrifice and service.
