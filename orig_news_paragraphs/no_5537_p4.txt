Reuters learned from the Badr militia, linked to the U. S.  PMU, that its advance to the Syrian border would benefit the Assad forces. " The Americans will not be allowed to control the border," Badr leader Hadi   told   TV. Iran has deployed tens of thousands of Shiite troops to fight on behalf of Assad in Syria, including members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) terrorists from Hezbollah, as well as fighters from neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan.
