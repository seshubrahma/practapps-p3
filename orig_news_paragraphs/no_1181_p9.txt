The F. B. I. director and the former director of national intelligence have said the phone tapping charge is not true, and congressional leaders of both parties have said they have seen no evidence of it. In an interview broadcast on BBC on Monday evening, John O. Brennan, the C. I. A. director under Mr. Obama, chided Mr. Trump for making an unsubstantiated allegation against the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, has "a solemn obligation" to provide information "that is accurate, that is measured and that is not just a spontaneous or impulsive number of words. "
