Friends and advisers to the former House speaker, who resigned from Congress in 1999 and ran for president in 2012, say he has taken a keen interest in Trump’s 2016 candidacy in no small part because he personally identifies with the businessman and his insurgent campaign.   Former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber, one of Gingrich’s closest allies during their overlapping years on Capitol Hill, said his friend looks back over his career and views himself as a "disruptor. " Gingrich, Weber said, believes there are close similarities between the arc of his career in the House of Representatives and Trump’s 2016 White House bid.
