Michigan state records show a "certificate of correction" was filed Tuesday    the day after the issue surfaced in DeVos’ confirmation hearing    for the charity’s 2006 and 2015 annual reports requesting the corporate records by amended to remove DeVos’ name from the list of directors. DeVos is a woman who stands between two wealthy and powerful conservative families who have given considerable money to conservative organizations, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates. Multiple Democratic senators pushed DeVos Tuesday for her connection to Focus on the Family, a conservative   that, among other things, has pushed the benefits of conversion therapy for LGBT men and women.
