The State Department had initially said that none of the information on Clinton’s server was classified at the time it was sent or received, but some of it was given restricted classifications afterward. But Comey’s investigation found that a small number of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent or received. Of the 30, 490 emails Clinton gave investigators, Comey said, three emails were in this category. Clinton has also maintained that she had permission to use personal email.
