At least four medical malpractice lawsuits have been filed against Dr. Harold Bornstein in the state of New York dating back to 1986. In a 1999 lawsuit, New York resident Kenneth Levin accused Bornstein of negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat his wife by "overmedicating" her with prescription drugs and not following proper medical procedures, which Levin argued led to her death. The case argues Bornstein "prescribed unnecessary barbiturates and other drugs to the decedent with full knowledge that these medications were not necessary" and that some were "greatly in excess of appropriate dosages.
