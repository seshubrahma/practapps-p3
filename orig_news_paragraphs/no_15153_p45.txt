August 25, 2016    The United Nations issues a report calling for an investigation into possible human rights violations in Yemen. The UNHCHR says the conflict between   government forces, Houthi and other rebels, has resulted in the death of 3, 799 civilians, 6, 711 wounded civilians, and millions of others displaced from their home. The humanitarian organization says air strikes by the   coalition that it monitored, made up the "single largest cause of [civilian] casualties," approximately   of the deaths and injuries they recorded.
