Are local Democrat mayors in Portland, Oakland, Los Angeles, and Denver loudly condemning the protests and asking their police departments to arrest the lawbreakers? Or do they offer sympathy and encourage the protests with   slogans like, "We feel your pain?" Donald Trump has been elected President of the United States by a resounding vote more representative of the nation than Bill Clinton’s 43 percent victory in 1992. Republicans did not take to the streets protesting Bill Clinton’s poor showing of only 43 percent of the popular vote.
