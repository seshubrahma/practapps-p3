But being worried about potentially embarrassing testimony is not a sufficient basis to invoke executive privilege. If Trump tries to stop Comey from testifying about their discussions relating to the Flynn investigation, Comey should just ignore him and do it anyway. Itâ€™s highly unlikely a court would prevent Comey, who is now a private citizen and no longer a government employee, from talking.    Trying to stop Comey from testifying by using executive privilege will almost certainly fail, but I understand why the White House would want to do it.
