Why have you attacked the Syrian army which is at war with terrorists? Under what law or authority did you launch your missiles at this independent country?" Iran and Russia are the closest allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad. They have provided him with military support not only against jihadists like the Islamic State group and former   affiliate Fateh   Front that are targeted by a   coalition but also against other rebels they deem "terrorists" too.
