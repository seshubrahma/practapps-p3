The charts below show the dramatic decline of interior deportations (called removals by the DHS) and the removal of criminal aliens from the U. S.:   Vaughn reported that 98 percent of all interior deportations were convicted criminals. This means that other migrants who have been crossing the border in massive numbers for the past several years are simply allowed to stay. Even though the removal of criminal aliens made up nearly all of the interior deportations, the numbers of criminals being deported also continued to fall from previous years.
