A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too. " The president, who inherited and expanded a family fortune built on   and   real estate development, has proposed eliminating an   infrastructure program that would have funded   proposals to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, and extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan north to East Harlem. State and city leaders say both projects are essential: The subway line is needed to alleviate congestion on Manhattanâ€™s East Side, and the tunnel is needed to improve deteriorating rail service in the heavily trafficked Eastern corridor and provide a new conduit for freight in the event of a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
