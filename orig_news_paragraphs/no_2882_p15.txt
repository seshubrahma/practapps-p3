In Gouthière’s workshop, gilt was applied with fire gilding, a process by which an amalgam of mercury and gold was gently baked onto an object in a low fire, the mercury evaporating and the gold remaining as a coating of gilt. Electroplating   —   using an electric current to adhere the gold to the object   —   appeared in the 19th century, largely replacing fire gilding, whose mercury fumes are highly toxic.
