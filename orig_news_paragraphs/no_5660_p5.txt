In California, the state legislature allowed his Tesla Motors to sell more than $500 million worth of carbon energy credits, said the Los Angeles Times, and the state’s   agency allows the owners of   cars to use   "high occupancy" lanes in gridlocked Los Angeles. Musk’s   company in New York state has reportedly gained $1 billion in   and   investment from Democratic politicians said the newspaper.   Unsurprisingly, Musk is a strong advocate for growing "carbon taxes" on natural fuels. In a January 2017 interview with Gizmodo, Musk declared:  CO2 [carbon diooxide] isn’t exactly pollution, but it does cause warming and slight acidification of water if very large quantities are dug from deep underground and added to the surface cycle.
