The department’s statement did not, however, offer any evidence to support a correlation between illegal immigration and increased violence in sanctuary cities. New York City Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill said Justice’s statement "demonstrates a willful disregard for the facts," adding that the city has seen crime drop overall, including major reductions in murders and shootings.   " In fact, 2016 saw the fewest shootings ever in New York City history since   began," O’Neill said.
