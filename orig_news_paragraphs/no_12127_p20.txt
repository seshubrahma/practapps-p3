According to Sentier Research, median household annual income in September, 2016, the most recent period for which data is available, was $57, 616. While that shows an increase of about $7, 000 in median household annual income in nominal terms during President Obamaâ€™s administration, when adjusted for the Consumer Price Index, real seasonally adjusted median household income (in September 2016 dollars) was about $57, 500 in January 2009, virtually the same as it is almost eight years later. " In real dollar terms, the median annual income is 1. 5% lower ( $884) than its interim high in January 2008 but well off its low in August 2011," Sentier Research found.
