In a statement on Monday, Mr. Stepien’s lawyer, Kevin Marino, called Mr. Wildstein’s testimony "sad and " noting that his client was never charged in the case. " Despite what Mr. Wildstein apparently feels compelled to say now, Mr. Stepien had no role in planning, approving or concealing his   scheme," Mr. Marino said. Mr. Wildstein told Mr. Baroni that they would not tell local officials, or anyone at the Port Authority, about their plan for punishment.
