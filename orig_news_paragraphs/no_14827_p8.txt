Along the New Jersey coast, strong winds pushed ocean water into neighborhoods, resulting in coastal flooding and beach erosion. A video posted by Chris Macaluso showed flooding in Atlantic City. The storm had subsided enough for Gov. Chris Christie to lift New Jerseyâ€™s state of emergency.   The governor said the storm has been "a tale of three storms," referring to its effect on different regions of the state.
