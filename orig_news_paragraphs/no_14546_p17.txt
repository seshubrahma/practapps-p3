Under the new policy, if someone canâ€™t prove he or she has been living in the US continuously for two years, he or she could now be eligible for expedited removal. Previously, this was limited in practice to people apprehended within 100 miles of the border and who had arrived within the past two weeks.   The memos also make a series of changes as part of ending   "catch and release," where undocumented immigrants awaiting court proceedings are granted parole and leave to enter the country pending court dates that can be years in the future.   It places stricter limits on who can be paroled instead of detained, making detention pending court proceedings the default for thousands of immigrants.
