During a campaign rally Wednesday in Lake Worth Florida, Hillary Clinton needed help climbing one step onto a platform.   According to footage captured by HillBroYo and Paul Joseph Watson from Prison Planet, Clinton was given a helping hand as she climbed onto the riser to address an overflow crowd that was unable to get into her rally. According to American Mirror, "Clinton was outside to greet supporters in Lake Worth when she attempted to stand on a small riser. She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness.
