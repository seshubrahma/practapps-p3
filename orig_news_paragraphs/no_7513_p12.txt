The Canary quotes an American Spectator article from 1996 reporting that La Farge helped funnel weapons to Saddam Hussein during Clinton’s tenure: "provided key services for the covert arms export network that supplied Saddam Hussein. To prevent exposure of that secret supply line, and collateral damage to Hillary Clinton  —   who joined Lafarge board in 1990, just as the arms pipeline was being shut down  …     the Justice Department was told to bury the investigation  …      But investigators from other US government agencies who worked on the case say they were ‘waved off’ whenever they got too close to exposing the direct involvement of the intelligence community in the arms export scheme.
