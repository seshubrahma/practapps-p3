But Gov. Terry McAuliffe —   one of Hillary Clinton’s oldest and most loyal supporters —  declared on April 22 of this year that he was using this pardon power to restore voting rights to 206, 000 convicted felons in Virginia. This was a political bombshell, because felons vote overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats, and Virginia is a swing state (made all the more so by Clinton’s tapping Sen. Tim Kaine from that state as her running mate). Virginia lawmakers sued, and the Virginia Supreme Court held in Howell v. McAuliffe that the Clinton ally’s political move was an unprecedented power grab that previous governors of both parties had acknowledged was illegal.
