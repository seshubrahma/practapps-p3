When he was shot and killed, Mr. Scottâ€™s hands were by his side, and he was slowly walking backward," he said. The police chief has said the video does not provide "definitive visual evidence" that Scott pointed a gun at officers. The investigation has been turned over to the State Bureau of Investigation, which said the   police are still the custodians of the videos and can release them if they want. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said Friday that the bureau has been looking for several days into the deadly encounter between Scott and police.
