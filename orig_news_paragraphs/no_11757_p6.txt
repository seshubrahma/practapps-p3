Trumpâ€™s closest primary election competitor Sen. Ted Cruz dropped out of the race in May. With only Trump left in the race, Issa endorsed Trump, the then presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Despite support from Obama for Applegate and a cash infusion, the Democrats were not able to flip the seat. San Diego Rep. Duncan Hunter, an early endorser of Trump, easily won   to the U. S. House of Representatives in his district, the 50th, on Tuesday night.
