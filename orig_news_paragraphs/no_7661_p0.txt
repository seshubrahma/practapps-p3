Fox News host Megyn Kelly defended Sen. Marco Rubio after Chris Christie accused the freshman senator of being too scripted and avoiding tough questions on the campaign trail. ["Do you take offense at him calling you a boy, a boy in a bubble?" Kelly asked Rubio during an interview with him on the campaign trail in New Hampshire.   "As far as answering questions, Megyn, Iâ€™ve been with you at least once a week," Rubio responded.
