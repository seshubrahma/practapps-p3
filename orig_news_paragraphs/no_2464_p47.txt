Skyscrapers and new apartment buildings are going up all around Fort Lauderdale. The local chamber of commerce says the city expects to add about 50, 000 people in the next 15 years and currently lacks housing to accommodate them. In Miami, much of the new construction consists of luxury condos aimed at a large number of cash buyers from Russia and Latin America. Nationally, median home prices in areas at high risk for flooding are still 4. 4 percent below what they were 10 years ago, while home prices in   areas are up 29. 7 percent over the same period, according to the housing data.
