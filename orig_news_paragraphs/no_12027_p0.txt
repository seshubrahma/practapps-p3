The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is slashing its organizing budget by $90 million, in a sign that unions fear their message will not resonate during a Trump administration, according to Businessweek. [Breitbart News has reported extensively on the bare knuckles tactics of the   protests that eventually led to Los Angeles and many other large cities across the U. S. adopting some form of $15 minimum wage.   SEIU President Mary Kay Henry stated at the time: "Together, we will continue to fight in the streets until greedy corporations and the politicians who favor them over working people take steps to restore the chance for all American families to get ahead. We will not stop until all work is valued and every community has the chance to thrive.
