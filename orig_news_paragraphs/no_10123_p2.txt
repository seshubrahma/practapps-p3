Donald Trump is running better in Iowa than other Midwestern states and that shows in his lead in this poll. He has a slight lead among independent voters, but his margin there may be heavily tied to demographics. Iowa, with a voting bloc that is overwhelmingly white, lacks the kind of large minority population that has fueled Hillary Clintonâ€™s lead in some of the large industrial states," Assistant Director of the Quinnipiac Poll Peter Brown said. Over in Colorado, Trump ties Hillary Clinton in a   race at 47 percent apiece.
