Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the intelligence panel, said Friday that he expressed at his meeting with Rosenstein and Boente his preference that Rosenstein name a special prosecutor. But Rosenstein made no commitments to him and the committeeâ€™s chairman, Richard Burr, Warner said.   " This is where, again, the chairman and I just disagree in terms of the needs for this narrowly tailored independent counsel," Warner said.
