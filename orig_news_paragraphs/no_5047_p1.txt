The annual term begins with its first sitting on the first Monday in October, and the last sitting for each annual term is conducted over two weeks in April.   The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) represents the United States before the U. S. Supreme Court. The office is led by a solicitor general (SG) who is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, assisted by a principal deputy solicitor general who is a presidential appointment not subject to Senate confirmation. These two appointees oversee a team of close to twenty attorneys who are mostly career staff, the senior ones holding the rank of deputy solicitor general, and the junior members being called assistant to the solicitor general.
