" When it comes to credibility problems, though, Donald Trump is in a league of his own," Gates, a Republican who led the Defense Department under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, wrote in a Wall Street Journal   Friday, adding that electing Trump is "too great a risk for America." " The world we confront is too perilous and too complex to have as president a man who believes he, and he alone, has all the answers and has no need to listen to anyone," Gates wrote.
