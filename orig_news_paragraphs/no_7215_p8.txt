These battles have paralyzed cities all over Mexico. Breitbart Texas recently published a video that shows the kind of firefights that have become commonplace in Mexico.   It remains to be seen if, in any upcoming appearances by Fox, the former president will be asked about the Mexican drug cartels who are responsible for the majority of the crime along the U. S.  border and are tearing that country apart. Will Fox explain how those drug cartels were able to expand their operations and build large armies of sicarios or gunmen under his watch?
