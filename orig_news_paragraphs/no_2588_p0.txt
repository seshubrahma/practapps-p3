Weeks of provocative and outlandish behavior have hurt Donald J. Trumpâ€™s standing in two new national polls of registered voters, which showed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee falling further behind Hillary Clinton. A Washington   News survey had Mrs. Clinton with a   lead: 51 percent to 39 percent. A Wall Street   News poll had Mrs. Clinton with a smaller advantage of five percentage points. Both polls, released on Sunday, showed Mr. Trump in worse shape than he had been a month ago, as voters in the latest polls expressed doubts about his preparedness and qualifications to lead the nation.
