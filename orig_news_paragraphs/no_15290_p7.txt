On the heels of the multiple launch, South Korea’s   THAAD missile defense system    which China vigorously opposes    arrives on the peninsula. As it was delivered, China’s top diplomat, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, warns that the US and North Korea are set for a "  collision" with neither side willing to give way.   On March 14, the US, along with allies South Korea and Japan, responded to the North’s earlier missile tests, dispatching   missile defense ships to the same area where Pyongyang had previously fired the four missiles. The Aegis warships began exercises to improve their capability to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles, the US Navy said in a statement.
