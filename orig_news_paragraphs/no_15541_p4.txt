In February, U. S. President Donald Trump had a meeting with James Comey, who was in charge of the FBI at that time.   Comey made a memo of something the president said during the meeting and the text of that memo was reported by "The New York Times" on Tuesday night.    Quote: I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.
