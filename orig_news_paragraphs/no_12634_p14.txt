This means that, if you include attacks on military recruiting bases, the number of American soldiers killed on U. S. soil by Muslims is greater than the number of Muslim soldiers killed on foreign soil wearing America’s uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan. While Donald Trump called Khan a hero, Trump explained that at the same time the nation must fix its immigration policy. The notion put forth by the media that a less restrictive immigration policy would somehow damper America’s armed services is not supported by reality. Indeed, if Muslim immigration were an essential feature of U. S. military recruiting, in just the last 14 years alone, the U. S. has resettled a domestic pool close to the size of 1. 7 million.
