Last February, when Justice Antonin Scalia died, for the first time in decades the Republican court appointees no longer held a majority. Democratic President Barack Obama, or a   successor, appeared ready to fill the vacancy. The Supreme Court was on the cusp of a historic reversal, and Roberts, the man with a golden resume, who when appointed in 2005 at age 50 was the youngest chief since John Marshall in 1801, seemed to face the greatest challenge of his life in the law.   Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a respected moderate liberal and former prosecutor who is chief judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
