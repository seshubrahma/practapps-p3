Thursday morning as Donald Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other officials inside. " Creamer, meanwhile, stepped back from his responsibilities working with the campaign after a video released by James O’Keefe and his organization, Project Veritas Action, reportedly showed the Democratic operative hiring people to protest at Trump events and allegedly to incite violence. Creamer’s associations with Clinton’s presidential campaign came in the form of activism on behalf of his organization, Democracy Partners, a progressive consulting group, and Creamer’s position as leader of Mobilize, which was contracted with the DNC.
