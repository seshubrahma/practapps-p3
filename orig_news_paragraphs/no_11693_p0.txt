Rocker Neil Young penned a lengthy letter on Facebook Monday demanding that President Obama "end the violence" against activists protesting the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline being built in North Dakota. ["We are calling upon you, President barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful protesters at Standing Rock immediately," Young wrote.   The "Rockinâ€™ in the Free World" singer called the controversial protest on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation "an awakening" that has seen activists "standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and National Guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access Pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of   dollars.
