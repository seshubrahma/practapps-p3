There is one   policy that Trump could preserve —  and even expand. Each year, Obama has requested from Congress more funds for NASA’s commercial spaceflight program, which invests in private companies designing launch systems. Trump’s advisers have described such   partnerships as the "foundation" for   efforts. Trump recently named Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, to an economic advisory team, and has met with Jeff Bezos, the founder of spaceflight company Blue Origin, despite their contentious relationship over The Washington Post.
