Mr. Hoffman articulated a view that is often whispered within the business community   —   among those who are voting against Mr. Trump  —   but rarely spoken aloud. I have talked to some of the top executives of the Fortune 500 companies in recent months, and I’d be   to name one who didn’t at least roll his or her eyes when Mr. Trump’s name was mentioned. Technology companies are afraid that Mr. Trump might criticize their approach to privacy, as he did with Apple.
