The mission’s casualties have raised doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation, initially during the Obama administration, and whether the right questions were raised before its approval, which took place over a dinner Mr. Trump held with top advisers five days after taking office. Senior Trump administration officials said that the Defense Department had conducted a legal review of the mission and that a Pentagon lawyer had signed off on it. But the comments by Mr. Owens, his first public remarks since his son’s death, cast a new spotlight on whether the mission’s risks  —   to the American commandos and to Yemeni civilians   —   had been considered fully enough by Mr. Trump and his top aides.
