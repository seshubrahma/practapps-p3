Responding to video of an   group leader declaring "Hail Trump," Johnson said, "I know that there are people like that in America. It’s been that way ever since slavery existed in this country and they’re not going to go away tomorrow or the next day."   He said Trump and his team "gotta show me what they’re going to deliver to make those kind of silly Nazi behavior( s) irrelevant to black America."
