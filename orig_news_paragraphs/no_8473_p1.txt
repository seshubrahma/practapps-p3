Earlier today, BuzzFeed informed the RNC that we would not accept Trump for President ads and that we would be terminating our agreement with them," he said. " The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs," he argued. The announcement comes at a time when Buzzfeed and other   sites are struggling financially, with BuzzFeed specifically slashing its 2016 revenue forecast in half after missing its 2015 target by more than $80 million.
