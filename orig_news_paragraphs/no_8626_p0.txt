Hank Paulson, George W. Bush’s treasury secretary, who presided over both the meltdown of the U. S. economy and the subsequent bailout of his close friends and associates, has endorsed Hillary Clinton  —   citing his belief that she’d be more likely to enact globalist policies on trade and immigration as part of the reason for his endorsement. [Paulson also posits that Clinton would be more likely to cut Americans’ medicare and social security, which Paulson cites as a top priority following the financial collapse he helped to create.   Paulson is also the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, which has given Hillary Clinton hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches. According to Politico, Goldman Sachs rewarded Clinton with a total of $675, 000 for three paid speeches.
