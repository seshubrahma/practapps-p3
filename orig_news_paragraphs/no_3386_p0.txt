Homeland Secretary John Kelly has not made a decision to expand the     visa program, and his deputies have not even met with counterparts at the Department of Labor to begin the expansion process, says an agency spokesman. ["He has not yet made any determination," said spokesman David Lapan, adding that "there is no timeline. "   Lapanâ€™s comments suggest that Kelly has reversed his initial support for an expansion of the   program, and is now looking for a P. R.  strategy that allows him to deflect pressure from legislators and lobbyists who want an expansion.
