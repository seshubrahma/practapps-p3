Thanks for being a part of this, Elizabeth, Breitbart News reported extensively that there is zero credible evidence to support her claim that she has any Native American heritage, not even the false claim advanced by some Warren apologists that she is   Cherokee: Lynda Smith, the amateur genealogist who unknowingly found herself at the root of the false "Elizabeth Warren is   Cherokee" meme introduced to the media by "noted" genealogist Chris Child of the New England Historic Genealogical Society, acknowledged in an email to me this past Saturday, May 12, that her statement in a March 2006 family newsletter upon which Mr. Child based his claim of Ms. Warren’s Cherokee ancestry was made with no supporting documentation. It was, in fact, an honest mistake that Ms. Smith now acknowledges is entirely without foundation. Ms. Smith had been quoted in a statement in a March 2006 newsletter that William J. Crawford had listed his mother, Ms. Warren’s    grandmother O. C. Sarah Smith, as a Cherokee on an 1894 Oklahoma Territory marriage license application (emphasis added).
