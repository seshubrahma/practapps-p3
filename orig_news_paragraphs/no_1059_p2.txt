Friday’s defeat of the Republican leadership’s bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act was a return to form, handing an immense defeat to President Trump and embarrassing Speaker Paul D. Ryan in his own House. It also challenged the veracity of their   claims that a Republican president was all they needed to get big things accomplished. The most important question for Republicans now is whether the members of the Freedom Caucus will find themselves newly emboldened in ways that may bring the new president more defeats   —   or whether Mr. Ryan will do what former Speaker John A. Boehner could not, and find a way to shred their influence for good.
