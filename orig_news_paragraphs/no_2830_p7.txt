Two months before the election, Hillary Clinton is within a couple of points of where President Obama ended on Election Day with Hispanic voters, while Donald Trump has been drastically underperforming Romney by 10 points or more," John Anzalone, Mrs. Clinton’s pollster for Florida, said in a statement.

The traditional playbook has been for Democrats to run up the score in South Florida, with its large nonwhite population, and for Republicans to rack up votes in the conservative panhandle. That leaves Central Florida, and especially Tampa on the Gulf Coast, as one of the state’s most contested swing areas.
