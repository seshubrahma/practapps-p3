A group of advocacy organizations that had worked to overturn the executive order and help immigrants and refugees stranded at airports issued a statement on Saturday afternoon encouraging travelers "to rebook travel to the United States immediately. " "We have been in contact with hundreds of people impacted by the ban, and we are urging them to get on planes as quickly as possible," Clare Kane, a law student intern at the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, one of the groups involved, said in a statement. But some officials were being more cautious, advising travelers to wait for further clarity.
