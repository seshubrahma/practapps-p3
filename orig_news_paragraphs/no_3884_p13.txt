Trump will be in Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day, a national holiday here that marks Israelâ€™s reunification of Jerusalem after the 1967 Six Day War and the establishment of Israeli sovereignty over the eastern sections of the city, which include the Old City, Western Wall and Temple Mount. Many will be watching to see if Trump uses the visit to announce a move of the U. S. embassy from the beach in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although reports put that as unlikely. U. S. law requires the relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem. However, President Obama signed successive waivers delaying the move.
