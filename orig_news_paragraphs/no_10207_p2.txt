Friends, the fix is in: they want to throw the election to the Democrats. The archaic GOP, like a boneyard of prehistoric mammals, does not realize that it can never EVER win another election in its current incarnation. The gerrymandering of the voting populace by negligent immigration policies, lack of assimilation, bolstering of special interests, an indoctrinating  educational system and the ineffectual. uninspired GOP have all contributed to this.
