In his news briefing later that day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined repeatedly to explain what the tweet meant or address questions about whether there were recording devices in the Oval Office. Trump and Comey had a private dinner in the White House on January 27 in which a source close to Comey said the President asked the FBI director to pledge his loyalty, which Comey, who reportedly was taken aback by the request, refused to do. The dinner was on the same day that Yates went to the White House to warn the administration about   national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s potential vulnerability to Russian blackmail and that Trump issued the executive order restricting travel from several   nations.   Clapper said Sunday that he spoke with Comey prior to the dinner while at an event at FBI headquarters in Washington.
