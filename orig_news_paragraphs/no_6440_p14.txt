Another development at the retreat was the resolve among GOP senators to fill the vacancy left by the Feb. 13, 2016 death of Justice Antonin G. Scalia. Again the problem is the GOP’s lack of 60 votes. Before   leader Sen. Harry Reid (D. .) invoked the "nuclear option" in 2013, all confirmations were part of the   process of ending debate with 60 votes and then confirming the nominee with a simple majority. Reid executed a challenge to the rule for nominees in order to break the logjam of Obama appointments —  blocked by the Republican minority.
