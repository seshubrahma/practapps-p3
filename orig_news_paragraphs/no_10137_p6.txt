Focusing briefly on the current occupant of the White House, who is on an official visit to Havana with Cuba’s communist dictator, Raul Castro, Cruz —  whose father fled Cuba as a young man to escape political persecution —  sharply criticized Obama. " While our friends and allies are attacked by radical Islamic terrorists, President Obama is spending his time going to baseball games with the Castros," he said. The senator called on Obama either to immediately return to the White House to personally take charge of the U. S. response to the Brussels terrorist attack or to announce that he was heading immediately to Brussels to meet with our NATO allies.
