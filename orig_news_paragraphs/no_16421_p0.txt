Washington (CNN) A pair of House Republicans have added their names to a request for their party to stop funding Donald Trump at the top of its ticket. Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell and Wisconsin Rep. Reid Ribble, both of whom are retiring, added their names to the request, along with former Reps. Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, and Jim Kolbe, of Arizona, said GOP operative Andrew Weinstein. Weinstein, who is coordinating the letter drive, said he now has 110 Republicans who have signed on.
