An N. F. L. official said two Denver Broncos defenders were fined for hitting the Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton on the head in their season opener last week. Newton was hit on the head four times in the game, only one of which drew a penalty against the Broncos. But there were shining moments in the opening week of professional football, like the   34 completions the Kansas City Chiefsâ€™ quarterback, Alex Smith, made against the San Diego Chargers. Tonight, the New York Jets play the Buffalo Bills.
