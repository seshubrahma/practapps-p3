Tensions between Japan and China have spiked over the past year as the Pacific powers wrangle over control over the Senkaku Islands, which China calls the Diaoyus, in the East China Sea. In October, Japan said it had dispatched its warplanes 407 times between April 1 and September 30 in reaction to increased Chinese military flights near Japanese airspace. That’s almost double the number of intercepts Japan’s Air Self Defense Force made on Chinese aircraft in the same period in 2015.
