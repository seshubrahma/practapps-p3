["On 2 November 2016, the director general expressed concerns related to Iran’s stock of heavy water to the vice president of Iran and president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran," said the confidential IAEA report, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.   Iran reportedly told the agency it would begin preparations to ship 5 tons of the excess heavy water out of the country within the next few days. " It’s important to note that Iran made no effort to hide this, hide what it was doing from the IAEA," U. S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said at a press conference.
