Washington (CNN) A delegate to the Republican National Convention has filed a lawsuit against Virginia officials as part of a   attempt to avoid voting for Donald Trump this summer in Cleveland. Carroll Correll is suing Virginia election officials in federal court, arguing that his right to free speech is infringed upon by legal requirements that he cast his ballot for Trump. His suit comes as efforts to unbind delegates and subvert Trump at the convention intensify, though remain very unlikely to succeed.
