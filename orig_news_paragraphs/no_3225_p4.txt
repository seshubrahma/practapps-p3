Dane says the current system of family chain migration ends up a drain on American taxpayers, as they must foot the bill, writing "In 2012, more than half of   households in the United States relied on at least one welfare program, compared with 30 percent of households headed by a   citizen, according to a report based on data from the Census Bureauâ€™s Survey of Income and Program Participation. " Trump, according to Dane, should focus on creating a   immigration policy where only immigrants who have a high likelihood to succeed are admitted, as this would be in the national interest: All prospective immigrants to the U. S. should be evaluated based on objective criteria. These include education, job skills and English proficiency.
