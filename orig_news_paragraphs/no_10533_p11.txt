While that meaning of it is   and indeed   level, there is an element of truth to the idea that the Bush family has obtained control over Republican politics over the past two decades —  and similarly the Clintons over Democratic politics. Americans, this election cycle, are repeatedly rejecting what they see as failed royal rule by a pair of   political families and those closely associated with them —  turning instead to outsiders they see as pure from the political corruption with which the Bushes and Clintons are so commonly associated. It’s why Iowa went to Cruz and a contested election on the Democratic side, and New Hampshire went to Trump and Sanders. It’s also why in South Carolina GOP presidential primary polling Trump and Cruz are so solidly ahead of their opponents in recent surveys.
