Mr. Dalio, they said, wanted to discuss the   problem of "fake news" and "distorted news," which he believes is   exemplified  about his company (and which he wrote   about in a  this week). We agreed on some ground   rules: We had control over what we published, but Dalio wanted to   be sure we shared his views with our readers, not our view of his   views. Thus, I suggested a Q&A. ’ ’ I spoke with Dalio by phone for nearly two and a half hours.    To me, the conversation was itself a case study of the   Bridgewater discussion style, which includes lively debate and   open disagreement.
