Curriculum needs to be integrated throughout the education system from   so students are thinking of postsecondary education and careers at a younger age. Researchers and scholars can contribute by providing scientific and   policies to those designing these   programs, similar to the work of the University of Chicagoâ€™s Urban Labs.   And finally, the philanthropic community can pool together resources and invest long and deep on   policies, as the MacArthur Foundation, the Chicago Community Trust, and several other funders recently have to support the Chicago Fund for Safe and Peaceful Communities.
