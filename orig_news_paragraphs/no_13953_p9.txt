The march, which was   by the NAACP, was capped by a rally in Washington that attracted speakers from advocacy groups, the local government and the Senate.   Among the speakers were Sharpton, Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, President of the National Urban League Marc Morial, and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser. Cornell Williams Brooks, president of the NAACP, had strong words for Trump. Responding to Trump’s comments earlier Saturday to civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis, Brooks called Trump’s comments disrespectful and asserted that Lewis was an "icon of the civil rights movement" who came "perilously close to becoming a martyr" because of it.
