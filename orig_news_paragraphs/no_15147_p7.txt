The missile was launched from the same point of the April 5 launch, a White house foreign policy adviser said. US military officials don’t believe the missile had intercontinental capabilities, a US defense official told CNN. The official said there was limited data as the missile blew up so quickly. Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the think tank RAND Corporation, said he thinks the missiles were not the kind that could reach the United States’ mainland.
