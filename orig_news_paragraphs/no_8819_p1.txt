[Kasich campaign manager John Weaver sent out a memo explaining that Trump will probably not get to 1, 237 delegates now, opening up the convention floor for a   Kasich power play. Cruz is currently racing to steal delegates to win on the second ballot as the Republican Establishment hints that it might run Paul Ryan at the convention in Cleveland.   Weaver wrote: This week will be remembered as the one in which Ted Cruz and Donald Trump both effectively admitted they will not reach the GOP Convention with enough bound delegates to be the nominee. Tonightâ€™s results will solidify the fact that no candidate will reach Cleveland with 1237 bound delegates.
