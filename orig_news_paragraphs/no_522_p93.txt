" Friedanâ€™s 1963 book, "The Feminine Mystique," had been an awakening for a class of white, married,   women, and she pictured herself as the leader of what she called a "mainstream" feminist movement. When women at one 1970 march offered her a lavender armband to wear in solidarity with a NOW member recently attacked for her bisexuality, Friedan dropped it on the ground, furious at the attempt to add gay rights to her program. Kennedy continually pushed in the opposite direction, trying to build bridges between feminist groups and other movements.
