Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose phone was once tapped by US intelligence, did not take kindly to Trump’s quip that they had something in common Friday. Also Friday, Trump’s Justice Department sent classified information to Capitol Hill about the claims, but sources said it did not substantiate them. The apparent lack of evidence for Trump’s claims is causing consternation among the President’s Republican allies and Democrats alike, and speculation about how he will respond if Comey testifies that they are baseless. His unrepentant Friday news conference suggests the President will simply quadruple down on his claims, and ignore evidence against him.
