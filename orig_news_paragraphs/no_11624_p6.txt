The higher limit is due to a Supreme Court ruling, which eliminated aggregate caps on individuals, and a statutory provision tucked into a 2014 appropriations bill that allows both national party committees to create new fundraising committees. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have exploited the new rules even more aggressively. The Clinton campaign and DNC have signed joint fundraising agreements with 32 state parties. The Democrat National Committee has also created new campaign accounts, allowing an individual to contribute up to $1. 1 million to support Clinton and the Democrats this Fall.
