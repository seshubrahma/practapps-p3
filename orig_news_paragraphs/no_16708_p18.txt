Police allowed the family to see the   footage Thursday, but the public has yet to see it. On Friday,   police Chief Kerr Putney said he expected police videos of the shooting    from dashboard and officer body cameras    to be released eventually when investigators decide it can be done as part of a package with other information, so the videos aren’t made public without context. That stance differed from the chief’s message a day earlier that the public shouldn’t expect the videos’ release. Curry said he believes police have a copy of Rakeyia Scott’s video.
