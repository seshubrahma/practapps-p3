Across 28 states with exit or entrance polls this spring, Trump averaged 50% support among white   GOP primary voters or caucus participants, compared with 37% among whites with college degrees. And across five   polls conducted since the primaries ended in June, Trump’s lead among white   voters averages 29 points, while white college voters have broken in Clinton’s direction by an average of 8 points. Restated in terms similar to the   gender gap, that adds up to a   education gap among whites. According to exit polls back to 1980, it has never been larger than 14 points.
