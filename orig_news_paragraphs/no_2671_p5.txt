• President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has indefinitely postponed a trip to France after the French government said talks would be devoted solely to the Syrian crisis. The move came after President François Hollande of France and the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, called for a war crimes inquiry. Mr. Johnson also called for protests outside the Russian Embassy in London.
