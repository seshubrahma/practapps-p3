The Pentagon announced on Wednesday that Secretary of Defense James Mattis will visit Japan and South Korea in early February, on his first overseas trip since confirmation. ["The trip will underscore the commitment of the United States to our enduring alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea, and further strengthen U. S.   of Korea security cooperation," said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis.   "President Donald Trump raised concerns during the campaign by asserting that some allies are not pulling their weight and by suggesting that he might not object to Japan or South Korea developing their own nuclear weapons if they do not pay more for U. S. military support," Stars  Stripes noted in reporting Mattisâ€™ travel agenda.
