Although abortions in the United States are overwhelmingly obtained in the first trimester, the study included hundreds of women who sought them later in pregnancy. There were 452 whose pregnancies were within two weeks of the clinic’s limit and who received abortions and 231 women who were denied abortions because their pregnancies were up to three weeks past the clinic’s limit. The study also included 273 women who received   abortions. Of the 231 turned away, 161 ended up giving birth and 70 miscarried or received abortions elsewhere, often requiring longer travel and more expense.
