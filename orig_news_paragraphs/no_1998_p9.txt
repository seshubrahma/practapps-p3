The Obama administration has accused Russian interests of meddling in the presidential campaign by spreading fake news and  hacking into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and the emails of John Podesta, a leading figure in Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign. But efforts by Russia, which has jailed some of its own white supremacist agitators, to organize and inspire extreme   groups in the United States and Europe may ultimately prove more influential. His voice amplified by   think tanks, the Orthodox Church and   news media, like RT and Sputnik, that are aimed at foreign audiences, Mr. Putin has in recent years reached out to conservative and nationalist groups abroad with the message that he stands with them against gay rights activists and other forces of moral decay. He first embraced this theme when, campaigning for his third term as president in early 2012, he presented Russia not only as a military power deserving of international respect, but also as a "civilizational model" that could rally all those in Russia and beyond who were fed up with the erosion of traditional values.
