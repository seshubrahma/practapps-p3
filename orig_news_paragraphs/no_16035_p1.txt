Clinton’s super PAC, Priorities USA, plans to spend $5. 5 million, with both groups devoting most of their cash to Florida and Ohio. The billionaire’s campaign has yet to air a single   advertisement, and has none booked for next week, according to   Media, nor do any of his super PACs. Trump has not bought TV advertising since early May spots in Indiana and Nebraska. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
