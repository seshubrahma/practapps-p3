Even New York, where Clinton won last week in a victory that seemed to mark the beginning of the eventual end for Bernie Sanders, Clinton saw a 2. 26 percent decrease from 1, 068, 496 in 2008 to 1, 044, 299 in 2016. That’s especially significant since New York state elected Clinton to the U. S. Senate after she was First Lady of the United States in the 1990s when her husband Bill Clinton was president.
