I look at this, and you know what I think? I think the Muslim ban is dead. Maddow is referring, of course, to Trumpâ€™s January 27 Executive Order, the one that has been clobbered by the MSM and waylaid by the courts.   That order was never a "Muslim ban" but, rather, an attempt to restrict entry from seven countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.
