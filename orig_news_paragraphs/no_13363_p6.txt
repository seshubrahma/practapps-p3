Miller wrapped up his speech Friday in Fresno by warning the crowd that a President Hillary Clinton would gladly "grind" hardworking Americans "under her hill as they get poorer and poorer and poorer, while she gets richer and richer and richer. " "We’re not going to have a government where you just give money to Bill to get favors from Hill," Miller said, adding: We’re going to have a government, folks, where the people who make the decisions are the people in this room today —  the people who follow the rules, the people who go to work every day, the patriotic loyal citizens of this country, who are the heartbeat of the nation, the pulse of this country, the lifeblood of the United States of America.
