On Wednesday, Mr. Christie’s only public appearance was the one in Atlantic City, in the southern part of the state, where he celebrated the opening of the Hard Rock Casino in Atlantic City. " We have shown that we’re committed to doing the hard things in Atlantic City," he said. He refused to answer questions from reporters and said nothing about the commuting woes.
