With the exceptions of North Korea and Japan, President Trump has proven somewhat more malleable than the candidate. Trump has demanded an end to tensions on the Korean peninsula and proven he prioritizes that conflict by sending his   officials to Seoul and Tokyo to pressure Pyongyang. In Japanâ€™s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump has found steady support after choosing him as the first head of government to meet with following his election in November. With China, however, the Trump administration has kept its diplomacy tactful, and Trump himself has offered Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping something his voters would have never expected the candidate Trump to: a "not as good" trade deal in exchange for keeping North Korea from attacking its neighbors or, worse, the United States.
