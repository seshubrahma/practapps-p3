A number of Senate Republicans are worried about Tillersonâ€™s coziness with Putin, including Marco Rubio, John McCain, and Chuck Grassley. Rubio said he was "seriously concerned" about Tillerson, and he is significant as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee that will hold the first vote on his nomination. With Democrats expected to oppose Tillerson en masse, the opposition of just three Republicans could sink his nomination. He benefits from the support of the Republican leadership, and endorsements from Condoleezza Rice, Robert Gates and James Baker.
