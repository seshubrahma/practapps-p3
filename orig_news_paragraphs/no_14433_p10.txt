" Our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the President to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned," Miller had told CBS News. After Miller appeared on four Sunday shows (CNN was not one of them) the   President sent an attaboy tweet.
