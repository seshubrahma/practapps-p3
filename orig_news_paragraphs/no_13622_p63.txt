Panthers offensive coordinator Mike Shula, the former Alabama quarterback, needs to take a page out of Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin’s playbook and find creative ways to utilize tight end Olsen in the second half like Kiffin did with O. J. Howard against Clemson in the college football title game. Tight ends have been successful finding soft spots in Denver’s defense. Carolina did not go deep once in the first half. Why have   on the field if you aren’t going to at least try a   pass to either when Denver is stopping the run and the underneath throwing game?
