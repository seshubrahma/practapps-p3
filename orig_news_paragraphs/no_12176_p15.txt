That means, per Ryan’s own standards as laid out here during this primary in Wisconsin thanks to Nehlen, the TPP is dead until at least the next president takes office. Either voters nationwide will select Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, who will take that deal and retool it ever so slightly and ram it through Congress, or Donald Trump, who will shred it to pieces and completely destroy it. In other words, Paul Nehlen killed the Trans Pacific Partnership. A   vice president for a water filtration company from rural Wisconsin who decided to run for office in the ultimate David vs. Goliath race —    candidate against   incumbent and sitting House Speaker —  singlehandedly put a dagger through the heart of that Speaker’s and the sitting president’s biggest globalist agenda item.
