One congressman, Steve Scalise at second base, one staffer.   I wish I knew his name, but I donâ€™t, the one that was wounded in the leg at the bottom of the first base dugout that we used my belt to help put a tourniquet around  his leg, two law enforcement officers. One was shot in the leg. To his credit after the shooter was taken down he went into the right field where Steve Scalise was lying on the ground to help tend to him.
