Mr. Burnett, who has not commented on whether such footage exists, said he did not have the legal right to release "Apprentice" tapes M. G. M. the global entertainment conglomerate that now owns Mr. Burnett’s production company and its archive, says the same. A person familiar with Mr. Trump’s "Apprentice" contract, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe confidential terms, said M. G. M. would have to obtain Mr. Trump’s permission before releasing unaired footage of him from the show, part of a clause granting Mr. Trump control over the use of his name and likeness. The clause in Mr. Trump’s contract is not unusual in reality television, and M. G. M. said on Wednesday that it intended to honor its agreements. Few Hollywood studios wish to be at the center of a fevered political dispute, and M. G. M. ’s statement did not mention Mr. Trump by name.
