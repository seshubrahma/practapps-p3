More than half of the 44 people arrested Wednesday are undocumented immigrants, acting US Attorney Sandra Brown said.   But the raids aimed to curb violent crime    not immigration violations, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said. He said   often "preys on" undocumented immigrants.    The suspects face a wide range of charges, including federal racketeering, narcotics conspiracy and homicide.
