Democrats thought misleading Congress was no big deal until today : Call it an example of  "whataboutism" if you will, but it bears noting for the record that Democrats were quick to dismiss blatantly false statements to Congress from such individuals as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, and Sessionsâ€™ predecessor Attorney General Eric Holder as trivial errors. And, of course, Democrats launched an   jihad against the very concept of perjury to keep Bill Clinton in power in the Nineties. In each case, congressional Democrats showed the maximum possible indulgence to Obama administration officials, blithely accepting every claim of imperfect memory, misunderstanding of questions, and even rank incompetence as acceptable excuses.
