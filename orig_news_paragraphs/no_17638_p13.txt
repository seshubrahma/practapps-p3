At the beginning   of the 401( k) revolution, many employees were told 3 percent of   their incomes would be perfectly adequate, as the Journal article   reminds us. More recently, some, like Cindy Hounsell at the   Womenâ€™s Institute for a Secure Retirement, have said as much as   15 percent. Since Americans currently put aside about 5. 5 percent   of their incomes, this presents something of a challenge. If   hectoring people to save more worked, surely it would have by   now.
