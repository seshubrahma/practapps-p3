Washington (CNN) Vice   Mike Pence on Wednesday declined to say whether he believes Russia should be punished for carrying out a hacking operation aimed at influencing the 2016 presidential election. In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, Pence said simply that he was "aware" of a bipartisan bill moving through Congress designed to impose additional sanctions against Russia. He also refused to answer whether the country’s influence campaign in 2016 should be met with "American strength," as he suggested Russian provocations should be met during the vice presidential debate last year.
