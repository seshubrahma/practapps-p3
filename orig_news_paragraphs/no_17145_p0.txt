 (CNN) Nearly 200 organizations concerned that   Donald Trump may revive the National Security   Registration System, known as NSEERS, once used to register and track mostly Arabs and Muslims, are asking President Barack Obama to abolish the program before he leaves office. In a letter delivered to the Obama administration on Monday, the American Arab   Committee, or ADC, blasted NSEERS for being "ineffective as a counterterrorism tool" and causing "tremendous harm" to immigrant communities. The letter was signed by 197 other organizations, including the National Council of La Raza, the   League, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.
