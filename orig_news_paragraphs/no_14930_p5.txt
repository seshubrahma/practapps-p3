The vice president conceded in the speech that "Congress wasn’t ready" to repeal the bill and acknowledged that a "handful" of Republicans were to blame as well for the failure. Tax reform is next on the administration’s list of issues, he said, specifically promising that the administration would lower the corporate tax code to 15% to bolster American businesses. Pence also made a direct appeal to West Virginia’s senators, Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Shelley   to support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court, saying that even though Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, is threatening to filibuster the nomination, the Senate would confirm Gorsuch "one way or the other. "  Senate rules say 60 senators must vote to break a filibuster, meaning eight Democrats would have to join the 52 Republicans unless the GOP changes the rules on Supreme Court nominations through a majority vote.
