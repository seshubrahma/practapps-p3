Basically, universities are free to hire as many   as they like, anytime in the year, for any job that requires a college degree. The university exemption is so broad that   companies can legally create affiliates with universities so they can exploit the universities’ exemption to hire cheap   professionals. From 2011 to 2014, for example, Dow Chemical, Amgen, Samsung and Monsanto used the university exemption to hire 360 extra   professionals outside the 85, 000 annual cap. That’s not an abuse of the law.
