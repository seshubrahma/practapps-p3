"Given the need to complete the parliamentary process to approve the budget law," Mr. Mattarella asked Mr. Renzi to postpone stepping down until the budget, now being discussed in the Senate, had been passed, according to the statement from the president’s office. An official from the office said the budget was expected to be passed this week. Mr. Mattarella’s request was not unusual: His predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano, had "frozen" the resignations of two prime ministers so that pending laws could be passed.
