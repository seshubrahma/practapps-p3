The Pentagon insists the   test of its   interceptor system is not solely about North Korea, and the test is aimed at being able to challenge any threatening ICBM, including possibly from Iran in the future. That test involved firing a new version of the militaryâ€™s single     interceptor missile, which is currently based in Alaska and California. That program has also been in existence for more than a decade but only about half of the tests have been successful, according to the Defense Department. US officials often call it a   effort to hit a bullet with another bullet.
