Hillary Clinton’s campaign was quick to act, putting out a video Monday morning that drew attention to Mr. Trump’s remarks and to some critical responses to him by other Republicans. Representative Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, accused Senator Mark Kirk, the Republican she is challenging, of being "complicit" in Mr. Trump’s campaign of "hate and division" and of dodging Mr. Trump’s comments on Judge Curiel Mr. Kirk did not reply to requests for comment. Democrats in Nevada also held a news conference to draw attention to Mr. Trump’s remarks, while others publicized them to reporters in Ohio and Florida. On Capitol Hill, House Democrats held a private conference call to discuss how to apply pressure on the Republican leadership.
