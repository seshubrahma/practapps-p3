: Sanders says he grew up in Brooklyn to Polish immigrants and this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the   interests that dominate   interests. He says Clinton cannot take money from Wall Street and do what is best for working families at the end of the day. Clinton, tailoring her closing for New Yorkers (Sanders repeated his same lines) says that she is grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave her the great honor of serving as your Senator by taking a chance on her in 2000 and then   her with one of the biggest margins in 2006. She says she had their backs and they had hers.
