Cruz’s Fiorina pick is a disaster and shows how clueless the professional establishment and conservative tacticians are. First, many of Cruz’s "New York values" criticisms of Trump can be leveled at Fiorina. So, Cruz can’t effectively criticize Trump for not having core conservative values after picking Fiorina, whose one note candidacy didn’t resonate because conservative grassroots voters have never trusted her as one of them. Second, should Cruz somehow win the nomination, Democrats would eviscerate her as the female Mitt Romney.
