Robin Mickle, a fellow Navy officer of Mr. Bannon’s aboard the destroyer Paul F. Foster, remembers that he and some of his idealistic mates were struck by something Mr. Bannon told them in 1978. " He said he joined the Navy so it would look good on his résumé because he wanted to go into politics someday," said Mr. Mickle, a retired defense contractor. Another officer, Sonny Masso, who would stay in the Navy and eventually make admiral, recalls a devoted reader of The Wall Street Journal who picked stocks to buy through a San Diego broker and had an astonishing ability to retain information.
