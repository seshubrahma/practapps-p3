United Talent Agency, one of the world’s largest talent agencies, canceled its traditional Oscars party and instead made a $250, 000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union. They opted to hold a    rally where speakers blasted the Trump agenda. Shortly after the travel ban was announced, Ari Emanuel, a   agent to Trump, told   talent agency employees that he and his   Patrick Whitesell, were forming a federal political action committee. Though Emanuel has not spoken publicly about the focus of the PAC, one source familiar with the plans said many of the agency’s employees were profoundly shaken by the travel ban    which affected some of its clients.
