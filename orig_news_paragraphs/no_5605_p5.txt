Well, that all changed back in the 1960s when the absurdly named "liberals" and "progressives" finally realized that the electorate would never buy their crazy authoritarian bunkum. So they decided that the electorate needed to be cut out of the deal. That was when they started stacking the courts with people who flat out reject the notion that the Constitution actually means anything. These   neanderthals certainly have no intentions whatsoever of upholding the Constitution or applying it fairly.
