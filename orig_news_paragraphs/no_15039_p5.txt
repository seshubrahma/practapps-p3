The meals will be served with a 2014 Chalk Hill Chardonnay from Sonoma Coast and a 2014 Girard Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley. Once the dinner plates are whisked away, two desserts will be offered: chocolate cake with vanilla sauce and dark chocolate sorbet, and a trio of fruit sorbets. As for the conversation menu? A stack of tough issues lie before the presidents of the worldâ€™s two largest economies.
