As CNN reported Thursday, sources involved in   discussions with DHS are set to recommend the construction of additional fencing rather than a concrete wall, as President Trump called for during the campaign. Just hours before the GAO released its report Thursday, border security officials testified on Capitol Hill about the ongoing threat of drug cartels and their ability to breach security layers along the southwest border. Matt Allen, an assistant director for DHS investigations, testified that cartel smugglers can sidestep fencing by launching drugs over the border with air or propane cannons or by using vehicle "" where ramps and even cranes lift vehicles over barriers. Paul Beeson, CBPâ€™s Director of Joint Task Force    West, said fencing and surveillance technology have helped reduce these vehicle breaches.
