An illegal alien in California was arrested but was quickly released because of new liberal federal and state policing laws, allowing him to murder Air Force veteran Marilyn Pharis a few days after release, Californian Police Chief Ralph Martin told a House hearing today. [During his testimony, given Thursday at the "Criminal Aliens Released by the Department of Homeland Security" hearing, Martin detailed how Mexican illegal Victor Aureliano   was able to escape jail and deportation prior to the murder.   A federal court ruling permitted Santa Maria County to ignore an ICE request to hold   in 2014. In 2015, he was merely cited for possessing meth, Martin said.
