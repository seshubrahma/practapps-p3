Trump’s triumph is even more shocking to Wall Street, because the vast majority of analysts expected Democrats to win a   majority in (and control of) the U. S. Senate, and be very close to taking the U. S. House.

Since equity markets hate surprises, both Donald Trump’s and Ronald Reagan’s    victories caused big   stock losses.
