Every time an American loses his or her job to an immigrant on a green card, that is "legal immigration. " In other words, the difference between, say, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador and a legal immigrant is that only the legal immigrant has federal permission to take an American job, collect lifetime benefits and welfare, bring in his or her family on green cards, and vote in U. S. elections. As a result of these legal visa issuances, the U. S. adds a population of new immigrants the size of Los Angeles every three years.
