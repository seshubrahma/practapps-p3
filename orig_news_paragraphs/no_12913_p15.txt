Social media research reveals that many in leadership at the NBPC actually wanted to support Senator Cruz, but they indicated that he had made no effort to have a relationship with the only organization advocating for the agents, the NBPC. Senator Cruzâ€™s spokesperson, Catherine Frazier, responded to Breitbart Texas media inquiry on this matter and she felt that Senator Cruz had done a lot to fight for border security : Cruz had a positive and informative meeting and border tour in Laredo this week. No one has been a greater advocate for giving border agents the resources they need to secure our border.
