As Maddow put it: Oh, right, so much for extreme vetting, right?   The whole justification, the whole explanation from this administration for the Muslim ban was to stop people coming into this country, at least for a while, right?   At least for a while, it’s a temporary travel ban so we can get the extreme vetting, In other words, Maddow seems to be saying, if we’re operating from ignorance, as to who’s a potential threat, then the best thing to do is operate from even more ignorance.
