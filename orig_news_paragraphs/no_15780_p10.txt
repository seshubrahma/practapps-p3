The news outlet provided the US government agency with a copy of the document, according to the complaint. After examining the document, it was determined the pages of the intelligence reporting appeared to be folded or creased, "suggesting they had been printed and   out of a secured space," according to the criminal complaint. An internal audit revealed Winner was one of six people who printed the document but the only one who had email contact with the news outlet, according to the complaint. Prosecutors said when confronted with the allegations, Winner admitted to leaking the classified document intentionally    and she was arrested Saturday in Augusta.
