Beware also the   page truism that black male unemployment is due to factory jobs moving overseas. The same men’s unemployment rates went down and stayed down even in cities where factory jobs did not disappear in this way.   Read classic works on inner city lives such as sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh’s "Gang Leader for a Day" or Alice Goffman’s "On the Run," and any sense that men in these communities were all but barred from legal work falls to pieces.
