As McAdams told me this week, Trump "has no respect for, or interest in, expertise of any kind, writing it off as weakness and the providence of elites. " This is the mindset that led Trump to put some agencies    like the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy and the Department of Education    under the control of people who either knew little of what these organizations did or, in some cases, are hostile to their missions.    Among Trumpâ€™s first appointees, Spicer may have possessed the greatest relevant expertise combined with the smallest measure of dominance behavior.
