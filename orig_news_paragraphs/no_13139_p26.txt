Apparently, the Times leaked information about the    interview to the   BuzzFeed, who in turn, without hearing the audio, launched a   attack against Trump, accusing him of saying one thing to the Times and another to the voters regarding immigration. BuzzFeed then demanded Trump prove heâ€™s not a communist liar. There is nothing more sacred in journalism than an    situation. This is supposed to be inviolable.
