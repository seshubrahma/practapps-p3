Mrs. Clinton’s campaign expects at least 40 percent of votes in battleground states to be cast early. " We actually think that states like Nevada, North Carolina and Florida could be decided before Election Day," said Robby Mook, the campaign manager. Democrats say that despite Mrs. Clinton’s solid performance in the first two debates, she will still attend her usual "debate camp" and grueling preparation sessions with aides in Westchester, N. Y. and Las Vegas.
