Muir challenges Christie about whether Kasich’s record on jobs is stronger than Christie’s. He says Kasich has been great on jobs in Ohio. But he says Kasich is using "old statistics" and New Jersey has cut spending and fewer employees while Kasich has a bigger government and more employees in Ohio. He asks veterans who are waiting for health care whether Obama knows what he is doing in running the government.
