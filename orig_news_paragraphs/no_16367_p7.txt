The idea of writing such a letter had been discussed by GOP national security officials for a while, but gained momentum when Trump called on Russia to share Clinton emails it potentially hacked and when he took a position many saw as legitimizing Russia’s claim to Ukraine’s Crimea region.   " We thought it was important to make the point that even for longtime Clinton critics, Trump poses too big a risk to   and   national security," one person involved with the letter said.   It was drafted by John Bellinger, a former State Department legal adviser to   of State Condoleezza Rice, with edits from Bob Blackwill, a former George H. W. Bush White House adviser, and Eliot Cohen, also a former adviser to Rice.
