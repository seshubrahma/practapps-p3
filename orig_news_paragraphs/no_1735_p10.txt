Mr. Odgaard’s daughter from his first marriage disavowed her father ’s actions on Facebook, and his gay second cousin will not speak to him. Even their own Mennonite congregation put out a statement saying that while the denomination opposes gay marriage, "not every congregation" or Mennonite does. Mrs. Odgaard, 64, the daughter of a Mennonite minister, was devastated.
