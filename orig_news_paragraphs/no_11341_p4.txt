A total of 69, 933  refugees were resettled for the entire Fiscal Year 2015 that ended on September 30, 2015. During the first week of September, the Obama administration brought in a total of 4, 371 refugees from all countries. Should it continue that pace for the three remaining weeks of the fiscal year, the final number of refugees resettled in the United States during Fiscal Year 2016 will end up around 89, 000, approximately 20, 000 more than in Fiscal Year 2015, and 4, 000 greater than the 85, 000 ceiling it proposed to Congress. (The 85, 000 ceiling included 79, 000 allocated by specific regions of the world and included a 6, 000 "reserve" for special circumstances.)
