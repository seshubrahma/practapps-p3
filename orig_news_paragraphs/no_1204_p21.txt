F. R. A. is concerned that two derailments in the last two weeks at New Yorkâ€™s Penn Station have caused minor passenger injuries and severe service disruptions on the Northeast Corridor," Mr. Willis said in a statement. In June, federal officials began a safety investigation of New Jersey Transit. Then in September, a train crashed into Hoboken Terminal, killing a woman and injuring more than 100 people. The station is still being repaired, adding to the problems on Tuesday by making it more difficult for commuters to get through the building.
