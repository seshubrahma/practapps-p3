It was a start, I guess. But it fell short of the   "knock it off" to Mr. Trump that these times demand, at least when it comes to calling true journalism false or calling journalists dishonest enemies. The office of Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, declined to engage with me on Saturday when I asked for a comment on whether Mr. Ryan was comfortable with what I called Mr. Trumpâ€™s attempt to delegitimize the fourth estate. His office said it disputed the premise of the question.
