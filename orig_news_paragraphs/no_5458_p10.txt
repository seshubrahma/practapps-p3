The   IFCN recently drafted a code of five principles for news websites to accept, and Facebook announced it will work with "  fact checking organizations" that are signatories to the code of principles. Facebook says that if the "fact checking organizations" determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, "there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. "
