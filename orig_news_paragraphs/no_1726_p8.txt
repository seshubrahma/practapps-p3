In an interview last month with The Associated Press, the director of the scientific research department of North Korea’s National Aerospace Development Administration, Hyon Kwang Il, said a moonshot was the nation’s goal. " Even though the U. S. and its allies try to block our space development, our aerospace scientists will conquer space and definitely plant the flag of the D. P. R. K. on the moon," he said, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Whatever the goal, the most important aspect of the new North Korean engine is that its design appears to be indigenous, rather than a knockoff of   Soviet missiles.
