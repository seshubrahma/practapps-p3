NBC News’ Megyn Kelly can’t get any love.   On Saturday, journalist Yashar Ali obtained an unedited video of Kelly’s interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the   HuffPost and promptly eviscerated the "nervous" Kelly for asking Putin "softball" questions. He wrote that the unedited footage "shows a nervous Kelly who asked the authoritarian leader softball questions and failed to hold him accountable on key topics. " "Most troubling, Kelly devoted precious time in her short interview to a question that led one former CIA Russia analyst to say that it sounded as if Putin had written the question himself," he continues.
