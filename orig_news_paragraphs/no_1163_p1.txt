Bossert, the president’s homeland security adviser. The general invited Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bossert to accompany him "to receive an update on the status of the   campaign in Iraq and Syria," Captain Hicks said. Mr. Kushner is "traveling on behalf of the president to express the president’s support and commitment to the government of Iraq and U. S. personnel currently engaged in the campaign" against the Islamic State, Captain Hicks added.
