The Citizens United gift was the largest donation. The foundation gave $50, 000 each to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in West Palm Beach, and to the private school his son Barron attends. Four other charities  —    the Police Athletic League, two health organizations and the   League  —   received about $100, 000 between them, and a collection of other groups received smaller grants totaling about $200, 000.
