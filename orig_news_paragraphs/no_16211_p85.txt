Earlier this year, the Interior Department instituted a pause on issuing new coal leases on public lands while it reviews the federal coal program. Coal miners have lost jobs, though not as many as Capito cited. According to the Mine Safety  Health Administration, a government agency thatâ€™s part of the Department of Labor, there were 127, 977 individuals (employees and contractors) working in coal mining in the first quarter of 2011.   In the first quarter of 2016, that number has fallen to 78, 359.
