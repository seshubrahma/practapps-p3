Last February, after Beck’s endorsed candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) lost the Nevada primary to Trump, Beck launched into an angry rant on his radio show calling Trump supporters "Brownshirts" and comparing Bannon, a former Surface Warfare Officer in the U. S. Navy, to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. But Beck’s animus towards Bannon took an extreme turn earlier in his Wednesday broadcast when he suggested that Bannon dabbles in the "Dark Web" for possible illegal activities, up to and including hiring assassins. As Breitbart’s Ezra Dulis noted, Beck’s fallacious allegation was likely in reference to a Bloomberg profile of Bannon that described the research project conducted by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) into the Clinton Foundation foreign donations scandal   —   research which became the basis for Peter Schweizer’s New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash.
