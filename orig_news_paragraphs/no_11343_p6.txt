I think it makes some positive steps with regard to legal immigration, but I don’t think it goes nearly far enough  …      if we want to improve   innovation in my view we should not do so by half measures. We should do so with a significant step that materially improves the status quo, and for that reason I’ve introduced this amendment to increase the cap by five hundred percent. As such, Cruz offered an amendment to double green cards —  which would have resulted in an explosion of   immigration from   nations.
