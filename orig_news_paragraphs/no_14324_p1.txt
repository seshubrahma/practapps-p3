Trump has only been in office for 17 days, but his Justice Department is already embroiled in a   legal battle that could affect hundreds of thousands of people and the direction of his presidency. Attorneys general for Washington and Minnesota, which challenged the executive order, say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had "unleashed chaos" by signing the order. Trump, who rode a wave of populist anger into the White House, now has to wait for the Ninth Circuit panel. The San   court has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation to the point where some Republican lawmakers have even pushed to split it up in an effort to limit its impact.
