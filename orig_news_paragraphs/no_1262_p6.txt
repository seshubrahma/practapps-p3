Yasmine Mashaan, a pharmacy technician from the town of Muhassan in eastern Syria who lost several brothers to the conflict, said the strike was unlikely to change much for her and her family. And she doubts Mr. Trumpâ€™s motivations. " It would be great if he continued this in the direction of saving more civilians or establishing a safe zone, but after his racist speeches and   policy, I think the strike is more for popularity," said Ms. Mashaan, who is now in Germany after fleeing there with her family.
