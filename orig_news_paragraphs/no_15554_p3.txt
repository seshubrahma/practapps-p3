Trump’s comments contained a number of mischaracterizations of   or assertions that are not backed up by any statistics.

It was also entirely unclear which cities and town Trump meant were "literally taken over" by   which remains a small fraction of the overall gang problem in the US, per available statistics. Neither the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement nor the White House responded to a request for clarification.
