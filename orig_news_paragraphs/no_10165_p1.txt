Ben Carson has 9 percent, while John Kasich has 7 percent. The poll, conducted by Iowa’s Ann Selzer, was conducted after the GOP debate last Saturday. The poll doesn’t show any drop in support for Trump following his criticism of former President George W. Bush over the Iraq War. A slight majority of voters say their minds are made up on which candidate to support, while 43 percent say they could still change their minds.
