Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who said "goodbye" to diplomacy with the United States last year, is now urging his American counterparts to work with Manila in combating terrorism and other mutual threats. [The request for cooperation, which comes soon after the U. S. bombed the Russia —   and   Syrian regime, marks a departure from the   sentiment Duterte repeatedly expressed in response to former President Barack Obama ’s criticism of the Philippines’ bloody war on drugs.   President Duterte repeatedly claimed he had "realigned" himself ideologically with Russia and China after he claimed to end the Philippines’ relationship with the United States.
