A parade of surrogates for Donald J. Trump backed away on Sunday from a primary element of his immigration policy, further muddying an issue on which Mr. Trump himself sowed confusion in recent days. Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trumpâ€™s running mate on the Republican presidential ticket, would not affirm that their administration would expel the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally, a   stance that helped Mr. Trump vanquish opponents in the primary race. Asked if Mr. Trump still sought a "deportation force," which he called for last year, Mr. Pence said Mr. Trump was speaking of "a mechanism, not a policy. "
