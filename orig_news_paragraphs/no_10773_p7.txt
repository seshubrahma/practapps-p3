Mansour  —   deals "precisely" with America’s spiritual issues: What’s happened is, as these empires rise, they remove God as their anchor. They let men determine what’s right , what’s wrong, what’s good, what’s evil, and how much your life is worth. The documentary looks at a historical account, going all the way back thousands of years, and it’s always the same: Once you remove God, then the carnage starts.
