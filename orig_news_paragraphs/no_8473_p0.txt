Liberal news outlet BuzzFeed has announced that it will end its deal with the Republican National Committee over the party’s nomination of Donald Trump as its presidential candidate. [Employees were reportedly told of the news by the company’s CEO, Jonah Peretti, who said that Trump’s policies would make it impossible for company’s Muslim employees to do their jobs if they could not travel to the US.   " Earlier today, BuzzFeed informed the RNC that we would not accept Trump for President ads and that we would be terminating our agreement with them," he said.
