Recent public polling in Pennsylvania shows a   race between Hillary Clinton and Donal Trump. Clinton maintains a   edge in the RealClearPolitics average of polls, largely because of a   NBC survey that showed her leading Trump by 15 points. That NBC survey is wildly divergent from other polling and is likely an outlier. Beyond its bounty of 20 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is critical this election for another reason.
