Mark Urban, chairman of the Bayonne Zoning Board who voted against the project, said Saturday he’d been advised by his attorney not to comment. But in the minutes of the board’s March 6 meeting, Urban said he didn’t think there was enough parking in the area to accommodate the mosque. Given that and concerns over general congestion, he said he couldn’t agree to support the application. Zoning Commissioner Edouardo Ferrante also voted no, saying the project "is just too much for this small community," according to the minutes.
