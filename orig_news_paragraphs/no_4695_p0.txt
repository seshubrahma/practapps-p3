Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for "free and fair" trade deals in Asia, echoing Donald Trumpâ€™s promise to America when he campaigned against the   Partnership (TPP). [Abe, of course, was an active supporter of the deal drafted by former President Obama, but he signaled a different approach during his visit.   "Free and fair common set of rules should be created for the free trade in the region," Abe said, according to a translator during a press conference at the White House with Trump on Friday. The prime minister appeared optimistic that he could discuss the possibility of a bilateral trade deal with Trump.
