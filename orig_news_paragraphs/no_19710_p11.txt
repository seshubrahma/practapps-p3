According to the governor’s office, the program would be funded through the state’s   program —  which provides close to $1 billion in grants to students —  federal grants, and other state funds. But whether state lawmakers, who have resisted earlier   plans, are willing to endorse the idea remains to be seen. And while Cuomo has supported state Dream Act proposals, which would open up such funding to undocumented students who graduate from high schools in New York, they are currently barred from receiving these grants, meaning undocumented students likely would not be covered by the   proposal.
