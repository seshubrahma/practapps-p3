When he did make his first outing, he traveled just outside Washington to the course at Joint Base Andrews (which, back then, was still called Andrews Air Force Base). Trump hasn’t ventured to that course, but he has traveled to his own golf facility in Sterling, Virginia, just a   drive from the White House. He ’s also played at the two courses he owns near his    estate in Florida.
