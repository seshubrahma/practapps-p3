[The leftist view of the Second Amendment is that its only meaning is that the federal government cannot stop state governments from arming their National Guard (i. e. "militia") units with guns.] So declarations from Donald Trump and Mike Pence that gun rights are in danger is no longer hypothetical. It is now certain. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, the Second Amendment can be effectively erased from the U. S. Constitution.
