On the page, anyway, Mr. Trump was even capable of humility, describing himself as a scribe of "little talent" in a 1985 note to Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, then the publisher of The Times. (Mr. Trump had an agenda: to complain about a reporter he disliked.) Mr. Trump traces his epistolary habits to his attempt to win over Franklin M. Jarman, who controlled a Manhattan department store that Mr. Trump wanted to buy in the 1970s to make way for Trump Tower. Mr. Jarman rarely replied to Mr. Trumpâ€™s letters, but he had, in fact, read them, Mr. Trump wrote in his book "The Art of the Deal," laying the groundwork for an agreement.
