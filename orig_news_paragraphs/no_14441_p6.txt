Vice President Mike Pence    who was pushed into the center of the story after he defended Flynn on TV one month ago    did not respond to shouted questions as he left the Capitol Tuesday. Pence has yet to say how he feels about Flynn’s actions.   Pence met with Senate Republicans Tuesday at the Capitol for their weekly lunch and discussed Flynn’s resignation, although senators in attendance said he did not discuss his personal feelings.   Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who used to serve with Pence in the House of Representatives, said that Pence thanked Flynn for his service and explained that "when discrepancies arose, they realized they had to do something."
