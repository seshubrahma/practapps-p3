During the discussion, Ulukaya boasted about how he has "11 different nationalities [represented] in Chobani factories" and how he had to hire "11 different translators into the factory" because the local company employees couldn’t communicate with one another. " Every summer, we do our Chobani picnic and, you should see, it’s [like the] United Nations in there," Ulukaya proudly declared about his U. S.  company. Ulukaya explained that Syrian refugees "bring flavors to the community just like in  …     Twin Falls, [Idaho]" where Ulukaya’s yogurt factory is based.
