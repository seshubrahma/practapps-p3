On Thursday, the North Korean military called the joint exercise a drill for "nuclear war" and vowed to take unspecified strong measures. The next day, the Northâ€™s main   newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, hinted at more missile tests, saying, "New strategic weapons of our own style will soar into the sky. "
