The real dream would be to arrive at a place where we can watch a film and argue about who’s in it instead of who isn’t. And can I also say, Manohla, that I really liked that moment with the tour group? If they’d been bused in against their will for our entertainment, I’d object. But those sights are, presumably, a version of what they paid that tour company to show them: the world through Jennifer Aniston’s sunglasses.
