On the day after the initial ban, Azadeh Shahshahani, a legal and advocacy director for Project South, an   social justice organization that works with immigrant and Muslim communities in the southeast, recalled getting roughly "a message a minute" on Facebook, on her voicemail and inbox.   Lawyers and activists wanted to help. Others passed along stories of immigrants being detained. She relayed one story to Owings, the Atlanta attorney.
