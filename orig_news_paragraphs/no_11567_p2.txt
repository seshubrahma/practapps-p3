Chaos has descended upon Iowa’s capital city hours before the final 2016 GOP presidential primary debate before Iowans head to the caucuses on Monday —  which will be moderated by the Fox News Channel.   Because of the network’s antics aimed at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, Trump has decided to abandon the network’s debate. Every   narrative from the mainstream media has been destructed as Trump dukes it out with Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) another   force who is set to appear in the debate. And every single one of the   GOP presidential candidates, from Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) to his former mentor Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, can’t get anywhere close to   Trump’s or   Cruz’s level of support.
