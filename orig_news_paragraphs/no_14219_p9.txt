NATO doesn’t have his own troops but relies on contributions of forces from its member countries.   At NATO’s core is Article 5 which states an attack on one member is an attack on all NATO allies.   The collective defense principle was to protect Western European nations against the Soviet Union.   But when the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO’s new tasks range from being a bulwark against   in Afghanistan to fighting human trafficking and intercepting refugees in the Mediterranean.
