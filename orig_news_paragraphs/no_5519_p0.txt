  Donald Trump asserted that cyber attacks had "absolutely no effect" on the results of the election, after he received an intelligence briefing at Trump Tower on Friday. ["While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines," Trump said in a statement sent to reporters.   He added that although there were attempts to hack the RNC, they had the proper security defense to ward off the attacks.
