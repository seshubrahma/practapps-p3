, The bomb device in Chelsea was almost identical to those used in the Boston Marathon attacks three years ago. Pressure cookers were used to house the devices shrapnel was added to increase the lethality of the charges, and Christmas lights were used to initiate the explosions, according to law enforcement officials. Terrorist groups have posted these recipes online. Just as is often the case in school shootings, jihadist terrorists also study previous attacks and itâ€™s interesting to note the close match between the Boston bombs and the device used in Chelsea.
