Though Kushner and Christie work together on the transition team, sources describe to CNN their relationship as awkward but polite, thanks to Christie putting Kushner’s father in prison a decade ago. The elder Kushner, Charles, was arrested in 2004 and charged with federal crimes, including tax evasion, witness tampering and campaign finance violations. He struck a plea deal and served two years in prison. Christie failed to succeed in his own quest to be president, but he proved to be a formidable adversary, most notably when he ripped into Marco Rubio at a debate and destroyed the Florida senator’s momentum before the New Hampshire primary.
