The White House maintains that FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe approached White House chief of staff Reince Priebus to discuss the misleading story in The New York Times, that he described as "bulls**t. " That meeting occurred on February 15, after the New York Times published the story. Priebus asked McCabe if they would correct the record, which cited sources claiming the existence of an FBI investigation into "repeated contacts" between Trump aides and Russian intelligence.
