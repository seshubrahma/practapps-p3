The Federal Railroad Administration is investigating both accidents and has not identified the causes, said Marc Willis, a spokesman for the agency. Federal officials were talking to Amtrak and New Jersey Transit about how to ensure safety and reduce the likelihood of future disruptions, he said. " F. R. A. is concerned that two derailments in the last two weeks at New Yorkâ€™s Penn Station have caused minor passenger injuries and severe service disruptions on the Northeast Corridor," Mr. Willis said in a statement.
