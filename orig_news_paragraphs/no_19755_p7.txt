Democrats are accusing Republicans of trying to rush Trump’s Cabinet into office without proper vetting, particularly in the case of the wealthy executives who have slim public records and a greater potential for conflicts of interest. Just three of the nominees have completed financial disclosure forms and signed ethics agreements —  traditionally a prerequisite for confirmation hearings. Democrats are also upset that Republicans have scheduled six hearings for a single day, Wednesday they believe it’s an attempt to dilute media coverage of the hearings and make it easier for the nominees to avoid a major controversy. Late last week, the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to senators that the Republican hearing schedule was "of great concern" and was causing "undue pressure" for the relatively small federal agency responsible for processing presidential appointees and nominees.
