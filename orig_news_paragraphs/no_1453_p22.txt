__ 8. In Baltimore, protesters chanted "Freddie Gray should be here with us today" after a police officer was acquitted of all charges in Mr. Grayâ€™s death. The officer, Caesar Goodson, above, drove the van in which Mr. Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury. The judge said prosecutors had not proved that Mr. Goodson had given or intended to give Mr. Gray a "rough ride," making it the third trial in the case to end without a conviction.
