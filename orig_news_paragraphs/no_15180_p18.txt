I am in touch with the US embassy and the ambassador said no, there was nothing of such nature. I can tell you to ignore any call or advice to reconsider travelling to the US because there is no basis for that. "  The US embassy in Abuja released its own statement supporting Onyeamaâ€™s position, affirming that the travel ban did not apply to Nigerians with valid visas or other US government authorization, and urging them to travel as normal.    Beyond Nigeria  Africans of other nationalities are also facing new difficulties with US immigration.
