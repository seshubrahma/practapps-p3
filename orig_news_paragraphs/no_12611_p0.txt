Sorry, I was on Twitter. I felt it was necessary to dispel the   myth, adored by #NeverTrumpers, that somehow attacking Trump relentlessly does not aid Hillary Clinton, and that they are not choosing Hillary Clinton by choosing to be NeverTrump. All choices have consequences. By supporting Trump, I am responsible for the consequences of a Trump victory  â€”   and those consequences could indeed be dire.
