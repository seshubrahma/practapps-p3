" It’s so easy to make a mistake in this," said Robert Shrum, a Democratic strategist on several past campaigns, including John Kerry’s bid in 2004, when John Edwards and Richard A. Gephardt were finalists for vice president. " Choosing Edwards was a mistake because Dick could have helped us in Ohio in a way that Edwards could not, and Dick would have done better in the   debate," Mr. Shrum said, referring to Mr. Kerry’s narrow loss in that state.
