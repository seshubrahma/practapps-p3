"The Unhappy Identity," about French multiculturalism and its discontents, started a national conversation in 2013, while "The Time Has Come to Tell What I Have Seen," a 2015 political memoir by the politician and writer Philippe de Villiers thatâ€™s heavy on concern about decay, has been a best seller. The   magazine Valeurs Actuelles, which publishes frequent warnings about the decline of France and the threat of Islamic terrorism, saw its combined print and digital circulation rise to 119, 000 copies last year from 86, 000 in 2011, according to figures provided by the magazine. The decline boom seems to manifest itself in books and intellectual debate more than in popular culture, although some French television shows have waded into the murky waters. Recent seasons of "Engrenages," or "Spiral," a dark police drama, paint a bleak picture.
