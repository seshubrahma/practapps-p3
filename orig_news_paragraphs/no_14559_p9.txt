There are already more than 542, 000 cases pending in the backlogged US immigration courts    a major factor in previous US policies to release individuals pending court dates that could be years in the future.   The new DHS guidance orders the agencies to "surge immigration judges and asylum officers" to try to cut back on some of the backlog, but itâ€™s unclear how that will be done. DHS will explore video conferencing systems to make more judges available across the country in any underserved areas as well. Hiring immigration judges will involve the Justice Department, which runs the US immigration courts.
