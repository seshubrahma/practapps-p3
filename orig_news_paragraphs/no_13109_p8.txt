It should be noted that none of these potential GOP rivals have indicated an interest, at least publicly, against running in a primary election against the incumbent senator. PPP also released information showing that Texas Governor Greg Abbott remains the most popular Republican in Texas. The polling data showed that Abbott would soundly defeat either Castro or Davis if they challenged him in 2018. Abbott would win by 29 and 25 points respectively, the poll stated.
