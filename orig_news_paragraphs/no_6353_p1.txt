In 2017, African migrants are coming by the hundreds daily, with an estimated 19, 000 Haitians and Africans arriving in 2016 alone. Reuters reports that African migrants are difficult to detain or deport by Mexican officials, as the country does not have diplomatic ties with some African nations. Previous Breitbart Texas reporting found that Mexican officials actively aid African migrants in their journey north. International Organization for Migration in Tapachula director Claudette Walls says the influx is due to economic hardships in Brazil and an international migrant crisis, in addition to Trumpâ€™s November victory.
