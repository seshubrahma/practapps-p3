America launched Operation Linebacker II, the   "Christmas Bombing," from December 18 to December 29, 1972. It was the largest aerial bombardment since World War Two, and crucially, it included many previously   targets in Hanoi and Haiphong. So finally, after more than a decade of fighting, the North Vietnamese felt such military pressure that they had to reach a deal. Yes, they had, in effect, been bombed into submission, and it must have been galling to the North Vietnamese that their "friends" in China and the USSR were standing by and watching, doing nothing.
