At the core of those who oppose the new fiduciary rules is a basic belief: People ought to bear more responsibility for monitoring their finances and lives. The fiduciary standard, its critics claim, does a disservice to the nation by placing the burden of financial accountability on advisers, rather than on us, the people who should be paying attention to what occurs with our bank accounts. We should be expected to scrutinize the advice we receive, these critics say, rather than accept it unthinkingly. A fiduciary protection enfeebles us by guaranteeing weâ€™ll receive only good advice.
