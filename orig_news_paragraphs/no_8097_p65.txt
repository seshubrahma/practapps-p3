On CNN, Rubio, sounding like a career politician, doesn’t give a   answer when asked if his advisers have been pitching the Trump campaign for him to be Trump’s running mate. When asked repeatedly whether he will vote for Trump, Rubio says he doesn’t want Clinton to be president. He says he signed a pledge to support the GOP nominee and intends to do that. He says he won’t waste his vote and won’t be voting for Clinton.
