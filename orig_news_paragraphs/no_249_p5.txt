Mr. Valls came in second out of seven candidates in a primary of   parties on Sunday. With about 31 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Valls trailed the top   Benoît Hamon, a former education minister in Mr. Hollande’s government, who took about 36 percent of the votes. More worrisome for the left was that turnout was roughly 50 percent lower than it was in 2011, when the the   parties last held a primary. Few analysts believe that any of the Socialists have a real shot at retaining the presidency in the April general election.
