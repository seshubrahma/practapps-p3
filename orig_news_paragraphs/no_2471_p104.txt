As Mr. Bannon became a steadily more obvious supporter of Mr. Trump, some Breitbart editors and reporters thought he was turning a news site into a propaganda platform   —   though other staff members approved. Mr. Shapiro was the most outspoken critic, saying that Mr. Bannon had "betrayed" Mr. Breitbart’s mission of "fighting the bullies. " "In my opinion, Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out Andrew’s mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump," Mr. Shapiro wrote in a statement when he quit Breitbart in March in support of Michelle Fields, a Breitbart reporter who had been roughly grabbed by Corey Lewandowski, then Mr. Trump’s campaign manager.
