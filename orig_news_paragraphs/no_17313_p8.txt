Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: Like Trump, Perry is   on climate questions. He is a supporter of the fossil fuel industry and pledged during his brief 2016 campaign to revive construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, but during his time as governor also invested in renewable energy projects. Perry is no fan of the department he would run.
