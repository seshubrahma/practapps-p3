IS has advocated for   jihadis and extremists to conduct attacks in their home countries. In his communications with Hussein, the Islamic State recruiter encouraged the Eritrean immigrant —  according to the Justice Department —  "to plan and execute a violent attack within the United States. " " Abdulkader communicated with Hussein and the CHS [confidential human source] about a plan to kill an identified military employee on account of his position with the U. S. government," the Justice Department said in a press release.
