Some are mounting familiar works, from "Coriolanus" to "All the Way," thinking that their themes will resonate especially strongly this fall others are focusing on new shows. Here are some examples: 45 PLAYS FOR 45 PRESIDENTS At the Merrimack Repertory Theatre in Lowell, Mass. An evening of   plays, one for every president, followed by an audience vote on whether it would like to see another two minutes about Donald J. Trump or about Hillary Clinton.
