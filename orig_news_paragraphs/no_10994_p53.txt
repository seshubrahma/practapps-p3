Kasich says George Washington because he didnâ€™t want to be King even though he could have been president forever. Kasich mentions that he left government for ten years after balancing the budget and reforming welfare. He says he learned a lot about the private sector in those ten years, and that has made him a much more effective governor. Kasich says Washington was also a "compassionate man" and the   the mentally ill, and the working poor need to have more opportunities.
