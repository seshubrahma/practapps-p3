Tillerson also emphasized the need for "trilateral cooperation" with an increasingly unstable South Korea, which just impeached   president Park   and is set to elect leftist rival Moon   in a special May presidential election. " Trilateral cooperation allows our three nations to coordinate actions on major regional and global problems, and more effectively counter the threats posed by North Korea," Tillerson said. President Donald Trump has personally emphasized the need for strengthening bilateral ties and rejected the use of multilateral talks as a diplomatic device.
