Barack Obama is set to meet with top Democrats next week to discuss plans to block the incoming Trump administration’s plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, POLITICO has revealed. [The meeting, which will involve both House and Senate Democrats, is scheduled for 9:30 am on Wednesday on Capitol Hill and is expected to last one hour.   Throughout the presidential campaign,   Donald Trump repeatedly claimed he would repeal and replace Obamacare, although has since confirmed that he would like to maintain some aspects of the program. Republicans, who will retain a majority in both the House and Senate, are expected to vote to repeal the healthcare law in the very early stages of Trump’s presidency, although they have yet to outline a replacement plan.
