I am upset that the effeminization of men has led to the demonization of women. Please hug me. I am upset that, for years, no one has fought for the celebration of Christmas in the public square, yet many rant how everyone’s religious freedom except is protected, except for Christians’ and Jews’. I am upset that instead of letting the political process take its natural course, we see the mafia of the political class converge on Donald Trump and use any means necessary to assassinate him.
