Seweid claimed in a Facebook post that Trump supporters yelled "Look, it’s a fucking terrorist," and "Get the hell out of the country" and "You don’t belong here!" Seweid also blamed New York City residents for the phony attack, falsely claiming "It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs. " When Seweid alleged that the Trump supporter attack happened, the mainstream media, including the New York Daily News and Buzzfeed, jumped on the story to report it as fact.
