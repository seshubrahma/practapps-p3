In public, Clinton became a vocal champion of the Indian corporation, repeatedly defending the company’s   worker business model. Howard University Professor Ron Hira observed that during the   period   Tata imported an incredible 27, 193   guest workers and likely more than 10, 000   workers. That is tens of thousands of "jobs that American workers should have been hired for or in many cases were already doing   …     and got replaced" by   foreign labor, Hira told Breitbart News. Interestingly, Tata has given tens of thousands of dollars to the Clinton Foundation.
