A Prince spokesman said in a statement that the meeting "had nothing to do with President Trump" but did not explain the purpose of the meeting. Both the White House and a diplomatic source tell CNN that the administration was not involved in arranging the meeting. If Trump officials knew of or sanctioned Prince’s meeting, that raises new questions about Trump’s agenda for Russia and about any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. A push to separate Russia from its Middle East ally might require lifting or easing sanctions against Russia, which would face strong opposition from Europe and Congress, where there is strong bipartisan support for sanctions.
