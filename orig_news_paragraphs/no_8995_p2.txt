In August 2012, the magazine American Conservative did an article on the film Occupy Unmasked. That film was directed by Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon and featured people like Andrew Breitbart, Brandon Darby, and myself exposing the Occupy Wall Street movement for what it was   —   a socialist,   activist movement. We pointed out that Occupy was the latest incarnation of the     protest movements that dates back to the 1960s’ Students for a Democratic Society and Black Panthers.
