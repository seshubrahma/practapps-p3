Two Democrats briefed on the invitation to Mrs. Warren, however, cautioned that Mrs. Clinton had not yet made a decision about a running mate and that asking Ms. Warren to take the stage on the first night did not preclude her from being tapped as the   nominee. Ms. Warren and other individuals who received invitations on Tuesday to address the Philadelphia convention were told that their speaking times were subject to change depending on who was selected for vice president, according to the two Democrats, one with ties to Mrs. Clinton and the other to Ms. Warren, who both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss convention planning. But even Ms. Warren’s allies are now increasingly skeptical that she will join the ticket as the famously cautious Mrs. Clinton enjoys a steady lead in the polls over Donald J. Trump and is eyeing Democrats who are less dynamic than Ms. Warren but would not overshadow her on the campaign trail or in the White House. Mrs. Clinton’s meetings with the remaining   candidates are continuing: She has met with or is expected to meet soon with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey Representative Xavier Becerra of California Julian Castro and Tom Perez, who both serve in President Obama’s cabinet and James G. Stavridis, a retired   Navy admiral, at her Washington home.
