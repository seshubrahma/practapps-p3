Since 2010, Republican candidates at the state level have outraised their Democratic counterparts by more than $700 million, according to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics. In that same period, the Republican Governors Association outraised its Democratic counterpart by a nearly    margin and, at the state legislative level, Democrats were outraised nearly    before we even take into account independent expenditures, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. And as Republicans have gained control at the state level, theyâ€™ve used their power to enact a massive phalanx of legal voter suppression    strict voter ID laws, cutbacks in early voting, new registration requirements and other regulations    aimed at depressing voters in core Democratic constituencies.   According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 14 states added restrictive voting laws between the 2012 and 2016 elections.
