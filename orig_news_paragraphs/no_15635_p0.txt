 (CNN) On the eve of Montana’s special House election, Republican nominee Greg Gianforte got into a physical altercation with a reporter from The Guardian newspaper    an incredibly odd and potentially damaging   swerve in a race that has, of late, attracted considerable national attention and money. In audio posted by the Guardian, reporter Ben Jacobs can be heard asking Gianforte a question about health care    in the wake of the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis released Wednesday afternoon. Gianforte deflects the question.
