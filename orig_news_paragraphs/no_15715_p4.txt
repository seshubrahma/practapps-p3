That appears less likely now that Mueller and Comey have discussed the limits of his testimony. Since his firing last month, dramatic accounts have emerged in the New York Times, CNN, and elsewhere about the tense confrontations with Trump that Comey memorialized in memos afterward.

The source said that Comey is expected to stand by those accounts in his testimony.
