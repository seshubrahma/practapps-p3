Mr. Kushner is married to Mr. Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka. She converted to Judaism before their wedding, and they are raising their children Jewish. Though he has no political experience and no official role in the campaign, Mr. Kushner  has emerged in recent months as one of Mr. Trump’s most influential advisers, even as the Trump campaign has been embraced by   and other hate groups. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Kushner have denounced the hate messages, many of which have been directed at Jewish journalists who have written about the campaign.
