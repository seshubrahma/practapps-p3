KCNA said the test showed North Korea "has all powerful means for retaliatory strike" should Washington take any military action to stop its nuclear weapons program. Tensions have rapidly escalated on the Korean Peninsula since US President Donald Trump declared in early April he would be prepared to act "unilaterally" against Pyongyang    and North Korea has engaged in a series of military drills and test launches. China, North Korea’s longtime ally, has called on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear program while calling on the US to stop military drills and deployments in the region, which North Korea sees as threatening its security. Russian President Vladimir Putin weighed in after Sunday’s missile test, saying that while Moscow did not support Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions, "intimidating (North Korea) is unacceptable."
