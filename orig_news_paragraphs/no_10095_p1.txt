In the wake of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom this week, many wondered if the same sentiments that drove voters to leave the UK, such as voter unease about the economic and cultural effects of globalization, were at work in the U. S. presidential election, too. Similar sentiments underpin Donald Trumpâ€™s general election vote, though there is not yet enough for him to surpass Clinton. Trump is also competitive in large part because of partisanship, as   file Republicans continue to get behind him, even as Republican leaders have been more lukewarm toward the way Trump is running his campaign. About   of voters in these states feel the U. S. has done too much in trying to become part of the global economy too much to make changes to its culture and values, and encouraged too much diversity of people from different backgrounds.
