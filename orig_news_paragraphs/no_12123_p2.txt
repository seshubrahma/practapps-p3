A new   poll out on Wednesday has Trump back within three points of Clinton, which is essentially a tie because it’s inside the survey ’s 4. 1 percent margin of error. That poll, conducted with 1, 300 general population respondents —  from whom registered voters were culled —  from Aug. 19 to Aug. 23, found Trump at 44 percent and Clinton at 47 percent in a   race. In the   race adding Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, Clinton’s   lead over Trump is still inside the margin of error.
