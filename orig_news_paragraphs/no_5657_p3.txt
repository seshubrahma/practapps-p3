It is interesting to note that 2016 had already broken all prior annual records for background checks by the close of business on November 30. Breitbart News previously reported that there were 24, 767, 514 background checks January 1 through November 30 alone. The   surge broke previous   records by more than a million checks.    Donald Trump’s decision to run as a defender of the Second Amendment seems to have caught the mood of the public  —   at least of consumers in the market for firearms, who were partly driven by concerns that new federal and state restrictions, such as ammunition background checks in California, could limit their ability to own guns and ammunition.
