Trump’s tough talk on trade goes to the core of his appeal. It is also the issue that  may allow him to win a general election against Clinton by attracting   whites and minorities who don’t want to see their jobs shipped overseas. Trump could have used his first minutes of his press conference to talk about trade, American workers and how the GOP can grow the party by championing the issues he has been talking about on the stump. He could have addressed American workers in all communities —    class workers who thought they would have at least the same   lifestyle their parents had, black communities that have been decimated because factories and plants in their communities have closed due to bad trade deals, Americans of Hispanic and Asian descent who are having trouble finding jobs because of illegal immigration, and   Americans of all backgrounds who are worried that cheaper,   foreigners will be brought in to replace them while they are forced to train them.
