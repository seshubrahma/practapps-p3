Of course, I`m talking about the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in 2014, and the Summer Olympics last year in Rio de Janeiro, 2016.

And so, organizers of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics are trying to do their best, in their words, to not repeat those kind of mistakes. But there are certainly challenges that remain, including the fact that Pyeongchang is one of the smaller cities to host these Winter Olympics, and the fact that there are still infrastructure projects that need to be completed.
