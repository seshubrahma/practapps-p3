5:38: Chuck Todd asks how the Rubio campaign can spin a   finish as a "win" with so many   South Carolina endorsements  …     5:25: Sanders top strategist Devine tells Chuck Todd that they will "prove a point" in Nevada that Sanders can potentially win a diverse state like Nevada. Even if Sanders loses narrowly to Clinton, it seems like Sanders is ready to spin that he is a candidate who doesn’t just appeal to   whites. When asked about Sanders’s brothers comments about Bill Clinton, Devine says "Bernie loves his brother very much" but his brother Larry, who has lived in England, does not speak for Bernie or the campaign. Devine says Bernie disagrees with his brother’s characterization of Bill Clinton as a rapist.
