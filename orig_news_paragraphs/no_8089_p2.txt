Trump later told the public that he was going to add names to the list, which led some optimistic conservative legal experts to hope that he would add names such as Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Mike Lee, or former U. S. Solicitor General Paul Clement. This later statement from Trump also led some of his conservative critics to speculate that the presumptive Republican nominee would be adding names that conservatives would oppose, or that if elected to the White House he would ignore his own list, noting that his statement releasing the list said the list was a "guide" to picking a justice, and that he later added he would pick either from that list or other people very similar to those on the list. But Klukowski regarded Trumpâ€™s list as a very positive development that would help unify the Republican Party behind the businessman, telling Bannon: The Supreme Court has always been extremely important, on issues that belong in court such as the Second Amendment, Obamacare, and immigration.
