Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, opened the doors of the vice presidential residence and held a pool party for the children of military families. Pence then tweeted about the event, with April as the Month of the Military Child as her inspiration. She posted several photos of the festivities: With April being the month of the Military child, @VP and I hosted a pool party at the VP Residence for kids of parents deployed. Fun times!
