Trump has not followed through on campaign promises to label China a "currency manipulator" on day one of his presidency or to impose steep tariffs on all Chinese imports. After initially questioning it, he has since endorsed the   "one China" policy, which for decades has governed delicate relations between the United States, China and Taiwan    a   island that Beijing regards as a rebel province that must be reunited with the Chinese mainland, by force if necessary. One of the few areas that Trump still keeps poking China on seems to be Beijingâ€™s inability or unwillingness to rein in its unruly neighbor North Korea, as the Pyongyang regime continues to defy UN Security Council bans with its missile launches and possibly a new nuclear weapon test. Xi has compelling reasons to work with Trump, as the Chinese leader prepares to start his second   term as the head of the ruling Communist Party in the fall.
