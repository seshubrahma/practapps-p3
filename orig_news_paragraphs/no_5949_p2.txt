The report also speculated that the decision could affect the Murdoch family’s pending $14 billion deal to     TV provider Sky, with a decision to sack O’Reilly likely to increase Murdoch’s favorability with media regulators Ofcom. O’Reilly’s primetime show, The O’Reilly Factor, is at its most popular since its conception in 1996, averaging 3. 7 million viewers in its final week before details of the settlement emerged, a 28 percent increase from the previous year, according to Nielsen Research. Over 90 companies dropped advertising on The O’Reilly Factor over the allegations, while a small group of feminist protesters gathered outside the Fox News headquarters in New York calling on the network to fire O’Reilly. Last year, Fox News’ longtime chairman Roger Ailes resigned over claims of sexual harassment against several female staff members, including former host Gretchen Carlson and anchor Megyn Kelly.
