A short ferry ride from downtown Manhattan and New York’s least populated and most conservative borough, Staten Island has become known this year as Trump Country. More than 8 out of 10 Staten Islanders who voted in New York’s GOP primary in April backed Trump, marking almost double the level of support the Queens native received in Manhattan.
