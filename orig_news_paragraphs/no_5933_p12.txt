During the morning National Day of Prayer event, the President described the trip to the faith leaders gathered: Saudi Arabia is the custodian of the two holiest sites in Islam and it is there that we will begin to construct a new foundation of cooperation and support with our muslim allies to combat, extremism, terrorism and violence and to embrace a more just and hopeful future for young muslims in their countries. Our task is not to dictate to others how to live, but to build a coalition of friends and partners who share the goal of fighting terrorism and bringing safety, opportunity, and stability to the war ravaged middle east. Trump is expected to go from the   stint on to an already planned visit to Brussels, Belgium for a meeting with NATO leaders on May 25.
