Bannon at the White House by naming Reince Priebus as chief of staff. On Saturday, Mr. Trump will meet with Mitt Romney in Bedminster, N. J. to discuss, among other things, the top post at the State Department, according to people close to the transition. Last week, he held similar discussions with Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina.
