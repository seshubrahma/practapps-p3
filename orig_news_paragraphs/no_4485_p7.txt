Rice has denied doing anything "untoward" with the intelligence she received, as did Bolton.

The piece also pointed out that names unmasked by Bolton have still never made it out to the public, in contrast with the illegal leaking in February of phone conversations held by former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
