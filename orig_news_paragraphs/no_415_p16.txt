The surgery was a success, but Dr. Prat said Sham should remain under close monitoring, not only because of her face but also because of other health concerns, including her failure to put on weight. Further surgery will be required to correct facial asymmetries as she grows, while her eye prothesis will also need replacement. Sham and her family were granted residency in Spain until late December. They have been housed in a   apartment, a stone’s throw from the Sagrada Família, Barcelona’s emblematic basilica.
