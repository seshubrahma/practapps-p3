WASHINGTON   â€”    The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, set off an intense backlash on Tuesday when he suggested that President Bashar   of Syria was guilty of acts worse than Hitler and asserted that Hitler had not used chemical weapons, ignoring the use of gas chambers at concentration camps during the Holocaust. Mr. Spicer later apologized.
