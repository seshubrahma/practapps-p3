BEIJING   â€”    China signaled on Thursday that it had installed weapons on disputed South China Sea islands and would use them like a "slingshot" to repel threats, compounding tensions with the incoming Trump administration. The Chinese message, in a Defense Ministry statement, suggested that China was further watering down a pledge made by its president, Xi Jinping, to not militarize the islands.
