For Ferguson, a Missouri native, it’ll be a chance to thank his father, Bill    the man who never stopped fighting for him while he spent 10 years behind bars for a crime he didn’t commit. " Being able to do this with my father after all he’s done for me, sacrificing 10 years of his life to prove my innocence    that’s when it became real," said Ferguson.   The   pilgrimage came about last month when a ticket distributor who had heard about his story offered Ferguson an    trip to Sunday’s game.
