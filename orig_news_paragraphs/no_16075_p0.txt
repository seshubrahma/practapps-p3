 (CNN) Ohio Gov. John Kasich declined on Tuesday to urge delegates at the Republican convention to cast their ballots for Donald Trump, instead urging them to follow their "consciences." " They have to weigh their responsibilities against their consciences and then make a decision about what they want to do," Kasich said, according to The Washington Post.
