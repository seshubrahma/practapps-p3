"Jeff Sessions is a former colleague and a friend, but I think it would be best for him  for the country to recuse himself from the DOJ Russia probe," said Sen. Rob Portman,   in a statement. House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, in an interview with MSNBC, said Sessions should recuse himself for "the trust of the American people. " An aide later said McCarthy was only referring to Sessionsâ€™ statement that he should recuse himself if there was a conflict.
