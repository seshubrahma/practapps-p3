In the   realm, Mr. Bharara may be best remembered for his sweeping crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry. The two most notable convictions growing out of a   investigation that began even before he took office were of Raj Rajaratnam, a hedge fund billionaire, and Rajat Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director and McKinsey managing partner who was convicted of passing an inside tip on to Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Bharara also secured a guilty plea against SAC Capital, the hugely successful hedge fund founded by Mr. Cohen. But Mr. Bhararaâ€™s office never was able to file criminal charges against Mr. Cohen, who has gone on to run a large family office called Point72 Asset Management that manages more than $10 billion of his personal fortune.
