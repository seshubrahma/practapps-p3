We are running    this is a   machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).    You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I’m saying "here’s my chief of staff," a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.
