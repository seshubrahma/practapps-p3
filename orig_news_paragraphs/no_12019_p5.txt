Cruzâ€™s key message, according to Kaergard, was that he is the only candidate that can beat Trump and then Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the fall. Cruz also hit on the three key issues of jobs, freedom, and security. In dealing with one protester, Cruz said to be respectful. Texas Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek posted that the protester repeatedly told Cruz to go back to Canada and waved a Trump sign as he was escorted from the venue.
