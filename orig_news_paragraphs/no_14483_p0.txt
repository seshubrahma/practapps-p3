 (CNN) Throughout the 2016 election campaign,   Donald Trump repeatedly promised a new approach to battlefield victory over ISIS, saying he would ask "the generals" to provide a new plan within 30 days of his inauguration.    This week Navy captain and Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis reported the Department of Defense was in the process of conducting the   review, and that there were a number of measures they were considering to "accelerate the campaign against ISIS," but no decisions had yet been made.   CNN journalists followed this announcement by reporting that one proposal was to send combat forces to Syria.
