CNBC senior contributor Larry Kudlow discusses the British vote to exit the European Union with Breitbart News Daily, as SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon noted the vote for exit is now ahead by a few points in some polls, producing a "tectonic plate shift and shockwave in London. " [Bannon asked Kudlow if the "rise of economic nationalism," as exemplified by the Brexit vote, was a good or bad development.   " In terms of Brexit, I think this has, frankly, more to do with Britainâ€™s culture, and government, and autonomy, as a great     Magna Carta state," Kudlow replied.
