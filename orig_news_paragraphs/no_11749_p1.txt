From there, the idea is to go into a brokered convention and cut a kamikaze deal that awards enough delegates to an "acceptable" candidate (who will have won far fewer votes, states, and delegates than Trump).   The problem with the Establishment brokering a    deal that hands the nomination to a Marco Rubio, is that the backlash against the Republican Party is almost certain to hand Hillary Clinton the presidency. If a bunch of rich, angry GOP elites rob Trump supporters of their victory, the blowback will result in so many voters staying home in November, Hillary wins. As NBCâ€™s Chuck Todd pointed out last night, at this point the delegate math is such that the only way to stop Trump is through this scheme at the convention.
