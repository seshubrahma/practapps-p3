Mr. Ebell leads the Cooler Heads Coalition, a   group that says it is "focused on dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis. " He has been one of the nationâ€™s most visible climate contrarians, known for dispensing memorable sound bites on cable news shows and at events like the annual conferences sponsored by the Heartland Institute, a   group that rejects the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. Mr. Ebell has said that "a lot of     and   scientists have gotten a long ways" by embracing climate change.
