North Koreaâ€™s sixth, for weeks now, as the country ramps up missile testing and saber rattling.   On Sunday, Pyongyang announced it had detained a US citizen on suspicion of "hostile acts" against the regime, days after it accused Seoul and Washington of plotting to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un using "biochemical weapons."   During the campaign, Moon advocated for engagement with North Korea    particularly on the economic front    as the best method to work towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.   Such measures have not historically been popular with conservative administrations in the US, however President Donald Trump has vacillated between tough, militaristic talk on the North Korea issue and suggesting he could sit down with Kim himself.
