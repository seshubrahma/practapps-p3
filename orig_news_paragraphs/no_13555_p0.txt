The Obama administration has accepted 25, 584 refugees into the United States in the two months and 26 days since FY 2017 began on October 1, according to the Department of State interactive website. That number is nearly double the 13, 791 refugees accepted during the comparable period between October 1, 2015 and December 26, 2015 of the prior fiscal year (FY 2016). [It is also more than the previous high for the Obama administration during his eight years in office, which occurred in FY 2013 when 18, 228 refugees were accepted between October 1, 2012 and December 26, 2012.   The Obama administration appears to be rushing as many refugees as possible into the country before   Donald Trump is inaugurated as the 45th President on January 20, 2017.
