" The Sinn Fein nationalist party declared Irelandâ€™s independence from Britain in 1919, setting off a guerrilla war between Irish and crown forces. That included the notorious British "Black and Tans" paramilitary group, which waged a night of terror in Tubbercurry in October 1920, burning buildings, including church parish halls, according to Michael Farry, an Irish historian who has documented the war in Sligo. In December 1921, Britain and Ireland signed a peace treaty, only to have civil war break out six months later among the Irish.
