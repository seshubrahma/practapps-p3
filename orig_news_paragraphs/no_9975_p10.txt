I think, this is guess, of course it will be his choice, he can walk away and the movement will likely wither until some younger, newer leader comes along, but I think he stays in the game. He becomes the kingmaker. If he loses by a respectable margin, say less than Romney did or within that range, I think he becomes a de facto leader of the party and I think Paul Ryan represents the older Reaganite consensus
