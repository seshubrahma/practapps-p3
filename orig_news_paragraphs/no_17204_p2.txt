The inaugural committee is a separate entity from the campaign and the transition, and can raise money as it sees fit, though donors and bundlers of $200 or more will be made public.   Trump’s inaugural committee is chaired by wealthy investment executive Tom Barrack, a friend of Trump’s who spoke at the Republican convention this summer.    The inaugural committee confirmed the document was authentic, but said it was subject to change. The document was first reported by the Center for Public Integrity.
