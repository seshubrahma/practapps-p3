Republican challengers will have a reasonable chance of winning in all five of these states. In Ohio, Sen. Sherrod Brown ( ) defeated Republican Josh Mandel by a 51 percent to 45 percent margin in 2012. But Brownâ€™s strident   voting record and rhetoric appears to be out of step with the more conservative trends of the Buckeye State, so he is probably very vulnerable in 2018. In Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson ( ) easily defeated former Rep. Connie Mack IV 55 percent to 42 percent in 2012.
