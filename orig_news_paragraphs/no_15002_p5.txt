And when Tillerson’s State Department released its annual report on the state of global human rights last month, he skipped holding the traditional news conference that had accompanied the yearly reports’ releases for decades, in both Democratic and Republican administrations. In his meetings this week, Trump will find himself sitting across from the leaders of two countries considered major human rights offenders, according to watchdog groups and the State Department. In the Oval Office on Monday, Trump will welcome Sisi, who was denied an invitation to visit the White House under the previous administration but with whom Trump has spoken several times since becoming the GOP nominee last summer. Later in the week he will meet China’s leader Xi Jinping at his    estate, where issues of trade and security are expected to eclipse discussion of human rights.
