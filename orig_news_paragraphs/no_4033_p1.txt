Let me begin by saying that I am from a family of immigrants that came to this country for a better life. They came to the US "legally," assimilated, integrated, and learned English to the best of their ability, and demanded we speak it. As we all know, we live in a time in which there are forces who wish to destroy our way of life. There are thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take them back.
