The "Establishment," including Bush cronies, have not been involved in the state or local Party, nor have they been elected to state GOP key committees for decades, since the early 1990â€™s. Any vision of this being a bunch of old,   white oilmen making decisions in a backroom, is simply not how it is done in Texas. Most of the folks are   conservatives who have volunteered for years because they believe in what they are fighting for. More recently, in the last some eight years, "Tea Party" conservatives, and "Constitutional Conservatives," have become active in the Party.
