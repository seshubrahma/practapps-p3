Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s supporters in Congress are urging him not to bring up Bill Clinton’s personal infidelities as he looks to rebound after the first presidential debate.   Trump was   about avoiding any mention of Bill Clinton’s affairs during the debate Monday, but his campaign is now urging supporters this week to raise Hillary Clinton’s treatment of the women involved as a salient talking point in the 2016 election. But Trump’s supporters in Congress, many of whom only slowly came around to supporting him, cautioned against those personal attacks Thursday.
