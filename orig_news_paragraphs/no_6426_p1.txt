According to Sharpe, Gronkowski gets away with more off the field than black stars like New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant, much like Trump has gotten away with more than Obama, although he did not offer up any examples. "Think about what was expected of President Obama and then look what is tolerated with President Trump," Sharpe said. " Listen, when a white guy does that, that’s just him, that’s Gronk being Gronk," Sharpe added later.
