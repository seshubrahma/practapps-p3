Decades ago, back before the modern primary system went into place, state party bosses could cut deals with a candidate or interest group to deliver their state delegations en masse to a specific candidate. That’s not to say there won’t be   and   this time around. An unbound delegate can be pressured, convinced, or enticed to back a particular candidate who might not be their his or her choice, but ultimately they get to make the final decision for themselves —   which means a candidate looking to cobble together a majority will have to hand out a lot of favors, as opposed to in the past when they only needed to dole out a few big ones.
