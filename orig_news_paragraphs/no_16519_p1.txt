" The former secretary of state pounced on conflicting messages from Trump and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto following their meeting. Trump told the press in Mexico City that while he and Peña Nieto discussed plans to build a wall along the   border, they did not talk about Trump’s pledge to make Mexico pay for it. Peña Nieto did not refute Trump’s comment during their press conference, but he tweeted hours after that he told Trump that Mexico "will not pay for the wall."
