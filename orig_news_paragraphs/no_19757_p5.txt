Backlash to the administration’s order, combined with the expectation that a Trump Justice Department will take a far different tack on transgender issues and interpretation of Title IX, seem to have inspired legislators to push their own legislation, even at the risk of incurring the harsh business backlash that accompanied H. B. 2. In fact, part of the strategy behind the new wave of bills is a calculation that while boycotts may be effective on a    scale, they will fall apart if many states enact such legislation. The Texas bill, styled S. B. 6, is perhaps the most viable of the bills proposed so far, given GOP majorities in the legislature and Governor Greg Abbott’s previous positive statements about bathroom bills. It covers school districts,   charter schools, state agencies, and some other districts.
