This news comes as Johnson will campaign with Trump —  and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who’s also from Wisconsin, and the state’s governor Scott Walker —  in Wisconsin on Saturday. " Johnson is in serious trouble and when it is over, he will have to assess his decision to run a separate campaign from Donald Trump," said Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the   polling company that conducted the poll. The poll carries a three percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.
