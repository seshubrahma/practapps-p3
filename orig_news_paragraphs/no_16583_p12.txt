Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended Trump’s appearance to CNN’s Chris Cuomo on "New Day" on Friday, saying that Trump wasn’t criticizing the US to say the Iraq War was a failure.   " If you think that Donald Trump is the only person in this country that thinks we’ve had a feckless, anemic foreign policy in the last eight years, then that’s just not true," Conway said. She also clarified Trump’s comments on Putin the day before, in which Trump called Putin a stronger leader than Obama in his country.
