—    unfolded at an awkward moment, just hours after the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, accused Mrs. Clinton of being "extremely careless" in her email use as he announced the end of an investigation that has engulfed her candidacy and put the Obama administration on the defensive. The dueling political events on Tuesday were as discordant as they were separate: The president and his   secretary of state sidestepped the email issue at their rally, where Mr. Obama clasped hands with his onetime rival and predicted victory in the fall, making no mention of Mr. Comey’s dramatic announcement in Washington faulting Mrs. Clinton even as he recommended against criminal charges. Without mentioning the email controversy, Mr. Obama pointed to the political attacks that have chipped away at Mrs. Clinton’s trust among voters.
