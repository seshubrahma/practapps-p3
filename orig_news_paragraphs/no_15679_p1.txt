The meetings with various White House officials and RNC officials included members of the   political group America First Policies    run by Katie Walsh, who briefly served as Trumpâ€™s deputy chief of staff    and RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel. The meetings between the trio of Trumps and the various groups were held to make sure everyone was "on the same page," according to the source. The group discussed the midterm election and 2020 reelection outlook as well as assigning roles moving forward. The meetings were first reported by The Washington Post.
