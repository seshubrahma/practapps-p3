Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has endorsed Rubio for the Republican nomination and campaigned for him in the Pelican State.   Rubioâ€™s third place showing in Louisiana is a big disappointment for his campaign. Under current election results, Rubio will fail to meet the 20 percent support level required to win any delegates. Rubio also failed to win any delegates in Maine, where he finished fourth.
