AMES, Iowa  —   2016 GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump won the coveted endorsement of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin —  the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee —  here at Iowa State University on Tuesday. [Palin, who appeared on stage with Trump in the Hansen Agriculture Learning Center, backed Trump for president just 13 days ahead of the   Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. The Palin endorsement is about the best endorsement any conservative can get, and has been since the mainstream media tried to politically wipe her out in the 2008 presidential election. Palin has survived, and thrived, and remains a grassroots conservative hero.
