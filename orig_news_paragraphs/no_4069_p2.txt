—   Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 11, 2017,   In response to the preview, several Twitter users identifying themselves as family members of the 27 victims of the horrific attack tweeted directly to the Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly host to express their outrage that the anchor and NBC would give Jones a platform to discuss his views. Cristina Hassinger  —   daughter of Sandy Hook Elementary principal Dawn Hoschsprung, who was killed in the attack   —   and Nelba Marquez Greene, who reportedly lost a daughter in the attack, both sent messages to Kelly denouncing the interview.
