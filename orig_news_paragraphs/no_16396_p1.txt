Neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton have explained how they would seek to put U. S. doctrine on a safer footing and reduce global nuclear weapons risks. Last week, much to the concern of the Washington national security community, it was reported that Trump allegedly asked an anonymous   expert multiple times why, if the United States has nuclear weapons, it couldnâ€™t use them.   Trump denies this exchange took place. But he raised a similar question in March.
