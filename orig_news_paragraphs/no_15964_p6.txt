So our faulty tax code gives the owner an annual tax "loss" of as much as $3. 6 million. To top it off, the owner can claim this     loss even if the property value is actually going up. This is because depreciation deductions are based on the entire value of the property, not simply the cash that the investor put down. Looked at another way, over just three or four years, the building owner will have written off his entire $10 million cash investment.
