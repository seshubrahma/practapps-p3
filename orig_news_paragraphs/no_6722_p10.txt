As for Marc Short, a loyalist of Vice President Mike Pence and Joe Hagin, there are concerns as to whether he can perform the duties necessary in the position Walsh is vacating. Short currently runs White House operations and is described by Trumpâ€™s people as very capable at that job. If Dearborn gets the position, as he is expected to per multiple White House aides, then there is discussion of bringing in David Urban to fill the position Dearborn will be vacating to replace Walsh. Urban, an   of staff in the U. S. Senate to the late Arlen Specter, is a Trump loyalist who was crucial to his win in the state of Pennsylvania.
