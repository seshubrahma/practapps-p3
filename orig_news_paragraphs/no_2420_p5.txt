Itâ€™s really a refugee crisis," said Perrine Leclerc, the head of the field office for the United Nations refugee agency in Tapachula. In the 2016 fiscal year, which ended in September, nearly 409, 000 migrants were caught trying to cross the southwestern border of the United States illegally, a 23 percent increase over the previous fiscal year, according to statistics released by the Obama administration. Officials said the increase reflected the growing number of people heading north, not any sweeping changes in enforcement. The trend continued through October, according to figures released Thursday by American immigration officials: More than 46, 000 people were caught last month on the southwestern border, up from about 39, 500 in September.
