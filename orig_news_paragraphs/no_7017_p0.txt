A Friday breaking Fox News report on surveillance of President Trump’s team that began before he became the Republican presidential nominee claimed a very senior intelligence official was responsible —  as well as for the unmasking of the names of private U. S. citizens. [The report cited sources which also indicated that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes ( ) knew of the existence of the information in January, but one or more intelligence agencies blocked him, and there were only two locations where he could view the information that he called "very troubling. "   On Thursday, the New York Times began reporting what they claimed were the identities of two White House officials who were the sources of the information disclosed to Nunes. Nunes met with sources on White House grounds on the day before he announced to reporters striking news that he had seen new and disturbing information indicating intelligence officials under the Obama administration "unmasked" the names of Trump team members who were incidentally surveilled.
