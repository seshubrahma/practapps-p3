Dan Kildee: We can’t change the past but we can put our best foot forward today  Like many Americans, I am still jarred by Wednesday’s horrific shooting at the Republican baseball practice in Virginia. We continue to pray for the victims of this attack, including Congressman Steve Scalise, US Capitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey, congressional staffer Zack Barth and Tyson Foods lobbyist Matt Mika. There is absolutely no place for violence in our political system. I learned about the shooting as Democrats were practicing on a different field for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity.
