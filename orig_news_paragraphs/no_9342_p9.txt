In the early stages of the Cruz campaign he made a point of graciously welcoming each new candidate as they announced. Bush was among those and at the time Cruz stated, "Iâ€™m glad to welcome Jeb Bush to the growing and diverse field of 2016 GOP candidates. Gov. Bush is a good man and was a strong governor in Florida. I look forward to a productive and thoughtful debate on the issues most important to Republican voters as the 2016 GOP primary season gets into full swing.
