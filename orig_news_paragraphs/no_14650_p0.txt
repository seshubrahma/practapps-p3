Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he will ask Congress to approve a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, a push that would make good on a key campaign pledge.   " To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States    financed through both public and private capital     creating millions of new jobs," Trump said, noting that the effort will be guided by his "Buy American and Hire American" principle.
