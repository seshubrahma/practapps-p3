If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out, and the rest of them left.   as I really define it, and that’s the way I define it, is you’re going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out. As far as the people that I’ve hired, in various parts of Florida, during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It’s the up season. People didn’t want to have   jobs.
