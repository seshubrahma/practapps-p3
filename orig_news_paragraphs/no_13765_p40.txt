I updated him about what I knew was going on from my conversations with my wife and the National Lawyers Guild. Some people have said that they would have liked to have been a fly on the wall during that conversation, and I’m sorry to disappoint, but there really wasn’t anything substantive about it. He was moved to another cell after a short time. At about noon, based on the conversations I’d had, I thought we were due to be released at any minute, but the authorities had other plans.
