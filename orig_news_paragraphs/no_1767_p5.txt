" "Today" is gripped in a ratings battle with ABC’s "Good Morning America," and both shows rely on women as a significant part of their viewership. At the time the video was shot, Mr. Bush was a host of NBC’s "Access Hollywood" and talking with Mr. Trump, then the star of "The Apprentice," as he was about to leave a bus to visit a soap opera set. In the video, Mr. Bush laughs at Mr. Trump’s most outrageous comments, and the two vividly discuss the physique of a "Days of Our Lives" actress, Arianne Zucker, who arrived to accompany Mr. Trump on set ("Oh, that’s good legs," Mr. Bush said at one point).
