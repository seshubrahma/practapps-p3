He was sentenced to two and half years in federal prison. Prosecutors said Buryakov used his cover as a bank employee to work for Russia’s SVR, the country’s version of the CIA. He traded coded messages and had clandestine meetings with other Russian agents, prosecutors said. In the summer of 2014, they added, he met multiple times an FBI informant and an undercover FBI employee purported to be working on a casino development project in Russia.
