Mr. Gentiloni agreed, leading a rush to finalize the details and paperwork. The effort was part of a burst of urgent,   diplomatic talks aimed at moving as many as possible of Guantánamo’s 22 prisoners who are recommended for transfer. By law, the Pentagon must notify Congress 30 days before a transfer, so the deadline to set in motion deals before the end of the Obama administration was Monday. By late in the day, officials said, the administration had agreed to tell Congress that it intended to transfer 17 or 18 of the 59 remaining detainees at the prison they would go to Italy, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
