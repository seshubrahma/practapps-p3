The broader picture presented by Comey’s testimony is deeply damaging to Trump.    That Trump and Comey had nine    conversations in the space of just over three months    as opposed to the two    chats Comey had with Obama in four years    is hugely telling. And, in those conversations Trump is repeatedly cast as attempting to secure Comey’s loyalty    and, at times, suggesting his job depends on it. (FBI directors are appointed for 10 year terms but, as we know, can be fired at any time by a president.)
