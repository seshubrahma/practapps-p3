So here’s what we know happened.   President Donald Trump tweeted "Despite the constant negative press covfefe," a clause with no context, at 12:06 a. m. ET Wednesday. Trump’s tweet is the latest example of his ability to draw attention on social media    and keep the public guessing as to the meaning behind many of his remarks. It’s also a reminder of how different he is from past presidents and the traditional, carefully orchestrated pronouncements typically associated with the office.
