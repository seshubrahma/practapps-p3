The Obama administration put in place a number of programs that attempted to address the impact of climate change, including rising sea levels and temperatures.   Trump said those actions harmed American businesses. " With todayâ€™s executive action, I am taking historic steps to lift the restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel   regulations," he said at an event marking the signing of the executive order.
