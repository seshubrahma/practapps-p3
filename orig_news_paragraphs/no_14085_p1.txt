The meeting    with the top eight House and Senate leaders from both parties    was mostly social, barely touched on the issues and didn’t go into much detail about Trump’s policy preferences, Democratic Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer told CNN’s Erin Burnett on "OutFront" shortly after the meeting. " This is largely an opportunity for him to get to know members of the leadership that he did not already know," Hoyer said. Trump told the congressional leaders    including the Democrats    that it’s his intention to provide "something that is better and more affordable" than Obamacare, Republican Sen. John Cornyn said, adding that the Democratic leaders pushed back when he said that.
