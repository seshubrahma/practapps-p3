We have two reporters and a photographer near the front lines as Kurdish pesh merga troops advance on villages east of Mosul. The fight could take weeks or months and involve up to 30, 000 Iraqi and Kurdish troops with American air support. Next door in Syria, the Islamic State lost a small town, Dabiq, with huge symbolic import. An Islamic prophecy identifies Dabiq as the site of an apocalyptic battle.
