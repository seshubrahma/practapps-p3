Defense Secretary Jim Mattis briefed the presidentâ€™s team on Monday on potential strategies for defeating the Islamic State, which has operated in Iraq and Syria. Still, even the wars believed to be outright American victories by the public are not necessarily so, according to Andrew Exum, a retired Army Ranger and a Defense Department official in the Obama administration. " Those victories were not as decisive as we remember: It took another 100 years, after the civil rights acts of the 1960s, before the North truly won the Civil War, while the peace that ended the First World War begat the Second World War, and the peace that ended the Second World War begat the Cold War and its many constituent conflicts," Mr. Exum said.
