So important, and we are so proud of them. This weekend, I am delighted to be participating first hand in the excitement by joining the students and faculty at Liberty University to celebrate the success of their graduates. I was invited to make the commencement address at West Point, but I will be away at the G7  —   and I look forward to that   —   and will be at West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy.
