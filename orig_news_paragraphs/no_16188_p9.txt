President Barack Obama has bequeathed to his successor a nation at war with itself, involved in three     wars abroad, unprecedentedly terrible relations with key allies, and problems so diverse and so thorny they will likely plague the next few presidents.   In politics, this is what should be called an opportunity for the other party. But instead, prominent Republican national security leaders    people like Marco Rubio, John McCain, Bob Corker    are largely steering clear of the candidate and the convention. And others, like Tom Cotton, who is attending, are engaging in somersaults to align some    and only some    of their views with the likely nominee.
