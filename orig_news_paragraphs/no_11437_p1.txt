[Despite the Florida senatorâ€™s promises to do well in the Texas GOP primary, Rubio was only able to pull one delegate in each of three congressional district races. He picked up one delegate in Houston (CD 7)  one in El Paso (CD 16) and one district in north Dallas (CD 32).   The At Large delegates selected in statewide voting were distributed between Cruz, with 30 delegates, and Trump with 17. Senator Cruz won two congressional districts with a majority vote and received all three delegates in those districts.
