Virginia, the Old Dominion from where his opponent’s running mate hails, with 13 electoral votes? Michigan, a blue collar state where American workers are seeing core companies part of their history like Ford move huge chunks of their to business to Mexico, with its 16 electoral votes? Wisconsin, where a bevy of recent surveys have shown a tightened race and from where the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman and Speaker of the House hail —  along with being a stronghold of his former     Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) —  and its ten electoral votes? Or Colorado, ironically the original birthplace of the   "Never Trump" movement, which has been, perhaps more than Wisconsin, a thorn in Trump’s side, with its nine electoral votes?
