I noticed three young men in white   that they had written on with a black marker.   Their shirts said that they were Muslim and were suddenly being interviewed by a TV station. Going through security, I noticed quite a mix in the population in line at each Secret Service checkpoint.   People were laughing and happy to be at the event and were eager to get inside.
