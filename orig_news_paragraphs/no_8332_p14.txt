My husband, a constitutional attorney and captain in the U. S. Army Reserves, and I had started Evangelicals for Mitt the year before [2006] and  —   through a series of coincidences and opportunities   —    I ended up helping Ann Romney on a writing project. In my normal life, I was a    mother of two, so life consisted of car lines, lunchboxes, and afternoon volleyball games.
