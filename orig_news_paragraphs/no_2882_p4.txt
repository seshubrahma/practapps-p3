In addition to Gouthière at the Frick, there is Charles Percier, architect and designer to Napoleon Bonaparte, on exhibit in drawings and extraordinary     objects at the Bard Graduate Center on the Upper West Side. Farther uptown on Fifth Avenue, the Guggenheim has Maurizio Cattelan’s "America," an   solid gold toilet, on working display. Downtown, Martin Puryear ’s "Big Bling," a    sculpture with a monumental     shackle, commands Madison Square Park until April.
