Priebus was unveiled as Trumpâ€™s chief of staff shortly following the election, though he shared billing on the announcement with Steve Bannon, the CEO of Breitbart who officials say will share an equal role with Priebus in the White House. McDonough and Priebus have spoken since the announcement, and the incoming chief of staff has also consulted with other predecessors. The 2008 meeting gathered 12 former chiefs of staff to share advice and counsel to Emanuel as he prepared to assume the office.   One of the attendees then was John Podesta, who served as chief of staff under President Bill Clinton.
