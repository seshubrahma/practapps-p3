’s future as the Green Blob. The Green Blob’s tentacles extend everywhere: into our kids’ classrooms (where they are brainwashed with environmental propaganda) into our universities (where whole departments have now been hijacked by green junk science —  because hey, that’s where the money is) into the mainstream media (most of which repeats, unquestioningly, the spurious claims of impending   put out by environmental activists and   university departments) into business, which now wastes billions on environmental compliance and billions more on energy costs artificially inflated by the almost entirely unnecessary   drive for renewables) into government (where few politicians, even now, have the nous to appreciate that they have been sold a pup and who still continue to inflict more "sustainable" initiatives on their hapless electorates) into the economy, where jobs have been killed and growth blighted by measures designed by   on a   mission to destroy Western industrial civilisation into the environment, which has been ravaged by the very things we’re told are supposed to help save it —  from     eco crucifixes to those forests in the US which have been chopped down to create   biofuels to be burned at Britain’s Drax power station to the   minerals mined in appalling conditions in China to make wind turbines into the cost of living (inflated by green taxes, regulations and tariffs) where in some cases people have been driven into fuel poverty and an early death because governments like Obama’s have caused electricity prices "necessarily" to "skyrocket" by mandating renewables over cheaper, more reliable fossil fuel. This insanity has been allowed to prevail, largely unchecked, for over four decades. While enriching a corrupt few, it has caused misery to billions.
