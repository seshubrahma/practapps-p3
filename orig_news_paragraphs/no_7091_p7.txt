Hanlon makes a few false assumptions about conservative students. Most of us don’t believe that we are on the receiving end of "ideological oppression," as he suggests. Most of us engage with the texts of the great conservative and libertarian minds such as F. A. Hayek, Ludwig Von Mises, Milton Friedman, and Thomas Sowell, making us some of the most   thinkers on campuses thanks to our university’s progressive curriculums. Considering that these thinkers and their works are often absent from university curriculum, why isn’t Hanlon asking progressive students to read them?
