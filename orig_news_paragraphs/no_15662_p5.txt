The brothers spoke on the phone just minutes before the attack at a concert at Manchester Arena, Ben Salem said, but Hashim told his Libyan interrogators that he did not know details about where and when the blast would be. The Special Deterrence Force in Tripoli, a militia nominally under the control of Libya’s interior ministry, arrested Hashim   a day later on suspicion of links to ISIS. The militia also arrested the brothers’ father, Ramadan  . Earlier this week the militia said Hashim had admitted    under interrogation    that he and Salman were members of ISIS.
