Marco Rubio’s interview with Meet The Press host Chuck Todd —   in which he pledged to allow illegal aliens remain in the U. S. —   has received widespread attention. [However, while Politico oxymoronically titled its article "Rubio:   Undocumented Immigrants Could Stay," perhaps the most striking part of Rubio’s interview was his indication that criminal aliens would be allowed to remain in the United States as well.   Rubio’s Sunday statement in support of criminal aliens is consistent with some of the most controversial aspects of his Gang of Eight bill, which would have allowed convicted criminal aliens —   such as sex offenders and gang members —   to remain in United States and become U. S. citizens. Rubio seems to have adopted President Obama’s open borders talking point that only "felons, not families" should be deported.
