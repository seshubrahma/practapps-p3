In the   race with Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein included, Trump and Clinton are still tied at 42 percent, while Johnson gets 8 percent and Stein just 2 percent —  with 6 percent undecided. But more importantly, pollster Wes Anderson of On Message told Breitbart News in a brief phone interview on Thursday that Trump is surging with independents far ahead of Hillary Clinton. In fact, the data shows that Trump is winning 53 percent of independents, while Clinton is just getting 33 percent of independents —  with 15 percent undecided. That is a   advantage for Trump.
