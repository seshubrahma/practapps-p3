"Priebus" is a German name, pronounced like the Toyota Prius with a "b" stuck in the middle. Reince (short for Reinhold, rhymes with "pints") is 44 but has an  â€™s vibe. He is often underslept, has the beginnings of jowls and tiny goose pimples clustered under his eyes like those on the belly of a toad. He speaks in the slow and slightly   manner of an adolescent whose parents are always hassling him about the nightmare house guest.
