Imagine if those numbers were switched, Kasich and Rubio, he would likely be number two now, and have the momentum. So he looks like heâ€™s been stopped in his tracks right now. And imagine one other thing, Trump gets over 30% which is extremely impressive in a big field, but had the field been winnowed today, tonight, to one person for the mainstream lane, Cruz, and Trump, 30% or so means a dead heat among the three. The longer that is postponed, and New Hampshire has postponed it, the better it is for Trump.
