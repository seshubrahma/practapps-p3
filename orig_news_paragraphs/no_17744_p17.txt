Our most important allies in the fight against   ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic   ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended   or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our   country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to   help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.
