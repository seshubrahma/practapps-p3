Elliot Abrams, a former deputy national security advisor to George W. Bush, and Robert Kimmitt, who previously served as Bush’s deputy secretary of the Treasury Department and was an ambassador to Germany and had a top job at the State Department under President George H. W. Bush, have been gaining steam as possible deputies to Tillerson, sources familiar with the search said. In a recent interview with the Daily Caller, Hadley said Paula Dobriansky, a former undersecretary at the State Department during the George W. Bush years, and James Jeffrey, a career ambassador in Iraq and Turkey who also served as Bush’s deputy national security advisor, would make good deputy secretaries, in addition to Bolton and Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Haass, a former director of policy planning at the State Department under Rice, is already being considered by the transition, according to several sources. Haass spoke to Trump by phone and met with the transition team at Trump Tower earlier this month on a "wide range of issues and personalities," according to a source, who said the team was asking his advice on policy and potential staff recommendations.
