Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal, in part because of President Obama’s aggressive regulations to cut emissions from power plants, but also because natural gas is cheaper. Nationally, about 300   power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group. Many of those plants  —   including one in nearby Louisa, Ky. where a giant cooling tower was recently demolished after the plant converted from coal to natural gas   —   are not coming back.
