The real treat, though, is heading down to the Point Loma tide pools and exploring these   hiking along the cliffs and taking in the Pacific vistas. Entire ecosystems flourish in the tide pools   â€”   and you can get right up next to them. You might see kelp, mussels, abalone, chitons and sandcastle worms.
