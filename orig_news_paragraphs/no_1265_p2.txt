As a precaution, the Pentagon is flying patrols in Syrian skies with   jets, the Air Forceâ€™s most advanced    fighter. If it becomes clear that the Syrians and Russians will not follow their sharp criticism of the operation with significant military action, the pace of American airstrikes against Islamic State forces in Syria can be quickly increased. Over the last two years, American and allied warplanes striking Islamic State targets in Syria have had to fly among formidable Syrian and   air defenses. While there have been a few close calls between Russian and American jets, some of them unintentional, the   air campaign has for the most part proceeded without interference from Russian or Syrian fighters or air defenses.
