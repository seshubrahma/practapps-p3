What role Ivanka Trump plays in her fatherâ€™s White House is among the pressing questions at the intersection of politics and business under the Trump administration. Since her father became president, Ms. Trump has sat in meetings with political and business leaders at the White House, drawing criticism that she could use her informal adviser role to promote her brand. Now, she also works out of a West Wing office and is in the process of getting a security clearance and   devices. To address those concerns, Ms. Trump handed over    control of her company to her top executive, Abigail Klem, and transferred its assets to a new trust overseen by relatives of her husband.
