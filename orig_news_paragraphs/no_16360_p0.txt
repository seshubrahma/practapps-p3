Washington (CNN) Former CIA   Michael Morell said Sunday he’d trust Hillary Clinton with the nation’s security, but that Donald Trump is being manipulated by Russian President Vladimir Putin.   Morell, who cast Trump as an unwitting agent of Putin in a New York Times   last week, said on ABC’s "This Week" that he’s comfortable with Clinton after seeing her in action in President Barack Obama’s administration.
