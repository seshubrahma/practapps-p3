President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton embarked on a joint campaign visit to Charlotte, North Carolina aboard Air Force One   â€”   on the same day that FBI director James Comey announced he would not recommend prosecuting Clinton for mishandling classified emails. [The joint appearance is only the latest in a string of curious coincidences as the FBI neared its conclusions, including a secret meeting between former president Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch last Tuesday.   Earlier in the day, Comey announced that despite "evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information," including evidence that Clinton and her team were "extremely careless," he would not recommend that Clinton be prosecuted because, he said, the FBI had not uncovered sufficient evidence of intent to convince a reasonable prosecutor to pursue the charges.
