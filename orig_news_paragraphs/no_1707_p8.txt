In another case, the foundation paid $100, 000 in 2007 to Fisher House Foundation, a veterans’ cause, as part of a settlement for fines racked up by Mr. Trump’s     Club in Palm Beach when it hoisted an oversize pole for an American flag. Other unusual donations from the foundation have included $20, 000 paid to an artist to paint a portrait of Mr. Trump, and $12, 000 for an autographed helmet from the football player Tim Tebow. A compounding factor for Mr. Trump is that he has given relatively little of his own money to the foundation in recent years, it has relied almost exclusively on donations from others.
