Much like Trump, Marine Le Pen has vowed to combat radical Islamic terrorism and has said she will have a much tougher border policy, getting France out of the   Schengen agreement. Le Pen has also said she would look to hold a referendum on French membership of the European Union and advocates an exit or "Frexit" from the bloc. Ms. Le Pen has also praised Trump and in a speech in February said that his election and Brexit were, "in tune with the great planetary movement which consists of the awakening of the peoples [and] the return of national frontiers and national pride.
