The following day after those remarks, China sent three Chinese Coast Guard vessels around those islands, located in the East China Sea, according to the Japan Coast Guard. " Three ships entered the waters surrounding the uninhabited chain," the Japan Coast Guard said in a statement, according to the Times. Chinese state media outlet China Daily also issued a veiled threat to neighbors that the new advanced missile, first unveiled in September 2015, could challenge "foreign military installations" on the islands.
