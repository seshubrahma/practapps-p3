President Trump’s criminalization policies that target immigrants, Muslims and people of color through bans, walls and raids have only exacerbated this climate. The administration’s actions send a clear message to the public: Certain people do not belong in America.

Unless this pattern of   hostility toward communities of color, Muslims, and immigrants radically changes, condemnations of hate violence can only go so far.
