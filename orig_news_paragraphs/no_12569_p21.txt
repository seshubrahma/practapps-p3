11:20 a. m. Republican nominee Donald Trump is surveying the damage in   Louisiana. Trumpâ€™s motorcade drove early Friday through the   community of Central in East Baton Rouge Parish, where   carpet and flooring, furniture and the entire contents of homes were piled on the curb. In some cases, people who were still mucking out their homes came out to wave at the motorcade. At least 13 people were killed and thousands were displaced in heavy rain that dumped as much as two feet of water on some areas.
