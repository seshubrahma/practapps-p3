The American crew was in the process of retrieving the device when a small boat dispatched from the Chinese vessel took it as the American sailors looked on. The action came two weeks after Mr. Trump angered Beijing by speaking by phone to the leader of Taiwan, and almost a week after he criticized China for building military bastions in the South China Sea. American officials were trying to determine whether the seizure was a response to Mr. Trump or whether it was just one more escalatory step in China’s   plan to try to push the United States Navy out of the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest commercial and military waterways. The Pentagon formally protested the capture of the drone, saying it was stolen American military property.
