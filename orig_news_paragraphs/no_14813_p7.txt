Next month, Trump plans to host Chinese President Xi Jinping for a summit at his    estate in Florida, a senior administration official told CNN Monday. The US also announced Monday that it will permanently station attack drones in South Korea, a move that comes just days after South Korea received the first parts of the controversial   THAAD missile defense system.   " The US wants to, and I think it needs to, be seen as responsive to developments in the region," said Yvonne Chiu, a professor at Hong Kong University.
