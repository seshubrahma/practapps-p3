In an effort to steady his campaign after several rough weeks of controversies that knocked him off course, Trump put some new leadership at the top of his team this week and is about to begin his first real concerted television advertising campaign in the battleground states. He also started to shift his tone a bit, expressing general regret for some of the things he has said during this heated campaign. The initial $4 ad million buy will be hitting television screens in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.   And Trumpâ€™s new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has mentioned the goal of beefing up some of the state based operations in the key states.
