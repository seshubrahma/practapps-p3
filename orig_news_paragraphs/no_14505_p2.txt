While ICE said 75% of those arrested had criminal records and insisted the "targeted" enforcement was consistent with what the Obama administration had done, the department also said officers who encountered individuals not on the list of targets were given latitude to decide whether they should also be arrested for removal.   Fear in immigrant communities had already been running high based on Trumpâ€™s pitched rhetoric against illegal immigration on the campaign trail, and only increased during the ICE enforcement actions. The new guidance makes it more difficult to seek asylum in the US, allows the detention of substantially more undocumented immigrants and gives more authority to immigration officers    all of which could add up to a huge increase in the number of undocumented immigrants held in detention facilities by the US government.   A department spokeswoman, Gillian Christensen, said she could not confirm the guidance is final and would not comment on documents before they are publicly released, but she did not dispute their contents.
