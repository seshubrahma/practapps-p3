If the Democrats pull out all the stops to scuttle Pryorâ€™s nomination, particularly after a presidential election premised on the notion that the next president should get his or her pick, their position would be greatly weakened should Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Justice Anthony Kennedy retire. The Democrats can only go to the mattresses so many times, and given that this seat, uniquely, is premised on the results of the election, it would seriously damage any future case.   And if the Democrats do attempt to stop his nomination? Pryor is worth the fight.
