"Under President Obama, our national dialogue has steadily moved towards political correctness (despite his denunciations) but with President Trump, I think our national dialogue will likely move away from being blanketly PC. Even though, as you pointed out, Obama has criticized PC speech, he doesn’t exactly engage in   speech like Trump does. I don’t expect a President Trump to instantly convert people, but when you have someone in the Oval Office giving decidedly   speeches and announcements, I think that would change the discourse, don’t you?
