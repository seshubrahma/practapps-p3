CNN previously reported that Flynn, according to a top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, was paid more than $33, 000 of a $45, 000 speaking fee by RT for the speech in December 2015, with most of the remainder of the money going to Leading Authorities, the speakers bureau.   The US intelligence community has long assessed RT, formerly called Russia Today, to be a propaganda tool of the Kremlin, writing in a January report on Russian interference in the US election that the organization had participated in disinformation campaigns aimed at the US. Flynn initially said he was paid by his speakers bureau for the talk. The forms say Flynn received "compensation exceeding $5, 000 in a year" from the Russian airline and cybersecurity company for speaking engagements in the United States.
