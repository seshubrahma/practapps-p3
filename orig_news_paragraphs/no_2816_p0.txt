SCRANTON, Pa.   —    Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. warned on Monday that Donald J. Trump, even as a candidate, had elevated the dangers confronting American allies and military personnel overseas. Mr. Biden said that on a trip to Kosovo and Serbia this week, he would be compelled to "reassure" allies that the United States would honor its commitment to NATO, given Mr. Trump’s comments saying he would reassess the arrangement if elected.
