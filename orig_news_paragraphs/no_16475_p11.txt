In North Carolina, Clinton and Trump are about even on who would better handle immigration (49% choose Trump, 47% Clinton) and Clinton has a   lead on handling health care.   Clintonâ€™s position in North Carolina is bolstered by a sense that she can better handle the responsibilities that come with being commander in chief (50% trust her vs. 43% who trust Trump on that score) and that she better shares voters values (47% think Clinton does, 42% Trump). Trump tops Clinton as more honest and trustworthy (49% to 39%) and 11% say neither major party candidate for president has the edge on honesty.   In Arizona, the share who see neither as honest and trustworthy rises to 16% and Trump continues to top Clinton on that measure (49% to 33%).
