High drug prices have attracted intense scrutiny in the last year, and   Donald J. Trump has singled them out as an important issue. " We believe the Spinraza pricing decision is likely to invite a storm of criticism, up to and including presidential tweets," Geoffrey C. Porges, an analyst for Leerink Partners, said in a note to investors on Thursday. Mr. Porges said the price could lead some insurers to balk or to limit the drug to patients who are the most severely affected, such as infants, even though the F. D. A. has approved Spinraza for all patients with the condition.
