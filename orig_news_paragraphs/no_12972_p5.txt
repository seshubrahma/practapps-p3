Few refugees have accepted offers to resettle in Papua New Guinea and Cambodia because most hope that Australia will eventually take them in. Any refugee who refuses to go to the U. S. would be given a   visa to stay on Nauru, a tiny impoverished atoll with a population of 10, 000 people, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said. U. S. Department of Homeland Security officials are expected in Australia this week to begin assessing refugees. Turnbull would not say how many refugees the United States might take, but said the most vulnerable would be given priority.
