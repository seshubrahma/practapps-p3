Activists are angry over the display of dysfunction, but they are uncertain whom to turn their guns on. They will not blame Mr. Trump, because to fault him is to link arms with the left and an adversarial news media, a nonstarter in an era of tribal politics. Some on the right are tempted to point a finger at Mr. Ryan, a pillar of the   party establishment, but that approach has been complicated by Mr. Trumpâ€™s decision to align himself with the speaker, both on the health care issue and more broadly. This leaves the Freedom Caucus.
