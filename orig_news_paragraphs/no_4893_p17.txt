One of the most effective arguments against those who insist healthcare is a "right" that should be provided for "free" or at heavily subsidized prices by the State, is to ask them why the even more universally essential need for food should not be satisfied the same way. They never have a good answer for why food shouldnâ€™t be provided by the government, even though most people need food even more urgently than medicine or health insurance. The reason for their silence is the lingering   fear that voters know exactly what happens when governments handle food distribution. Nobody wants to schlep to a grim   food dispensary to wander among bare shelves with ration card in hand.
