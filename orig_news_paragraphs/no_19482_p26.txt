" "   Because the case was tied up in court for years, he said, the   narrative from the Democratic side ended up being about how   unfair and difficult the law made it for many to vote. As a   result, he said, many people wrongly thought that the IDs were   very difficult to get, and that it wasn’t worth it for the   purpose of voting.
