The economic theory Levin has laid out would prohibit action to raise the price of a foreign good to protect a domestic industry —   exactly what Reagan did. Yet trade rules, by definition, are protectionist. Any prohibition on an unfair subsidy is, at bottom, a prohibition on importing a good so cheaply that an American company has no chance of competing against it. However, by Levin’s   argument that cheaper is necessarily better, none of these trade rules should exist or be enforced at all because to levy a tariff is to raise prices, and —   by Levin’s argument —   damage the economy.
