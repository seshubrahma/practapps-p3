Friedmanâ€™s appointment and a rightward shift in policy could also deepen rifts within the American Jewish community, Malka said, because he "is associated so closely with   and rightwing causes in Israel, which is are ideals which are at odds with the majority of the American Jewish community. " Friedman has been openly contemptuous of the liberal Jewish organization J Street, which openly favors a   solution, calling them "worse than kapos," a reference to Jews who worked with the Nazis during World War II to guard prison camps.   J Street said it "vehemently" opposed Friedman and said he "should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel" when they consider whether to confirm him.
