NBC’s   variety sketch show Maya and Marty wasted little time turning political by featuring a skit in its first episode that poked fun at the wives of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and former candidate Sen. Ted Cruz. [In the sketch from the new series, produced by Saturday Night Live‘s Lorne Michaels, Melania Trump introduces a new line of "edible diamonds" while Heidi Cruz pokes fun at her accent and laments how she was compared to her during the presidential primary.   Trump and Cruz are played by Saturday Night Live alumni Maya Rudolph and Kate McKinnon, respectively. McKinnon is perhaps best known for also playing Hillary Clinton on SNL.
