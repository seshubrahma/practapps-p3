The USITC claimed that NAFTA and Most Favored Nation for China would generate much bigger benefits than the   Partnership, but both have since become substantial losers for American workers. Workers without a   degree account for slightly less than 70 percent of the overall U. S. workforce. But 75. 5 percent of black workers and 85. 0 percent of Hispanic workers do not have a   degree. Because blacks and Hispanics are less likely than white workers to have   degrees, they have suffered even more harm from trade deals.
