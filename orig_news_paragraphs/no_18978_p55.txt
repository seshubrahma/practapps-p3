The one thing that came out of Dallas was that the police chief   reminded us what the real role of the police is   â€”   talk about a   guy who with grace and dignity and wisdom took an incredibly   volatile situation and showed what intelligent law enforcement   ought to be doing, which is restoring peace and harmony to the   communities that they are obliged to serve. There are plenty of   police officers out there who do the job right and I think our   job is just to elevate those people as role models.
