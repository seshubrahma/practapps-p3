So, for example, in trying to get more favorable Chinese treatment of American goods and services, the standard menu of carrots Mr. Trump has to offer for compliance is relatively modest. China wants things like United States membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank that it started, and support for its "One Belt, One Road" program to build better transportation infrastructure stretching from Southeast Asia to Europe. Bigger Chinese goals, like achieving "market economy" status in the World Trade Organization, are likely to be nonstarters unless the country makes major progress on allowing international companies better access to its market. The United States could conceivably have more negotiating leverage by threatening punitive tariffs or other aggressive measures, as Mr. Trump did during his campaign, but those actions are just as likely to produce a painful blowback from China that damages the United States.
