But thatâ€™s the wrong way to look at it. You add up Cruz and Rubio, both of them conservatives, one more conservative fundamentalist if you like than the other. And what you have is 51 percent of Iowa is conservative and one quarter is populist. That tells me that the Republicans are likely to stay with their roots as a conservative party and not be, accept the siren song of the kind of populism that Trump is championing.
