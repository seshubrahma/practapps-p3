Trump has claimed he knows more about ISIS than America’s leading generals. Clearly this is also total nonsense he doesn’t seem to have done the slightest thing to educate himself about ISIS.   In June, Gen. David Petraeus, formerly the commander of all US forces in Iraq, predicted the largest city that ISIS now holds, the Iraqi city of Mosul, could fall to   Iraqi forces before President Obama leaves office in January. Petraeus characterized this as "a very big deal" and went on to say, "no question ISIS is a loser in Iraq and, increasingly, Syria," in an interview with me at New America’s offices in Manhattan.
