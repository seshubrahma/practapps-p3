Posters have begun to appear on campus attacking Trump and the students who support him as "racist" and calling for a rally.   Sources tell Breitbart News that Portland police and the university itself have been unwilling to do anything to protect the First Amendment rights of the   students, instead telling them to move todayâ€™s event outside. Despite the intimidation and openly hostile atmosphere, the   students plan to carry on the event. The first attempt by about a dozen   students to have a meeting eight days ago ended up with those students having their First Amendment rights trampled on as dozens of radical protestors affiliated with the Black Studies department and other   groups connected to the Portland State University Student Union jumped on furniture, screamed at   students and intimidated anyone who disagreed with them.
