Former governor  —   and Mitt Romney surrogate   —    John Sununu worked the crowd up before Trump spoke, drawing loud cheers. He also stressed the need to retain Republican control of the Senate, and urged the crowd to support Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who faces a tough   fight and has refused to endorse Trump (though she has said she will vote for him).
