Thursday nightâ€™s Congressional Baseball Game was hailed as the ultimate sign of bipartisan unity, but dozens of Democrat staffers reportedly cursed, booed, and jeered when President Donald Trump appeared on the video screen at Nationals Park to deliver a message of unity.   According to a Washington Times report, the "staffers erupted into boos, jeers and even vulgar gesticulations" while Trump was saying, "you are showing the world we will not be intimidated by threats. " One person reportedly "shouted an expletive" at Trump while others even mocked the teams when they gathered near second base in prayer.
