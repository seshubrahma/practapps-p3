When Mr. Trump heard the tape played, he acknowledged it was him, but he believed the fallout would not be dramatic. Mr. Pence, however, was dismayed, and called into Trump headquarters on Friday night to urge Mr. Trump to apologize.

Mr. Trump, after monitoring television coverage, realized he was becoming isolated by his party.
