Since the other candidates had withdrawn, Fox News canceled the debate. Cruz spokesman Ron Nehring issued a statement saying: Perhaps Mr. Trump is unable to speak for more than one minute about any given topic because of his shallow understanding of basic policies, or perhaps he is scared of voters learning the truth —  that he has spent his entire adult life promoting liberal positions completely opposite of the conservative platform that he has campaigned on. In what some regard as calling Trump’s bluff, Cruz instead decided to attend AIPAC at the same time as Trump, to give his own speech. Since they’ll be in the same place at the same time, Cruz has renewed his challenge for Trump to debate him, this time in Washington, D. C. adding on The Kelly File that he would be happy to make the debate about foreign policy, or some other topic that fits AIPAC’s theme of focusing on Israel.
