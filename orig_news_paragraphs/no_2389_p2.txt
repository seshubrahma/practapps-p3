Mr. Trump, who has lashed out at the speaker for being critical of him, has privately said that Mr. Ryan should pay a price for his disloyalty, according to two people close to Mr. Trump who insisted on anonymity to describe internal campaign discussions. Mr. Trump made his frustrations plain on Tuesday. " The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top," he said in an interview with Reuters.
