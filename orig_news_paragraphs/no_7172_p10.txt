Expect this question to come from Anderson Cooper, who likes to show his foreign policy chops. It is the question neither candidate wants to answer, since the problem cannot really be solved short of war with Iran and confrontation with Russia. Clinton has a standard answer, which is to talk about continuing the Obama administrationâ€™s fight against ISIS (such as it is). She may try to claim she wanted to do more about Syria as Secretary of State but was overruled.
