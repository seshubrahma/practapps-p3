When he announced the president’s budget, Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, explained that his budget request was based on Trump’s own speeches and campaign promises. " Knowing what you know about the President, you could imagine what that budget would look like before you even see it, which is that there will be more money on defense   —   $54 billion," Mulvaney said.
