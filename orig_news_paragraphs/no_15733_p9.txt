It would be a travesty for agencies to return the CIA torture report instead of reading and learning from it, as senators intended," said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLUâ€™s National Security Project. The committee sent the report to seven federal agencies: the CIA, CIA inspector general, FBI, director of national intelligence and the Justice, State and Defense Departments. But even if all those copies are returned to the committee, there is another way the report could eventually be made public. When President Barack Obama was still in office, the White House felt it was caught between congressional Democrats who wanted the full report made public and the CIA and intelligence community that felt strongly against it, according to a former administration official.
