During this period, we had no access to phones and, therefore, no access to information from the outside world about what was happening. First, we were marched past the fencing and razor wire into a room to watch an orientation film about prison rape, which included helpful suggestions like not to take a Snickers bar if someone offers it to you because you may be required to provide sexual favors in exchange. Full disclosure: nobody ever offered me a Snickers bar. After the prison rape video, we were sent for another processing session.
