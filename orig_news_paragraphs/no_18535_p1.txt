Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose contacts   with Russia’s ambassador to the U. S. during the presidential   campaign have sparked questions, agreed Saturday to appear before   the Senate intelligence committee as it investigates alleged   Russian meddling in the election. " ’   Sessions recused himself in March from a federal investigation   into contacts between Russia and the presidential campaign of   Donald Trump after acknowledging that he had met twice last year   with the Russian ambassador to the United States. He had told   lawmakers at his January confirmation hearing that he had not met   with Russians during the campaign.
