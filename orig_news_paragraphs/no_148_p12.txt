"Melania’s Moments," a series of digital shorts that detailed the thoughts of the future first lady in a concise form that resembles the mellow   from the "S. N. L. " writer Jack Handey’s "Deep Thoughts. " Mr. Handey aimed for pure absurdity, but Mr. Torres makes Melania Trump a tragic,   heroine trapped in her gilded cage. Approaching a window in Trump Tower, like a cursed princess, she gazes onto Fifth Avenue, wondering about Sixth Avenue the way a Chekhov character dreams of Moscow.
