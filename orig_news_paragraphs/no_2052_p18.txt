" Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks," the statement said. Several senators, including Rand Paul of Kentucky and James Lankford of Oklahoma, both Republicans, expressed support for such an investigation on Sunday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, did not comment on the issue over the weekend, but he was expected to address it in a news conference scheduled for Monday morning.
