I have problems with the other candidates. I have problems with Hillary Clinton, I’m sorry. Because I have problems with the Democratic Party that is just as linked to the corporate capitalist structure as the Republican party. But I know that if I vote for Donald Trump, or if I don’t vote for anyone, that I will perhaps be contributing to the possibility of increasing oppression over the next decade.
