Due to these shortcomings, I am unable to lend my support to this bill. The main concerns grassroots activists have about Rubio in the realm of education is his promotion of a vocational education program, his plan to reduce student loan debt, and the federal intervention and data collection involved in both of those endeavors. In New Hampshire recently Rubio explained his vocational training proposal and said that, "as president, I’ll be able to help with this," a statement that suggests he would invite some federal intervention in a vocational education program. This idea raises a red flag since Rubio’s stance on illegal immigration remains an issue for conservatives.
