To turn back to that other milestone movie: When Kathryn Bigelow won best director for "The Hurt Locker" in 2010, some hoped that her historic win would serve as a breakthrough for women, but it hasn’t, and the numbers for female filmmakers are worse now. I don’t want to harsh our mellow, but I also don’t want to overpraise the academy for occasionally getting it right when the industry continues to get it so wrong. " Moonlight," after all, wasn’t made by one of the big studios, which are more interested in superhero fantasies it was bankrolled by A24, a small, independent company.
