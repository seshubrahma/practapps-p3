"That is not the case," Rohrabacher said of the comparison to Russiaâ€™s dictatorial communist leaders during World War II. The meeting also comes as multiple activist groups in Syria tell CNN that dozens of people, including children, were killed in one of the deadliest gas attacks the country has seen during years of civil war.
