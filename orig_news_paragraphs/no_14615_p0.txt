 (CNN) A little blue ribbon has become the hottest accessory for many stars on the red carpet at the 89th Annual Academy Awards. Celebrities are donning the ribbon in support of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) an organization that challenged President Donald Trumpâ€™s controversial travel ban in court.   The nonpartisan, nonprofit organization says it reached out to all major Oscar nominees to participate in the "Stand with the ACLU" initiative.
