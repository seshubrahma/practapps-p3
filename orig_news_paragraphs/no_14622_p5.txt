On the night of John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Lyndon Johnson was already meeting with advisers to plan how he would move forward a massive tax cut and civil rights bill through the Senate, while mapping out a schedule for sending to the Hill a host of other domestic bills. Notwithstanding the controversial election that brought him into office, George W. Bush was pushing within weeks for a massive   tax cut and a federal educational bill to show that he would govern like he had a mandate. By the end of January in President Obama ’s first term, the House had passed a massive economic stimulus bill and both chambers had voted in favor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.
