Mulvaney emphasized that the biggest savings in the budget come from cutting or scaling back entitlement programs.   The budget would also slash other programs that help the working poor. It cuts food stamps, student programs, the   credit, the child tax credit and disability payments, among others, while increasing military spending, border security and infrastructure.   Asked whether these cuts are "" referencing cuts to an example he gave about an education program, Mulvaney responded, "You know, for the schoolteacher in Kenosha, Wisconsin, who is trying to raise two kids by herself, save for her college and save for their retirement, isn’t it   to go to her and say, ’give me money for a program that is only 6% effective’?"
