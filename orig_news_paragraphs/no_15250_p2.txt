The Turkish government has been conducting a   fight against the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group that has carried out terrorist attacks in Turkey. But Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Americaâ€™s primary Syrian ally in the fight against ISIS, and the   Kurdish Peshmerga both said that they suffered casualties as well as a result of the airstrikes.   " We are very concerned, deeply concerned, that Turkey conducted airstrikes earlier today in northern Syria as well as northern Iraq without proper coordination either with the United States or the broader global coalition to defeat ISIS," acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Tuesday.
