Johnson lifted the Independence Day line from Nigel Farage of the U. K. Independence Party —  also a Leave campaigner —  and an actual leader of the populist movement who has been banging the drum on the issue for 25 years. Trump struck a similar note in his New York City speech exposing Clinton: Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country. They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.
