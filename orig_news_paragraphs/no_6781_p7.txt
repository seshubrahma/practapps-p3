â€”    Lee Stranahan (@stranahan) February 19, 2017,   As Reuters reported several weeks ago, LGBT activists continue   about the Trump administration: Advocates said on Tuesday they were bracing for a Trump administration rollback of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, despite a White House statement vowing to uphold protection for LGBT people in the workplace. U. S. President Donald Trump will continue to enforce a 2014 executive order by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, barring discrimination against LGBT people working for federal contractors, the White House said.
