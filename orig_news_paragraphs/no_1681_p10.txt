In nearly every successive economic cycle, progress came slower and harder than in the previous one. The data, which measured how Americans were doing six years into the economic recovery, show that incomes in the middle, measured in 2015 dollars, were still 1. 6 percent below the previous peak of $57, 423 a household, which was attained in 2007, just before the economy sank into what has come to be known as the Great Recession. How does that look compared to the nationâ€™s recent history? After the economy slipped into recession in 1969, it took only three years for incomes in the middle to rebound and surpass their previous peak.
