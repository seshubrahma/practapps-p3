Former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin told Breitbart News that she welcomes President Trump’s executive order aimed at lifting the ban on offshore drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic and Atlantic areas. [Governor Palin said, "Quashing Obama’s   energy plan makes America great again. We’ve been working for years to remind people that our exceptional nation came to be by developing our   natural resources and by expecting reward for an unsurpassed work ethic. We capture that again when we drill, baby, drill!"
