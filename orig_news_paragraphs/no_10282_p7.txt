It is also possible that the Fox poll is simply an outlier, since it is based on a large move between Cruz and Kasich, rather than a surge of support for Trump. It is also possible that, as the race hits the final stretch, voters who oppose Trump are divided on which alternative candidate to support. It is possible that Republicans will enter their convention in Cleveland where no candidate, including their frontrunner, commands a majority of support from their voters across the country. Conventions are designed to unify a party ahead of a general election.
