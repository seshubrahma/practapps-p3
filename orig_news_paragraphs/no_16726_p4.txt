And it’s no coincidence that Trump is proudly and publicly supported by a frightening number of white supremacists and   such as David Duke. And while Trump will tell us he doesn’t want their support, just a few weeks ago leading white supremacist leaders held a press conference to "discuss their affection for Donald Trump and their hopes for a white homeland," which they demand must be free from Jews. (Trump has no problem calling people he doesn’t like such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren a "fraud" and a "racist" but has yet to use such blunt and impassioned language to denounce his white supremacist fans.) If Fallon were a person of color, a woman, a Muslim, disabled or a member of any group that Trump has demonized, you wonder if he would’ve given the candidate a free pass.
