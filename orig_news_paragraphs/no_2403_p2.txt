Until recently, the only vantage point from which we could photograph him was the "press pen," an enclosure in the back of the room at his events, which offers only a   view. Mr. Trump doesnâ€™t like to be photographed from behind, from the side or from below and, as a result, we have had little access to the areas closest to the stage. Photographers covering his campaign went weeks without seeing Mr. Trump interact with supporters on the rope line after his rallies. In the final weeks of the campaign, we have often been ushered out before he has finished his speech.
