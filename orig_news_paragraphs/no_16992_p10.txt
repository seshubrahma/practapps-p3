Trump has hammered the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, calling it a "disaster" and vowing to replace it with "the finest health care plan there is."   The law has had its share of setbacks, the most recent of which was the announcement that premiums are set to skyrocket in 2017.    The prospect of undoing Obamacare will excite even the Republicans who were lukewarm toward Trumpâ€™s candidacy. House Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that, despite his misgivings with Trump, he nevertheless voted for the GOP nominee in part because of the opportunity to get rid of the health care law.
