Iraq was removed from a revised version of an executive order banning travel from certain   countries after intensive lobbying from the Iraqi government at the highest levels, a senior US official told CNN Monday.   President Donald Trump signs new travel ban, exempts Iraq, The new measures will block citizens of Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from obtaining visas for at least 90 days. The new ban, which will be implemented March 16, comes six weeks after Trumpâ€™s original executive order caused chaos at airports nationwide before it was blocked by federal courts.   The ban removes language in the original order that indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and called for prioritizing the admission of refugees who are religious minorities in their home countries.
