Washington (CNN) A version of this report first appeared in May. While President Donald Trump continues to dismiss Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation as a "WITCH HUNT," new questions were raised this week about whether Mueller’s probe will specifically drill down on whether Trump has obstructed justice. A source tells CNN that investigators will soon speak with two senior intelligence officials who were allegedly asked to do Trump’s bidding and publicly deny any evidence of collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia    much like fired FBI Director James Comey claims the President asked him to "let go" of the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
