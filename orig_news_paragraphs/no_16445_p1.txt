Clinton’s main super PAC, Priorities USA, said Saturday it had amassed nearly $40 million in cash on hand, a staggering amount as of August 1, with four months until Election Day. Those funds will be critical to turning out the vote in key states, as well as flooding the airwaves with   advertisements. Clinton’s official campaign, meanwhile, had about $58 million on hand, thanks in part to a    performance with   donors. And the Democratic National Committee, which she fundraises for, pulled in $32.
