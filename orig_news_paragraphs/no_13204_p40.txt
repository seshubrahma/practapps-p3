If you want to talk about scams, the only scam in education that I am aware of is the scam of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton at Laureate university where Bill Clinton was paid millions of dollars where Secretary Clinton was funneling money to this university. You want to talk about legal issues we should focus on, how about this. Hillary Clinton says Barack Obama didnâ€™t go far enough with his executive amnesty. In other words, Hillary Clinton is saying she will take the U. S. Constitution and put it through a shredder.
