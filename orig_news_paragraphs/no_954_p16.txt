Yahoo has said it has not been able to glean much information about that attack, which was uncovered by InfoArmor, an Arizona security firm. The two thefts, the largest known breaches of a private company’s computer systems, had threatened to scuttle a deal that Yahoo struck last summer to sell its internet businesses to Verizon Communications. Verizon sought to shave $925 million from the original $4. 8 billion deal following news of the attacks, but last month, the two companies finally agreed to a $350 million price reduction. Ms. McCord and other officials would not discuss any connection between the charges in the Yahoo case and an ongoing investigation into Russia’s meddling in the November election and a    hack at the Democratic National Committee.
