House Speaker Paul Ryan urges conservatives to rally around his leadership in 2016, to focus on economic growth and to avoid emotional "hot button issues" and "identity politics. " ["We canâ€™t let how someone votes on an amendment to an [ ] appropriations bill define what it means to be a conservative," according to the text of a speech that Ryan delivered to an audience at the Heritage Foundation, which included representatives of Heritage Action, which advocates in Congress for conservative policies.   That barb was likely also aimed at his     critics in the diverse House Freedom Caucus, who favor reduced federal spending.
