Mrs. Clinton’s staff is larger than Mr. Trump’s by nearly tenfold, and her stable of advisers includes the polling and advertising firms that steered President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Trump’s campaign, by contrast, rolled from state to state during the Republican primaries, building   operations as needed, but left few resources behind that he could now draw upon in the general election. In New Hampshire, for example, Stephen Stepanek, a state lawmaker who helped steer Mr. Trump’s primary campaign, said there was catching up to do in the state. He predicted there would be 30 or 40 paid staff members in New Hampshire by July.
