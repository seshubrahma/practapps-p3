" Lewandowski spoke before the Presidentâ€™s news conference Thursday, in which Trump claimed that his White House was running like "a   machine" despite the controversy over his proposed travel ban and the early ouster of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. During the   conversation, Lewandowski, who has maintained friendly relations with the President, said Trump "has begun to fulfill (his) campaign promises" through a number of executive orders. But Lewandowski expressed hope that the White House will learn from its rocky debut and refine internal processes to minimize future political stumbles.
