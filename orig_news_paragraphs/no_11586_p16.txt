I’ve gone through the pain of the VISA process ladies and gentlemen, and I am more against illegal aliens than I ever was after that. I kept screaming my safe word and the immigration officials wouldn’t stop torturing me!   My safe phrase by the way is "Women can be funny".   One of the words you should not use according to the just words campaign is Nazi.
