[Ohio governor John Kasich could win 6 delegates, all from districts currently allocated to Trump, in which case the projection would be Trump 100, Cruz 66, Kasich 6.   The new projections are slightly more favorable for Trump than Breitbart News’ previous projection (94  —   72  —   6) and is based on available public polling data, demographic data and qualitative analysis. That win would likely bring Trump close to the 1, 237 delegates for a majority on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, but not quite over the threshold, leading to a contested convention. Analysis by the Associated Press estimates that Trump would need to win even more decisively in California
