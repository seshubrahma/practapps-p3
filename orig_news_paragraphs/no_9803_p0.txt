Tim Clark, the director of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in the California primary, has not spoken to the candidate in the two weeks since he has been hired, according to the UK Guardian. Clark will only speak with Trump Thursday evening. ["I haven’t talked to him   …      There’s been, you know, email traffic and things like that," Clark said, when pressed by reporter Paul Lewis.
