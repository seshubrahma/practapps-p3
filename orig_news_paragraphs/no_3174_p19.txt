The conversation took place the same day that outgoing President Barack Obama imposed a series of symbolic sanctions   —   including the expulsion of 35 Russian officials and their families   —   against Russia for suspected hacking of Democrats’ emails during the 2016 election. The conversation was recorded by U. S. intelligence agencies, who are normally barred from recording or release Americans’ conversations, unless they’ve got written approval from a special court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
