One of the radical groups that helped to shut down Donald Trump’s Chicago rally has long maintained a close relationship with Sen. Bernie Sanders. [In fact, Sanders raised funds for the group, the Democratic Socialists of America, or DSA, and himself helped to recruit new members to the socialist organization.   Sanders further was a key player in helping to elect   candidates to Congress and was involved in an effort to rebrand and incorporate that   legislative axis within the Congressional Progressive Caucus, or CPC. The DSA in turn was critical in organizing early support for Sanders’ national political career and Sanders has since maintained close working ties to the organization.
