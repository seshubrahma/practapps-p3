The big donations streaming from   powerhouses like   or big financial entities like Bank of America not only whitewashed the policies of interests directly opposed to what the Democratic Party should stand for, but they also clouded the deeper systemic crisis within the party. We can only address climate change, poverty and global inequality by axing the very system benefiting many of the donors to the Clinton Foundation. Fast forward to the 2016 election. There is no doubt in my mind that Bernie Sanders would have defeated Trump.
