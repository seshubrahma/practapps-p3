Washington (CNN) Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer defended his comment Wednesday that the Democratic women who wore white to President Donald Trump ’s joint address were "poorly" dressed, telling CNN that they looked "silly" and that he didn’t buy their argument that it was done in honor of the suffrage movement.   The   congressman from North Dakota also reiterated that he hasn’t ruled out a Senate bid next year for the seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, and he said Trump has already pledged his support should Cramer decide to run.
