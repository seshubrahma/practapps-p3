Critics charge that there is no international body currently capable of overseeing ICANN, and that without the antitrust exemptions it had formerly enjoyed under U. S. law, it will eventually come under the control of the United Nations’ International Telecommunications Union, where repressive governments have considerable influence. Republican presidential nominee issued a statement strongly opposing the handover of ICANN last month. Clinton led Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the overall poll, 44% to 43% in a   race, a result well within the poll’s margin of error, and despite a majority saying that Clinton won the first presidential debate. Libertarian Gary Johnson was third, at 4% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein scored 1% of the vote.
