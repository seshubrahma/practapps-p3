Some even argue that the contrast between Bush, a seasoned politician with a reserved demeanor, and Trump, a        TV star, is helping to make Bush more presidential.   " I think it actually helps Jeb in the long run that a crazy son of a bitch is after him all the time," said Mac Stipanovich, a Florida lobbyist and longtime Bush supporter.
