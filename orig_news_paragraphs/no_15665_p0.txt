 (CNN) A former US ambassador to NATO who has served in both Bush administrations and under President   Clinton issued a strong rebuke Friday night of President Trump’s relationship with Russia. Ambassador Nicholas Burns’ criticism came after a Washington Post report that Russia’s ambassador told Moscow that Jared Kushner, Trump’s    and senior adviser, sought to set up a secret communications channel between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin.
