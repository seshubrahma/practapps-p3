Fearing a certain loss to Baker, Bush’s political director, David Keene, recently contacted his counterpart in the Reagan camp, Charles Black, and proposed a political deal: Bush and Reagan could pull out of the Maine competition in an effort to minimize what they figured would be a public relations game by Baker. Keene confirms that he made the efforts but says that Black turned him down. Now, in the wake of Bush’s victory, Baker official are spreading the word to reporters that Reagan supporters at the GOP forum possibly decided to vote Bush because they were not going to win and were hoping to stop Baker   —   a suggestion that offers a convenient devil theory to cushion the Baker defeat.
