In response, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said, "In light of the letter received from Senators late this afternoon, the Attorney General will respond to their questions along with his amended testimony on Monday."   Earlier Friday, the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee, including ranking member Dianne Feinstein, requested Grassley call Sessions before the panel, saying a written submission from the attorney general to correct the record would not be sufficient. " The Attorney Generalâ€™s responses to our questions during his confirmation process were, at best, incomplete and misleading," the senators wrote in the letter.
