It’s still to be seen. I think     Trump is a very practical person. He prides himself on being a   negotiator, and I think he will soon realize that the climate   issue during the Obama administration became one of the sole   bright spots in the U. S.  relationship. And in any kind of   broader, bilateral relationship, you want to have some things   that are going well, because there’s inevitably going to be   tension on other things.
