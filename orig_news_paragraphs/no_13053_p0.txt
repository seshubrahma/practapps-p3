Thursday on Bloombergâ€™s "With All Due Respect" airing on MSNBC,   John Heilemann warned that in the wake of allegations Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields was assaulted by Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager for Republican presidential   Donald Trump, at a Trump event in Jupiter, FL on Tuesday, it was   for the Trump campaign as a whole to be in a fight with Breitbart.   Heilemann said it was his view that while other media outlets had been hostile, Breitbart had been favorable toward Trump. But he also said the issue was part of a "broader issue. " "I think in general, Donald Trump does not have that many news organizations that have been favorable towards him," he said.
