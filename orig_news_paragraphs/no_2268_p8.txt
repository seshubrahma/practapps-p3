As a former competitive swimmer, I can say that at multiple meets we needed the help of a guard. I watched a   swimmer slip on the start and dive straight down into a   deep competition pool and hit his head so hard he was immediately knocked out and had a dislocated shoulder. Something as simple as compressing your knuckles as you drive your hand into the touch pad may require attention. Always need to expect the unexpected.
