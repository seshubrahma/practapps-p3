The Trump administration should publicly state that the US already has a strategic partnership with Afghanistan until 2024 that was negotiated by the Obama administration and that it promises to maintain a US military "train and advise"   mission for the Afghan army that will stay in the country until the Taliban are contained. Afghans donâ€™t care if the United States has 8, 400 troops in the country, as it does now, or 12, 000 troops or 20, 000 troops. Clearly there is a difference from a purely military point of view but from a political point of view the message Afghans want to hear is that the United States is not abandoning them. A public announcement of such a   commitment to Afghanistan will help NATO and other allies also commit for the long term.
