" I am an evangelical Christian, therefore Glenn Beckâ€™s theology and my theology do not agree," Piper answered, adding: There are many theological issues that Glenn Beck would take that I would challenge him on. If ever given the opportunity in a debate I would hopefully have a cordial and polite discussion with him on theological differences rather than theological syncretism. That aside, I agree with, I think, the premise of your point that you just made, and that is Beck, or Breitbart, or you or me, is a distraction.
