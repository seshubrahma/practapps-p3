Senior foundation officials coordinated with the State Department to give "Friends of Bill" Clinton preferential treatment during earthquake recovery efforts in Haiti in 2010, according to emails obtained by the Republican National Committee through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra pledged $100 million to the foundation in 2005 and later benefited from the foundationâ€™s work in Colombia, where he used the land he acquired in the country to set up an oil business, according to the Post. The foundation has received millions of dollars from foreign governments such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden and Ireland. But donations to the foundation have dropped by 37 percent to $108 million last year after allegations that Hillary Clinton used the charity to solicit   donations from foreign governments and corporations in exchange for favorable treatment from the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.
