The full interview aired Tuesday on "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer" and will   at 8 p. m. on "Anderson Cooper 360. "  Pressed on why the public has a hard time trusting her, Clinton maintained she faced "the same kind of onslaught" in her two New York Senate campaigns and her confirmation as secretary of state, and said Republicans have sought to turn controversies like her use of a private email address and the Clinton Foundation’s actions against her. And that, Clinton said, is why national polls and   surveys have found that a majority of voters say they don’t see her as honest and trustworthy.   A Quinnipiac University Swing State poll found that by margins of 8 to 14 percentage points voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania are skeptical of Clinton’s trustworthiness.
