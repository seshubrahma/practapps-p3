The administration decided against exempting Somalia from the 2013 rules because its adherence to limits intended to avoid civilian casualties was seen as helping to maintain partner support for American operations. Another aspect of the dilemma the administration faces, the officials said, centers in part on the War Powers Resolution, a   War law that limits combat deployments that Congress has not authorized to 60 days. After the March 5 airstrike, the administration argued that the War Powers Resolution limits did not apply to strikes made both to aid African Union forces battling the Shabab and to defend American advisers. The idea was that Americans had been deployed to Somalia in part to counter   Shabab elements, so the 2001 authorization covered their presence and strikes to defend them from any threat.
