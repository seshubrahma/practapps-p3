—   Shia LaBeouf (@thecampaignbook) February 23, 2017,   LaBeouf initially launched his    live stream at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York, hours before Trump was sworn in as America’s 45th President. The concept of the project was to have museum patrons stand in front of a camera placed on a wall, which had the phrase "He Will Not Divide Us" written on it.
