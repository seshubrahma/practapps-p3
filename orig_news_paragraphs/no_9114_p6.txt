On January 5, 2016, President Obama circumvented Congress and instituted new gun controls with the swipe of a pen. These controls will have zero effect on crime, as they deal with pumping more money into federal schemes for smart gun technology, requiring background checks to be performed on a greater number of private sales, and requiring background checks on individuals in family trusts which hold guns. There were other aspects to Obamaâ€™s controls as well, but these are the central points. Whereas Obama instituted these with the swipe of a pen, Trump needs to get out his pen following the inauguration and reverse these measures all as part of saving the Second Amendment.
