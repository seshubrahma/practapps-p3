After a lengthy discussion, Judge Sutton continued, "If there is one thing clear in American law today, it is that the government may not deny an individual a benefit, least of all a constitutional right, based on a   generalization and a   assumption stemming from a   diagnosis or a   institutionalization. " "Tyler has presented plenty of evidence that he is just fine," Judge Sutton concluded. Judge Karen Moore —  a   liberal who is a perfect example of the sort of judge Hillary Clinton would be expected to nominate to the Supreme Court —  wrote an energetic dissent, joined by several other liberal judges. In it, she argued that Tyler should never be allowed to own a gun, and that Congress has all the power it needs to ban gun ownership by many other types of Americans as well.
