A Democratic source said that Democrats on the intelligence committee are resistant to the offer. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said Friday it was too early to say whether they would agree to Flynn’s request, but put Flynn’s offer in greater context. " We should first acknowledge what a grave and momentous step it is for a former National Security Advisor to the President of the United States to ask for immunity from prosecution," Schiff, who later went to the White House as part of the House’s investigation, said in a statement.
