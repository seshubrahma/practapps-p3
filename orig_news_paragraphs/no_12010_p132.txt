Lynch claims "all of the relevant facts" re: Clintonâ€™s email scandal were reviewed by the entire team and they recommended that Clinton be exonerated. Sensenbrenner points out that one of the servicemen sent an email to his colleagues warning them that they may be in danger and he got prosecuted while Clinton did not get prosecuted for trying to avoid scrutiny. He says Lynch has a burden to prove to the public that Clinton does not get to play by a different set of rules. 10:40:
