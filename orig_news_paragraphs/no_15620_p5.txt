The source says Mueller is likely going to want to talk to people involved in the House and Senate investigations to make sure that he has the lead on everything involved with this investigation. On Monday, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence panel, told CNN that he and the committeeâ€™s chairman, North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, hoped to meet with Mueller to talk about what Comey can and cannot say in his testimony. " Our hope is that the chairman and I will be able to sit down and again just kind of get the rules of the road for us going forward with Director Mueller," Warner said.
