@WI_Elections) November 25, 2016,   But instead of a full recount by hand, officials decided a machine recount will suffice and county officials will not be required to count by hand   â€”   though they can if they wish to do so. This means that instead of inspecting and counting each vote by hand, the optical readouts will simply be   through the machines for a recount to be tallied mechanically.
