On Friday, U. S. officials called the use of the    Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb (MOAB) the right weapon at the right time. " This was the right weapon against the right target," Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U. S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said. The MOAB is the U. S. militaryâ€™s largest   bomb, weighing in at over 25, 000 pounds.
