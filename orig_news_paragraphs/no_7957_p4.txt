However, President Barack Obama, the CIA and FBI have all maintained it was their Cold War nemesis behind the leaks, which included devastating revelations about key leaders in the Democratic Party. President Obama used the occasion of his last press conference of the year to drive the point again and to criticize Russia and President Vladimir Putin saying, "the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC and, as a consequence, it’s important to review elements of that and prevent that interference in the future.
