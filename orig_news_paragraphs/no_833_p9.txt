Ladbrokes, a British gambling company, offers a market for bets that the president will resign or be impeached before the end of his first term. On Sunday, that market implied that the chance of such an outcome was 55 percent. At Paddy Power, an Irish competitor running hundreds of markets related to the Trump presidency, the implied probability of impeachment was 40 percent. Other betting opportunities ranged from the likelihood of a third Trump divorce before the end of his presidency to the chance that Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would share a Nobel Peace Prize.
