By making this very careful statement, Trump keeps the looming possibility of Hillary Clinton being indicted alive. Even if the Obama administration gives her a pass, as we all expect, Trump can drive the DC Media insane by keeping the indictment threat alive through the end of the general election. Hillaryâ€™s media will be desperate to put this entire issue to bed after the Obama administration grants her absolution. Trump is not going to allow that to happen, The idea of the Clintons finally facing justice for their sins will also keep the base excited.
