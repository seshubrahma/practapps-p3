In order to more fully evaluate our position if Bill Murray again declines to engage on "Ghostbusters" AG requested that we identify "aggressive" litigation counsel with whom we can consult to evaluate our alternatives and strategize.   [Harkening back to his prior employer, of course, raised the name of David Boies.] Personally, while I’m fine with aggressive, I think we are in much worse shape if this goes public so seems to me we should look for someone who isn’t seeking the spotlight. Can we discuss at some point soon to provide a suggestion or two?
