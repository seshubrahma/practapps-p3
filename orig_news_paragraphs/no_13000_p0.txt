On this weekend’s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday,"   Donald Trump’s incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus denied there was "open warfare" between Trump advisers and loyalists over the possibility of  former Gov. Mitt Romney ( ) being tapped as secretary of state.   Priebus said, "There are a lot of opinions as far as this topic and many other cabinet positions, but I think what   Trump has said is that, as he said the entire campaign, he’s going to hire the best people possible. He ’s going through this process, He’s interviewed Governor Romney, he’s talked to the mayor, he’s talked to others like General Kelly.
