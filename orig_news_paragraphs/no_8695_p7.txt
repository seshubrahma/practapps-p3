According to Planned Parenthood’s own   annual report, however, while taxpayer funding of the abortion business was increased last year, the group’s total number of services dropped by 11 percent. The "cancer screenings" and other preventive services have fallen by 27 percent in just one year, and by 57 percent since 2010. Similarly, Planned Parenthood’s contraceptive services dropped by almost 18 percent in just one year. As for 20 million Americans who "could lose their health care altogether," it’s become obvious to most Americans many of these "newly insured" largely have health insurance cards, but little, if any, access to real health care.
