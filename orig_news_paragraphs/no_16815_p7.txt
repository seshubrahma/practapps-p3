Clinton said.   The New York Times story, which published online Saturday evening, has the potential to be deeply damaging for Trump in the final weeks of the presidential election.   Through an examination of portions of Trump’s 1995 tax records, the New York Times determined that Trump declared $916 million in losses in his 1995 income tax returns    "a deduction that could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years," the article stated.   The Times did not look at Trump’s federal return.
