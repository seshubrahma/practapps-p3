Republicans do not have an agreement even among themselves on the content of legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, the timetable for votes on such legislation or its effective date. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Wednesday that she agreed with Mr. Trump that Congress should repeal the health law and adopt a replacement plan at about the same time. " But I donâ€™t see any possibility of our being able to come up with a comprehensive reform bill that would replace Obamacare by the end of this month," she said.
