We can produce content that is much better and funnier than they can, because they are so obsessed with their juvenile emotions and special interest groups. Anyone unfortunate enough to have sat through the new Ghostbusters film knows I am speaking the truth. My approach is best summarized by G. K. Chesterton, who praised living "hot as the riots of Dionysus, wild as the gargoyles of Catholicism". This has been tremendously effective for me in reaching younger people, and the best part is, laughter and war are infectious.
