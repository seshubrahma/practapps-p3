I’m really not sure what’s achieved by pointing out that your opponent has an attractive wife. Isn’t that a sign of success? Indeed Melania isn’t just a great beauty: she’s proven herself to be eloquent and willing to speak up about immigration, and she is the only   (sorry Jeb) spouse to have gone through legal immigration, unless you count Ted Cruz himself of course.
