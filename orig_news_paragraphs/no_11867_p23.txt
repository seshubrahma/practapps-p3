twitter.    â€”   ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) November 11, 2016,   Earlier on Friday, a group of supporters of   Donald J. Trump held a rally not only for the incoming president but for veterans as they waved signs and flags honoring veterans just outside an entrance to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in north San Diego county. Another part of the motivation behind the rally, that was planned in under two days, was to counter the   protests that had marked the days following the election of Trump to the highest office in the land.
