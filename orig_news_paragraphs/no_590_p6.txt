Morale sank lower last week when Mr. Baker said that Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy editor in chief who had been at The Journal for 22 years, was leaving for The New York Times, where she will become one of the paper’s   editors. The announcement surprised and saddened many in the newsroom, where Ms. Blumenstein had been viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Baker. At Monday’s meeting, Mr. Baker answered questions about The Journal’s strategy going forward and acknowledged that the paper had to address concerns about diversity and offer more opportunities for women in the newsroom.
