Soon afterward, Neil M. Gorsuch  —   then a top Justice Department official  —   sent an email to a White House colleague in case he needed "cheering up" about the administration’s setback. The email from Judge Gorsuch, nominated by President Trump to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, linked to articles about a   provision in the act that undercut the rights of Guantánamo Bay detainees by barring courts from hearing their habeas corpus lawsuits. " The administration’s victory is not well known but its significance shouldn’t be understated," wrote Judge Gorsuch, who had helped coordinate the Justice Department’s work with Congress on the bill.
