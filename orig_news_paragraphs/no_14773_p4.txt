In addition, companies involved have provided CNN with new explanations that at times conflict with each other and still don’t fully explain what happened.      The story    of a possible connection between computer servers    is a strange tale because there are no specific allegations of wrongdoing and only vague technical evidence.      Internet data shows that last summer, a computer server owned by   Alfa Bank repeatedly looked up the contact information for a computer server being used by the Trump Organization    far more than other companies did, representing 80% of all lookups to the Trump server.    It’s unclear if the Trump Organization server itself did anything in return.
