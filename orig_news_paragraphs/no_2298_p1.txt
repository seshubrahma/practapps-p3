Instead when Donald J. Trump showed up for a hastily assembled statelike visit at the presidential palace in Mexico City on Wednesday, he managed to accomplish something that he had failed to do throughout the campaign: communicate his provocative political ideas with something resembling diplomacy.

He described undocumented Mexican immigrants, but not in the ugly, racially charged ways he has in the past. And he talked about building a wall on Americaâ€™s southern border, but in newly measured, less belligerent terms.
