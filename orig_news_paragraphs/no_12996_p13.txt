These Jews have more in common with the party of treason than they do with the most courageous defenders of freedom, individual rights and the freedom of speech. This will destroy the Republican Party, and maybe that is what is needed. When Mitt Romney and his crew of keystone clowns are more vicious toward Donald Trump than they ever were toward Obama or any other of the traitorous Democrats, I say, throw the bums out. We need a revolution.
