"Absent this acceleration of settlement activity, absent the type of rhetoric we’ve seen out of the current Israeli government, I think the United States likely would have taken a different view," he stated. The Times of Israel has more on Rhodes’ statements during the conference call: Rhodes also cited the head of the nationalist Jewish Home party, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, claiming "the era of the   solution is over" following   Donald Trump’s upset victory last month over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.   …     Rhodes also cited past presidents who have abstained from UN Security Council resolutions critical of Israel and said that, up until this point, Obama was the first in decades not to allow a single resolution through during his time in office. The reason for the change now, he said, was that the administration "exhausted every effort to pursue a   solution through negotiations," alluding to the   push by US Secretary of State John Kerry to reach a   agreement in a   time frame, as well as other efforts since 2009.
