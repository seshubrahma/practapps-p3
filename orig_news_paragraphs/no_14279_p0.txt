Washington (CNN) The   House voted Thursday to repeal an   regulation that required the Social Security Administration to disclose to the national gun background check system information about people with mental illness.   The regulation instituted in the final days of the Obama administration required the SSA to share information about those who are considered incapable of managing their own disability benefits due mental illness. The rule sought to limit the ability of those with mental illness to purchase guns but drew criticism for casting too wide a net and not providing the opportunity for due process.
