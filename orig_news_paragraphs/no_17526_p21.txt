Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called McCain "a hero" on Twitter. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain’s, fired off a series of tweets criticizing Trump and questioning his qualifications to be president in light of the comments. But while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz    who has stood out in the 2016 field as a supporter of Trump’s controversial remarks on immigration    defended McCain in a tweet, he notably declined to criticize Trump when asked by reporters to comment on the real estate mogul’s remarks. Instead, he blamed the media for trying to turn Republicans against each other.
