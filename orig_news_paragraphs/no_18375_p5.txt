During the meeting with the two Russian diplomats, Trump went off   script and began to tell them about an ISIS plot related to the   recently implemented laptop ban on some international   flights, officials told the Post. ’ "    The disclosures were likely not illegal, The Post wrote, because   of the president’s broad authorities on declassification. " ’    "The president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats   from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation,"   H. R. McMaster, Trump’’s national security adviser, who was in   the meeting, told the Post.
