The release of the newly available primary documents, which include information not discussed in a   executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into the C. I. A. torture program that was released in 2014, comes at the same time as an urgent legal battle is unfolding over the potential fate of the     full version of that report. Lawyers for two detainees who were subjected to the C. I. A. ’s most extreme "enhanced" interrogation techniques, Mr. Zubaydah and Abd     the suspected mastermind of the deadly October 2000 attack on the American destroyer Cole, are asking federal judges to order the executive branch to deposit a copy of the full report with the judiciary to ensure that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans do not destroy it. But the Obama administration, in its waning hours, is fighting that idea. On Thursday, the judge overseeing Mr. Zubaydah’s habeas corpus case, Emmet G. Sullivan, ordered the United States government to "immediately" preserve a complete, unredacted copy of the Senate report and deposit it with the court for secure storage by Feb. 10.
