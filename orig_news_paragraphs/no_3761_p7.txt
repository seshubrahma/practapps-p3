Reiterating his closeness to the whole Egyptian nation that two days ago suffered "another act of ferocious violence," the Pope prayed that the Lord might "welcome these courageous witnesses, these martyrs, in his peace and convert the hearts of the terrorists. " On Saturday, during a pastoral visit to Genoa, Francis prayed for the victims of the attack and lamented that there were more martyrs today than in early Christian times. He also tweeted about the event, requesting prayers for "our Coptic brethren in Egypt" and highlighting the religious motivation behind the assault.
