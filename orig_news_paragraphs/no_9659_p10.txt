(@PRyan) October 4, 2016,   Despite Sykes’ and Ryan’s repeated denunciations of the Republican nominee, Trump not only won the presidential election (which Ryan was unable to do when he was on the GOP ticket) but he also won Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin (which Ryan was also unable to do when he was on the GOP ticket). Trump ran on a platform that is in direct opposition to Ryan’s personal agenda —   particularly on the key issues of trade, immigration, and crime. Ryan now says that Trump has earned a "mandate" from the American people.
