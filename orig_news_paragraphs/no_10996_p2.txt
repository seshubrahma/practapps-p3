Dr. Carson has cancelled all remaining campaign events today and will be traveling to Omaha this afternoon to be with the family during this difficult time," the press release adds. Carson is expected to meet with Joplin’s family this evening to offer his condolences. Other Republican presidential candidates took to twitter throughout the day to share their condolences and send prayers to Joplin’s loved ones. Trump, who held a rally Tuesday, began the event by asking his supporters to pray for Carson’s campaign staffers and volunteers involved in the accident.
