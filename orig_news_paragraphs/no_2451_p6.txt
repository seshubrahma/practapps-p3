On Saturday, some wept as they studied the long wooden pew in the seventh row in the center of the church where Ms. Ifill and her friends regularly sat, and where, after her death, the church placed a plaque with Ms. Ifill’s name. (The church has placed plaques on other pews for figures like Frederick Douglass.) The funeral became a reunion of Ms. Ifill’s large family and a gathering of luminaries. Michelle Obama, the first lady Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama and Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, sat alongside a number of prominent journalists, including Dorothy Gilliam, Chuck Todd, Roland Martin and Charlayne  .
