In a   with CNN’s Dana Bash at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the GOP vice presidential nominee said Donald Trump was speaking "boldly" as did the 40th president of the United States.    "I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that’s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president," Pence said. But pressed by Bash on the difference between the two nation’s governments    namely that in the US democracy presidents share power with Congress, Pence acknowledged that Trump was not advocating for a dictatorship.
