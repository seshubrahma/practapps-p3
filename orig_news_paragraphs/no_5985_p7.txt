" Within minutes of the Federal Housing Administrationâ€™s announcement [on January 9] that it was cutting annual mortgage insurance premiums, observers were already wondering whether the incoming Trump administration would put a stop to the plan," The National Mortgage News reported when Castro announced the reduction: The FHA said it would cut the premium by 25 basis points, down to 60 basis points, starting on Jan. 27, a week after   Donald Trump is scheduled to take office. That gives Trump and his team a limited window to delay or scrap the cut. Observers said it will likely be a close call, but there are reasons why Trump may want to allow the premium cut to go through.
