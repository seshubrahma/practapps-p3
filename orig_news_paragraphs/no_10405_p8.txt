According to a study by the Partnership for a New American Economy, the   Hispanic and Asian populations in particular could cause the the electoral makeup of 18 key states to change substantively. In New Hampshire, there are a total of 12, 000 unregistered Asian and Latino voters. Between 2012 and 2016 there will be a total of 8, 187 newly eligible Hispanic and Asian voters, by 2020 that number is expected to grow to 16, 968. In a high impact scenario, this demographic change could result in 3, 944 additional democratic voters in 2016 and 6, 057 by 2020.
