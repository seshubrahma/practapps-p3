The new group provides more evidence to back up Trump’s assertion that Obama is tied to the protest movement targeting the Trump administration. Last week, Breitbart News reported that Organizing for Action, the activist group that emerged from Obama’s first presidential campaign, has partnered with the   Indivisible Project for "online trainings" on how to protest Trump’s agenda. One week earlier, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros. On Thursday, the Daily Mail reported that Obama’s top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, has moved into Obama’s   dollar rental home in the nation’s capital.
