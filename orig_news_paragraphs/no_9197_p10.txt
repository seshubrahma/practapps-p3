MACEDONIA’S WALL, So effective is Macedonia’s wall that migrants have been storming it en masse in an attempt to break it down. These are the scenes some people want to avoid on the U. S.  border, and to avoid them, they’d rather allow illegal crossings to continue. But the number of illegal crossings dropped by 90 per cent after Macedonia strengthened its border with Greece, according to figures from the European Union’s own border agency Frontex. In March of this year, 4, 930 people crossed the   border illegally, just 10 per cent of the figure for the same month last year.
