As recorded by historian Kenneth S. Davis in FDR: Into the Storm,   Roosevelt, in his second term in the White House, engaged in a   power struggle with Congress and his own generals and admirals over future military strategy. In 1938, FDR invited Congressional leaders to the White House for a briefing on the war to come.   Startlingly, his vision began with the defense of the Western Hemisphere entirely through air power â€”   Fortress Americas, one might call it.
