Most recently, students at Southern Illinois University (SIU) have demanded that all illegal immigrants residing in the region be given "sanctuary" status on the campus, as Breitbart Texas reported. Students with the Graduate and Professional Student Council and the Undergraduate Student Government are demanding that university officials "begin immediately" crafting a campus policy that would offer comprehensive sanctuary to the Illinois illegal immigrant population from federal immigration laws.
