" The battle for Mosul, now in its sixth month, has taken a heavy toll on civilians, with the Islamic State gathering civilians to use as human shields and, lately, with reports of growing numbers of deaths from airstrikes. The Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said in a statement that more than 3, 800 civilians had been killed in the battle for western Mosul, which began in January. On the eastern side of the city, which was declared liberated in January after months of fighting, 2, 190 civilians were killed, the group said.
