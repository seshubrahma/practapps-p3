NHLA has called upon NBC Universal to follow Univisionâ€™s lead and to both withdraw from the Miss USA telecast and terminate its financial relationship with Donald Trump.    If both the Republican Party and NBCU turn a blind eye or tacitly continue to work with a person who espouses such bigoted rhetoric, it is clear that the Latino community will express its disgust and assert its power, not just through TV ratings but also at the polls.
