2015 was a record year for           residential building permits in New York City —  with           developers pressed by expiring loopholes, the city           authorized nearly 35, 000 new units in the second quarter           and nearly 10, 000 more in the fourth. Total permits           topped 50, 000 —  more than any year since the early 1960s.            And many of them aren’t done yet —  according to the U. S.           Census Bureau,  of all           multiunit projects take more than 13 months from the           permitting date to be completed.
