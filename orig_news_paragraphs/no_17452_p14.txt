Kerry on Wednesday offered the US’s most direct rejection of Israeli claims that the US worked behind the scenes to guide the UN resolution to passage and criticized those claims as an attempt to "distract attention from what the substance of this vote really was all about." "The United States did not draft or originate this resolution, nor did we put it forward," he said, adding that the US simply made it clear to the resolution ’s sponsors that "if the text was more balanced, it was possible we wouldn’t block it. "
