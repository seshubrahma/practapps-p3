Here, De La Hoya references comments made by Trump when he announced his candidacy for president in the summer of 2015. Trump pointed out, correctly, that Mexico has allowed rapists, drug dealers, and other kinds of criminals to cross the border into the U. S. However, Trump didnâ€™t say that all Mexicans coming over the border were rapists and drug dealers. Instead, he pointed out that there are "good people" among them as well, a fact conveniently omitted by De La Hoya.
