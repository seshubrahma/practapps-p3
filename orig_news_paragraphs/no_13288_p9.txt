So the rosy scenario that Tim Kaine tried to portray, I don’t think has any purchase in the general public, and, as I say, it should be used politically to underline the point that Hillary will be Barack Obama’s third term on foreign policy. Bolton said Kaine’s contention that "in a lot of ways, the terror threat has decreased in the Obama years" was "flatly contradicted by senior officials appointed by Barack Obama": The director of National Intelligence, the director of the CIA, have both testified repeatedly, in open public sessions of Congress within the past few months, that the international terrorist is equal to or greater than it was on  . There’s no doubt in my mind that when George W. Bush left office, it was significantly lower. It’s obviously increased the spread of ISIS and other terrorist groups, the collapse of state government across North Africa and the Middle East, the descent of nearly the whole region into anarchy, the spreading number and scope of terrorist attacks in Western Europe and the United States.
