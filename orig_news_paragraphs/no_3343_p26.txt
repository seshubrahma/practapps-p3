Goldman Sachs’ February study, titled "The   Visa Debate: A Global FAQ for Investors," tried to count these extra workers and extra years, saying: "We estimate that 900k to 1mn individuals are working under   visas in the US today, based on the assumption that most existing visas are renewed for a second term, and that about   of qualified   visa holders eventually apply for a green card (based on average wait times and green card quotas for countries affected)   …     figures would be slightly higher when including spouses of   visa holders (which could be as many as 500k people based on prevailing marriage rates of roughly 50% across countries). That number is much larger that a 2011 estimate by the   Center for Immigration Studies, which estimated the population of   to be roughly 650, 000. Additional   Visa Programs, Both the EPI and the Goldman studies ignore different parts of the massive   contract labor force in the United States. The Goldman report understates the total number of     contract workers in the United States by downplaying several additional visa programs that are similar to the   program.
