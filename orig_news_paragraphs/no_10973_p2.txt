Stanford Professor Adam Bonica found that the share of political giving by the Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans to the GOP has plummeted from 68 percent in 1982 to 59 percent during the 2012   of President Obama. According to Bonica’s analysis of two decades of data, Silicon Valley CEOs’ overwhelming percentage of political contributions going to Democrats might be more about gaining economic advantage than being fellow travelers with leftist comrades. Because the vast majority of Silicon Valley tech CEOs supported Barack Obama’s 2012 Presidential   bid, about 83 percent of all employee donations from top tech firms went to Obama. In the 2016 election cycle, the Silicon Valley tech elites are almost exclusively backing the Democratic establishment and its candidate.
