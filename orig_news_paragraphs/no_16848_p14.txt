Perkins said Christians are left to vote for the candidate that will do the most to protect religious liberty. " At this point in the political process, because of our lack of engagement and involvement as Christians, not just in this election but in the government and culture as a whole, we are left with a choice of voting for the one who will do the least damage to our freedoms," he said.   Other public evangelicals offered mixed opinions.
