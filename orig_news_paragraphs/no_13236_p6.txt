In a speech at the end of December, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump said that Hillary "got schlonged" by Barack Obama in 2008.

Rather than apologize, however, Trump turned the tables and accused Hillary Clinton of having enabled Bill Clinton’s affairs and covered up allegations of Mr. Clinton’s sexual assaults against women.
