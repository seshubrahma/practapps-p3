n’t realize that most of my family members, who live in rural Virginia, were voicing their support for Trump online, and I did n’t see any of the   memes that were in heavy circulation before the election. I never saw a Trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds, and the only Election Day selfies I saw were of people declaring their support for Hillary Clinton.
