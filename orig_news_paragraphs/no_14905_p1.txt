His Democratic counterpart on the committee    Rep. Adam Schiff of California    warned that his colleague had cast a "profound cloud" over their effort to investigate Russian attempts to interfere in the election. A Republican source with knowledge of the situation claimed the information that Nunes talked about was from the intelligence community and not the White House. The source said Nunes was "steaming" about what he read. That source said Nunes met with Republican members of the Intelligence Committee before his news conference, and several tried to convince him not to do it before he spoke with Schiff.
