Most millennials polled expressed a renewed commitment to uniting America and found politics more relevant to their lives than they did five years ago.    percent of those polled saw voting as the most effective way to create change, and they saw talking about politics and volunteering as important as well.   " While we spend a lot of time talking about what divides us, younger millennials are seeking leaders who will unite us," polling director John Della Volpe said in a news release.
