Judges are humiliated and dehumanized whenever they must enforce the nation’s immigration laws, according to a senior judge on the   Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. [The judge’s cry of outrage came when he could not block the orderly repatriation of an illegal immigrant who has two drunk driving convictions, plus a U. S. wife and three children.    "We are unable to prevent [Andres] Magana Ortiz’s removal, yet it is contrary to the values of this nation and its legal system," complained Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who wishes to extend citizens’ rights to illegal foreign migrants.
