In 2006 when the GOP was considering   amnesty, Pence categorically rejected the concept, saying that because part of what makes America exceptional is the rule of law, an immigrant’s first action joining this country cannot be breaking that law through illegal entry. So he called for legislation requiring every illegal alien to leave this country at a point of entry, and once there, to register at that point of entry to be able to   legally if he passed a background check and fulfilled other requirements, such as being needed to fill a job. Some hardliners panned this approach as "shadow amnesty," but it is surprisingly similar to Trump’s own proposal. Secure the border, then build a "big, beautiful door" in the security wall so that the federal government can lawfully admit however many immigrants the country needs, at whatever level serves the national interest.
