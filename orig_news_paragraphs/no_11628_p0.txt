Tuesday on his radio show, conservative talker Mark Levin discussed the   "Rule 40" of the Republican National Convention and how it could impact the outcome of the GOP’s presidential nominating process at the RNC in Cleveland in July.   Levin argued the rule was not specific as to when it was applied and also noted there were some questions as to how it would impact the   nominating process. However, he touted Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) as being the candidate that would adhere to the rules of the convention and said following rules, despite what Cruz’s opponents, be it GOP presidential   Donald Trump or anyone in the   "Stop Trump" movement, may lobby for in terms of rule changes, was essential for the process. He was particularly critical of those in the "Stop Trump" movement that would opt not to vote, or to vote for Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton, should the general election   be Clinton versus Trump.
