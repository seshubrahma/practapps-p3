shacks pushing up out of the ground like unruly weeds.    We hired a guide, Luis, to take us through the valley on   horseback, and we sat in his   house while he saddled the   horses. He had clearly built the stable himself and the horses,   of which he had five, were unkempt and thin, but he cared for   them lovingly. He took us past his house and through tobacco   fields, a coffee plantation, and several caves.
