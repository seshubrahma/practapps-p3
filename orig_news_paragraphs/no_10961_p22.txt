I see   conservatives who have had enough of mainstream politicians ignoring their concerns about immigration and cultural politics. I see intellectuals desperate to discuss dangerous, forbidden ideas as the left tries to make the overton window narrower and narrower. And millennials are proving phenomenally talented at converting their parents, who might be disaffected republicans or tea partiers with   thinking. Iâ€™m sure a few people in the room have gotten Harambe jokes from their parents and that scares the left to death.
