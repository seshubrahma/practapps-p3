For example, an executive who is paid $1 million in salary could instead form a limited liability corporation to "sell" $1 million of management services to his or her old company, cutting the tax rate to 15 percent. What Mrs. Clinton would do: She envisions a 4 percent tax surcharge for income over $5 million, meaning that the very highest earners would effectively have a nearly 44 percent top marginal rate. She also envisions implementing a rule so that those with income over $1 million pay at least 30 percent, aimed at preventing high earners from paying low overall rates thanks to the lower capital gains tax. She would also limit the value of tax deductions, and require longer holding periods to get the low   capital gains tax rate, among other steps that would make the tax code less favorable to the affluent.
