The lawsuits join a larger effort to try to turn electors against voting for Trump. Last week, Breitbart News reported Harvard law professor and progressive activist Larry Lessig announced that he is teaming up with a   law firm to offer "free and confidential" legal services to any members of the Electoral College who will vote against   Donald Trump in violation of state law. Lessig, a   presidential candidate, has served on the boards of numerous groups financed by billionaire George Soros. Lessigâ€™s Electoral College scheme, which is being called the Electors Trust, is a   effort to stop Trump from becoming president.
