Washington (CNN) The nomination of President Donald Trump’s Army secretary is in serious jeopardy, and he could be withdrawing as soon as this week, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Mark Green, Trump’s second pick to be Army secretary, is facing what the sources described as a difficult    if not insurmountable    path to confirmation amid a backlash over his controversial statements on LGBT issues, Islam and evolution. The sources said that Green’s withdrawal is not finalized, but it’s unlikely he would go forward because "there are questions whether he has enough support from either side of the aisle" to get confirmed, according to one source.
