(@jamesjohnson252) December 9, 2015,   In June, Mr. Johnson shared a tweet, commenting "worth a read" which described a Trump rally as "horrifying" like a "security state" and akin to "Nuremburg".   Trump supporters meanwhile were described as violent "people who never learned to love" while one is claimed to have done a "war dance". This is worth a read.
