Yesterday, on the National Day of Prayer, President Trump signed a new executive order.   Itâ€™s named Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty.   The president says, under his administration, free speech does end at the steps of a cathedral, a synagogue, or any other house of worship.    And what his executive order could do is give churches and other religious organizations more flexibility to endorse or oppose political candidates.
