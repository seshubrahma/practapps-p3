In 2012, as a result of the sentencing, Ukraine faced the possibility of an unfavorable ruling from the European Court of Human Rights, and US lawmakers were considering sanctions. In response to the deteriorating international climate, Ukrainian prosecutors say, Manafort drafted a public relations strategy that included hiring Skadden to review the Tymoshenko case and show the conviction had a sound legal basis.   But a spokeswoman for the US State Department in 2012 said the report Skadden eventually came out with "was incomplete and doesn’t give an accurate picture. "  Prosecutors told CNN that Ukraine’s Justice Ministry had signed an agreement with Skadden to provide legal services for the equivalent of only $12, 000, the legal limit above which it would have been necessary to hold a public competition to award a government contracting job.
