The Ninth Circuit avoided clashing completely with the Seventh Circuitâ€™s Moore decision. Doing that would make it very likely that the Supreme Court would take this case. Judge William Fletcher did so for the court by writing: We do not reach the question whether the Second Amendment protects some ability to carry firearms in public, such as open carry. That question was left open by the Supreme Court in Heller, and we have no need to answer it here.
