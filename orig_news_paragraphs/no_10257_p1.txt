The idea that Donald Trump doesn’t have a mandate after he got 100 more electoral votes than Mitt Romney did, he got 306, it wasn’t close. He won states that had not gone Republican in decades. Had this been a race for the popular vote, we would have won that, too. Mr. Trump would have campaigned in California, in New York, stayed in Florida, gone to Illinois perhaps.
