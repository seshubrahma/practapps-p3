The lesson in these numbers is that if leaders don’t heed suburbanites, they could pay a price politically and miss an opportunity for sound policy.   Almost every one of the approximately 40 congressional seats identified by both parties as competitive this year were wholly or substantially suburban. They’re filled with moderates who "vote the person, not party"    but who will and do punish those who let them down with partisan or ideological lurches from the mainstream. The whipping that the Democrats took in 2010, when they lost control of Congress, isn’t the first time presidents and parties faced a quick backlash to voters’ remorse.
