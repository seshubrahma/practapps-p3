No party preference candidate Ryan Glenn Wingo received 3. 7 percent of the primary election vote. Under California’s   primary system only Issa and Applegate moved on, leaving Wingo’s supporters up for grabs. Back in February Issa warned that Donald Trump, not yet the Republican presidential nominee, could be the next Rep. Todd Akin whose comment about women contributed to the loss of his congressional seat. Issa heavily backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for president.
