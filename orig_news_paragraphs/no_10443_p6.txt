Progressives have long excoriated   education companies for placing profits over quality pedagogy. Still, for five years, Bill Clinton allowed his face and name to be plastered all over Laureate’s marketing materials.

That Laureate has campuses in Turkey is odd, given that   colleges are illegal there, as well as in Mexico and Chile where Laureate also operates.
