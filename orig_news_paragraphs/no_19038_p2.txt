—   the conflicts     of interest, both perceived and real, that would be created by     a global foundation headed by the man who was the 42nd     president of the US and the woman who would be the nation’s      45th.   " ’     US election law bars a candidate from accepting donations from     foreign entities and corporations, but it makes no such     restrictions on who can and cannot cut a check to the family     foundation of that same candidate. While the Clintons are now     promising to build that firewall for themselves if they win the     White House, this announcement does nothing to prevent foreign     entities from splashing the foundation pot during the final     months of the general election.   ’ "     The Clintons’ cozy relationship with their foundation’s global     patrons was a problem when Hillary was secretary of state, and     it is a problem now that she’s running for president. And it     would remain one if she ends up in the White House, since the     foundation is still actively accepting donations today, when     she is the overwhelming favorite to get there.
