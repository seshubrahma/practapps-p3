 (CNN) Rep. Cedric Richmond apologized to White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Sunday night for making crude remarks at a Washington dinner last week about a photo showing Conway on her knees on an Oval Office sofa.   " After a discussion with people I know and trust, I understand the way my remarks have been received by many," the Louisiana Democrat said in a statement.
