A spokesman for the NFL told the Times that these transcripts are not meant to be full,    transcripts of the events. The paper further notes that the NFL has "sanitized its Super Bowl transcripts in past years," with a reminder that two years ago the league also left controversial comments by Seattle Seahawks’ Richard Sherman out of transcripts. Andrew Bucholtz of AwfulAnnouncing. com points out that the questions missing from the NFL transcripts aren’t necessarily excised from the historical record, because reporters make their own recordings at these events.
