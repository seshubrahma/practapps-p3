Washington (CNN) A senior US military official told CNN Monday that intelligence collection wasn’t the only objective of the recent military raid in Yemen but the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula had also been targeted. If the leader, Qassim   wasn’t there, the US military believed it would find intelligence that would help lead to him, the official said, though the official cautioned that the mission was not greenlit based on whether it was thought   would be at the site. US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, and the Pentagon are strongly denying   was an objective of the raid just over a week ago.
