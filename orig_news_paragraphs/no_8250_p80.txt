Mark Watson, a veteran, cites Ferguson and  asks why aren’t we using technology to better protect communities. Paul talks about how so much of Ferguson’s budget was composed of trivial fines that targeted people living on the edge of poverty. He says the "war on drugs" has "disproportionately affected our   community" and we need to make sure there is "equal protection under the law" re: war on drugs and America doesn’t incarcerate another generation of young   men.
