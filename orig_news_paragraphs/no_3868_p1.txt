The Washington Examiner’s Sarah Westwood reported on Sunday that Gorka, an   News national security editor, was leaving the White House for another federal agency. " Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Trump, will soon accept a position outside the White House, two sources told the Washington Examiner on Sunday," Westwood wrote: Gorka’s new role will deal with the "war of ideas" involved in countering radical Islamic extremism, a senior administration official said, and will entail an appointment to a federal agency. Gorka has served for months on the Strategic Initiatives Group, an internal organization within the White House, and as a national security adviser.
