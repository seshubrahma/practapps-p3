"  Trump has said on multiple occasions that he respects states’ right to establish their own marijuana policies. We would expect appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president to stick to the president ’s position on this subject," said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project in a statement to CNN. Others suggest he will see the majority of Americans support legalization efforts.
