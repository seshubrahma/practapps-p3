Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım reiterated that resolve hours before Erdogan met with Trump, telling reporters that Turkey was open to doing "what is necessary" to keep the YPG from participating in the fight against the Islamic State, implying military action. Shortly after the Pentagon’s announcement that Washington would provide the Syrian Kurds with heavy weapons, the Turkish military executed airstrikes against YPG positions in Syria. While Trump confirmed in a joint statement following their meeting Tuesday that he opposed the PKK, he did not walk back his administration ’s support for the YPG.
