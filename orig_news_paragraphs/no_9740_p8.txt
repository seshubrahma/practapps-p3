Sanders, on the other hand, is attempting a real change in what the Democratic Party actually believes. Or, alternatively: Sanders wants to finish what Barack Obama started in 2008, when it still had to be shrouded in euphemisms, pandering, sockpuppetry and lies. Sanders promises: punitive taxes on the rich government health care for all free college amnesty for illegal aliens, radical cuts to the military and Israeli surrender. Obama took big steps towards these goals, but Sanders wants to cement them.
