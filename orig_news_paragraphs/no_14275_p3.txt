Three US service members were also wounded and a $70 million Osprey helicopter that took a "hard landing" was destroyed.   According to medics at the scene, 10 civilians were also killed, including women and children. One of the victims was the    daughter of the militant   cleric Anwar   who was killed six years ago in a CIA drone strike. She was the second of Awlakiâ€™s children to be killed by the United States.
