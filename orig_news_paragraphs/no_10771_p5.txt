Upon learning of the results, the Cruz campaign released the following statement: We had a tremendous show of grassroots support that resulted in a critical victory at todayâ€™s Wyoming Republican Convention. This victory continues a momentum shift that started in Utah and carried through Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Colorado. Grassroots are rising up. Republicans overwhelmingly elected delegates who will support us at the national convention and nominate us to take on Hillary Clinton.
