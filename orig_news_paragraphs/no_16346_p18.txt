Obama, for his part, is enjoying some of the best approval ratings of his second term and is in a unique historical position    though it remains to be seen to what extent his politicking helps Clinton. Still, since the passage of the 22nd Amendment limiting a presidentâ€™s time in office to two elected terms was ratified in 1951, Obama is in perhaps the best political shape of any   incumbent. Dwight D. Eisenhower cut back on his political activity due to advancing age and was of limited help to Vice President Richard Nixon in the 1960 campaign. Reagan was hobbled by the   affair and lacked the vigor of Obama despite his campaign trail appearances for Bush.
