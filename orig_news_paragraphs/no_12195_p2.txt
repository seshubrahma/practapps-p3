In the interests of the ongoing prosecution investigators will not be releasing any more information, but the examining magistrate will reportedly decide later if any of the suspects who were taken for questioning will actually be arrested. The raids are merely the latest in a string of   incidents witnessed by the Belgian capital in recent years. Several suspects allegedly connected to Novemberâ€™s terrorist attacks in Paris lived in Brussels, including the troubled Molenbeek district in which some of the raids occurred. Brussels itself was placed under the highest level terror threat from 21 November to 26 November, during which time bars, restaurants, museums, shops and even schools were restricted in opening times or closed, and the entire metro system was shut down.
