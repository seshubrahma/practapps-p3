A former campaign spokeswoman for Bush, Kristy Campbell, quickly fired back Saturday, calling Trump’s "obsession" with Bush "unhealthy." "Donald Trump’s unending obsession with @JebBush is really unhealthy," Campbell wrote.   Campbell referred CNN to her tweet when asked for comment on Trump’s assertion. A group of Republican delegates, led by Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh, began organizing last week to change the convention rules so bound delegates could abstain from voting for Trump by citing a moral objection to him.
