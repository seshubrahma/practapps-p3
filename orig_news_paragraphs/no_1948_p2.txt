And it traces the outlines of the enduring split in the Republican Party between establishment figures who scoffed at Mr. Trumpâ€™s chances of victory and the   insurgents who backed him as a disrupter of the Washington power structure. The most publicly vocal faction has been the group opposed to Mr. Romney, which has questioned whether he would be loyal after his searing criticism of Mr. Trump during the campaign.

Mr. Trump, who is always difficult to read and is capable of changing his mind at any minute, has also praised Mr. Giuliani in recent conversations with acquaintances.
