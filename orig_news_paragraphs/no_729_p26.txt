Already a senior herself, Bersabe works 65 hours a week caring for two elderly clients with dementia. She spends five   and   night shifts in her clientsâ€™ homes, providing companionship, reminders to take medicine and light housekeeping for one client, and everything from bathing and dressing to diaper changing for the other. Having two jobs is partly a necessity and partly a hedge should one of her clients die, she can still rely on income from the other. She also needs the money.
