The businessman who has made billions and created many thousands of jobs, or the politicians who have spent their life in the swamp? I’d like to end this speech with a quick note about the men and women I’ve been speaking about, the white working class of America. As a foreigner, I’ve had more exposure to the working class during this tour than I ever had before. They’ve been at my shows, spoken to me in public, and I’ve come to know them.
