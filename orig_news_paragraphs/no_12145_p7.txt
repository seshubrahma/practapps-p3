We’re not going to let them change the rules on us and put someone in that hasn’t worked for the position," Beavers told Bannon on Breitbart Radio Saturday, heard on the Patriot Channel 125 of the   Radio Network. As Breitbart News reported previously, Beavers, Gill, and former State Rep. Joe Carr, a Cruz delegate who narrowly lost to incumbent Sen. Lamar Alexander in the 2014 Republican U. S. Senate primary, met on Friday to prepare the agenda for the larger meeting, which will be held before the end of March. " This story has caught fire on Breitbart, and people are talking about it all over," Bannon noted.
