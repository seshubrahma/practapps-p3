Thus, Congress can legitimately investigate any question "on which legislation could be had and would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit."   As the court explained in Watkins v. United States (1957) the power of Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes.
