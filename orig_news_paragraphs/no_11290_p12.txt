As for what Bannon’s   said in their divorce papers, don’t even go there. People are at their worst during a divorce. They will say anything and do anything to get the kids, the money, the house, whatever. It is all wild mudslinging, and I accuse "journalists" such as Jake Tapper of committing defamation and libel in their rage over the fact that that quisling crook Hillary lost and lost big.
