Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said that the state party "cheated" Donald Trump at Saturday’s convention, where Ted Cruz won most of the delegates up for grabs despite Trump’s victory in the Arizona primary. [Trump supporter Brewer ran for delegate but lost the election. Brewer then came forward and announced that her name was left off electronic ballots and that "glitches and errors" led to Trump’s poor showing. Cruz supporters reportedly won "virtually all the 28   national delegates," while Cruz won about a half of the other 27 delegate slots, according to the Associated Press.
