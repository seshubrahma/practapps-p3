During this time, Schumer gave a passionate speech about how preventing an    vote on judicial nominees was profoundly undemocratic, and an assault on the constitutional order. So Democrats created that precedent on November 21, 2013, one that did not address the Supreme Court simply because there was no Supreme Court vacancy at the time.
