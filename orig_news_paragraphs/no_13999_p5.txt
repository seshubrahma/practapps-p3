The power to grant pardons and commutations is written into the US constitution as one of the president’s clearest unilateral prerogatives. With large batches often coming in the final weeks of an administration, an act of clemency cannot be challenged in court or overturned by Congress. President George W. Bush granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations, including reducing the prison term for I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the probe of the leak of the name of a CIA operative. President Bill Clinton issued a flurry of pardons on his final day in office, including for financier Marc Rich and the president’s   Roger Clinton.
