Rubio’s push to expand the record rate of immigration even higher will, ironically, disenfranchise the GOP voters Rubio is courting.   lawmaker and mass migration supporter Trey Gowdy, who has endorsed Rubio, received around 126, 452 votes in his last election in the span of one decade, Rubio’s bill would have brought in 261 immigrants for every one Gowdy voter.    lawmaker Jason Chaffetz, who similarly endorsed Rubio, received around 94, 571 votes —  or nearly three times less voters than Muslim migrants admitted to the U. S. each year. Yet Rubio’s new   bill dramatically expands Muslim immigration.
