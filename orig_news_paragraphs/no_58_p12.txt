Mr. Cruz said he spoke on Friday with Bryan Santiago, who relayed that the family was shocked by the news of the killings. The family offered no known motive for the crime, but noted that Esteban had recently been hallucinating and was receiving psychological treatment. " Bryan said his brother went to Iraq or Afghanistan, one of those places, and came back with psychological problems," Mr. Cruz said.
