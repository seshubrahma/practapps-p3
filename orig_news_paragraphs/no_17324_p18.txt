His appointment would cause a massive conflict of interest, giving ExxonMobil    a company that investigative reports have shown covered up their own climate research and misled the public for decades    an unprecedented ability to sway foreign policy to protect their own interests," he charged. While ExxonMobil, like other energy firms, has incurred the wrath of environmental groups, it did back the Paris climate accord concluded by the Obama administration this year. Tillersonâ€™s personal views on the agreement are unclear, though he has said there is a human contribution towards climate change and backed a carbon tax. Trump has called climate change a "hoax" and suggested he could pull out of theinternational Paris agreement outlining individual emission limits for member countries.
