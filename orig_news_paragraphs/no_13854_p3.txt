But The Benjamin is crafting more than luxury cocktails     it caters a full experience for visitors, locals and hotel guests and curious tourists alike. Ladies in fur coats and businessmen sip in the palatial lobby of the   Old Post Office building, decked with chandeliers, marble floors, a display of televisions tuned to ESPN, Bloomberg and Fox News, an impressive collection of crystal decanters lining the walls, and contemporary jams pumping through the Bose sound system.   Servers don white gloves to facilitate tastings of wine "by the crystal spoon," poured out in   portions, and sipped through the handle, per Hungarian tradition.
