The lines come from a letter that Shakur wrote titled "To My People," where she describes herself as a "Black revolutionary" who "declared war on the rich who prosper on our poverty, the politicians who lie to us with smiling faces, and all the mindless,   robots who protect them and their property. " Shakur is a hero to communist revolutionaries for her involvement in the 1960s and 1970s with a violent, criminal Black Panther Party offshoot called the Black Liberation Army. Shakur and the group robbed several banks as a "revolutionary act" and eventually killed a New Jersey State Trooper with his own gun after a highway stop in 1973.
