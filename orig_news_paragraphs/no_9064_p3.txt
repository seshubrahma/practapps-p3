That totals 164 electoral votes. Despite initial polling scares during the darkest days of Trump’s campaign in also reliably red Georgia and Arizona, both of those states —  per recent polling —  have seemingly moved solidly into the Trump column. That’s another 27 electoral votes, for a total of 191 electoral votes with the other red states. From there, add in Florida with 29 electoral votes.
