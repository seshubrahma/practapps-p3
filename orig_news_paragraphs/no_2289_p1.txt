It was at a hospital there, a week and a half ago, where Ms. Fernandez learned she had lost her home, too, to flooding. She explained this to President Obama on Tuesday afternoon as he walked through that house, emptied of all the furniture except for what was too heavy to haul outside. He hugged her four times and they had their picture taken. Others may have debated the timing of Mr. Obamaâ€™s visit and whether he was too late in coming to this   state, but Ms. Fernandez wiped tears from her eyes and said she had not been following any of that.
