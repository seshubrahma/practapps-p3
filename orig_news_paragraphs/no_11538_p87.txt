Cruz says that the middle class has been left behind in the Obama economy and weâ€™ve got to bring jobs back, get people back to work, get wages up again, and get people to move from   work to   work. He says this is not going to be solved by magic pixie dust and we have to understand the principles that made America great. Cruz describes his "flat an fair" tax plan that will abolish the IRS because Americans will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard. Garrett pushes Cruz on the VAT and he says his business flat tax is not a   VAT that is a sales tax.
