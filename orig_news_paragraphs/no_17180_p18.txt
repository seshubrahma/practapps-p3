This election cycle was unique in the degree of foreign interference witnessed throughout the campaign: the U. S. government concluded that Russian state actors were behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the personal email accounts of Hillary for America campaign officials, and just yesterday, the Washington Post reported that the Russian government was behind much of the "fake news" propaganda that circulated online in the closing weeks of the election," he wrote. A senior administration official said in a statement that there is no evidence of any hacking. " The federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day," the official said.
