The meeting marked the first time Cruz and Trump met in person since the Texas senator dropped out of the presidential race more than two months ago. Priebus told Fox News Thursday that Trump and Cruz had "a good conversation," but said that because the meeting was private, he wouldn’t go into specifics.   " I’ll just say they had a good conversation and it was very polite and cordial and normal," Priebus said.
