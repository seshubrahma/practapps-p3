" The issue of illegal immigration was a major campaign theme for Trump, who framed it as an economic and security challenge threatening the US. One of his first acts as president was to sign two executive orders for construction of a   border wall and increasing the number of border patrol officers and immigration enforcement officers who carry out deportations. During the campaign, Trump went to Mexico City to meet Pe√±a Nieto and said he discussed the wall but not who would pay for it    a claim the Mexican president disputed.
