And the reason is quite simply that itâ€™s too soon. Too soon since Hillary Clinton lost the election and gave the White House to Trump    because, regardless of what strengths Trump might have had, 2016 was ultimately an election for the Democrats to lose. I have no doubt that almost any other candidate could have beaten Trump. Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Alec Baldwin, Big Bird.
