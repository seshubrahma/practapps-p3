" These defendants made several statements about Mrs. Trump that are 100 percent false and tremendously damaging to her personal and professional reputation," attorney Charles Harder said as he filed the suit last year. Lawyers for Tarpley and The Daily Mail had asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, but this week Judge Sharon Burrell rejected arguments to summarily dismiss the lawsuit for failing to meet the "actual malice" standard for libel against public figures, Politico reported. Judge Burrell said that it seemed pretty clear that "  escort" can be construed to mean "prostitute," and by that understanding there was enough to justify a charge of libel.
