All of which leaves me with a question: Why did Trump conclusively say that the Manila incident was terror on Thursday afternoon even though ISIS didn’t claim credit for it until Thursday night and the Manila police continued to insist today that this was simply not a terror attack? Did Trump know something we didn’t? Or the Manila police still don’t? According to the White House, national security adviser H. R. McMaster had briefed Trump on the situation before he arrived in the Rose Garden.
