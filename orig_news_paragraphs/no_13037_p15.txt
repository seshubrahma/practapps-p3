my supporters have tremendous love of this country. Theyâ€™re tired of our country being ripped off by everybody, and I will tell you you would have had a tremendous clash and a lot of people would have gotten hurt or worse, and by canceling it, everybody dispersed beautifully. The police did a great job. The secret service was fantastic, and there was no injuries, no nothing.
