In light of the apparent conflicts of interest, I have called repeatedly on Attorney General Lynch to appoint a special counsel to ensure the investigation is as far from politics as possible," Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. " This incident does nothing to instill confidence in the American people that her department can fully and fairly conduct this investigation, and thatâ€™s why a special counsel is needed now more than ever," he said. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, seized on the incident, describing it in a radio interview as a "sneak" meeting and saying it exposed the rigged nature of the process.
