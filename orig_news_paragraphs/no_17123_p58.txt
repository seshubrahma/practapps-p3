One group that took advantage of that opening was the Redeemers, a popular movement led by conservative,   politicians who vowed to "save" the South, said Podair, who is writing a book on Bayard Rustin, a close aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The Redeemers gained control of most Southern statehouses and pledged to reduce the size of government. They defunded public schools, closed public hospitals and halted road construction, Podair said, all while cutting taxes for the wealthy plantation owners, the 1 percenters of their day. The Redeemers cloaked their rhetoric in the need for more government efficiency, but their goals were also racial, Podair said.
