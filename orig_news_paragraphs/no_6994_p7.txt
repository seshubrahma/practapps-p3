Rajoub, who has in the past stated that he is proud he served time in an Israeli jail for lobbing a grenade at a bus full of IDF soldiers in 1970, later tried to deny he ever made such a statement.

S. president to visit the Western Wall, but did so as a private visit. Last week, U. S. envoy to the UN Nikki Haley visited the wall in what was also billed as a private visit.
