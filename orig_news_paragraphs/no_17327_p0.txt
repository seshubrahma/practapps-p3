Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama has vowed the US will retaliate against Russia "at a time and place of our own choosing" for Moscow’s hacking attempts to influence the country’s elections. A growing chorus of powerful voices on Capitol Hill    including Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate    is calling for a bipartisan probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential vote. But   Donald Trump has rejected out of hand any suggestions of Russian influence on the election    despite the CIA concluding that Russia acted to help Trump win.
