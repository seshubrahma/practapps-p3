Cohen served as executive vice president and special counsel at the Trump Organization during Trump’s presidential campaign and did not hold a formal title in the campaign. But he was a prominent TV surrogate for Trump during the campaign and led the National Diversity Coalition in support of it. Cohen has repeatedly pushed back on allegations that he was involved in any coordination with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. Ryan, Cohen’s   attorney, is the head of government strategies at McDermott, Will and Emery.
