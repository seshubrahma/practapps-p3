The scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton’s health "means that Tim Kaine has to step up his game," said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. " He’s such an unknown quantity to the American people that he now has to kind of assume the mantle of what it would be like to have him as commander in chief, not just vice president," Mr. Brinkley said. Nine vice presidents have assumed the presidency during a president’s term, eight because of a death and one because of a resignation.
