For the vote in the House, each state delegation votes among themselves and the winner inside the delegation is awarded the state’s single vote. Given that the Republicans hold the majority of 36 delegations, the Democrats hold 13 and Maine is a   tie, if the vote goes to the House, Trump wins in a huge landslide. The Electoral College is also determined by state, except Nebraska and Maine, which allow congressional districts to vote separately, regardless of the statewide vote. Voters are actually voting for a slate of electors chosen by the presidential candidate’s party to participate in the real election that happened in November.
