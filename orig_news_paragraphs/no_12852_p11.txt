This president has announced to the world that he would like his college to have a reputation like the University of Missouri, which has lost tens of millions in donations because they caved into the regressive left.   Instead of taking the route of the University of Chicago, which is attracting accolade after accolade in the press for standing up for free speech and against safe spaces and trigger warnings, he wants to consign his college’s reputation to oblivion. Well, fine! If that’s what he wants, I’ll happily help him do it!
