not omnipotent —   no country ever is —   but in its                   foreign policy it is acting like a global power                   broker, and doing so effectively. It has an                   ideological underpinning, in the revived doctrine                   of                    which asserts that Russia’s status as an imperial                   power is a natural outgrowth of its geographical                   position between Europe and Asia.
