As we drove through a padlocked gate, McGinty noted that various systems of alarms and sensors ring the   neighborhood, a place where retaining walls and old water pipes are still visible sticking up from the sandy ground. The views of the sea are incredible. If an alarm goes off, it could just be kids sneaking in to smoke pot, he pointed out, or it could be something far worse. He mentioned the possibility of a terrorist group or   gang smuggling   missiles into the city with the goal of shooting down planes at LAX.
