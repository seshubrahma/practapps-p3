Through his inexcusable comments, Mr. Tanner has clearly demonstrated that he possesses neither the character nor the judgment to be heading the Voting Rights Section. For that reason, I respectfully request that you remove him from his position. Sincerely,   Barack Obama, United States Senator, 4) April 28, 2008   â€”
