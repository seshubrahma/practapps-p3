That’s why the British government has approved a project that would build a traffic tunnel underneath Stonehenge and also widen the highway nearby.    The government says it will give a boost to local economy, as well as shorten drivers’ trip times and reduce traffic congestion.

But critics say the tunnel won’t significantly help traffic and that it could destroy any ancient artifacts that might still be hidden underneath Stonehenge.
