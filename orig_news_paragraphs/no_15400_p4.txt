Carter said closer to the general election that he intended to vote for the eventual Democratic nominee, and said again he believed Clinton would win, while noting Sanders’ support among young voters. At the time, he also said he’d rather vote for   Donald Trump over Sen. Ted Cruz. Like Sanders, Carter has long railed against the influence of money in politics. He said in 2015 that the US was essentially no longer democratic in nature.
