President Trump’s claim on Twitter early Saturday that he had "just found out" that "President Obama was tapping my phones in October," an accusation for which he offered no evidence, has set off another spasm surrounding his young administration. On Sunday, Mr. Trump’s spokesman said the administration was asking Congress to investigate the president’s allegation. There is ample reason for caution because Mr. Trump has a history of making   and politically explosive claims that have no basis in fact. As things stand, a plausible explanation is that Mr. Trump was merely riffing off a March 3 article on the   website Breitbart.
