GOP SHUT OUT OF U. S. SENATE RACE? At the time that Congresswoman Barbara Boxer won her U. S. Senate seat in 1992, edging out television commentator Bruce Herschensohn, California was a competitive state for Republicans statewide.

The blue state blues of the California GOP may sink to a new level soon, thanks to the 2010 passage by voters of Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€™s "top two" election system, replacing the old traditional primary process.
