Since the Obama administration is on track to exceed that number in Fiscal Year 2016, it appears very likely that whatever number of refugees Congress authorizes to bring in the country in Fiscal Year 2017 the politically powerful resettlement industry, in conjunction with ideologically aligned federal and state bureaucrats, will make certain that the actual number of refugees brought in will significantly exceed what Congress authorizes. In August, the Refugee Council USA, the resettlement industryâ€™s lobbying arm, called for a more than doubling of refugee resettlements in Fiscal Year 2017 to 200, 000: The U. S. should commit to provide protection to 200, 000 refugees through admission to the United States in FY17 through a combination of traditional refugee resettlement and additional legal, proven and secure approaches. At least 140, 000 of these refugees should be resettled through the existing U. S. refugee resettlement program, with the necessary support for receiving and integrating them in American communities. To do any less would represent a U. S. commitment that falls short of the call made by the White House for a collective doubling of resettlement commitments in advance of the Summits.
