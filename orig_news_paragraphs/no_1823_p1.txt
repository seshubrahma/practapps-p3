After several days in Brooklyn, I was realizing not just how huge it was, but how flat  â€”   so even the smallest changes in altitude provided for some great panoramas. The highest natural point in Brooklyn, Battle Hill, stands (at a mere 220 feet) within the cemetery. Walking the lush, quiet grounds, perusing different headstones of the over   people interred (including Samuel Morse, Boss Tweed and   Basquiat) provided a sanctuary from the city. But it was also a promising stop in my quest to discover the essence of the borough today
