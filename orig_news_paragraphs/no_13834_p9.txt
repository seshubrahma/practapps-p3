"Make America Sick Again" in a play off of   Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, Democrats are warning that Republicans are about disrupt millions of people’s health coverage    without offering an alternative solution.

GOP leaders are currently considering passing a repeal bill but holding off on the repeal from going into effect for a few years.
