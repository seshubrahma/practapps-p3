The constitution requires Egypt’s government to provide "enough financial allocations to achieve its purposes," and forbids the secular government from dismissing the Grand Sheikh who oversees the university. Egypt is about 90 percent Sunni Muslim. While the Sisi government occasionally reaches out to other religions in various ways, especially Coptic Christians, there is no question that Egyptian law discriminates against   in many ways, including apostasy prosecutions for those who convert away from Islam. For example, from the State Department’s 2015 report on Egypt:  In keeping with sharia,   men must convert to Islam to marry Muslim women, although   women need not convert to marry Muslim men.
