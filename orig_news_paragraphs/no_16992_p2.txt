The wall, which Trump has promised will be "beautiful," was the centerpiece of his immigration policy. He insisted that Mexico would pay for its construction, although he didn’t broach the subject when he met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in August.   Many Democratic and more moderate voters have voiced opposition to the wall, but the proposal is wildly popular among Trump’s backers.    percent of his supporters said they favor building a wall along the entire   border, according to the Pew Research Center.
