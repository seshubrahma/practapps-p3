Senators Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, were similarly scathing in a joint statement.

The candidate, Charles J. Cooper, said he was withdrawing as a possible nominee for solicitor general of the United States "after witnessing the treatment of my friend Jeff Sessions," who was approved as attorney general Wednesday evening after bruising attacks by Senate Democrats over his civil rights record.
