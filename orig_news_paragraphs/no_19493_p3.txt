Elias said the Clinton campaign will continue to cooperate if   Stein pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan with the   funds she has raised.   ’ ’    He also noted that the combined margin of victory for     Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and   Michigan, while only 107, 000 votes, "exceeds the largest margin   ever overcome," in a recount. The three states account for a   total of 46 electoral votes.
