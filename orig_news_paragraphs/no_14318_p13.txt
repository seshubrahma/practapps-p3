Impact on Gorsuch nomination, The latest legal controversy    and Trump’s highly unusual step for a President of personally attacking a judge who delivered a ruling critical of his administration    could spark new controversy and ammunition for Democrats in the fight against his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made clear on Saturday that the President’s tweet branding Judge James Robart as a "  judge" would prompt difficult questions for Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing. " The President’s attack on Judge James Robart, a Bush appointee who passed with 99 votes, shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn’t always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of respect for the Constitution, making it more important that the Supreme Court serve as an independent check on the administration," Schumer said in a statement.
