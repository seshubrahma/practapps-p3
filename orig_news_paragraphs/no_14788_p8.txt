Remember, the Trump administration has done much more than talk tough, and it has not been hypocritical. The president has announced three executive actions relating to immigration    two on January 25 and a third on January 27. Only the travel ban was stayed by the courts, but it has already been supplanted by a more focused executive order that seems to be fully within the President’s authority to prioritize refugee policy. Trump’s orders to deter sanctuary cities, prioritize deportations and empower local officials are proceeding apace.
