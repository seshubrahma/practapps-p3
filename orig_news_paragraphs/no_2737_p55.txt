This isn’t the most demented show on this list, but it’s among the sharpest. A workplace comedy in the style of "The Office," filmed with   flourishes, it’s about a Los Angeles real estate company that deals in   properties. How the company stays in business is a mystery, since the staff is full of misfits preoccupied with personal problems and infighting. The core ensemble clicks beautifully, and   guest stars in ridiculous roles complete the package.
