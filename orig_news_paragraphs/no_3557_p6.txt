The Times used the same dubious methods in reporting Tuesday that President Trump had "asked" Comey to end the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. In that story, the Times relied on a Comey "associate" who read from a purported memorandum by Comey, which the newspaper never obtained or verified itself. And it spun Trumpâ€™s words as a "request," when Trump had, in fact, merely said: "I hope you can let this go. " CNN, predictably, convened a panel of experts immediately after the story was published, all of whom agreed that the Times story provided "bombshell" evidence of obstruction of justice.
