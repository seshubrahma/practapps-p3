" Accusations of plagiarism are not unknown in political speeches, although the consequences have varied. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Obama for appearing to lift a passage from Deval Patrick, then the governor of Massachusetts, in a speech about how words matter. Mr. Obama, then a senator, said that he should have credited Mr. Patrick but that he did not consider it a case of plagiarism.
