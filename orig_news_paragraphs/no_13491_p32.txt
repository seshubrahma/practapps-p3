As we all remember, 43 went into both Afghanistan, in 2001, and Iraq, in 2003, without securing the surrounding countries as allies, or at least as  . Thatâ€™s why the rebels in both countries could be so effective as in Vietnam, they were steadily resupplied by countries that were outright enemies (such as Syria and Iran) or "frenemies" that were happy enough to see us bleed (such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan). As a result, as earlier in Vietnam, the bravery of US troops on the ground, and the effectiveness of US airpower, was mostly for naught. The enemy, drawing its forces from the general population, plus outside Islamist freelancers, could keep being replenished and, as a result, keep coming.
