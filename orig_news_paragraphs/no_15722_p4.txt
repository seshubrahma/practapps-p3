But the sources, privy to the descriptions of the communications written by US intelligence, cautioned the Russian claims to one another "could have been exaggerated or even made up" as part of a disinformation campaign that the Russians did during the election. Sources have also told CNN that   director Comey knew that a critical piece of information relating to the investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s email was fake    created by Russian intelligence    but he feared that if it became public it would undermine the probe and the Justice Department itself. As a result, Comey acted unilaterally last summer to publicly declare the investigation over    without consulting   General Loretta Lynch    while at the same time stating that Clinton had been "extremely careless" in her handling of classified information. His press conference caused a firestorm of controversy and drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.
