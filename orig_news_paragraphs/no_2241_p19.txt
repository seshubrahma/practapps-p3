After Mr. Manafort tried to do so anyway on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton’s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, replied "nice try, not true" on Twitter and added, "blaming Hillary Clinton isn’t the answer" for every Trump campaign problem. Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who has also been an Obama adviser, argued that the controversy revealed an inability among people closest to Mr. Trump to talk about his character. " The person who is supposed to know the candidate best and can speak to his values and what drives him couldn’t write her own speech on it," Ms. Cutter wrote in an email.
