Unlike Hillary who painted millions of Americans with a broad brush, I am taking specific aim at leaders who have hurt black America much more than they helped it.   I am keeping this list to a small selection of the actual rogueâ€™s gallery because we could spend all night listing leaders who have hurt black people in this country in exchange for power or a quick profit.    LBJ became president when Kennedy was murdered. His presidency spelled the beginning of tough times for black America.
