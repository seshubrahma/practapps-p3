The candidate, who seemed blindsided in 1960 by the new medium, won the presidency through the first modern   campaign. Mr. Ailes became a media guru for Republicans, prodding votersâ€™   centers of emotion and insecurity. For George H. W.

In 1996, he signed on to start a cable news channel for the conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch, as dispirited conservatives were looking down the barrel of a second Bill Clinton term.
