Prison medical records show that Mr. Slahi, a computer specialist with no history of mental illness, received   medicine, antidepressants, sleeping pills and psychotherapy, and that he had recurring nightmares of being tortured in the years after his ordeal. Dr. Vincent Iacopino, a civilian physician who evaluated Mr. Slahi in 2007 for his defense team, criticized psychologists and psychiatrists at Guant√°namo for failing "to adequately pursue the obvious possibility of PTSD," or   stress disorder, linked to severe physical and mental harm, the records show. Dr. Iacopino said military doctors had medicated Mr. Slahi for his symptoms instead of trying to treat his underlying disorder, which had "profound   and debilitating psychological effects. "
