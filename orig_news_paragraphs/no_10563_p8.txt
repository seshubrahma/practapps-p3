And the voters chose differently. I could blame the media for giving me virtually no attention and giving it all to Trump. I could blame the people who promised their support and urged me to get in the race but who then disappeared into the camps of others because they saw better paychecks, better rewards, or maybe really thought they saw a better candidate. But in the end, my fate was decided by voters.
