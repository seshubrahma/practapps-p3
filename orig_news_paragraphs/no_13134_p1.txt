The election is still 6 months away and early polling is not necessarily predictive of final results. That said, a recent survey of "political insiders" by Politico confidently predicted that Clinton would crush Trump in a landslide in November. Politicoâ€™s surveys of "insiders" have usually been wrong in this unpredictable year, but this prediction seems particularly off. The contest between Clinton and Trump is very likely to be close throughout the election season.
