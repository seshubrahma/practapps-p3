At least two Midwestern high schools have become engulfed in controversy when students attending basketball games hoisted Donald Trump signs and called out Trump chants to heckle opposing teams. [The two schools, one in Iowa and one in Indiana, both investigate incidents of mostly white students using GOP frontrunner Donald Trump as a taunt against students from opposing, more   schools.   In Iowa students from the largely white Dallas   (DCG) school in West Des Moines began chanting Donald Trumpâ€™s name during a February 22 game with Perry High, a mostly Hispanic school. According to the Associated Press, about a dozen students of the nearly 120 in attendance began chanting "Trump, Trump!" after Dallas   lost in a   game to Perry.
