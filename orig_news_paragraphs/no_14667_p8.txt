The idea that educational and economic privilege or "legal" immigration status can prevent discrimination has never served us. Think back to the turn of the 20th century when Sikh and Hindu lumber mill workers were chased out of Bellingham, Washington, or to the harassment faced by   residents and small businesses from a group calling itself the "Dotbusters" or to the post   targeting of Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus across the socioeconomic spectrum in airports, workplaces and schools. No, degrees and bank accounts have never saved us. What we must do is connect deeply with other communities of color, critically analyze government policies, and be ready to confront Islamophobia,   bias and   racism, both within and outside our communities.
