This Sunday on "United Shades of America With W. Kamau Bell," youâ€™ll see me go to Standing Rock to see if I could hear what the real story was. I also spent time at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, one of the poorest places in the country, to get a sense of what    life is like there   These were truly   experiences for me. The unique nature of the action at Standing Rock combined with the honesty, pain and humor of all the conversations    including one with a mother and father on Pine Ridge whose son had been killed only days before I talked to them    took my breath away and also somehow inspired me.
