" We were competing with our guests’ need and our own need to do business," said Kathy Bryant, one of the inn’s managers. She noted that despite a sprawling property well suited for corporate retreats and meetings, the inn was unable to attract such business because of its limited internet. After years of pleading with local officials and telecommunications providers for a broadband connection, the inn was connected to   internet by the Margaretville Telephone Company last August.
