Drenched in the blood of innocents, MILO urges the viewer to consider the suffering wrought by globalist,   immigration policies, lax policing and the obsessive pandering and mollycoddling of Islam by progressive social justice warriors. MILO is a warning from Europe. He urges the viewer to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN in November. MILO will also discuss the Trump Tapes, and how the culture war has flipped upside down as the left now tries to censor art and artists.
