That means he is the only obstacle to the party of Obama and Hillary and Huma Abedin, of the Iran deal and the appeasement of Islamic   beginning with the Hamas terrorists of Gaza and the Fatah terrorists of the West Bank. In mounting a   run which would split the Republican vote and elect Hillary, Bill Kristol seems to be forgetting that the Iranians and their   allies are openly preparing a second Holocaust in the Middle East (and then for the rest of us). Obama, Hillary, Huma Abedin, and the Democrats are the chief enablers of this already planned Holocaust. Splitting the Republican vote and electing Hillary is a betrayal of the Jews in an hour in which their backs are to the wall.
