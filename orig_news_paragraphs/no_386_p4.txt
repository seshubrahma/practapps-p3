Commandos waited for a moonless evening on Saturday to exploit their advantage of fighting at night. As helicopter gunships and armed Reaper drones provided cover, the commandos carried out the attack against the home of the Qaeda leader in the rugged mountainous region of Bayda Province, a part of Yemen that has been a focal point of United States military operations over the past month.

In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump called the raid "successful" and said that it had captured "important intelligence that will assist the U. S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.
