 (CNN) Democrat Jon Ossoff has a 7 percentage point edge over Republican Karen Handel among likely voters in a closely watched special election for a Georgia House seat, a new poll released Friday shows.   Ossoff leads Handel 51% to 44% among likely voters in an Atlanta   poll conducted June   by Abt Associates.    The poll did not specify how many likely voters were included in the survey, but the figures have a   margin of error, and with 5% saying they are still undecided, Ossoffâ€™s advantage could close.
