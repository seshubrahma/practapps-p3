" On the one hand, Mr. Duke is widely seen here as a uniquely poisonous figure who must be publicly opposed, hence the recent reformation of a      group, The Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism. The group includes former governors and United States senators, as well as Representative Steve Scalise, the   House Republican, who faced a national firestorm two years ago when it was revealed that he had spoken to a   group in 2002.
