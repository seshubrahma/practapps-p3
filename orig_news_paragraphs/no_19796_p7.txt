This, it should be said, is a minority position. Numerous experts, most notably Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, and the constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe, have already voiced their disagreements in no uncertain terms, stating without reservation that Trump’s continued ownership of his properties will violate the Constitution the day he enters office. Moreover, the workaround Trump’s legal team has apparently created —  donating profits from foreign governments’ payments to the U. S. Treasury —  does nothing to change the fact that governments will likely attempt to curry favor with the president through his hotel, as he may view that as flattering, not to mention the hotel will still collect revenues on the stay. Their second defense was one that Trump has repeatedly asserted since the election: The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties does not apply to the president or vice president.
