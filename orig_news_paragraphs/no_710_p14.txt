The gang, also known as La Mara Salvatrucha, was responsible for the killings of 11 people in Suffolk County last year, the police said. It was not clear if the murders would be included in the charges. As part of Mr. Trumpâ€™s executive orders, he directed the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to expand its   crime initiative. Even before the orders, Suffolk County had rejoined a joint gang task force with the F. B. I. and increased its own street patrols last fall.
