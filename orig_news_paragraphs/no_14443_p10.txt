Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was "highly likely" that the chamber’s intelligence committee would look at allegations that Flynn spoke about sanctions with Kislyak. Sens. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, Roy Blunt and Lindsey Graham also called for an investigation. " I  think Congress needs to be informed of what actually Gen. Flynn said to the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions," Graham told CNN’s Kate Bolduan on "At This Hour."
