The last two Republican presidents have been conspicuously absent from the national dialogue during this election cycle, with the exception of the prominent rumor that George H. W. Bush will be voting for Hillary Clinton. His aides have not publicly denied it. It’s obvious to any observer of American politics with common sense that for past presidents and nominees of the Republican Party to not support the GOP’s chosen candidate is tantamount to endorsing Hillary Clinton. Only the smug, deluded, and   disagree with this.
