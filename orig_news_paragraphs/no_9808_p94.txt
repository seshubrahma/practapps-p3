The same thing happened with Trump. I can’t count the number of people who played along with the   narrative in public to appease their metropolitan friends and colleagues, only to quietly pull the lever for Trump in the voting booth. Pollsters need to have a few words with their friends in the leftist bubble, because their   and public shaming and buzzwords are effectively destroying their profession.   Nobody is going to be upfront about their political preferences if they’re going to be called racists, sexists, and the rest of the left’s favorite buzzwords.
