Comey, called Mrs. Clinton’s "extremely careless" handling of 110 classified emails with the former secretary of state’s shifting explanations over the last year about her use of a private email server.

" Instead we’re relying on somebody who’s tweeting with exclamation points," said Mr. Walsh, referring to Donald J. Trump’s initial response to Mr. Comey’s news conference.
