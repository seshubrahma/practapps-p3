Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman for Mr. Obama, said that if Democrats were conventionally cast as the "mommy party" and Republicans as the "daddy party" in American politics, then "Trump is the crazy uncle and Hillary Clinton is the only person you trust to watch your family for a week. " Mr. Trump has also cast doubt on American participation in NATO and spoken warmly of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president and strongman. And in recent days, he has feuded with Robert M. Gates, a highly regarded former defense secretary, and found himself mocked by another respected national security figure, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who called Mr. Trump "a national disgrace and an international pariah" in private emails released by hackers last week.
