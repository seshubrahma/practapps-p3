Washington (CNN) Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker revealed Tuesday he will speak at the Republican National Convention later this month, offering public support to Donald Trump at a time the presumptive Republican nominee has struggled to attract   Republicans for the role. The former Republican presidential candidate confirmed the speaking engagement to CNN affiliate   in Platteville, Wisconsin.   Walker has been critical of Trump in the wake of his   attacks on a federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University, and had at one point threatened to withhold his support from his partyâ€™s presumptive nominee.
