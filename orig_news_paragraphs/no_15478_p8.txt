" With the missile impacting so close to Russian soil    in fact, closer to Russia than to Japan    the President cannot imagine that Russia is pleased," the statement said. "Let this latest provocation serve as a call for all nations to implement far stronger sanctions against North Korea," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.
