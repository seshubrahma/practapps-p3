Fox’s late afternoon broadcast of Dallas’s     victory over Pittsburgh generated a preliminary overnight rating of a 17. 8, the highest for any N. F. L. game this season (although it fell 3 percent from the comparable game on CBS last year). But CBS’s slate of games Sunday afternoon tumbled 28 percent from last year. NBC takes over the Thursday night games starting with New Orleans playing Carolina, teams with  . 500 records that might not give the network a lift to start its   schedule.
