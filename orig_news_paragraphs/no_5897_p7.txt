Critics of the administration have pointed out on social media that Farkas left the administration in September 2015, but the concern is not whether she herself tried to save and spread intelligence, but that she was urging some of her former colleagues still in the administration to do so, and knew of some who "were trying to also help get information to the Hill. " Farkas has also been described as a Hillary Clinton campaign adviser, including in a March 2017 New Yorker report. During the briefing Spicer also suggested that administration officials may have more evidence to back up Farkas’s account —  as well as Trump’s assertion that his campaign was being spied on by the Obama administration —  that they intended to share with congressional leaders. Spicer said the White House had invited House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes ( ) and ranking member Adam Schiff ( ) to the White House on Friday.
