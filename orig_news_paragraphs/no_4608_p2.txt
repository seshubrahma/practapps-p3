â€”    J. David Jentsch (@jdavidjentsch) March 4, 2017,   The bureaucratic maneuver is not a full reform of the program, which now allows at least 650, 000   foreign professionals to work throughout the United States in jobs sought by young American graduates and by experienced professionals trying to get their own teenagers into college. The maneuver may not even reduce the annual inflow of foreign workers, but it buys time for President Donald Trump, who repeatedly promised to reform the program during the 2016 campaign.
