The picture it paints is one that may be contributing to Trumpâ€™s reluctance to release his returns. A CNN review of the documents, most obtained through open records requests, show at least two years in the 1970s when Trump paid $0 in federal income tax.   At least one year in the next decade Trump paid nothing at all in income tax, according to New York City tax documents obtained by CNN. An important point is this: as a real estate developer, Trump has had, over the course of his career, access to more tax breaks and loopholes than any other profession.
