 (CNN) President Trump dropped a bombshell Tuesday with the announcement that he had fired FBI Director James Comey    just days after Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about, among other things, the bureau’s investigation into Russian meddling in the election that propelled Trump to the presidency.   Trump has stunned the political world once again by issuing the orders to remove one of the most important figures in this entire investigation.   Ironically, the announcement comes at a time when former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been telling audiences that Comey was a key factor behind her loss in November.
