Investigations by reporters and an investigative team have showed that the accusations were nothing but cleverly orchestrated lies," the report said. Xinhua said Jiang Tianyong, a prominent human rights lawyer, had invented the story and shared it with foreign activists. One of Mr. Xieâ€™s lawyers, Chen Jiangang, denied that on Friday. In a statement, Mr. Chen reiterated that Mr. Xie had provided the account of his torture, describing in detail the meeting at which he had done so.
