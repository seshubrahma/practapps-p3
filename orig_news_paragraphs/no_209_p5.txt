Mr. Eusman said the library would also have someone on standby who will be notified immediately if the Bible has been damaged and will whisk it back to a conservation lab for immediate repair. The steps are mostly precautionary. The Lincoln Bible is in good shape, and "it can certainly sustain this kind of activity," said Mark Dimunation, the head of rare books and special collections. The Bible was given to the library by Mary Lincoln, the widow of Robert Todd Lincoln, the presidentâ€™s son, Mr. Dimunation said.
