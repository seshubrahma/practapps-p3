Kaine voted to grant President Barack Obama   authority to negotiate TPP and praised aspects of the deal, but said Friday morning that he was still concerned about an issue he raised initially with TPP: "The right of corporations to challenge unfair trade practices in private courts," without giving labor unions the same rights. " Itâ€™s been a year and nobody has given me a reason why we should embrace a trade deal," he said. Trump has slammed both Clinton and Kaine for their past support of the TPP deal and insisted that Clinton will ultimately approve the deal after passing minor changes.
