 (CNN) Ahead of a highly anticipated briefing to the full Senate next week by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, one Democratic senator says he plans to press him aggressively about the timeline that led to the firing of FBI Director James Comey and whether he plans to call for a special prosecutor to lead an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and alleged collusion with the Russians by Trump campaign associates. " I certainly have some very specific questions about the timeline" of Comeyâ€™s firing, said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, one of 94 senators who voted to confirm Rosenstein last month.
