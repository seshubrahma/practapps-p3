In an extremely costly year for Senate races over all, Missouri has become the     state, with $15 million in ads pouring into its race. Two weeks after Mr. Kander’s   gun ad in September, political action committees and other outside groups dropped more than $8 million into the state on the two candidates, quadruple what they had spent in the previous two weeks, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Kander has benefited from being a sui generis blend: At once, he is a   Democrat, a veteran, a   lawyer who wears the outsider label, and the opponent of an incumbent who is the embodiment of Washington longevity. He has focused on trying to turn Mr. Blunt’s experience into a liability.
