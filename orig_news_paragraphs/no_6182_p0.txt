TEL AVIV  —   Law enforcement and intelligence officials privately told the House Committee on Homeland Security that the U. S. screening process for refugees contains inherent vulnerabilities and that a lack of information makes background checks for potential refugees difficult to trust.

The contents of the report, issued September 2015, received little news media attention.
