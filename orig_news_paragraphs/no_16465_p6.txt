Meg Whitman, the former HP CEO and Republican California gubernatorial candidate, attended the event at Saban’s house as well, a source who attended the event told CNN. Whitman, a longtime Republican, endorsed Clinton earlier this month, saying in a statement that she would vote for and donate to Clinton. She paid $50, 000 to attend Monday night’s event, the source said. The two Monday night fundraisers raised at least $6. 3 million, according to ticket prices and attendance figures.
