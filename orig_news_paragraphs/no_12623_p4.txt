Those who participated in the poll from the blue city of Dallas, Texas, were more likely to vote for Clinton but Trump’s lead was still five points over Clinton. The Dallas Morning News endorsed Clinton but took a subscription hit from angry Texans after doing so, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Part of the     Strategies Poll was conducted prior to the announcement by FBI Director James Comey on the afternoon of October 28th that the FBI was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State. The poll was conducted on October 27 to 29.
