Other Senate legislators are drafting new bills that may be combined later this year into another proposed "Comprehensive Immigration Reform" bill.

One possible element of any new comprehensive bill is GOP Sen. Ron Johnson’s unpopular proposal to invite additional 500, 000 guest workers, plus their families, to take jobs from U. S. workers every year.
