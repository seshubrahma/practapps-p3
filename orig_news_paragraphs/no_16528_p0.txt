 (CNN) Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign raised $143 million in August for her campaign, the DNC and state parties, according to a campaign press release, a haul that makes the month the best of her campaign. The fundraising haul is a silver lining on what otherwise was a difficult month for Clinton, where questions about her exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of state and questions about    at the Clinton Foundation hamstrung her campaign. National polls have tightened since the Democratic National Convention in July, but Clinton maintains leads in almost all battleground states.
