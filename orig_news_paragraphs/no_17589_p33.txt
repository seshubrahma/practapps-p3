In just the past                 few years, it has managed to enter two wars, in                 Ukraine and Syria, that its rivals saw as                 unwinnable quagmires and, with relatively little                 money or manpower, to reassert its power in old                 spheres of influence.               ’ ’                 What has changed in the past year is that Russia is                 no longer just defending its interests —  it ’s                 expanding them. Examples of Russia’s growing clout                 are not confined to its traditional "near abroad"                 in the former Soviet countries or even its former                 client states. Take the recent OPEC meeting, where                 Putin played intermediary between Iran and Saudi                 Arabia  to cut production.
