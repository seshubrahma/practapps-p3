" I brought up the fact that it would be nice for him to at least say that he would vote for him," said Mr. Deason, whose conversation with Mr. Koch was first reported by The Hill. Mr. Koch has said that Mr. Trumpâ€™s policies do not align with his own, or those of the groups that he and his brother oversee, and that they cannot support him simply because he is the Republican nominee, according to James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, a nonprofit group that runs the seminars. Mr. Deason said that other   donors he spoke to were supporting Mr. Trump financially on their own.
