As part of Mr. Trump’s Oval Office renovation, he ordered that four hardback chairs be placed in a semicircle around his Resolute Desk now heaped, in Trump Tower fashion, with memos and newspapers. They are an emblem of Mr. Trump’s    management style, but also a reminder that in the White House, the seats always outlast the people seated in them.

Mr. Trump, several aides said, is used to quarterbacking his own media strategy, and did not see the value of hiring an outsider.
