Not all Beltway pundits agree. The Cook Report, which on November 7 predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the Presidency with at least 278 electoral college votes, giving Donald Trump 214 votes and calling 46 votes as tossups,  published its early predictions for the 2018 Senate elections on November 10,  and claimed that none of the 33 Senate seats were likely to change parties. The Cook Report rates five Senate seats up in 2018 currently held by Democrats as "Lean Democrat," that is, they are "competitive races" but the incumbent Democrat "has an advantage": Nelson in Florida, Donnelly in Indiana, King (the Independent) in Maine, McCaskill in Missouri, and Brown in Ohio.
