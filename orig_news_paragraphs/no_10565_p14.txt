It’s a possibility that Kristol does not actually have a serious candidate, or that he has a backbencher Congressman or former congressman or senator or former Governor lined up. Such possibilities for Kristol’s search for an independent to take votes away from Trump include, sources say, former U. S. Sen. Jim Talent from Missouri or former U. S. Sen. Tom Coburn from Oklahoma. Sources close to Talent and Coburn have not yet confirmed either way to Breitbart News whether they plan such a run.
