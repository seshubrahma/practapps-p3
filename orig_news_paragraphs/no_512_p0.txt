WASHINGTON   —    Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education, was confirmed by the Senate as the nation’s education secretary on Tuesday, but only with the help of a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence after weeks of protests and two defections within her own party. The    vote capped an   vigil on the Senate floor, where, one by one, Democrats denounced Ms. DeVos to a mostly empty chamber.
