Trump was addressing a small group of   evangelicals ahead of speaking before a larger group of religious leaders at a gathering hosted by the Christian group, United in Purpose. E. W. Jackson, who tweeted video of Trumpâ€™s remarks, said the comment came while Trump was trying to say that conservatives tend to get questioned more about their faith than liberals.   " I think everybody in there knows Hillary Clinton is a Methodist and by definition a Christian," Jackson told CNN.
