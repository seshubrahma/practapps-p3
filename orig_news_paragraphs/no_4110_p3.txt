He replied that his goal was not a "label," but a peace in which Palestinians recognized the Jewish state, and where Israel had full security control of the area west of the Jordan River. The shift from "two states at any price" is a fundamental change in U. S. policy and places new (and overdue) pressure on the Palestinians. A new era.
