’  ’ ’    Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday skewered his   Republican colleagues, contending that GOP lawmakers had treated   President Barack Obama with "unprecedented disrespect" and   suggesting such actions created the conditions ripe for the   candidacy of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. ’ ’    "As this Republican Congress heads for yet another unearned   recess, I feel compelled to comment on how Republicans have   treated the president of the United States during the last eight   years," Reid said on the Senate floor.
