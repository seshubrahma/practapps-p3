The Goldman report does not say how many of the   spouses are working in skilled   jobs, but if that number is only   of the resident   spouses, then the number of foreign   contract workers would climb by up to 100, 000 people. If Goldman’s estimate of almost one million   is combined with the EPI’s estimate of other skilled   visa programs, the data shows that U. S. companies employ roughly 1. 4 million   foreign contract workers in the United States. That’s enough jobs to fully employ nearly all Americans who graduated from college with skilled degrees in 2015 and 2016. Even if the EPIs lower estimate for the   population is correct, then the extra visas programs show the number of   contract workers in the United States up to roughly 940, 000.
