All five states voted Trump, with Pennsylvania turning red for the first Republican presidential candidate since 1988. Republicans could hold a   majority after   elections if they win those 10 seats in the states which Trump won. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has also announced he supports Sessions for attorney general.
