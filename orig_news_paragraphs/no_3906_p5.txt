Like Monty Python’s Sir Robin, they have turned and fled from what seems the least bit threatening, with no shortage of people willing to sing their praises for "bravely" doing so. As a result, we’ve allowed a narrative that equates "compassion with money" to dominate. If you don’t want to increase funding levels, you’re painted as not caring about the underlying issue. If you don’t want to give the military a blank check, you’re said to be unpatriotic.
