When the framers of the Constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have today, 95 percent of America was rural, as the 1790 census classified the population.

Today, equal state representation in the Senate is the only provision in the Constitution that remains singled out for protection from the amendment process no state can lose its full complement of senators without its permission.
