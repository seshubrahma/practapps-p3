The White House was not told about Mr. Trump’s call until after it happened, according to a senior administration official. But afterward, the Chinese government contacted the White House to discuss the matter. The   fallout from the   conversation could be significant, the administration official said, noting that the Chinese government issued a bitter protest after the United States sold weapons to Taiwan as part of a   arms agreement grudgingly accepted by Beijing. Mr. Trump’s call with President Tsai is a bigger provocation.
