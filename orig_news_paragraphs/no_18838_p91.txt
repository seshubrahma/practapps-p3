And it would avoid destroying the lives of countless people with deportations that needlessly separate families, lovers, friends, and acquaintances. If a border wall would make this more politically palatable, that’s fine. I dislike the symbolism of a wall, but the status quo, where we have large swaths of a wall,   gaps in parts of the desert that are particularly dangerous to cross, and armed guards on patrol, many of them corrupt, isn’t exactly a symbol of welcome! It may have more costs than a barrier that decreased instances of agents and migrants meeting.
