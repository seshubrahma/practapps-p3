We will work with Ukraine, Russia and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border," Mr. Trump said in a White House statement. His comments contrasted with those of Nikki R. Haley, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, who on Thursday condemned Russia for its "aggressive actions" in eastern Ukraine. She said the United States wanted improved relations with Russia, but added that American sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea would remain in place. She said "the dire situation" demanded "clear and strong condemnation" of Russia’s actions.
