Imagine the frustration in   intel services that, being familiar with the problem of terrorism, understand that the vast majority of terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists in the West are authored not by terrorists who infiltrated Western countries, but rather by citizens of those countries who   (as looks to be the case with the recent attack in London).    Again, the White Houseâ€™s policies may cause these important liaison partners to be more circumspect with what they choose to share in the future, which could have disastrous consequences. The Trump administration is still young, and many of our intelligence partners are showing great patience and taking a wait and see attitude    but such attitudes will not last forever.   And if the administration continues to take a   approach to sensitive intelligence relationships, erosion of intelligence relationships will eventually begin.
