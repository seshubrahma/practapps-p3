Tea party and town hall project, As Democrats decide on their new leader, a series of ad hoc groups have already taken on the task of organizing and channeling the protests    mirroring the tea party, which grew outside the Republican Party establishment in 2009 and 2010 but was eventually embraced and fueled by the GOP.    Jimmy Dahman    who spent the 2016 presidential campaign as a field organizer for Hillary Clinton in Iowa and Ohio    recently tapped into his network of Democratic contacts to recruit an army of 100 volunteers to launch the "Town Hall Project."   It was a simple idea: Dahman, his volunteers and other progressives on social media would compile every Republican town hall meeting or event into one giant spreadsheet and post it online.   Inspired by the massive turnout of   activists at a town hall hosted by Rep. Mike Coffman,   Dahman said he believed people craved opportunities to tell their representatives       much as tea partiers did in 2009    and he wanted a way to empower them.
