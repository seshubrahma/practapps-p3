My education is funded by scholarships from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, the Alexander Hamilton Scholars, Questbridge  and Golden Doors Scholars. These organizations have judged me by my ability rather than my birthplace.   I hope to go on to law school, study constitutional law and become a US citizen. Itâ€™s impossible to know if any of these things will happen, because it is impossible to know if President Trump will end DACA.
