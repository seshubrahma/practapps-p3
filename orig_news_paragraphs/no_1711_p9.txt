Among registered voters surveyed by Pew, 55 percent of supporters of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said the Pacific pact would be a good thing (58 percent of Trump supporters said the opposite). And while Mrs. Clinton, under pressure from her   pact Democratic primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, came out in opposition to the T. P. P. in October, a Pew survey in March found that even 55 percent of Sanders supporters said trade agreements had been good for the country. The pollster for the liberal group Public Citizen, which is among the most active opponents of trade agreements, recently found that the public comes to the debate over T. P. P. from a position "bordering on neutrality," with Republicans very negative and Democrats more positive. A plurality of all Americans favored past agreements, it said.
