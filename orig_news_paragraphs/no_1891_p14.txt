The league has increased the number of Thursday night over the years, but it has found its biggest success in selling some of the games, first to CBS, and now to CBS and NBC, because broadcast networks reach larger audiences than a   channel like NFL Network. But Thursday night games have been less attractive to players, who dislike the short week of preparation time after Sunday, and to fans who see that the mostly divisional matchups don’t generally rival those of other   packages. The Thursday broadcasts have also become part of a discussion about whether the N. F. L. is overwhelming fans with too many games. Rodney Harrison, an analyst on NBC’s pregame show, said that he was looking less at the election as a factor in shrinking audiences than quality games.
