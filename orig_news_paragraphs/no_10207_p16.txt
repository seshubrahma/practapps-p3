I have not heard or seen such a barrage of attacks on any other politician over minor nothings. WE know Donald Trump is not racist, sexist, or xenophobic. Every single person who has known him for years understands this and have said it and yet pundits continually make this a "signal," instead of taking it off the table once and for all. They must now coalesce and unify to provide cover for him.
