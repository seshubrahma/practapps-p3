GOP frontrunner Donald Trump defeated rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) in Louisiana primary, but Cruz may end up taking several more delegates out of that state, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. ["Donald Trump beat Sen. Ted Cruz earlier this month in Louisianaâ€™s Republican presidential primary by 3. 6 percentage points, but the Texan may wind up with as many as 10 more delegates from the state than the businessman," WSJ reported.   In Louisiana, Cruz and Trump each won 18 delegates. However, Cruz may now be able to gain 10 more delegates because there are five unbound delegates who can vote for whichever candidate they want.
