â€”   Shaun King ( @ShaunKing) July 16, 2016,  The attempted coup in Turkey has so far led to the death of 265 people, including 161 innocent civilians. King has previously claimed that a Trump presidency would lead to violence, claiming he appeals to "anarchists who see a Trump presidency as a shortcut to mass chaos, protest, dissidence, and anger in our nation," in an article for the Daily News. He has also refused to denounce the shootings of policemen in the Baton Rouge Police Department which has left three officers dead, and three in critical condition, telling Twitter users to "quit asking him" whether he denounces Black Lives Matter inspired violence.
