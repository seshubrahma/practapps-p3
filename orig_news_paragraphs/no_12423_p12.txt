—    Lee Stranahan (@stranahan) June 15, 2016,   The talk was supposed to have taken place yesterday at the University of Central Florida, however it was shut down by campus police despite the fact that the University’s Muslim Student Association were allowed to invite extreme Islamist Siraj Wahhaj in 2011. Yiannopoulos’ talk was moved to the Ground Zero of the Orlando shootings instead.
