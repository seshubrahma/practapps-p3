After a   deep investigation into suspected foreign meddling in the U. S. election, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has determined that Donald Trump has no ties to the Russian government. [Federal officials conducted a wide investigation throughout the summer looking for financial connections between Trump and his operatives and the Russian government in connection with the hacking of Democrat party computers but found nothing, according to The New York Times.   Upon the conclusion of the investigation, the FBI decided that, contrary to claims by Democrats, the hacking may have been aimed at disrupting the election but was not intended to ensure the election of Donald Trump. The allegations of Trumpâ€™s computer ties to the Russian bank were made in an article posted to the liberal Slate.
