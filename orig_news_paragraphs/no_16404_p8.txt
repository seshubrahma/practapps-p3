His reputation as a cheater of death took hold early. As a young revolutionary he was reported dead twice by Cubaâ€™s press    "perishing" once when he led a failed uprising against a military barracks and again when he returned from exile by boat with a guerrilla force. The number of people wanting Castro dead    or at least gone    rose after he seized power in 1959, took over US property on the island, embraced the Soviet Union and forced thousands of Cubans into exile.   A mob hit, Few had as much reason to want Castro dead as the American mafia.
