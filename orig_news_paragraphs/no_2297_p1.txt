The outcome could seal control of the Senate. For those who have followed the intrigue of recent campaign cycles, it is riveting for another reason. The battle to choose a successor to Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader, is pitting Mr. Reid and his   political operation against his archenemies, Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire industrialist brothers whom Mr. Reid has spent the past few years denouncing as the avatars of   politics. This is an epic proxy war, with Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat and a former Nevada attorney general, and Representative Joe Heck, a Republican, serving as surrogates in a clash to see who gets the last word in this brutal rivalry.
