This is the second premiere here in Cleveland, you can see the level of excitement. The movie just opened in three theaters: one in Dallas, one in Phoenix, and one in Hueston. So Green basis we are the number one movie in America we have just been packing the theaters and people go wild. Iâ€™m really excited because at the end of the movie everybody applauds and cheers and that is rare in a theater so we are very happy to see that.
