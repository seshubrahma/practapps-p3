Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 15, 2016,    Trump originally planned to announce his VP on Friday at 11 a. m. in New York City, but postponed the event due to the terrorist attack in Nice, France. In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow’s news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 14, 2016,
