These young people were beneficiaries of President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which celebrated its fifth anniversary this week.   Now the Department of Homeland Security has issued guidance suggesting that the DACA program will continue, and that the department will not be taking removal actions against DACA grantees.    This is welcome news for the young people directly affected by DACA. It is a tribute to their activism and advocacy that this sensible plan will continue.
