However, I disagree with your term "millions"   …      I don’t think "millions" would migrate out of California because of secession and I likewise don’t believe "millions" would immigrate TO California from the other states. I do believe, however, that an independent California can reorganize itself in such a way where conservatives might think twice before relocating.
