An impeachment resolution is considered a "privileged matter" and would have to be taken up by the Senate immediately.   If Senate Republicans wanted to move off the issue they would need 60 votes, meaning the support of some Democrats, to do it.   That would mean incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer could have been positioned to delay Senate action on the Obamacare repeal, Cabinet nominations and other top legislative items until the impeachment issue was resolved.   The Trump transition team urged Jordan not to move forward with the resolution, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
