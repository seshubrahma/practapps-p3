CBP officials stated they are suspending operation of the temporary holding facility late last week. " A continual decline in the total number of apprehended and inadmissible alien migrants in custody at the facility, along with manageable processing of migrants at previously impacted CBP Ports of Entry and Stations" led to the facilities shutdown, KRGV reported Tuesday. Breitbart Texas reached out to CBP officials for more information about the suspension of operations and to learn if any of the other temporary facilities had been closed.
