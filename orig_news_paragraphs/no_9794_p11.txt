Politico currently shows Donald Trump with 2, 279, 221 votes in Michigan, and Hillary Clinton with 2, 267, 798 votes, giving Trump an 11, 423 vote margin. The Detroit Free Press on Wednesday declared Trump the victor in Michigan by 13, 225 votes, after prematurely and incorrectly calling the state for Hillary Clinton on Election Night with only 11 percent of the stateâ€™s precincts reporting. A 13, 107 vote margin of victory is not close enough to trigger a vote recount under Michigan law, as Citizens for Election Integrity reports: Recounts initiated by a close vote margin are mandatory if the close vote margin is triggered, but only at the statewide level. This requirement applies to both initiatives and candidates in any primary or election, except for partisan offices in which more than one person is elected.
