Cleveland (CNN) The battle for supremacy among super PACs backing Donald Trump is intensifying as rival groups    almost all of which have struggled to collect top dollars    are making   pitches to the partyâ€™s moneyed elite before they split town. In lavish hotel ballrooms and guarded private suites lining the mezzanine of the Quicken Loans Arena, donors expressed their concerns that Trump    10 weeks after winning the nomination    still does not have a group that has demonstrated an ability to win unlimited checks. And they know he has little time to correct the situation, which has him being outspent by Hillary Clinton and her associated super PACs by tens of millions of dollars.
