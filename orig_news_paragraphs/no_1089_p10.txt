Mr. Kushner had not yet stepped aside as chief executive of Kushner Companies, which was trying to attract investment for the companyâ€™s crown jewel, an overleveraged Manhattan office tower on Fifth Avenue. The company was in the midst of negotiations to redevelop the building with Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese company with ties to the Beijing government. Senate investigators plan to ask Mr. Kushner if he discussed ways to secure additional financing for the building during his meeting with the Russian banker, a government official said. Ms. Hicks said that no such business was discussed at the   session, during which Mr. Gorkov expressed a desire for an open dialogue.
