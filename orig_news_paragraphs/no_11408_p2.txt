the Ruling Class put another boot on our neck to snuff liberty’s life out of We the People. It’s a farce that "no one is above the law" and my heart goes out to all who’ve been unjustly accused and destroyed over much lesser crimes than Hillary’s. We MUST redouble efforts to restore the rule of law that had sustained the most exceptional nation on earth, with everyone doing their part: * Don’t put blind faith in any politician, but don’t give up on our forefathers’ charters of freedom that created a Republic to be governed by and for We the People.
