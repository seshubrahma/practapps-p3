From Reuters:[The overseers of the U. S. intelligence community have not embraced a CIA assessment that Russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping Republican   Donald Trump win the 2016 election, three American officials said on Monday.   While the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) does not dispute the CIAâ€™s analysis of Russian hacking operations, it has not endorsed their assessment because of a lack of conclusive evidence that Moscow intended to boost Trump over Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, said the officials, who declined to be named. The position of the ODNI, which oversees the 17   U. S. intelligence community, could give Trump fresh ammunition to dispute the CIA assessment, which he rejected as "ridiculous" in weekend remarks, and press his assertion that no evidence implicates Russia in the cyber attacks.
