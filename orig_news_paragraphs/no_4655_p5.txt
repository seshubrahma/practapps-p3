Although a TRO cannot be appealed, a preliminary injunction can, which could take either case quickly to the next level of the federal judiciary. The Washington case would go back to the Ninth Circuit, while the Wisconsin case would go to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago. The first case is Washington v. Trump, No. 2:   in the Western District of Washington. The second case is Doe v. Trump, No. 3:   in the Western District of Wisconsin.
