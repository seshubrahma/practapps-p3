Ms. Rice said she had sometimes asked for the names of Americans whose identities were redacted in her daily intelligence briefings in order to understand the context of what she was being told. The purpose, she said, was "to do our jobs," but "absolutely not for any political purpose, to spy, expose, anything. " She added that she had never made public the identities of any Trump associates mentioned in intelligence surveillance.
