More than half of the ORR’s budget, or about $950 million, goes to temporary custody and care of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children, who are almost all from Central America and Mexico. In fiscal year 2015, the State Department spent about $3 billion on Migration and Refugee Assistance, and it spent $50 million on Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. On CBS News’ "Face the Nation" last September, Clinton was asked if the current U. S. plan to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees to 10, 000 was enough. She replied, "I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10, 000 to 65, 000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in."
