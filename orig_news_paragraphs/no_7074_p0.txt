Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was wrongly and inaccurately blamed when Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) was shot several years ago, is standing up for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont saying he is personally not responsible for the actions of his apparent supporter. [Palin, in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, called for the media industry to be more careful than they were back when Giffords was shot —   specifically asking for "media integrity" when it comes to learning the motives of the shooter of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise at the GOP congressional baseball practice on Wednesday morning.   "Prayers for healing are raised for all victims of today’s horrific violence, while we with lift up thankfulness that lives were not lost," Palin told Breitbart News.
