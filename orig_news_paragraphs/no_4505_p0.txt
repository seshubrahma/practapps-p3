Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. performs his last constitutional act by presiding over the joint session of Congress Friday in the House chamber for the official acceptance of the Electoral College results from the states. [The Constitution directs Biden to break the seal on the results from the Electoral College votes held Dec. 19 in the state capitals and then tally the results to determine if a candidate has a majority of the electors. If no candidate has an absolute majority of electors, then    top three candidates are put up for a new election by the House of Representatives.   For the vote in the House, each state delegation votes among themselves and the winner inside the delegation is awarded the stateâ€™s single vote.
