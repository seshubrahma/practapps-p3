In a procedural quirk, a confirmation vote on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama for attorney general was scheduled after that of Ms. DeVos so he could vote "yes" before leaving the Senate, securing Republicans a decisive vote.

She was the first of Mr. Trumpâ€™s nominees not to complete an ethics review before appearing before a Senate panel.
