American conservatism, at its best, is open to new ideas and new people. In contrast, American liberalism, like the socialism and communism from which it springs and which it seeks to perfect, is constantly proclaiming its novelty, but is actually just the application of a very old principle to new targets. It was Plato, not Marx, who first conceived of a completely equal society. Just like it was Aristophanes, not Hillary Clinton, who came up with the idea of a republic led by women.
