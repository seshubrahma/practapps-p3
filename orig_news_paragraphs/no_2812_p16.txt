John Kirby, the State Departmentâ€™s spokesman, said the vetting of applicants included fingerprint and facial recognition checks as part of a full counterterrorism screening. The government has struggled to keep pace with the influx of Afghan and Iraqi applications for special visas and changes to the eligibility rules made by lawmakers, mistakenly disqualifying some applicants and trapping others in a holding pattern that lasts months or even years. That is time, several translators and interpreters said, that the applicants cannot afford to waste as they face serious threats to their lives every day. As the Obama administration works out those problems, congressional inaction would turn off the spigot at the end of the year and shut out any new applications.
