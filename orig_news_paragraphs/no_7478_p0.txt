A 2014 report published by the Washington Post documented how   foreign nationals voting in U. S. elections "likely gave" Democrats the critical 60th vote they needed to pass Obamacare. [The report explains that   who illegally voted in 2008, and who electorally "tended to favor Democrats" could have handed the 2008 Minnesota Senate election to Al Franken, which gave Senate Democrats the "pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass   reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress," the report writes.   The 2014 Washington Post article titled "Could   Decide The November Election?" was written by Jesse Richman and David Earnest, two associate professors of Political Science and International Studies at Old Dominion University. Their research relied upon data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES).
