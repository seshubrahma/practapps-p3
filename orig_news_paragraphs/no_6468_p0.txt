White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to signal optimism about the future of the House health care replacement bill despite a gloomy outlook about it â€™s future in Washington D. C.["There is no question in my mind at least that the president and the team here have left everything on the field," Spicer said during the White House press briefing on Friday.   Trump and his White House team publicly supported the bill, hosting members of congress at the White House, visiting Capitol Hill, even conducting a rally with Senate Majority Leder Mitch McConnell in Kentucky.
