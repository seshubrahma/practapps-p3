Anyways, I just wanted to say what I think Trump’s core supporters, from the very beginning, will want Trump to do   …      it probably isn’t what the ’moderates’ RINOs and liberals want   …     sorry. Among other things, Brendan’s email is a reminder that   fault lines remain with us. (He’s mistaken, though, to say that Trump has named Bolton to a position in his administration.)
