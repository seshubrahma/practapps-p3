VANCOUVER, British Columbia  â€”    Seattle and Vancouver are like fraternal twins separated at birth. Both are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with   populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers. Yet 140 miles of   roads and an international border divide the two cities, keeping them farther apart than their geographic and cultural identities would suggest.
