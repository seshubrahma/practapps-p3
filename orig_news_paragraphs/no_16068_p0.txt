Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 6 percentage points, according to a new USA   University poll.   Clinton’s 46% to 40% edge is a tighter margin than the poll has found in the past, suggesting that Trump is narrowing the advantage Clinton has had since the two became their parties’ presumptive nominees. Just two months ago, the same poll showed Clinton up 11 points.
