Carson conceded that he believes HUD’s rental assistance program is "essential" and said it would be "cruel and unusual" to retire government assistance programs without a proper replacement. He also assured the committee that he would advocate for HUD’s budget and not seek to gut the agency. Carson also committed to ensuring LGBT Americans enjoy equal rights when it comes to HUD programs when pressed on his past controversial statements about that group. The testiest exchange during the hearing came when Sen. Elizabeth Warren,   urged Carson to promise none of HUD’s budget would wind up financially benefiting Trump or his real estate company.
