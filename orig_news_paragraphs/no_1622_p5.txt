Abu Zubaydah, who was waterboarded 83 times and otherwise brutally tortured after being mistaken for a   Qaeda operative involved in the   attacks, argued for his release from Guant√°namo Bay. He said he had no intent to harm the U. S. or any other country. Video of the hearing streamed to the Pentagon offered reporters and human rights advocates their first glimpse of him, appearing calm, since he was captured 14 years ago.
