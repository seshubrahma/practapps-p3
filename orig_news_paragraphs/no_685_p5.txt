Russia has deep historical ties with Serbia and vehemently opposed NATO’s war over Kosovo in 1999. After an   bombing campaign, Serbia lost control over the region but continues to support Serbs there, vowing never to recognize the sovereignty of Kosovo, which it considers the cradle of the Serbian nation and of its Christian Orthodox faith. Mr. Putin has continued to back Serbia, as well as Serbs living in Bosnia and Herzegovina   —   and continued to dabble in the complex swirl of Balkan politics.
