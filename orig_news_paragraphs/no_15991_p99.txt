Before arrival in the United States, refugees are interviewed, fingerprinted and given medical screenings, among other security checks. Finally, they arrive in the United States, go through U. S. Customs and Border Protectionâ€™s National Targeting Center and then must apply for a green card within a year of arrival, which triggers another set of security procedures.
