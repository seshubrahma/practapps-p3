Florida, along with Iowa and Virginia, permanently disenfranchises anyone with a felony conviction. As a result, roughly 1. 5 million Florida residents (almost 10% of the state’s population) are disenfranchised. This year, one in four of Florida’s black residents could not cast a ballot. Clinton lost Florida by just 112, 000 votes.
