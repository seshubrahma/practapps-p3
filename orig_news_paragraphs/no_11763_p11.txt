If elected President, Clinton would presumably be in office for more than one year. As such, Trump is correct to say that under her plan, Clinton would admit hundreds of thousands refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth during her presidency.

Plus, once Clinton’s Syrian refugees are here as green card holders, they will have the ability to bring over their family members through chain migration.
