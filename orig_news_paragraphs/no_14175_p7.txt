The policy team at the White House developed the executive order on refugees and visas, and largely avoided the traditional interagency process that would have allowed the Justice Department and homeland security agencies to provide operational guidance, according to numerous officials who spoke to CNN on Saturday. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Department of Homeland Security leadership saw the final details shortly before the order was finalized, government officials said. Friday night, DHS arrived at the legal interpretation that the executive order restrictions applying to seven countries    Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen    did not apply to people with lawful permanent residence, generally referred to as green card holders.   The White House overruled that guidance overnight, according to officials familiar with the rollout.
