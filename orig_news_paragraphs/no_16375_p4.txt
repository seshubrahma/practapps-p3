" Top officials in Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters held calls with Democratic Party officials in Arizona and Georgia on Monday to discuss a   investment in those two states, pledging that the money will not only help Clinton and her presidential campaign, but also the two Senate campaigns that are currently being run against incumbent Republicans. The idea inside Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters: If Clinton is within striking distance in Arizona and Georgia, two state that haven’t voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since the ’90s, Trump has a narrow path to 270 electoral votes. That said, Democrats said Tuesday that there is growing confidence that Clinton could win in Arizona and Georgia, especially if the local parties can turn out minority voters and white women.
