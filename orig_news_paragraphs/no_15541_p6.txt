So, why is all of this significant?   Democrats in Congress are accusing the president of obstruction of justice, intentionally and illegally interfering with the government carrying out its work, because the memo suggests that President Trump asked Director Comey to quit investigating Flynn.   The president eventually fired Comey, that happened last week.   And some Republicans are calling for Comey to testify before Congress, about his conversation with President Trump. The White House says Comeyâ€™s memo is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between Trump and Comey, and that the president has never asked Comey or anyone else to end any investigation.
