Bachmann said the protesters were using profanity to verbally harass Trump supporters, spitting on them, and were so much a threat to the community that police officers advised people that they needed to leave through alternative exits.   Bachmann told Breitbart News via text message about the Friday night event: The deranged left was on hand at the Trump event last night in Minneapolis looking for   predictably choreographed trouble. They were swearing at attendees as we arrived, spitting at whomever they could reach. They werenâ€™t protesting as much as they were looking to beat people up.
