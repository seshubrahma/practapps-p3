The bottom line though is if you’re running for president of the United States, and you know this is an issue that’s driving votes, you darn well want to have your position out there hard and fast and loud so people have no confusion. I know that both Sen. Rubio and Sen. Cruz are going to face this question whether or not they get asked it at the debate and if I were Sen. Cruz in particular I would welcome this question because I’d want to clear the air that he’s against the Trans Pacific Partnership.
