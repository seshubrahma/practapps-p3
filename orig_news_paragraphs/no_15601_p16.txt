In the first four months of 2017, more than 12, 000 people sought asylum in Canada, according to government figures. That’s more than half of the total number officials registered last year. Since January, police have registered more than 1, 000 unauthorized border crossings from the United States into Canada on this street alone. The majority of people crossing here, officials say, claim to be afraid of deportation from the United States or worried about Trump’s immigration policies.
