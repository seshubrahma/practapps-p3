Courthouses are often the first place individuals interact with local governments. It is the site of resolution for not only criminal matters, where a victim might seek justice when she has been harmed or wronged, but also for resolution of civil matters, including family and custody issues, housing, public benefits, and numerous other aspects integral to an individual’s life. "  DHS said the statement from the Civil Rights Commission was based on "innuendo and incorrect assumptions" and that they did not contact the department in advance.   "Determinations about where and how ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) personnel carry out arrests are made on a    basis, taking into account all aspects of the situation, including the target’s criminal history safety considerations the viability of the leads on the individual’s whereabouts and any sensitivities involving the prospective arrest location," spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said.
