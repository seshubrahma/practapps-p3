"   ’ ’      " I commend the Deapartment of Justice for taking the     appropriate step of appointing a special counsel to investigate     the Russian government’’s efforts to interefere in the 2016     presidential election and any links to the Trump campaign. The     issue of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and     Russian officials is extremely serious and the American     people deserve answers.
