In her new role, Ms. Fitzpatrick oversees assets that Soros Fund Management invests directly, as well as more than a handful of outside hedge fund managers and private equity firms. It is similar to the role Ms. Fitzpatrick played at UBS O’Connor several years ago. And during her last year at the Swiss bank, she held a more strategic role, managing teams across all of UBS’s asset management unit, and overseeing more than half a trillion dollars. It was a prestigious job, but one that removed her from the    trading and market strategizing that associates say she loves most.
