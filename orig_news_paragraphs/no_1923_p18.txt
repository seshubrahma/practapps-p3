No shortage of Reince Priebus photos hang on the walls of the R. N. C. ’s headquarters on Capitol Hill. He can be a little  . He travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required. Priebus was giddy when I spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for Time’s "100 most influential people" at Lincoln Center.
