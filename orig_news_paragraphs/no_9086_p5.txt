Taxpayers with the resources to hire skilled accountants can exploit the tax system to minimize, and even largely eliminate, a burden which less wealthy taxpayers have no choice but to share. This is something the Left is prone to complaining about, as well as the libertarian Right, but the Left always offers the fraudulent "solution" of raising taxes instead of simplifying them, because liberal politicians derive so much power from granting their friends and favored constituents exceptions from tax law. Such practices are no less corrupt because they are perfectly legal. Indeed, oppressive governments are eager to legalize corruption at every opportunity, to maximize the profits of the political class.
