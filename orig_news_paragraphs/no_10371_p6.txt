ABC News’ piece focuses predominantly on the impact of hoax hate crimes on Muslims, rather than Trump supporters who are primarily blamed for the fake attacks: Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the Council on   Relations (CAIR) told ABC News today that he believes the false reports are "statistically inevitable when you have such a large pool of reports. "   …     Hooper added that he was concerned about how such reports are used against the   community at large, which has been hurting and experiencing tremendous levels of fear, especially after the presidential election. " These false reports unfortunately give ammunition to the industry of Islamophobes who promote the demonization and dehumanization of Islamic Muslims," he said.
