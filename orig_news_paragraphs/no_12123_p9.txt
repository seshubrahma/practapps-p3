Trump forced the sitting president of the United States, Obama, to —  after leaving Louisiana underwater for days while vacationing and golfing on Martha’s Vineyard off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts —  finally visit Louisiana this week. Clinton, meanwhile, has come under withering criticism for flying over the state on her way from a fundraiser with Cher in Massachusetts and birthday party with her husband former President Bill Clinton —  also on Martha’s Vineyard —  to Hollywood for another lavish fundraiser. Clinton says she will eventually visit the state, but hasn’t committed as to when. Couple all that with Clinton under fire from the media for holding no press conference in more than 260 days now, along with a new email scandal and new Clinton Cash scandal revelations —  including evidence that interweaves the two scandals together.
