Nearly a month after he was fired by the Trump administration, Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, remains mystified by the circumstances of his ouster, saying he had never been told why President Trump changed his mind about wanting him to stay on. In his first interview since he was forced out, Mr. Bharara said this week that his firing was part and parcel of what he characterized as the chaos that has defined some of the administration’s decisions. He called it "a direct example of the kind of uncertain   incompetence, when it comes to personnel decisions and executive actions, that was in people’s minds when this     call for everyone’s resignation letter came.
