Paddy Power, the Irish gambling website known for its    marketing stunts, says wagers associated with Mr. Trump have been more popular than any other novelty bets it has offered in the last year, including bets associated with Britainâ€™s referendum on whether to leave the European Union. Now, Paddy Power is hiring a "head of Trump betting" to oversee bets related to the American president and his administration. The company, which is part of Paddy Power Betfair, a bookmaking business based in Dublin, is advertising the   contracted position amid sustained interest in   bets.
