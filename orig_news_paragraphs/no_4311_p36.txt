MacArthur admitted, "That was our intention, the reality that the House has to write its legislation in a way that is consistent with the Senateâ€™s rules and we would have to go back into this issue in a separate piece of legislation which I cosponsored. I voted on this bill before we voted on the American Health Care Act. By the time we voted on ACHA, we already voted on another standalone bill to mandate that Congress and our staff are covered by the same provision. "
