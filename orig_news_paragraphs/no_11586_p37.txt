I think a change is in order, and a quick tour through a rogue’s gallery of those that have led blacks astray will probably convince you of the same. I wanted to call this the basket of deplorables,  but the phrase was taken by Sick Hillary.   So I am calling it the Rogue’s Gallery. Unlike Hillary who painted millions of Americans with a broad brush, I am taking specific aim at leaders who have hurt black America much more than they helped it.
