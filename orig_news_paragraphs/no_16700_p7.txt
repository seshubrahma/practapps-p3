Clinton spoke with Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts and Democratic North Carolina Rep. Alma Adams, whose district includes Charlotte, about the shooting and protests today, a Clinton aide said. They discussed "steps we must take to ensure that everyone is respected by the law, and everyone has respect for the law," the aide added. Meanwhile, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is considering a trip to Charlotte next week after Mondayâ€™s debate, two aides told CNN. Campaign officials are looking at the logistics involved in such a trip, which would also bring Trump to a critical battleground state.
