There may be no legal sanction to seek in this instance, since public oratory is rarely protected by copyright. And I wouldn’t go so far as to claim that the passages apparently cribbed from Michelle Obama’s speech rise to the level of deathless eloquence.

The candid and emotionally honest nature of the words Melania spoke stands in utter opposition to the mendacity of the plagiarism from which they arose.
