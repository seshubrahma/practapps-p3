When shaking hands on the deal, Obama promised the United States would reduce "global warming" by cutting U. S. emission of "greenhouses gases" by   by 2025, chiefly by taxing natural fuels and subsidizing new solar energy. Trump’s decision to quit the Paris deal would help many U. S. manufacturing industries by reducing the cost of energy from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. That cheaper energy would be a big gain for the   manufacturing communities in the midwestern states whose voters carried Trump over the Democrats’ "Blue Wall" November 8, 2016.
