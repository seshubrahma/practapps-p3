Texas Senator Ted Cruz visited the Laredo Sector of the U. S.  border and did not contact Border Patrol agents to discuss their needs. [According to the agents, Senator Cruz has yet to contact them through his freshman term in the U. S. Senate. The Border Patrol agents reached out to Breitbart Texas and rebuked the Senator for what they say is a pattern of having tough rhetoric while taking little action. The agents say that Senator Cruz only shows up to the border to hand out teddy bears on camera or to hear the Obama Administration political appointeesâ€™ glossy version of the realities on the ground.
