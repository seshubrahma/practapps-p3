Bill Clinton and Lynch met privately on Monday. Clinton, who had been in the Phoenix area earlier in the day for a fundraiser for his wife’s campaign, according to a campaign source, joined Lynch aboard her plane while both were on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.   " I certainly wouldn’t do it again because I think it has cast this shadow over what it should not, over what it will not touch," Lynch said Friday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, adding, "It’s important to make it clear that that meeting with President Clinton does not have a bearing on how this matter will be reviewed and resolved."
