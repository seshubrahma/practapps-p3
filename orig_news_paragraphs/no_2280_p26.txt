One of them, according to court filings, involved a network of offshore companies that government investigators and independent journalists in Ukraine have said was used to launder public money and assets purportedly stolen by cronies of the government. The network comprised shell companies whose ultimate owners were shielded by the secrecy laws of the offshore jurisdictions where they were registered, including the British Virgin Islands, Belize and the Seychelles. In a recent interview, Serhiy V. Gorbatyuk, Ukraine’s special prosecutor for   corruption cases, pointed to an open file on his desk containing paperwork for one of the shell companies, Milltown Corporate Services Ltd. which played a central role in the state’s purchase of two oil derricks for $785 million, or about double what they were said to be worth.
