Republicans have been using the   budget reconciliation process to try to gut Obamacare. It allows the House and the Senate to pass a bill with just a simple majority of votes.

Democrats have pointed to that strategy as irrefutable proof that Republicans have no interest in reaching across the aisle on health care.
