With wages down, record numbers not working, and crime rising in cities across the U. S. the next person to occupy the oval office will have to chart a dramatically different course. That course must include: • Immigration control and reduction, • A dedicated effort to reduce crime and prosecute armed career criminals and drug dealers, • Cancelling the   2     Partnership, and rebuilding our manufacturing core, •   : celebrating the dignity of work, and helping our own people move from welfare to   jobs, • Adoption and implementation of a balanced budget plan, • Repeal of Obamacare, • Creating a smaller, leaner and less costly bureaucracy, • Streamlining the tax code, making it easier to keep jobs and wealth in America, • Tapping into our vast energy resources, • Restoration of the constitutional rule of law. Haley’s robotic response devoid of any emotion is why Americans hate politics. It is obvious the speech was written before Obama’s speech, as there were no specific rebuttals to anything Obama said.
