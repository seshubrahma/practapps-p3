Especially given   the fact that countries like the US are actively fostering the   technology that makes this possible. US companies are developing   driverless vehicles and authorities are supporting that   development by giving safety and regulatory guidance. There is   much less certainty in developing markets about how such   technology will develop. It is therefore easy to see the appeal   of driverless vehicles to a manufacturer in Milwaukee over one in   Mexico.
