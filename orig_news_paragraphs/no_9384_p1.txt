The Times notes: With the Obama administration on its way out, it seemed like a good time to nail down more   federal support on the assumption that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. So the state set up a meeting to ask the U. S. Department of Transportation to publicly announce a federal loan of up to $15 billion that would help build an initial rail segment from San Jose to Shafter, northwest of Bakersfield, which would cement federal support during the transition to a new presidential administration. Such a loan  —    even the commitment for one  —   would also show potential private investors that the project was "creditworthy," according to a briefing document for the meeting.
