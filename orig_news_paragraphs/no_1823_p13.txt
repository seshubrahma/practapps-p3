The club, which had a prominent sign declaring "No racism sexism homophobia transphobia violence," had a welcoming, diverse crowd. I zigzagged down to the corner of DeKalb and Broadway, where I spotted a big, empty lot where a colorful food truck was parked and a tarp under which a small group of people were animatedly debating politics. I picked up a $7 chicken arepa from the truck, Papelón con Limón, and joined the group at the moment the skies opened up and sheets of rain came pouring down. Everyone crowded in to avoid getting wet, and the conversation continued.
