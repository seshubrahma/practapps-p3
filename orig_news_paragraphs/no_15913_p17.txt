FBME, which was based in Tanzania, could not be reached for comment for this story. In May, the institution was shut down by Tanzania’s central bank because of U. S. accusations that it was "used by its customers to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, transnational organized crime, fraud, sanctions evasions and other illicit activity internationally and through the US financial system," according to the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.   There are oddities to   transaction, say financial analysts consulted by CNN who have examined the contract and supporting documents.   For one thing, Balec is described by FBME as being commercially engaged in the "  [of] promissory notes" and the import and export of building materials such as ceramic and marble tiles, timber, steel coils and "furnitures" [sic].
