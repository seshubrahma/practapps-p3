I am so thankful to my family and friends for believing in me and supporting me.   I am truly grateful to President Elect Donald J. Trump for giving me the opportunity to tell my story in the public arena of the 2nd Presidential Debate.    Iâ€™ve had messages from dozens of victims of sexual abuse and rape and I tell them: Do not give up hope.   Sexual abuse and rape are heinous crimes regardless of who commits them.
