The Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al Nahyan, came out strongly in defense of President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration Wednesday, the first such supportive comment from a Gulf Arab state. [As the Associated Press reports, Sheikh Abdullah first emphasized that the United States has the right to make a "sovereign decision" regarding its immigration policy.   Abdullah went on to defend the order itself, rather than merely acknowledging President Trump had the right to issue it. He pronounced himself satisfied with Trump’s assurances that the order was not based on religion (i. e. " ") and noted that only seven out of the many   countries were affected by it.
