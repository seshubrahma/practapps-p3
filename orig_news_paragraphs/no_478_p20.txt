In Bulgaria, the president acts as head of state and commander in chief of the military, but most political power resides with the prime minister. Boyko Borissov, who took a slightly more   tilt but also strongly favored close ties with Moscow, stepped down as prime minister after Mr. Radev’s victory. Mr. Radev had 20 opponents in his race for president, said Ivo Indzhev, a   journalist. Just one, he said, explicitly echoed the   alliance’s language toward sanctions against Russia over its seizure of Crimea.
