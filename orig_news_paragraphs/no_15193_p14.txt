A man who turned himself in to Antwerp police was Youssef El Osri. The man’s lawyer, Nabil Riffi, told CNN his client was "very shocked" at being linked to the Paris shooting and that he had been working at a gas station in Antwerp at the time it occurred.   Security in Paris has been stepped up in recent days, but the presence of 50, 000 police officers on the streets was not enough to prevent the latest assault, which was being investigated by   officials. French President François Hollande convened a meeting of the country’s defense council Friday.
