The climate models relied upon by the IPCC and the politicians they advise have predicted warming at about twice the rate observed during the past 27 years, during which the Earth has warmed at 0. 4 °C, about half of the 0. 75 °C   warming rate implicit in IPCC’s explicit 1990 prediction that there would be 1. 0 °C warming from  .    Green and Armstrong (2014) conducted   validation tests of the models and found that their forecasts were much less accurate than assuming there had been no global warming at all. The relative inaccuracy of the IPCC projections increased with longer ( ) horizons.
