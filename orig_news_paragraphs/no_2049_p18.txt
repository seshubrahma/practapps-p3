After Trump left the broadcast booth, the second half began, and the momentum swung abruptly when Bradshaw quickly lost a fumble at the Army 32. Abey completed a screen pass to White that picked up 16 yards and then muscled into the end zone on a keeper that cut Navy’s deficit to   less than four minutes into the half. The Midshipmen picked up a   field goal by Bennett Moehring and took the lead on Abey’s touchdown run. But Army found a way when it really mattered.
