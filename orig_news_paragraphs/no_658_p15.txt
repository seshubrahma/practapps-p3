Like other consuls, Mr. González has tried to assuage fears by appearing frequently on   television and radio, offering information that American officials may not be willing to share. He has been careful to emphasize that the operations appeared to be targeted, not widespread raids as some feared, but also pointed out that several people without criminal records had also been arrested. Many of the consulates’ most pressing concerns now are defensive. In several cases last week, immigration agents were "unwilling to provide our nationals with the option to talk with our consulate and the obligation to notify us," said one Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue was still under investigation.
