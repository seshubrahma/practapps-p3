On Sunday, President Trump is expected to sign an executive order cutting funding to the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, in a restoration of Ronald Reaganâ€™s "Mexico City policy" that banned U. S. government funding of abortion around the world. The executive order would reportedly be timed to coincide with the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized    on all 50 states in the Union.
