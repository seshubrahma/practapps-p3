Monday’s decision means the case will go back to a court of appeals and likely removes the possibility that the Supreme Court will hear it this term. The decision comes in the wake of a change in policy by the Trump administration, which last month revoked   guidance on protections for transgender students in public schools. The lower court will now have to answer the bigger    and far more important    question of whether federal law and not just Executive Branch interpretations of it treat discrimination on the basis of gender identity as tantamount to sex discrimination. The Supreme Court’s announcement has the effect of letting a lower court answer that question first.
