Something tells me that Harris, who served two terms as San Francisco’s first female district attorney and then was the first woman elected as California attorney general, has been through this before, maybe her entire career.   I know that I certainly have, and frankly it’s gotten a little boring. This old "boys club" strategy is familiar:  the blatant disrespect and machismo that singles out women, especially intelligent women of color, who insist on being a part of the conversation.    Kamala Harris is every working woman who has ever earned a position of power and has not been afraid to use it.
