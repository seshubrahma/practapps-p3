Most voters, however, do not consider their vote a piece on a chess board. Rubio will likely pick up a few points of support, however, as some weaker supporters of Cruz and Kasich decide in the end to support Rubio as a means of blocking Trump. It isnâ€™t likely to be enough to lift Rubio to victory, but it will narrow the gap between Trump and Rubio. Rubio will also gain some support by having the only campaign devoting almost all of its resources in Florida.
