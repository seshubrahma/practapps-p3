@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 6:22 P. M. ET, It’s worth noting that Hillary Clinton’s statement doesn’t mention or address the systemic corruption inside her own party that led to her nomination as part of a "rigged system. " She, like Obama and Biden, just praised her "friend" Wasserman Schultz and didn’t push for ANY changes or reforms.
