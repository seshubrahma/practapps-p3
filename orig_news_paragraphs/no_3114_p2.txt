visa workers filled more than half a million jobs in the U. S. in the past five years. The North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) is denouncing the plan, saying it will further undercut   American workers and the security of their jobs. " This maneuver runs directly counter to President’s Trump’s recent executive actions to ‘buy American and hire American,’ and which were specifically crafted to instruct the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security, and State to take prompt action to crack down on fraud and abuse in our immigration system in order to protect workers in the United States and their economic conditions," NABTU officials said in a statement.
