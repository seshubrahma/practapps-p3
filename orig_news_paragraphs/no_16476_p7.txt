Is it any wonder David Duke, former head of the Ku Klux Klan, feels emboldened to run for office? Or that former UN Ambassador John Bolton, speaking on Fox News Thursday, feels free to say that people are being destructive if they identify as black or Hispanic?

That’s why Clinton’s   confrontation with Trump’s racism in this speech is so necessary and powerful.
