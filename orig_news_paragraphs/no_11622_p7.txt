We’re working closely   @WMATA to design a sleeve for @TrumpInaugural SmartTrip cards, similar to what was done for @Pontifex visit to DC!   —   Boris Epshteyn (@BorisEP) December 22, 2016,   Epshteyn noted that Trump’s inaugural team is working with WMATA to make   sleeves for the special Metro Cards with Trump’s image on them. The sleeves are similar to what WMATA made for the September 2015 visit to Washington, D. C. of Pope Francis.
