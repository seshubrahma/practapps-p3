With more Republican lawmakers coming around to endorse Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan had stayed silent on when, or if, he would join them. Representative Chris Collins, the New York Republican who was the first member of Congress to endorse Mr. Trump, said Mr. Ryan’s announcement signaled the party’s growing unity. " Speaker Ryan’s endorsement today reinforces the fact that Republicans are united in our fight to defeat Hillary Clinton," he said in a statement.
