During a meeting of the National Security Council, Hwang   the acting president of South Korea, called for the early deployment of the American missile defense system known as Thaad, or Terminal   Area Defense. The United States and South Korea have agreed to complete the Thaad deployment within the year. They say it is meant to protect South Korea and American military sites there from North Korean missiles. But China says Thaad would undermine its own nuclear deterrent and has hinted at economic retaliation against South Korea.
