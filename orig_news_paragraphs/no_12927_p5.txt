Senator Clinton has a different philosophical view than I do about what government’s role is. She believes the government and Washington D. C. needs to be even strengthened more and more power put into Washington D. C. I disagree with that and I disagree with it powerfully, because I think if we’re really going to be the country that our founding fathers saw for us to be, the freedoms that are out there.
