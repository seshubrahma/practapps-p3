Ms. Holliday said she was asked on Wednesday if she would sing at the concert scheduled for Jan. 19, and she agreed, seeing the request as similar to those she received to sing at the White House during past Republican and Democratic presidencies. " I just thought of the history part of it, and about singing on the mall where Marian Anderson paved the way for me to sing as a black American," she said, referring to a 1939 concert that Ms. Anderson, a popular singer, performed from the Lincoln Memorial after being denied permission to sing at Constitution Hall because she was black. Ms. Holliday said she had been startled and disheartened on Friday by the venom that greeted the news of her participation.
