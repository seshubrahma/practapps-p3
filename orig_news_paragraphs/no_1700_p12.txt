The president is considering whether to publicly lay out his own parameters for a settlement of the   conflict, a prospect Mr. Netanyahu has strongly opposed. The presidentâ€™s speech to the General Assembly would be a logical place for such a move, though his advisers say he might wait until after the November election to avoid its becoming part of campaign politics. If he proceeds, he could give a speech outlining his ideas or even encapsulate them in a resolution before the United Nations Security Council.
