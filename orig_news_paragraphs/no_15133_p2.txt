Officials say the primary goal of the trip will be to reinforce regional security alliances. The same foreign policy adviser stressed that they will be discussing North Korea’s "belligerency" at every stop, and that broadly speaking, military options were being assessed and would come up. To this end, Pence will meet with the acting President of South Korea, Hwang   to reinforce the US commitment to consult with South Korea over North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs. In meetings with South Korean leaders, officials say the vice president is prepared to discuss sanctions if the topic is raised.
