The   Latino in Congress would be a bold choice for Clinton. Though he doesn’t have the same name recognition as Castro, Becerra has a stellar record on the Hill and is widely respected within the Latino community.

At the same time, given Becerra’s resume, he would also confirm the impression that the Democratic ticket is one with governing experience.
