President Obama has in fact already used this power. This existing statutory grant of authority to the President, and to those to whom he may delegate this power, is very broad, and a very recent Supreme Court decision held that he could withhold visas on national security grounds without providing any reason at all.   Thus, even without any action by Congress to give him additional authority, it is likely that the President could at least temporarily ban immigrants who are Muslim. If Congress were to back this proposal by enacting specific legislation to carry it out, the case for its legality would be even stronger.
