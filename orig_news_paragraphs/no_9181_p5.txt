If Cruz wins Arizona, Trump’s "need to win" number jumps to 58 percent. The most recent Arizona poll, conducted on March 8 prior to Rubio’s withdrawal, showed Trump with a 14 point lead over Cruz in the state. While Arizona, where Trump also benefits from the endorsements of former Governor Jan Brewer and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, looks to be a likely Trump win, Utah is another matter entirely. The decision today to cancel the planned March 21 Fox News debate in Utah following Trump’s decision not to attend, and Kasich’s subsequent decision not to attend as well, adds a significant element of uncertainty to the outcome in Utah.
