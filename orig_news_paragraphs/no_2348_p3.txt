One possibility is that every little twist and turn in polls represents a real shift in a volatile race. If that’s the case, perhaps we’ll look back and say that the debate was decisive: The race was very close before, and Mrs. Clinton took a clear lead after. The other interpretation is that the race is stable but that the polls are volatile, as changes in news media coverage affect the likelihood that people respond to surveys or are judged to be likely voters. If this idea is right, it’s harder to evaluate Mrs. Clinton’s debate bounce.
