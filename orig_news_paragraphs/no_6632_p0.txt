On Friday’s "PBS NewsHour," New York Times columnist David Brooks said President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement was due to "some sense of resentment, a sense of social inferiority, a sense of fragile ego. "   Brooks said, "I’m just struck by the fact that his administration is driven solely by resentment. He will side with the Steve Bannon side if that position alienates the people he feels resentful for. He will side with the regular Republican side and the budgetery, the more free market side if that will offend elite opinion.
