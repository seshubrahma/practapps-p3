It’s a disturbing preview of what kind of President he’d be. This is what I want to make clear today: A man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the internet, should never run our government or command our military. If he doesn’t respect all Americans, how can he serve all Americans? Now, I know some people still want to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.
