Wilbur Ross, commerce secretary, Hearing schedule: 10 a. m. Thursday before the Senate Commerce Committee, Ross, a New York billionaire businessman, is likely to face tough questioning from Democrats eager to portray his  record as at odds with Trump’s populist appeal to working Americans during the campaign. Should he be confirmed, Ross is expected to have an outsized impact on US trade policy compared to past Commerce secretaries as he would be put in charge of overseeing US trade policy and renegotiating existing trade deals, in line with Trump’s campaign pledges.
