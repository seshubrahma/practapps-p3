Outgoing Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the federal government has a mandate to hold police officers accountable for their actions. ["You’ve got to hold police accountable, you’ve got to help them hold themselves accountable, and you’ve got to build in community accountability," she told the Associated Press in an interview published Saturday.   Lynch also said that relationships between the Justice Department and local law enforcement had improved. Her comments come a day after the Justice Department released a scathing report on the Chicago Police Department’s civil rights violations, the Hill reported.
