His Saturday tweet of a graphic that included Hillary Clinton’s face, a   star, a pile of cash and the words "most corrupt candidate ever" drew immediate backlash for evoking   imagery. The image was posted 10 days earlier to an   white supremacist message board. Trump on Monday morning initially addressed the controversy    again on Twitter    by blaming the "dishonest media" for "trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff’s Star, or plain star!" On Monday afternoon, the Trump campaign finally issued a statement on the matter    one that amounted more to a response to the Clinton campaign statement than an explanation of his tweet.
