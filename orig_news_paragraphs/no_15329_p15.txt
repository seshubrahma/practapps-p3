Recep Tayyip Erdogan: Kudos for coup response , Trump appeared to offer his seal of approval for Erdogan’s ambitions to replace Turkey’s current system of parliamentary democracy with an   executive presidency in a congratulatory phone conversation shortly after the Turkish referendum. While many have criticized Erdogan’s crackdown on major opposition figures, a senior Trump administration official told CNN that the call bypassed the subject and instead focused mostly on Syria. Prior to this, Trump had previously shown admiration for how Erdogan had handled the last year’s failed coup in a July 2016 interview with the New York Times.
