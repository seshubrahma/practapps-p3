Of the 16 new justices since 1969, 12 were Republican appointees, four Democratic, not counting William Rehnquist’s elevation in 1986 from associate justice to chief.   When President George W. Bush named Roberts to the center chair, Roberts had a   majority for the conservatism he had embraced since he was a young lawyer in the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s. Under Roberts’ leadership, the court curtailed the protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other racial remedies, allowed more religion inpublic places, and restricted   lawsuits against corporate America.
