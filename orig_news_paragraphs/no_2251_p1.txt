It remains unclear whether Trump can be brought to his knees the way Mitt Romney was by ads like "Coffin" and "Firms," which alleged that Romney’s investment firm, Bain Capital, closed factories and shipped jobs abroad. In April, during the primary campaign, Politico reported that Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster currently working for the   "super PAC" Priorities USA Action, contended in a phone interview that Trump’s immunity to criticism worked only in the primaries among Republican voters: "Trump is not Teflon. " Among all voters, Garin argued, "a majority has come to the conclusion that Trump is unfit for the job and that he would represent a significant risk as president. "
