In January 1999, Prosecutor General Yury Skuratov was summoned to the Kremlin by   Boris Yeltsin’s chief of staff, who showed him a videotape of "a man who looked like" Skuratov frolicking in bed with two prostitutes. Then he asked Skuratov to resign, even though the prosecutor was in the middle of investigating Yeltsin’s administration for taking bribes from a Swiss firm trying to secure lucrative contracts for Kremlin renovations. It was a grainy tape and Skuratov would later say it was fake, but he submitted his resignation nonetheless.
