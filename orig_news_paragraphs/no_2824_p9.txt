The U. S. today commemorates the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, the deadliest terrorist attack on U. S. soil. The National September 11 Memorial Museum, at ground zero, has portraits of almost all of the nearly 3, 000 people killed that day in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, but seven are still being sought. Can you help? There may be no better way to understand how the passengers of Flight 93 fought their hijackers and brought their plane down in Shanksville, Pa. killing all aboard, than listening to Robert Franz, a    interpretive park ranger at the memorial there.
