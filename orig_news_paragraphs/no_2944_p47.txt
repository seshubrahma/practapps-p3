it has trended slightly toward the G. O. P. with respect to the country over the last decade or so, and it doesn’t have very many nonwhite voters. I have a slightly different view, which is that I think Pennsylvania is as good a state as any for Trump, even if it’s not a great one. So, I take the point that it’s a huge long shot. But just about everything is a long shot for Trump at this point, and I’m not convinced it’s harder for him than a state like Colorado or Virginia, which are better educated and more diverse, even if they have less Democratic voting traditions.
