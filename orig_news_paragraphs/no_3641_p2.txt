Our enemy is fanatical, determined, well organised. Plus, they still hold most of the key positions: the big banks, the corporations, the top law firms, the civil service, local government, the universities, the schools, the mainstream media, Hollywood  …     Give those bastards half the chance and they’ll drive us back into the sea  —   which, in contemporary terms, means nixing Brexit (or giving us "soft Brexit" which is basically the same thing) and frustrating all the things President Trump will try to do to Make America Great Again.   I use the war analogy first because World War II analogies never fail, but second because this really is a war that we’re fighting.
