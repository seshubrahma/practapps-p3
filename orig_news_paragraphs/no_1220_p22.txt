Mr. Beaudry said La Meute was assigning followers to 17 geographic "clans," each with officers and staff, "so people know who to report to and where to go when things happen. " He said five clans were "fully operational," and he expected all to be formed by the end of the year. The group has transportation cells that take people to meetings and has medical units to care for the injured.
