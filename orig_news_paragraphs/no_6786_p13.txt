The new policies, Trump continued, would require Cuba to "put an end to the abuse of dissidents, release the political prisoners, stop jailing innocent people, open yourselves to political and economic freedoms, return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop killer Joanne Chesimard" before America would be open to a deal with them. In another nod to the   community, Trump acknowledged the murder of U. S. citizens in the 1996 Brothers to the Rescue incident. With their family in attendance, he promised them, "they did not die in vain. " "We challenge Cuba to come to the table with a new agreement that is in the best interests of both their people and our people, and also for Cuban Americans," Trump concluded, before sitting down to sign the new policies into action.
