Democratic strategists say they believe as many as a dozen districts could become competitive late in the race, depending on Mr. Trumpâ€™s fortunes. Among the Republican districts that Democrats see as newly threatened are those held by Representatives John L. Mica of Florida, who represents the Orlando area Kevin Yoder of Kansas, from the suburbs of Kansas City and Michael G. Fitzpatrick, a lawmaker from outside Philadelphia who is retiring. Several others represent diverse, economically comfortable areas of California, including Representatives Darrell E. Issa and Ed Royce, from the San Diego and Los Angeles suburbs. Both parties are also eyeing a set of   to   open seats in states like Indiana and Minnesota, where incumbents are retiring or running for other offices.
