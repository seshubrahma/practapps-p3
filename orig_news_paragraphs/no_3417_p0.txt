The Washington Post has published a "blind item" White House report   —   where not only its sources but the subject of the article is anonymous. [Using "people familiar with the matter" as sources, the Post’s Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report that the investigation into the Trump campaign and its connections to Russia "has identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest, showing that the probe is reaching the highest levels of government. "   The person is a senior White House adviser "close to the president," but the unnamed sources would not identify that official, the Post reported.
