The radio stations Radio X and FM93 are among those cited as giving voice to   activists. While their own commentary may be muted, they give a platform to   voices from sites like Point de Bascule, which means Tipping Point, and Poste de Veille, which translates roughly as "Watchtower" and whose website shows a pirate ship with a jihadist flag as its sail approaching Quebec City. One popular conspiracy theory links Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the Muslim Brotherhood, a   group that supports the application of Islamic law in Muslim communities. Even Quebec City’s mayor, Régis Labeaume, who was visibly moved at a news conference on Monday while showing support for the Muslim community, has expressed frustration with some orthodox Muslim customs.
