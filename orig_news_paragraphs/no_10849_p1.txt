com, Senator Kaine based his contention that the FBI was working to undermine Clinton solely on a statement by the former Republican Mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani. Just prior to Director Comey’s October 28 announcement that the FBI had opened a new investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal, Giuliani had said that a "big surprise" was about to come out of the FBI. Giuliani went on to say that he had heard from individual FBI agents that there was "tremendous anger" inside the Bureau over Comey’s July decision not to recommend that the Department of Justice indict Hillary for her obvious violations of our national security laws. Rudy was hardly alone in mentioning these rumblings, as there were many stories in the media relating that anger.
