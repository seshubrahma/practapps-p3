A New York   News poll earlier this year found that 64% of voters answered "no" when asked if they felt Clinton was "honest and trustworthy" though the same said that of Trump as well. On Monday, Clinton said she understood people having questions about her and acknowledged that she has to earn it. " Now maybe we can persuade people to change their minds by marshaling facts and making arguments to rebut negative attacks," Clinton said.
