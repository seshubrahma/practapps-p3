The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack. No group has yet claimed it.   Afghanistanâ€™s intelligence service, the National Directorate of Security, said in a statement that the Haqqani Network, a   group in Pakistan, carried out the bombing. But the Islamist terror group has yet to say anything about the bombing.
