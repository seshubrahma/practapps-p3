In his world, instead of expensive,   military incursions, all you’d do is take people already trained by U. S. tax payer   —   former SEALs, former DELTA, "veterans itching to do us a favour"  —   and deploy them on the basis that they can sell any captured weaponry, loot, or claim bounties from the U. S. government for certain operations. Sounds crazy, right? But not until you speak to military officials or private military types do you realise this is a strategy that the U. S. is moving closer and closer towards anyway.
