Join me and my family in praying and fasting for our nation and our God to look down and forgive us of our misguided ways. "Help us Lord to return to you and have the bravery to do the hard thing   â€”   to Trust in You and to do our part by standing firm in the eternal truths that Got us here in the first place. " Let us renew our covenant with Him and as George Washington did and humbly seek his face, guidance and protection.
