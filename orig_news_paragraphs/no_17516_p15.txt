In a 2009 report arguing that immigrants have "high rates of criminality," the Center for Immigration Studies pointed to statistics that  . S. citizens represent a quarter of the U. S. prison population. This weekâ€™s report from the American Immigration Council counters that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes and are overrepresented in the federal prison system. Citing the American Community Survey, the report also notes that the percentage of   men in the United States who are incarcerated (1. 6%) is less than the percentage of U. S.  men who are imprisoned (3. 3%).
