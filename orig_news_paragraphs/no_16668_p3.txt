FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said Monday there is no evidence that Rahami was part of a cell, which also makes him also a typical American terrorist. Every lethal terrorist attack since   has been carried out by a   "lone wolf" or a pair of terrorists who were not part of a larger cell. Indeed, in many ways Rahami is almost exactly like Omar Mateen, who killed 49 at an Orlando nightclub in June. Mateen was a    married father and an American citizen of Afghan descent born in New York who carried out his plot by himself.
