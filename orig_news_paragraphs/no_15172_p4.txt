While reporters at the United Nations have heard similar rhetoric from North Koreans before, Monday’s forceful wording was on a higher level. The deputy ambassador, reading from a statement, told reporters, "The US is disturbing the global peace and stability and insisting on the   logic that its invasion of a sovereign state is ’decisive, and just, and proportionate’ and contributes to ’defending’ the international order in its bid to apply it to the Korean Peninsula as well. "    Kim said his country is ready to react to any "mode of war" from the United States.
