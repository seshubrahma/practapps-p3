Mr. Trump’s warning on nuclear weapons came after Mr. Putin vowed to continue modernizing his nation’s nuclear weapons and asserted Russia’s military superiority over the United States. " Of course the U. S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case," Mr. Putin said at an    news conference in Moscow on Friday. Mr. Putin said Russia was not seeking a new nuclear arms race with the United States that his country could ill afford, and he reacted dismissively to Mr. Trump’s Twitter post about strengthening and expanding the American arsenal, noting that it was similar to what the   had promised on the campaign trail.
