" We wanted to do something that is a mix of America and Sevnica," Maja Kozole Popadic, whose family owns the bakery, told NPR. Additionally, the Kopitarna shoe store in Sevnica has gotten in on the Melania craze, creating "White House slippers" that retail for $60 a pair. The designer of the slipper, Maja Stamol, told NPR he has made 300 pairs and is almost sold out at this point.
