Just a week earlier, in a   loss to Temple in the American Athletic Conference championship game, Navy had lost quarterback Will Worth and slotback Toneo Gulley to   foot injuries on the same play. The damage from that loss seemed to hang over Navy as Army turned an early fumble by Shawn White into a     scoring drive that concluded when fullback Andy Davidson plunged in from the   line. Later, after a   Navy punt, Army went ahead,   as another   run by Davidson capped an   drive.
