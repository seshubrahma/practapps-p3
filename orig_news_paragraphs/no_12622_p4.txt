While recent polling shows the race tightening in California between Trump and Cruz, Trump leads Cruz in every region of the state except the rural, conservative Central Valley, where there are few congressional districts. The problem for Trump is that Cruz is far more organized. Last Thursday, Cruz met personally with hundreds of his potential delegates in the state. The Cruz campaign understands that in places with few Republicans, such as San Francisco, a few votes can make the difference  â€”   and can earn just as many delegates as in heavy Republican areas.
