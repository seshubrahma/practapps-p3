" Trump’s new policy, signed shortly after the speech, would "enforce the ban on tourism, enforce the embargo   …     take concrete steps that ensure investments float directly to the people so they can open private businesses and begin to build their country’s future," according to the president. The new policies, Trump continued, would require Cuba to "put an end to the abuse of dissidents, release the political prisoners, stop jailing innocent people, open yourselves to political and economic freedoms, return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop killer Joanne Chesimard" before America would be open to a deal with them.
