The second big prize tomorrow is Mississippi. The question is whether that state’s voters are more like Alabama’s voters, where Trump won in a landslide, or are more like Louisiana’s voters, where a late surge by Cruz kept Trump’s margin to just three points. Both Cruz and Trump have campaigned in Mississippi ahead of Tuesday’s vote. On Monday, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant announced his support for Cruz.
