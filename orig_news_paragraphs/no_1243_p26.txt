More than 130 civilians were killed and 170 injured in the same month in Raqqa, the center of the Islamic State   â€”    the vast majority in coalition airstrikes, Ms. Shamdasani said. Syrian government airstrikes conducted over two days in early April on Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital, Damascus, killed at least 42 civilians, she added.
