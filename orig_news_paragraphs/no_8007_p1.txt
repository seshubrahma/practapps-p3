Police reports show that more than 2, 000 men were involved in the sexual assaults. Only 120 of them were ever identified by the authorities. Those who were found were given suspended sentences of a year or less.   Both the scale of the crimes committed and the nationalities, religion and ethnicities of the assailants were obscured by both government and the media.
