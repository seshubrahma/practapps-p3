On social media, many of Mr. Johnson’s backers say they hope that Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who has had a public  feud with Mr. Trump, might get behind the Libertarian ticket, but so far they have had no luck converting him. In June, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska expressed interest in the Libertarian Party, but later said that Mr. Johnson’s positions on abortion, religious liberty and national security were deal breakers. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who has showered praise on Mr. Weld, pushed publicly this week for the Libertarians to be allowed in the debates. Still, he has given no sign that he will back the party’s ticket in November, even though he has said he will not vote for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton.
