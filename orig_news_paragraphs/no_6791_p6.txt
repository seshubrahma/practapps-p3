These endorsements send a strong signal to Republican and Independent voters that respected leaders are putting country over political party in this election," the Clinton campaign release said. The release even quotes Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, the disgraced leader whose emails would later be published on WikiLeaks, praising   Republicans like Tellis for undermining the GOP nominee and instead backing Clinton. Podesta said: Americans are looking to the next president to help bring us together to tackle the big challenges facing the country and Hillary Clinton’s   support is the latest proof that she can work across the aisle to make us stronger together. Hillary Clinton’s experience and temperament make her a steady leader for this unique moment while Donald Trump is unfit, lacks the temperament, and is too dangerous to be in the Oval Office and the Situation Room.
