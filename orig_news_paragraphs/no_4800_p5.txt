Asked to grade President Trump’s first 100 Days from a national security perspective, Gaffney said "there are some points that are encouraging. " "I’m very happy with a lot of his rhetoric, notably about restoring American policy to the practice of peace through strength, which my old boss Ronald Reagan of course espoused. I like the fact that he has set his sights on rebuilding our military, ensuring that our military deterrent is once again ‘top of the pack,’ as he put it, that we have a     missile defense for example. I think some of the uses of power that he has conducted have also helped give credibility to those rhetorical statements," he elaborated.
