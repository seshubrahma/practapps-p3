Megyn Kelly’s jump from Fox News to NBC seems like it has hit a rough patch. [Kelly announced in early January she was leaving Fox News after 12 years and going to NBC to headline her own weekday news program and a Sunday night, 60   show, and to appear on panels during big events.   However, according to a story in The Wall Street Journal, NBC still has not announced a definitive start date for Kelly, and neither of her shows seems to be coming together with any urgency. One proposal is for Kelly to anchor a 10 a. m. show in front of a live audience, but no producer has been named for the show and NBC won’t even confirm the plan.
