Monday on Fox News Channel’s "The O’Reilly Factor," host Bill O’Reilly reacted to the House Intelligence Committee hearing early in the day regarding President Donald Trump and his possible ties to Russia that featured testimony from FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers.   O’Reilly went through the numerous allegations leveled at Trump and his 2016 presidential campaign but downplayed the possibility that anything might come out of those charges. He went on to say that leaks within various federal government agencies must be dealt with. Transcript as follows (courtesy of BillOReilly. com)
