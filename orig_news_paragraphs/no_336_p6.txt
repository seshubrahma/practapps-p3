That same morning, before Mr. Spicerâ€™s statement, Mr. Reynolds received a message from the White House that the president wanted to talk to him. They connected in the early afternoon, according to one of the people who was briefed on the call and asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. The new president asked for additional photos that could confirm his view of his crowd size. A park service spokesman, Tom Crosson, said he could confirm that a call took place between Mr. Reynolds and the president, but he would not describe the content.
