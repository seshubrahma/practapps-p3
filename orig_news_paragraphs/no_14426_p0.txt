 (CNN) A flight out of Austin, Texas, was delayed after a pilot behaved in a way that caused passengers to believe she was mentally unstable, a United Airlines spokesman said Sunday.   The pilot, whom CNN is not naming, boarded the plane in street clothes and began speaking to passengers over the intercom, spokesman Charlie Hobart said. Passengers on Saturday’s San   flight took to social media to express concerns after the pilot spoke to them about her divorce and the presidential election, among other issues.
