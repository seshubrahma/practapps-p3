The Italian media business is also   for enterprising   researchers hoping to detect likely cases of indirect lobbying.    To understand the study’s methodology, consider Berlusconi’s   election in 2001, after six years of sitting on the political   sidelines.

Suppose furthermore that in 2001,   Fiat’s ad spend on Mediaset jumped to 60 percent (leaving just 40   percent for RAI ads).
