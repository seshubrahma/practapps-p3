When she headed toward the schoolâ€™s entrance, the protesters stood in front of her, video from CNN affiliate WJLA showed. DeVos then turned around and walked away, the video showed, with one protester walking beside her shouting, "Go back! Shame, shame" as she got into an SUV and drove off. In a statement issued Friday afternoon, DeVos said she subsequently got inside the school to meet with students, faculty and administrators.
