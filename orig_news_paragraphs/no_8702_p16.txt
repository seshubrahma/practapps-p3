In the 1920s, the last time the   share of the population reached a record high,   Calvin Coolidge hit the pause button for roughly fifty years, producing an era of explosive wage growth and allowing immigrants already in the country to assimilate. However, far from curbing or pausing migration, Hillary Clinton has indicated that if she is elected President, immigration into the United States will expand substantially â€”   including Muslim migration. Under the minimum numbers Clinton has put forth thus far, 730, 000 permanent migrants from the Muslim world would be admitted during her first term alone. This figure does not include temporary migration, such as foreign workers or foreign students.
