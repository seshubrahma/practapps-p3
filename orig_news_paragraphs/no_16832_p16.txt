The revelation that Trump has appeared in several Playboy videos comes as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton seeks to make Trump’s  derogatory statements and actions toward women an issue in the campaign. At the first presidential debate, Clinton hit Trump over his past treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump called "plumpy" and an "eating machine" after she won the pageant in 1996. Last Friday, Trump attacked Machado on Twitter, telling his followers to "check out" her "sex tape"  —   an apparent reference to her appearance on a reality TV show in which she was filmed in grainy,   footage having sex with another contestant on the show.   The latest   poll, conducted after the first debate, found that 62% of women viewed Trump unfavorably.
