Several celebrities, including Michael Stipe of R. E. M. and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, are coordinating efforts aimed at building public support for Ms. Manning’s release. Both have previously made videos in support of her. While working as an intelligence analyst in a secure information facility at a forward operating base in Iraq, Ms. Manning copied and later sent to WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of incident logs from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a   diplomatic cables from American embassies around the world, dossiers about Guantánamo detainees, and a video showing an American helicopter strike on a group of people in Baghdad in which two Reuters journalists were killed. WikiLeaks later made the documents public, working with various traditional news media organizations, including The New York Times.
