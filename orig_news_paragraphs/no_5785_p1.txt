Brady is one of the committee chairmen who approved the "manager’s amendments" Monday, which made modest changes to the bill.   Thursday’s vote on the bill was canceled by Ryan after a bloc of conservatives, led by the House Freedom Caucus, secured north of 25  "no" votes. With 237 GOP congressman, Ryan cannot lose more 22 votes to reach the 216 votes required for passage. The Ryancare bill is still a work in progress, Brady said.
