Air Force officials said they were proposing to spend $2. 7 billion over the next five years to research, develop and test communications technologies and other advanced systems. The Air Force would then buy two   aircraft, which normally cost airlines $350 million to $400 million apiece, and refit them to include all the new systems and handle extra weight. The planes would not be ready to fly until 2024, so Mr. Trumpâ€™s $4 billion estimate may ultimately be about correct. However, since nothing but the basic study contract has been awarded yet, his administration could cut back or reshape the Air Force proposal in any way it or Congress wanted.
