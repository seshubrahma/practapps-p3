In its first new episode under the presidency of Donald J. Trump, "Saturday Night Live" opened with its vision of the most powerful man in the world  —   President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, smirking and chiding Mr. Trump for early missteps   —   followed by a monologue from the show’s host, Aziz Ansari, who commented on issues of race in   America and implored Mr. Trump to directly address them himself. Airing one day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, "S. N. L. ," which the president hosted as a candidate and has regularly attacked on Twitter, did not feature an appearance from its resident Trump impersonator, Alec Baldwin. Instead the show opened with the cast member Beck Bennett playing a   Mr. Putin and boasting of helping to get Mr. Trump elected.
