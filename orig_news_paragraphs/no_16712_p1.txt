This source added that the meeting with Trump came to fruition following a phone call between the GOP nominee’s representatives and Netanyahu’s office after it was clear that a similar meeting was going to take place with Clinton.   Another source disputed that account, saying Trump’s camp reached an agreement with Netanyahu’s office first. Additional details about the meetings, including what will be discussed, were not immediately disclosed. Clinton and Trump, the respective Democratic and Republican candidates for president, are set to face off in their first debate Monday night.
