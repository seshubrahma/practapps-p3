President Obama believes that Republicans have   the threat posed by the religion of Islam as a violent religion. [During a conversation with the Atlantic’s Jeffery Goldberg, Obama explained that too many Republicans wanted him to identify the terrorist threat using the same moral clarity as Reagan did with the threat of Communism.   He asserted that Communism "wasn’t a   religion that was embraced by a whole host of good, decent,   people who are our allies" like the religion of Islam. Obama argued that Trump’s controversial suggested ban on Muslims and refugees entering the country after terrorist attacks was the logical conclusion of Republicans’   rhetoric over the years.
