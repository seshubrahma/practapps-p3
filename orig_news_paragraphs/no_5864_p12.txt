That is not what we voted for. Nehlen is correct that he successfully forced Ryan to oppose the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) which President Trump has since gone on to officially kill once and for all. He also forced Ryan to campaign on bended knee in front of actual factory workers in Wisconsin. But he did come up short, winning less than 20 percent of the vote in the primary against Ryan.
