The House Rules Committee published its proposed $1 trillion budget at 12:47 a. m. on Monday, a massive   plan that is 400 pages longer than the average bible. [Not only are many of President Donald Trump’s budget priorities missing from the plan, but since 2009 Republicans have promised a   "read the bill" window to allow Americans to see legislation before it is voted on  —   a biblical task for a bill that could as early as Wednesday face an up or down vote.   The "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017″ will fund the federal government through the end of September, another       budget that does not pay for a wall on the U. S. southern border but does fund Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. The budget does include an increase in military spending ($12. 5 billion) and border security ($1. 5 billion) although the latter prohibits any spending on security except for technological advances and repairs to existing infrastructure, unnamed congressional aides told the Washington Post.
