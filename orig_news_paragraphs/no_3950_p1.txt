Nunes said that while there was no direct "wiretap" by President Barack Obama of Trump Tower, there was indeed surveillance   —   perhaps collected incidentally  —   of people close to Trump, possibly including Trump himself. Much of that had been suspected, on the basis of mainstream media reports, but Rep. Nunes reported something new: that the surveillance did not involve the ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) inquiry into Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Indeed, none of the surveillance had intelligence value, he said.
