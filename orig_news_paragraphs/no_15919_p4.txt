Nationwide, American businesses export about $300 million in agricultural products to Cuba each    and thatâ€™s just for humanitarian purposes.

Instead, for more than 50 years, American businesses and farmers have been hamstrung by it, unable to fully tap into a market with 11 million people just 90 miles from our shore.
