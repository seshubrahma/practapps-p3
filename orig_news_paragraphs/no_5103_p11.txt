â€”   Michelle Moons (@MichelleDiana) April 17, 2017,   The President, First Lady and their son Barron walked down to a craft table to spend some time with the children. President Trump spoke with the children for a bit after which he stood up, thanked those gathered, and took his leave with his wife and son. Near the end of the race finish line, Attorney General Sessions and the First Lady took their turns reading books to some of the kids.
