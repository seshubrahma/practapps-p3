The former president has leveraged his contacts to fill the foundation’s coffers and traveled the world to meet with people helped by its work.

The plan for the foundation’s future in the event of a Clinton victory this fall includes daughter Chelsea Clinton remaining. Foreign and corporate donations will be halted, though the foundation is looking for ways to spin off some programs and keep them running.
