That ought to appeal to the Court, coupled with the fact that the Colorado system seems to be unique. Most states charge the "fees" and order restitution, but readily refund the payments if a conviction is found invalid. Colorado’s brief to the Supreme Court is so truculent, so full of Margaret   faux outrage, that a reader might suspect the state has no case. In their first argument, the state’s lawyers rewrite the petitioners’ claim, suggesting they are grifters trying to create out of thin air a   right to an "automatic money judgment" when convictions are set aside.
