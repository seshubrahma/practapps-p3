What’s China been building? In early 2014, China quietly began massive dredging operations centering on the seven reefs it controls in the Spratly Islands    Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, Mischief Reef, Cuarteron Reef, Gaven Reef and Hughes Reef. According to the US, China has reclaimed more than 3, 000 acres since the beginning of 2014. On his 2015 trip to Washington, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China wouldn’t militarize the islands, but a December report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) said China had installed comprehensive weapons systems on seven reefs that include   guns.
