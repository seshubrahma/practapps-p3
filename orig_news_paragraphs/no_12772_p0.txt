In yet another example of the left inciting violence against Donald Trump supporters, graffiti urging death on Trump voters appeared in Boston only two days before Election Day. [A crude   sign that demands "Kill Your Local Trump Supporter" appeared on Sunday on a wall of a building on St. Alphonsus Street in Boston, the Boston Herald reported.   The defaced building is owned by the Museum of Fine Arts and houses studios and exhibition space. The graffiti is on a wall facing one of the facilityâ€™s parking lots.
