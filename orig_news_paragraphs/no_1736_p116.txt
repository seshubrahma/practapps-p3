Although Coulter was Trump’s earliest cheerleader among prominent   personalities, Hannity’s stake in the election perhaps runs deepest of all, if only because of the size of his audience. He hosts the    show (after Limbaugh) on talk radio and the    program (after Bill O’Reilly and Megyn Kelly) on cable news. More than 2. 4 million weekly viewers and 13 million listeners have witnessed Hannity sticking his neck out on behalf of a   politician and sometime Republican who has voiced support for Planned Parenthood while vowing to limit America’s military footprint and shred trade deals that the G. O. P. has backed for decades. Hannity’s critics on the right have accused him of essentially running hourlong daily Trump infomercials.
