At 53, Mr. Govan is the kind of arts executive who could probably exist only in Los Angeles. He is a celebrity in a world of celebrities, with the looks of a movie star a regular at the Tower Bar on Sunset Boulevard, its tables crowded with agents and actors and someone who, naturally enough, was a guest at last yearâ€™s Academy Awards. Mr. Govan seems as comfortable describing, with the air of a senior faculty member at a fine arts college, the latest catalog of acquisitions before an audience of donors as he is posing for the    paparazzi at Lacma   attended by Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese and Kanye West. Mr. Govan breaks rules and celebrates the unconventional in a way that, if nothing else, draws attention to the museum and its director.
