Only last week, Mr. Trump had dismissed the tax as too complicated, favoring his own plan to impose a 35 percent tariff on manufactured goods made by American corporations in overseas factories. Mr. Spicer said that the plan for the tax was "taking shape" and that it was "really going to provide the funding" for the wall. Mr. Spicer said that was a direct reference to the centerpiece of House Republicansâ€™ proposal to overhaul the tax code. They have been pushing the idea for months, but with little evidence, until Thursday, that Mr. Trump was interested in it.
