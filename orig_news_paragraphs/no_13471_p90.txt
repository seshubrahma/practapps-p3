As Alabama’s elected representative, Sessions eventually came to sit upon the very Senate Judiciary Committee that rejected him —   harboring no ill will nor animosity towards the men who opposed him, but instead becoming their partners and forging meaningful relationships with them, such as his friendship with   progressive Senator Al Franken.   With these men, Sessions spearheaded legislative reforms and never once voiced a complaint about their unfair treatment of him. Confident in his own dignity rendered to him by both his faith in God and the people of Alabama whom he represents, Sessions similarly never felt the need to plead his case publicly after all these years   —   assured in the belief that his own actions would speak louder than the allegations of his opponents.
