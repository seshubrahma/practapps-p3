Manafort’s finances and consulting work are drawing attention as Ukrainian officials try to determine whether he received improper payments as part of their corruption investigation into   Victor Yanukovych    Manafort’s former client. US authorities also are investigating possible Ukrainian corruption and any role Manafort might have played in Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In addition to reporting on Manfort’s financial transactions in Cyprus, the AP reported earlier this week that a firm he headed received $1. 2 million in    payments for work done in support of a   political party in Ukraine. Manafort strongly denies any wrongdoing in connection with his work for Trump and foreign officials.
