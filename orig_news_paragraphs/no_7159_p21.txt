Cuban politics follows a twisted sort of logic that is perfect for liberals. These famous   Americans are the people who defend Islam because it suits their political purposes. So they will surely have no problem moving to a leftist country whose former leader (I’m glad he’s dead) shipped gays off for  . Most importantly, there is a huge vacuum of VIPs in Cuba following the death of Fidel.
