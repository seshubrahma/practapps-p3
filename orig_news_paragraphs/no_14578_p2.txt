The families staying here would be undocumented immigrants, fearing an ICE raid and possible deportation.    The purchase of this home is part of a network formed by Los Angeles religious leaders across faiths in the wake of Donald Trumpâ€™s election. The intent is to shelter hundreds, possibly thousands of undocumented people in safe houses across Southern California.   The goal is to offer another sanctuary beyond religious buildings or schools, ones that require federal authorities to obtain warrants before entering the homes.
