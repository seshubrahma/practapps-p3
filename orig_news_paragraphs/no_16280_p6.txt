An alliance of true   conservatives (think Rand and Ron Paul supporters) and nationalists who are fine with big government as long as it serves narrowly defined American interests (think Trumpistasâ€™ enthusiasm for Medicare, wall building and torture) has effectively sidelined most GOP supporters of activist leadership.   What holds these two groups together is their focus on defending the Constitution and military security and their disdain for laws and norms that originate outside the United States or constrain the United States in any way. By these standards, requiring American soldiers to obey international humanitarian law is somewhere between foolish and treasonous. Using this rationale, the strategic and humanitarian objectives that led Ambassador Chris Stevens to risk his life, and the lives of his team, in Benghazi fade away.
