For that, we turn to The Dallas Morning News, which details how Abood helped U. S. armed forces in Iraq as a translator during the Iraq war —  and then took advantage of a special program for such translators. " Abood, a translator for American forces during the Iraq War, left Iraq in 2009 to take advantage of a rare opportunity for U. S. Army interpreters to become American citizens," The Dallas Morning News’ Kevin Krause wrote on May 25, 2016, continuing: Abood, who speaks Arabic, said during testimony Wednesday that he was offered the interpreter job after warning U. S. troops that large weapons caches were being kept inside Iraqi schools.
