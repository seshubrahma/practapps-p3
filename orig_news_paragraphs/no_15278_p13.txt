The Democrats on the House Oversight Committee also sent a request to Chaffetz Thursday that they schedule a meeting with the White House to demand the release of the Flynn documents they have asked for.   "To your credit, you have sought and obtained some documents relevant to this investigation. Now it is time to obtain additonal documents directly from the White House," the Democratic lawmakers wrote.   Flynnâ€™s lawyer, Robert Kelner, had previously said that Flynn briefed the DIA on his speech to RT and the payments, but Cummings said Thursday that another document that was declassified this week shows no evidence to support that statement.
