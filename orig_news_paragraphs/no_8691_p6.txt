Does the federal government have the authority to define a family as a "private school?"    In a conversation with a Cruz campaign official last fall, I was told that Senator Cruz wanted to "help" ease the burden of homeschool families. That is very compassionate. However, Senator Cruz is not running as a compassionate conservative but a constitutional conservative.
