Former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic Party vice presidential nominee, praised Trump’s move.   " In asking KT McFarland to become his deputy national security adviser,   Trump has brought to the top ranks of his administration one of our country’s most experienced, informed, and wise foreign policy and national security experts" he said. McFarland, who ran for a US Senate seat in New York in the 2006 Republican primary, is currently a Fox News national security analyst and was an aide in the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan.
