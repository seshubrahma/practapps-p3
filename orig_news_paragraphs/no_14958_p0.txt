 (CNN) When President Donald Trump’s    and aide Jared Kushner voluntarily appears before the Senate intelligence committee, he will describe his interactions with Russians during the transition as a point man "looking for the right person to engage with on Russia," and nothing more, according to a source familiar with what transpired. According to this source, neither of Kushner’s meetings    with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov    were about sanctions, which Russian banks have been lobbying against since they were imposed in 2014. These were "relationship meetings," the source said.
