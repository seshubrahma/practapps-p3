Bill Clinton is also expected to attend a fundraiser in San Francisco on Tuesday morning. Clinton kicked off his California trip Sunday with stops in the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Delano. At his speech in Delano, Clinton vowed not to mention presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump  â€”   and then promptly did so several times. " [Hillary] has been the strongest person to say Mr. Trump is wrong when he says we ought to keep the Muslims out and demonize them any more than immigrants," the former president said, according to ABC News.
