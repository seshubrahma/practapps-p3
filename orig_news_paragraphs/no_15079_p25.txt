A persecuted minority, Copts in Egypt have faced persecution and discrimination that has spiked since the toppling of Hosni Mubarakâ€™s regime in 2011. Dozens have been killed in sectarian violence. In December, an attack at a Coptic church in Cairo killed 25 people.   Coptic churches and homes have been set on fire, members of the Coptic minority have been physically attacked, and their property has been looted, rights group Amnesty International reported in March.
