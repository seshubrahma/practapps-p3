Union members in Kentucky are what keep the Democratic Party vibrant in the traditionally conservative state, and the union members in auto plants and working for the Federal Express hub in Louisville were supposed to put Clinton    with ease.

Oregon was an easier win for Sanders, where he took 53 percent of the vote to Clintonâ€™s 47 percent.
