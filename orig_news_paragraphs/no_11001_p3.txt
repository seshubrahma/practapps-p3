I think the real issue is what you have raised. Anyone who has said our generals who are sacrificing their, if you will  —   their lives   —   willing to put their lives on the line and to attack them and say they’re in rubble, anyone who refuses to call Russia what it is, an aggressor, that has stolen land from another country, Crimea, that is threatening Georgia, that won’t sit down with the president of the United States to resolve Syria, that is actually bombing parts of Aleppo or supporting those who aren’t, losing lives. All of this, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, one who is here on   frightens me. And it frightens the American people.
