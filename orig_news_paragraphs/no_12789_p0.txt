Sen. Marco Rubio apologized to voters for a series of personal attacks against Donald Trump, which he employed to get recognition from the media and satisfy supporters who were tired of seeing the billionaire attack his fellow running mates unchallenged. ["As you got a little dirty   …     you got a little naughty," Kelly said, referring to the recent personal attacks.   " I’d do it differently, you know I really would," he said, in a   interview in Florida with Fox News host Megyn Kelly.
