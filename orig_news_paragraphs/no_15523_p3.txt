Sources say, not surprisingly, Sessions and Rosenstein appeared exhausted.   A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment for this story. In recent days, Trump has also asked about    former New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly as a possible FBI director, a source told CNN. The source said the President asked him about Kelly, who was not one of the eight candidates Sessions and Rosenstein interviewed at the Justice Department on Saturday.
