By 1967, state investigators found that out of some 3, 700 apartments in Trump Village, seven were occupied by   families. Like Ms. Brown, the few minorities who did live in   buildings often had to force their way in. A black woman named Agnes Bunn recalled hearing in early 1970 about a vacant Trump apartment in another part of Queens, from a white friend who lived in the building. But when she went by, she was told there were no vacancies.
