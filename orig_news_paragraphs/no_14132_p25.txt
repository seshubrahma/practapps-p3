"Facilitating the removal of aliens who are subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a top priority for the Department of State," Toner said.   He also cited work done by State on the issue under the Obama administration.   " In FY2015, US government authorities successfully facilitated the repatriation of 235, 413 foreign nationals.   diplomatic efforts by ICE and the State Department have resulted in significant increases in cooperation among the 23 countries currently on ICE’s Uncooperative (’Recalcitrant’) list, with nearly half of these countries improving their records of issuing travel documents, accepting charter deportee flights with deportees, and agreeing on formal arrangements for future removals in recent months," he said.
