Those in attendance on Friday included the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, François Hollande, as well as the prime ministers of Britain (Theresa May) Italy (Matteo Renzi) and Spain (Mariano Rajoy). The agreement on Ukraine followed remarks by Mr. Obama on Thursday warning Mr. Trump to "stand up" to Moscow when it violated international agreements. Ms. Merkel also reminded Russia that peace in Europe had been possible over the past several years only because all nations respected the boundaries drawn after World War II. Friday’s meeting concluded a weeklong visit to European allies by Mr. Obama, whose terms ends in January.
