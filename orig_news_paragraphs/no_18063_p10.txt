"All I can tell you is what we’’re investigating, which includes   an investigation into whether there was coordination between the   Trump campaign and the Russians," Comey said, adding that there   was "no way to give a timetable" for when the investigation   would conclude. ’ ’    The FBI opened its investigation in late July, after WikiLeaks   started publishing emails that had been stolen from the   Democratic National Committee. Congress was not informed until   now, due to "sensitivities," about the investigation involving   Trump’’s contacts with Russia, Comey said.
