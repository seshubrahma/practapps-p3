Both Priebus and Bannon were highly involved with working out the arrangement, a source familiar with the decision said. Bannon represents   style politics seen as appealing to Trumpâ€™s most inflammatory instincts, and his initial hiring prompted a raft of criticism from Democrats accusing Trump of embracing the "alt right," an ideology closely associated with white nationalism,   and misogyny. Priebus should be a reassuring presence to establishment Republicans still uncertain about what a Trump White House will look like. The pick signals that Trump may look to build bridges in Washington and keep continuity with longtime Republican agendas, as opposed to make waves from the beginning.
