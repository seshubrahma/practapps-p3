" Keystone has never been a significant issue from an environmental point of view in substance, only in symbol," said David L. Goldwyn, an energy market analyst and a former head of the State Departmentâ€™s energy bureau in the Obama administration. But it was a symbol Mr. Trump found important enough to seize on early in his presidency. He signed an executive memorandum inviting TransCanada "to promptly resubmit its application to the Department of State for a presidential permit" for the pipeline, although the document did not guarantee approval.
