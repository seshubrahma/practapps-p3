Security will almost certainly be a key point in discussions with Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who said Thursday that North Korea may now may have the capability to deliver missiles equipped with sarin nerve gas. Along with a commitment to security, Pence will stress the Trump administration’s commitment to economic engagement in the region, and according to officials, communicate that the withdrawal from the   trade partnership "shouldn’t be seen as a retreat from the region. " In Tokyo, Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso will kick off the   economic dialogue, which was first announced in February during Abe’s visit to the White House.
