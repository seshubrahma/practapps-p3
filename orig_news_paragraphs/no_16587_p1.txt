Just two months out from Election Day with the race between Clinton and Donald Trump tightening, the former secretary of state’s meeting on Friday with a bipartisan group of foreign policy experts and the press conference that followed demonstrated the increasing prominence of national security in the 2016 campaign.   Seizing an opening after a string of gaffes this week left Trump vulnerable, Clinton told reporters here that the 2016 election is the "most important in our lifetime" that calls for "rational, confident and   leadership." " No conversation about our national security would be complete unless we acknowledged that the nominee on the other side promises to do things that will make us less safe," Clinton said.
