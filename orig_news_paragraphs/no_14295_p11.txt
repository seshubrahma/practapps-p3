Dilbireen was severely burned on his face and feet, but a blanket protected the rest of his body from harm. Iraqi doctors advised the parents to get him treated outside the country, Dilbireenâ€™s father, Ajeel Muhsin, said. The   charity Road to Peace made arrangements for Dilbireen to receive urgent medical care in Boston, where Shriners Hospitals for Children agreed to treat him and other injured refugee children at no cost. Road to Peace works with organizations around the world to help build alliances between communities in conflict and facilitate specialized medical care for refugee children.
