Leaders on both sides wanted to avoid losing, but none saw the race as desirable. The exception, Ronald Reagan, entered office in 1981 determined to win the Cold War in part by outstripping the Soviet Union on nuclear arms. But after a few years of tightening response times and   incidents, he became the most enthusiastic proponent of nuclear disarmament to occupy the Oval Office.
