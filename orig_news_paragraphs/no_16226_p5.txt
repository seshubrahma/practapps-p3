Clinton’s decision to choose Kaine began when John Podesta brought the candidate   binders to her home in Chappaqua, New York, in April, according to a campaign aide. Last week, Clinton and Kaine spent 90 minutes together, followed by another meeting on Saturday that brought together the two families, including Clinton’s husband, daughter and    as well as Kaine’s wife.   Ultimately, Clinton was swayed by her personal comfort with Kaine, as well as the belief that the senator is fully prepared to do the job. On Friday, Clinton called Kaine around 7:30 p. m. then spoke with President Barack Obama.
