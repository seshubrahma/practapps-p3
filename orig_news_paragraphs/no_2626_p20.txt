" Because of our recruitment work, Republicans are forced to spend money and energy in states they never dreamed would be competitive," said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mrs. Clinton, some Democrats argue, is trying to make   more of a priority by coordinating closely with   races, carrying their campaign literature when canvassing, sharing office space and helping them raise money. These efforts are particularly forceful in Nevada, where Republicans hold a narrow legislative majority, and in Colorado, where the legislature is closely divided between the two parties.
