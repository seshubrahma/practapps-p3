Some of the former operative’s allegations were first reported by Mother Jones’s David Corn in the final 10 days of the campaign. CNN also says they were what   Minority Leader Harry Reid was referring to when he sent FBI Director James Comey a letter stating, "It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government —  a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States. " CNN says it is not reporting the details of the memos because it has not verified them. It adds that while the information was circulating for months, the intelligence community has now "checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough" to use the information in briefings.
