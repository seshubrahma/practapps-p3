Two Williams College students are now facing disciplinary action after hoaxing vandalism which appeared to be Ku Klux Klan (KKK) inspired days after the 2016 Election. [The two students, whom the college has not publicly named, poured fake blood on staircases of a building and spelled out "AMKKK KILL" on the walls, according to the Williams Record.   On the day that the vandalism was discovered, campus organizations had to cancel meetings in the building as a result. Shortly thereafter, local police were notified of the vandalism and began investigating the incident, even getting the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and Massachusetts State Police involved in the case.
