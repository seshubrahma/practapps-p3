Prosecutors want him to testify, Ukraine’s prosecutor for special investigations Serhiy Gorbatyuk said. Prosecutors allege that Lavrynovych illegally diverted more than $1 million in government funds to a prominent New York City law firm  —   Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom. Lavrynovych had hired Skadden to review the 2011 jailing of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who had received a   sentence for allegedly harming Ukraine’s interests in gas supply negotiations with Russia. Tymoshenko was the main political rival of the   President Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort advised until Yanukovych was deposed in 2014.
