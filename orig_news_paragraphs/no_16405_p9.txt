While the hacker or hackers known as "Guccifer 2. 0" claims to have released the information about the Democratic congressional members and staffers through a blog, that is not the only mechanism being used to publicize private information. A Washington area cyber security firm, ThreatConnect, has released a new analysis tying documents from various hacks by "Guccifer 2. 0" to a website called DCLeaks, which calls itself "a new level project aimed to analyze and publish a large amount of emails from   officials and their influence agents all over the world" and has been publishing documents since this past spring. While the US government has not formally blamed Russia for these hacks, privately intelligence and law enforcement sources it is the most likely suspect. Some private cyber security experts also believe "Guccifer 2. 0" is somehow connected to Russia and its intelligence operation.
