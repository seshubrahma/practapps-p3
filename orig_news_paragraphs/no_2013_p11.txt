Nearly 500 Muslim and Jewish women, many wearing head scarves and skullcaps, gathered on Sunday at Drew University in Madison, N. J. in what organizers said was the largest such meeting ever held in the United States. It was the third annual conference of the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, a   group that now claims 50 chapters in more than 20 states. The first conference two years ago drew only 100 people. The women spread out inside an enormous sports complex and met in clusters to study sacred texts on the racquetball courts, practice   techniques in the dance studio and, in the bleachers, discuss how to talk to friends whose impression of Islam had been shaped entirely by news of terrorist attacks.
