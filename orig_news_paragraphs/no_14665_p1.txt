Grigsby and some other friends drove to Missouri to bring Hernandez home. Hernandez’s family couldn’t come to pick him up because one of his sons was sick, Grigsby said. There was to be one stop on the way home, La Fiesta, the popular restaurant where Hernandez is a manager, for some Mexican food Hernandez has been craving. Hernandez had been locked up for 20 days after being arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during a sweep that targeted another person.
