For the country’s most prominent political spokesman, Sean Spicer is not spending a whole lot of time in front of the camera. Monday was the seventh straight day that Mr. Spicer, President Trump’s press secretary, declined to hold a televised White House press briefing, an unusually long drought for someone whose role is traditionally to be the most visible face of a presidential administration. Instead, Mr. Spicer  —   who since the inauguration had become a highly rated, if   staple of daytime television  —   conducted a    session with no cameras allowed, over the objections of the White House Correspondents’ Association. The briefing was certain to be contentious.
