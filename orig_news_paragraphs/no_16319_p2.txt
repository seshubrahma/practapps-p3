So while the Khans themselves first politicized the death of their own son by wading into political waters, Trump should have resisted his usual propensity to go for the jugular and personally attack those who have criticized him politically. All this said, it should not be forgotten that the tragic loss of the Khans’ son in the Iraq invasion and occupation was not Trump’s fault. It was George W. Bush’s for launching an aggressive and unnecessary invasion of Iraq, which killed about 4, 500 American soldiers and vastly more innocent Iraqis.   And while the way in which Trump launched his counterattack against the Khans can be legitimately criticized, we should not consider it taboo to criticize people who have lost a son or daughter in military action    especially when those parents are essentially leveraging that death to take a political stance on an unrelated issue.
