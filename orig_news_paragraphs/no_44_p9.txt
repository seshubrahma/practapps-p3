We do expect production will likely be cut, particularly in the compact and midsize segments," said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book. The industry sold 1. 69 million vehicles during the month of December, an increase of about 3 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the research firm Autodata. The 17. 55 million sold over the year was a gain of 0. 4 percent. Sales of trucks and S. U. V.s accounted for nearly   of the sales volume during December as consumers continue to turn to the larger vehicles over cars.
