Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016,   Despite its own reporting on voter fraud and the role   foreign nationals likely had in delivering Democratic victories in close elections, the Washington Post now seems to be disregarding its own coverage on the issue in order to characterize Trump’s claims as "ridiculous," "unsubstantiated" and part of "broad conspiracy theories". House Speaker Paul Ryan has similarly sought to denounce the concerns of voter fraud expressed by his Party’s nominee —   insisting that the election results will be inherently secure.
