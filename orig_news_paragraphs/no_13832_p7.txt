To do so, they will likely start by taking one sizable leap for their supporters    repealing as much of the ACA as congressional procedures, budget scoring rules, and vote counts will allow in the first half of this year. As a result, some, but not all, of the repealed provisions will limp on for at least another year, if not longer.   In practice, that may mean something like the following moves:    quick repeal of the individual and employer mandates for insurance coverage,     delayed repeal of ACA taxes on the health care industry (at least until those sectors agree to "play ball" with the new majority’s transitional plans)    continuation of insurance subsidies for 2017 that later become gradually revised (flatter and broader refundable tax credits) in future years, and     accelerated reductions in Medicaid’s coverage expansion through per capita allotments to states.   The next daunting phase of reform    involving the regulatory side of Obamacare    will require larger,   majority compromises in the Senate that will leave just about all parties unhappy.
