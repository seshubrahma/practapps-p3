While there are certainly issues with the current law (for example, high premiums and deductibles) the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in its first estimate of the Republican bill that both it and the Affordable Care Act would stabilize over the long run. This is exaggerated. The competitive situation is not healthy in those two states, but Mr. Trump has overstated the current lack of insurers. But next year, he could be less incorrect.
