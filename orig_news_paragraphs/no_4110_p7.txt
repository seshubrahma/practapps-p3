Trump asked Netanyahu, publicly, to "hold back" on settlements (to which Netanyahu joked, "That’s the art of the deal"). The implication is that the U. S. now accepts existing Israeli settlements. That is a stark contrast to the attitude of the Obama administration, which argued that the entire Israeli presence across the 1949 armistice lines  —   including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem   —   was illegal.
