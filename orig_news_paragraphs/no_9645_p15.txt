Obama has declared that his   rules are an issue of "discrimination" for judges to decide, not a democratic issue for voters and politicians to decide. That’s a powerful political strategy, in part, because it allows a few liberal judges to quickly impose national changes. So, for example, just two judges recently backed a legal claim by Gavin Grimm in Virginia, above, which may impose major changes to all the students in his high school. Obama’s discrimination strategy also encourages his political allies to label their normal opponents bigots, and it pushes his media allies to portray opponents as racists.
