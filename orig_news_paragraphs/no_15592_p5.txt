In a statement, a White House official called the defense deal "a significant expansion of the over   long security relationship between" the US and Saudi Arabia. " This package of defense equipment and services support the   security of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region in the face of Iranian threats while also bolstering the Kingdomâ€™s ability to contribute to counterterrorism operations across the region, reducing the burden on the US military to conduct those operations," the White House official said. Ultimately, the two sides were able to reach an agreement on a weapons package that amounts to nearly $110 billion in tanks, fighter jets, combat ships and the THAAD missile defense system, according to the White House.
