The attackerâ€™s motivation remains unknown, as do questions of whether he acted alone. And yet this act, whatever its particulars, represents the culmination of   trends, in which terror tactics become more rudimentary and the targets more random.

This is shifting pressure onto more abstract and unproven counterterrorism methods that do not promise to halt violence but merely ameliorate underlying political or social drivers.
