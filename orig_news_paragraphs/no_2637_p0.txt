Good. But not too good. That is the verdict from economists after the Labor Department reported on Friday that in August employers added 151, 000 jobs, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4. 9 percent, and wage gains were modest. It was a solid performance that keeps the economy on track, but not strong enough to push the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate when policy makers meet this month.
