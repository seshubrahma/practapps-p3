Dr. Gulfo, the former biotech executive, said he had spoken with several people on the president’s transition team about the F. D. A. job. He said he was in favor of keeping the efficacy requirement. But he said he believed the agency’s standards were too rigid and burdensome to companies with innovative ideas. He called on the agency to approve more drugs based on what are known as "surrogate endpoints"  —   showing that a diabetes drug lowers blood sugar, for example  —   rather than forcing companies to prove that the product improves   outcomes like survival rates or lowering the chance for heart attacks.
