" Cyber is the rare kind of   challenge for which the Congressâ€™s jurisdictional boundaries are an impediment to sufficient oversight and legislative action," said a letter Sunday to McConnell from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, incoming Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Sen. Lindsey Graham,   Carolina, and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on Armed Services.   The proposal could be tricky for McConnell and Ryan, who both are sharp critics of Russia but now will have to work closely with a new president who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and dismissed allegations of Russian hacking. The two leaders say they want existing oversight committees    spearheaded by the intelligence panels in each chamber    to examine the issue and possibly propose reforms through legislation or by other means.
