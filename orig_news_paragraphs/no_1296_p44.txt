Stephen H. Norwood, one of the few historians who did study the Black Legion, also mined another rich seam of neglected history in which   vigilantism and outright fascism routinely infiltrated the mainstream of American life. The story begins with Father Charles Coughlin, the   "radio priest" who at his peak reached as many as 30 million weekly listeners. In 1938, Coughlin’s magazine, Social Justice, began reprinting "Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," a forged tract about a global Jewish conspiracy first popularized in the United States by Henry Ford. After presenting this fictitious threat, Coughlin’s paper called for action, in the form of a "crusade against the   forces of the red revolution"  —   a call that was answered, in New York and Boston, by a new organization, the Christian Front.
