" The attempted missile attacks on the USS Mason are believed to be Houthi payback for a   coalition bombing of a funeral in Yemen’s largest city on Saturday that killed 140 people. The alliance of Houthi rebels and followers of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, have been fighting for control of the country since 2014. The war accelerated in March 2015 when Saudi Arabia, fearing the influence of its   Iran, led a coalition air campaign to support Yemen’s exiled leader Abed Rabbo Mansour.
