Washington (CNN) Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright chastised President Donald Trump for saying he’d be "honored" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Albright, who served during the Bill Clinton presidency, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on "The Lead" that she was surprised by Trump’s remarks to Bloomberg News earlier this week, in which the President said he’d be "honored" to meet with Kim "under the right circumstances." "A president doesn’t go to a country without any preparation, and ’honored’ would definitely be the wrong way to discuss somebody who is keeping his people in poverty and starving and control," Albright said Tuesday.
