This meeting, however, created a particularly awkward situation for Ms. Lynch, a veteran prosecutor who was nominated from outside Washington’s political circles. During her confirmation, her allies sought to contrast her with her predecessor, Mr. Holder, an outspoken liberal voice who clashed frequently with Republicans who accused him of politicizing the office. Ms. Lynch’s reassurance that she will not overrule her investigators is significant. When the F. B. I. sought to bring felony charges against David H. Petraeus, the former C. I. A. director, for mishandling classified information and lying about it, Mr. Holder stepped in and reduced the charge to a misdemeanor.
