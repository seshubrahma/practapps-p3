For many people like me who cherish tolerance and clean air, the first 100 days of the Trump presidency have not been easy. As a Muslim immigrant to America, it has been painfully frustrating to witness the Trump administration reinforce xenophobia against both immigrants and Muslims. As someone whose faith is bound up with combating climate change, it hurt to see Trump impose an executive order that effectively denies the impacts of climate change I have seen with my own eyes. Frustration must never lead to resignation, however: that is why, on Saturday, I and many other Muslims will be marching in Washington, D. C. in solidarity with thousands of others for our climate and the protection of the vulnerable.
