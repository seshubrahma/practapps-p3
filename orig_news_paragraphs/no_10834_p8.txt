Like the New York Times, Bloomberg mentions that Japanese politicians are nervous about    Donald Trump’s criticism that U. S. allies are not shouldering enough of the burden for their defense, especially with the growing Chinese threat in the South and East China Seas. Trump’s critique of the   Partnership trade deal is also mentioned as a cause for concern by Abe, who strongly supports TPP. This transforms Abe, "long seen as a nationalist and traditionalist" in Bloomberg’s estimation, into a champion of globalism and internationalism.
