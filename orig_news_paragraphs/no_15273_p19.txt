That the era of big government programs, sweeping reform and overreach has seemingly come to an abrupt halt    whether by design or default    is nothing to mourn.    For those of us who never thought Trump could make good on many of his promises    to rip up various "bad deals" on day 1, to replace Obamacare quickly, to build a wall that Mexico pays for, to stamp out ISIS easily    our measure of his first few months is irrelevant. Nor does it really matter what his critics on the left and in the media think of how heâ€™s doing. All that matters is whether or not his supporters approve.
