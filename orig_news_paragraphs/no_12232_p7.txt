The Obama administration has resettled refugees in the United States during the first three months of FY 2017 at a rate that is nearly double the rate during the same three month period of FY 2016, the prior fiscal year, as Breitbart News reported earlier this week. Between October 1, 2016 and December 29, 2016, the Obama administration resettled 25, 671 refugees in the United States. With an estimated population of 321 million in the United States as of July 1, 2016, the number of refugees resettled across the entire country during this time period was 8. 0 per 100, 000 residents. Hawaii, President Obamaâ€™s home state before he moved to Illinois, resettled only three refugees during the first three months of FY 2017, a per capita rate of 0. 2 per 100, 000 residents, well below the national average.
