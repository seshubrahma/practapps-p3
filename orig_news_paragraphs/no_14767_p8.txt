In Holland, Geert Wilders and his Freedom party are surfing a wave of   sentiment, buoyed by dissatisfaction with traditional political parties. In France, the National Front’s Marine Le Pen    who inherited the mantle of nationalist leader from her father    is doing what he never managed: taking his fringe   party and turning it into potentially the most popular political force in France. And when Germany goes to the polls later this year, Europe’s former moral compass, Chancellor Merkel, faces increasing dissatisfaction with her handling of Europe’s refugee crisis, making her vulnerable to attacks from the right. The depth to which they are cutting in to her political real estate could be measured at her recent speech in front of Pence and Europe’s   diplomats.
