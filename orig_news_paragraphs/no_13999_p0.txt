 (CNN) President Barack Obama on Tuesday reduced or eliminated the sentences for hundreds more   drug offenders. The move brings Obama well beyond his most recent predecessors, who used their commutation powers more sparingly. Heâ€™s now reduced sentences for 1, 385 individuals, the vast majority of whom are serving time for crimes related to distribution or production of narcotics.
