A veteran Republican strategist now helping lead a "super PAC" in support of Donald J. Trump argued in a confidential memo last year that it would be dangerous to give Mr. Trump the power to launch a global war. The strategist, Alex Castellanos, has acknowledged that he had been publicly critical of Mr. Trump, but said on Sunday that he now considered Mr. Trump a superior choice to Hillary Clinton. In a private document presented to top Republican donors last fall, however, Mr. Castellanos suggested that Mr. Trump could be a threat to American security as president. He and another strategist, Gail Gitcho, drew up plans for a group named ProtectUS, and proposed to spend heavily against Mr. Trump in the Republican primaries.
