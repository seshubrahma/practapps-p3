The group says not only women are invited    anyone who thinks "women’s rights are human rights" is welcome. The Women’s March starts at the intersection of Independence Avenue SW and Third Street SW. From there, the march will make its way to the area between the Ellipse and the Washington Monument, just south of the White House. How is the security situation?
