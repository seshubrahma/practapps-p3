A research who worked on the report for CLINIC told Reuters that President Donald Trump’s administration should not be deporting illegal immigrants to begin with. " As we ramp up immigration enforcement in the United States, we should take this figure and remind ourselves that we shouldn’t deport first and then ask questions," University of California at San Diego researcher Tom Wong said. Wong said the number of illegal immigrants who he believes could get amnesty may be higher, as only states like Texas, Georgia, and Florida were outlined in the study.
