 (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign fired one of its senior advisers on Monday, multiples sources confirmed to CNN. Ed Brookover, who helped manage the campaign’s delegate operations in the lead up to the Republican National Convention, was fired a little more than six weeks after he was promoted as the campaign’s liaison to the Republican National Committee. The firing comes even as the campaign continues to hire more staff in an effort to build up its political operation less than 100 days before the general election.
