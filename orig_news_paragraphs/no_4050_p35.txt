Meanwhile, former Bill Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who has been working closely with the   MoveOn. org, penned a piece published in Newsweek arguing Trump’s Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch "shouldn’t be confirmed until Trump comes clean" about alleged ties to Russia. Like Lieu’s reference to a "cloud of treason" hanging over the Trump administration, Reich claimed a "true cloud of illegitimacy now hangs over the presidency of Donald Trump. " Reich’s piece was followed up by a MoveOn. org petition calling for Trump’s agenda to be "shut down" while he is investigated over the Russia claims.
