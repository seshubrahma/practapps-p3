Shaughnessy, that "It is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by [congressional] law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a given alien. " In 2015, the Court reasserted that judgment in Kerry v. Din, saying: The state action of which Din complains is the denial of [spouse] Berashk’s visa application. Naturally, one would expect him —   not Din —  to bring this suit.
