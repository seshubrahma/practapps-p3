I spent two years on the Benghazi Select Committee while they went after Susan Rice for no good reason and that now seems to be resuming. The second development, of course, was the public report that yet another Trump person, this case, Erik Prince, may have had yet another surreptitious meeting with the Russians. That obviously would be of deep concern to us if that took place, particularly if the timeline is correct   â€”   and that meeting took place in the Seychelles in January.
