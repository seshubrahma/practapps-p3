Bauman, on the other hand, issued a victory message to his supporters: There is no denying that there is a problem when so many of our hardworking activists feel that they are not welcome within our Party and that they have been slighted and shut out of the process. We cannot win the vital elections in 2018 and beyond without the energy, commitment and participation of every part of our Democratic family. Bauman has headed the Los Angeles County Democratic since 2000 and has served as the Golden Stateâ€™s Democratic party vice chairman since 2009.
