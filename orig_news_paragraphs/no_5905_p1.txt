Muhammad made this claim on February 7th, saying her detention occurred only a "few weeks ago," putting her incident right around the time of President Trump’s inauguration. Which, because   is something the mainstream media only does when it serves their cause, led to many in the media to characterize the story as a   Olympic hero getting caught in the web of President Trump’s harsh, terrible, and   Muslim ban. However, we now know that Muhammad’s detention did not last two hours, and it occurred during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. According to an official with Customs and Border Enforcement who spoke with the Washington Examiner on condition of anonymity, Muhammad’s detention was nothing remarkable whatsoever.
