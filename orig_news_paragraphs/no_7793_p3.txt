In the critical swing state of Colorado, Clinton is eking out a tiny lead of only one and a half percent over Trump in RealClearPolitic’s polling average in a   race, 40. 8 percent to 39. 3 percent. In a   matchup in Colorado, Clinton suffered a devastating crash from a 9. 6 percent lead over Trump on Sept. 11, the day she collapsed during New York City’s   memorial ceremony and had to be dragged into a van. She now leads Trump by a mere 1. 5 percent, 42. 3 percent to 40. 8 percent.
