Two out of every three Donald Trump voters turn off awards show when actors, singers and other entertainers start preaching politics, according to new data published by the Hollywood Reporter. [The National Research Group surveyed 800 people  â€”   half who voted for Hillary Clinton and half who pulled the lever for Donald Trump. The data revealed that 66 percent of Trump voters changed the channel whenever an actor began to lecture about politics, compared to just 19 percent of Clinton voters.   Another 44 percent of Trump voters said awards show speeches are "too political," compared to Clinton backers who said they want more politics at the Academy Awards.
