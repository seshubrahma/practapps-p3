Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama have tried lately to put their difficulties behind them by negotiating a   American security aid package for Israel. The deal is all but complete, and the White House has been discussing how to announce it. The two leaders will both attend the United Nations General Assembly conclave this month, but it seems most likely that it would be signed by   officials. But to Mr. Netanyahuâ€™s consternation, administration officials are still debating whether the president will lay down a final marker before the end of his time in office on the   impasse, perhaps with a speech outlining terms for an agreement or even a United Nations resolution.
