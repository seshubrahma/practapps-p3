The email address, Wayne. Tracker@exxonmobil. com, is part of the company’s email system and was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of   topics," spokesman Alan T. Jeffers said in statement.   Schneiderman has a different opinion, noting in his letter that Tillerson’s "Tracker" emails may be relevant to "potentially false or misleading statements to investors and the public" and that the discovery of this alias brings "additional urgency" to his demand that Exxon hand over relevant documents in the investigation.
