I’m okay with the choice," Giuliani told CNN’s Chris Cuomo on "New Day" Tuesday. The former New York City mayor had previously been in the running for the position but removed himself from Trump’s list on November 28.   The endorsement lacked the passion that Giuliani displayed on the campaign trail, but he stood by Tillerson even when Cuomo brought up the ExxonMobil CEO’s ties to Russia. He explained that that’s just one aspect of Tillerson’s career, and that it’s not unusual for someone in the energy industry to have a relationship with Russia.
