Agent Judd is indeed correct that CBP used Twitter to attack this reporter, only to later delete the tweet and admit that my information was correct. In defense of the media workers for CBP, they often do not realize that they are being made to lie for their agencyâ€™s officials. The same held true when this reporter published another report from the agents in the NBPC about the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allowing illegal aliens to fly on commercial aircraft without proper photo identification. In that case, the TSA spokesman sent multiple tweets out on Twitter to discredit me and insist that the Border Patrol agents were lying.
