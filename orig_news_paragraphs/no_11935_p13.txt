If Trump wins the state, it is very likely he will finish strongly in the remaining states and secure the necessary number of delegates to win the nomination outright. If, however, Cruz can capture the state, the primary will remain intensely competitive through June 7th, the final day of voting. A loss in Indiana would also make it unlikely that Trump can win the 1, 237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination before the RNC convention in July. The result could set in motion a scramble for delegates that will play out through the remaining months and the floor of the convention in Cleveland.
