Admittedly, authorship is always a squirrelly proposition in the case of public oratory by political figures or their kin, which is usually written or   by others. Still and all, it’s John F. Kennedy whom we agree to name when we quote his inaugural address, even though Theodore Sorensen did most of the writing, because the words reflect Kennedy’s sentiments and project his voice. However, we wouldn’t feel that way if we found out Sorenson lifted the most stirring passages from an earlier speech by Richard Nixon. In that case, we’d call him a thief.
