Ultimately, the two sides were able to reach an agreement on a weapons package that amounts to nearly $110 billion in tanks, fighter jets, combat ships and the THAAD missile defense system, according to the White House.   It is unclear how much the Saudis will be paying for THAAD, but Trump called it a "  system" last month when the US deployed the advanced missile defense radar to South Korea.    While calling the head of a major defense company and simply asking for a lower price is widely considered an unorthodox negotiation tactic, Kushner’s   approach has drawn comparisons to when    Trump criticized the stealthy   fighter jet for being too expensive, and Hewson gave her "personal commitment" to cut the cost of the program in February.   And the details of how the call took place also provide a window into Kushner’s role during negotiations with the Saudis and the range of his influence on matters of foreign policy as a whole.
