Donâ€™t expect those cards to be dealt swiftly because such investigations take time. The Obama administration was highly adept at stalling investigations until the Democratic media could pronounce them "old news" and ignore the outcome.   The Trump administration can distinguish itself by cooperating energetically with this one and helping it move forward quickly. Rest assured that no matter how long it takes, the media will never consider it "old news" as long as there remains any chance for anyone connected with the Trump 2016 campaign to get in trouble over contacts with the Russians.
