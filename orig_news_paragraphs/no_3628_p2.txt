The Times claims a portion read to them quotes President Donald Trump as expressing his wish for Comey to "let this go" with regard to   Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Comey is alleged to have made extensive additional memoranda from his notes of private conversations with the president. Comey himself has acknowledged that President Trump had a right to fire him for any reason or no reason, and some reports suggest he testified under oath that he received no request to curtail any investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The controversy now spinning in the mainstream media over these issues, however, would appear likely to form the thrust of Comey’s testimony.
