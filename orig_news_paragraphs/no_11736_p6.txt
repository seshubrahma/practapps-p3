Brady does seem to recognize that there is an awful lot of   political discussion on his network and one problem he pinpoints is the advent of social media in which   (and even behind the scenes) employees can connect with fans instantly and constantly.

But Brady admits that there are other signs that the network is leaning increasingly to the left.
