The basic regulations say each   visa lasts for three years —  and can be automatically extended for another three years. In theory, that would limit the   population to a maximum of six times the annual apparent cap of 85, 000, or a total of 510, 000. But, the program has many loopholes which are used by immigration lawyers to bring in an extra 20, 000 extra   workers per year, to lengthen the stay of many   by several years and to get work permits for some spouses of   workers. Goldman Sachs’ February study, titled "The   Visa Debate: A Global FAQ for Investors," tried to count these extra workers and extra years, saying: "We estimate that 900k to 1mn individuals are working under   visas in the US today, based on the assumption that most existing visas are renewed for a second term, and that about   of qualified   visa holders eventually apply for a green card (based on average wait times and green card quotas for countries affected)   …     figures would be slightly higher when including spouses of   visa holders (which could be as many as 500k people based on prevailing marriage rates of roughly 50% across countries).
