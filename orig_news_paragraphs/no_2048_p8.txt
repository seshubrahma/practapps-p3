The disclosures also undercut another theme that was central to Mr. Trump’s appeal as an antipolitician  —   his insistence that he would not favor wealthy donors and powerful interests if elected. Some of his   nominees, who include millionaires and billionaires, made large donations to his campaign or to "super PACs" supporting him. For example, Linda McMahon, the professional wrestling mogul whom Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Small Business Administration, donated $7 million to two   groups. The records also show that the men he intends to nominate for his secretaries of Labor, Treasury and Commerce all made   contributions to his campaign, the Republican National Committee or another group supporting him.
