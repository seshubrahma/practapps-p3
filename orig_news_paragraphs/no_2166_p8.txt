Mr. Kasich had been set to fly to the Washington area on Wednesday to hold a news conference, meet with a newspaper editorial board and attend   for his campaign. He got on his plane in Columbus, according to campaign advisers, but had reservations about pressing on. The plane never took off, and within hours, Mr. Kasich was announcing the end of his bid. A former chairman of the House Budget Committee and the governor of a large and electorally critical state, Mr. Kasich did not lack in credentials.
