Leon Rodriguez, the director of the United States Customs and Immigration Service, said the vetting included what officials call a "Syrian enhanced review" involving fraud detection and national security units, as well as intelligence checks that include examination of social media. Seven percent of Syrian refugee applicants have failed the screenings and been denied entry, Mr. Rodriguez said on Friday, and an additional 13 percent were paused because of concerns about their credibility. The nonprofit groups that help resettle refugees began to feel the impact. At their weekly Wednesday "allocation" meeting, where a representative from each group spends hours in a nondescript office conference room in Arlington, Va. across the Potomac River from the State Department, there was a spike in the number of Syrian cases they were being asked to accept.
