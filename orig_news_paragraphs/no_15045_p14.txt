Theyâ€™re an admirable idea, but based on multiple discussions I have had with senior US Air Force and other military officials, implementing a safe zone in Syria would be quite complex, because it would require a " " zone to succeed. This would possibly put Russia and the United States on a collision course because Russian jets are also conducting airstrikes in Syria, while some of the planes that the Syrian air force flies are the same model as some of the Russian planes that are flying in Syrian air space. The Russians have also given the Syrians the      missile system, which is one of the most sophisticated air defense systems in the world, according to US military officials. A " " zone in Syria would also require, at least theoretically, a UN resolution, but that would be a   with Russia and China.
