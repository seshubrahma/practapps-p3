Daily Beast columnist and CNN contributor Dean Obeidallah started off the new year with a tweet suggesting Donald Trump is a bigger threat than the Islamic State. [In the tweet, Obeidallah writes that   and ISIS are "using Trump’s words to help recruit" soldiers for their Islamic Caliphate and that he is "unqualified" on foreign policy, thereby suggesting that Trump is "more a threat to the US than [the Islamic State]. " Trump has proven to be the strongest presidential candidate, on both sides thus far, to come out against the radical Islamic organization.   Al Qaeda and ISIS using Trump’s words to help recruit shows how unqualified Trump is on foreign policy.
