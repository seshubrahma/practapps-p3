In quick succession, Mr. Trump has repeated his critique that Ms. Machado gained a "massive amount of weight" after she won the Miss Universe crown in 1996 suggested that former President Bill Clinton’s infidelities are fair game for campaign attacks and urged his followers to "check out" a sex tape that may not exist.
