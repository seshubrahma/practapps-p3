 (CNN) A federal judge in Seattle on Friday declined to release from detention a    immigrant who had been protected from deportation under   rules. Magistrate Judge James Donohue set a February 24 bond hearing for Daniel Ramirez Medina, thereby extending for a week a case that has roiled   groups. Ramirez is originally from Mexico and had twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, his lawyers said.
