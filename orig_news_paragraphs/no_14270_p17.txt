US planning additional sanctions on Iran following missile test, Trump’s frequent criticisms of the European Union, which he has branded corrupt while apparently rooting for more nations to join Britain by voting to leave, is irking US allies, who see the block, for all its faults, as the root of decades of peace in Europe, a continent previously wracked by centuries of war. " It is unacceptable that there should be, through a number of statements by the US President, pressure on what Europe should be or what it should no longer be," French President Francois Hollande said at the EU summit in Malta on Friday,  "There is no future with Trump if it’s not worked together," Hollande said, according to an official Twitter account for France’s representative to the EU. Trump has also criticized the other bulwark of European security, NATO, as obsolete and has far more in common with populist leaders seeking to make an impact in elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany than the ruling elites in those nations.
