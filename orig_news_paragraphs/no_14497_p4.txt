The case raises questions about what it could mean for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Ramirez came to the United States when he was 7 years old and became a DACA recipient in 2014 and renewed in 2016, according to court papers filed by his attorneys.   Immigration rights groups say they believe this may be the first time a Dreamer has been arrested without cause.   Ramirezâ€™s lawyers have filed suit in federal court saying their client is being unlawfully held by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.
