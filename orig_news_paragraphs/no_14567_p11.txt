That’s when the Obama administration gave a controversial instruction to schools regarding students who are transgender, people who identify as a gender that’s different than their biological sex at birth.    A recent university estimates suggest around half of 1 percent of Americans are transgender, though the exact percentage isn’t known. The Obama administration recommended that U. S. public schools allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms or locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity.   The government said this would protect transgender students from discrimination and it threatened schools with the loss of federal funding if they didn’t follow the rules.
