Police said Michael Sandford, a Briton, struck up a conversation with a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officer under the pretense that he was seeking to get an autograph. During the conversation, police said Sandford tried to pull the officerâ€™s service weapon from its holster.   Other officers also assigned to provide security at the event were quickly able to detain Sandford and authorities said there was no further disruption to the event. Sandford told police that he drove to Las Vegas from California "to kill Trump," according to the complaint, after hearing a few days earlier in the news that he was expected there.
