Mr. Kushner and his father Charles began showing potential investors a "white book," which laid out their vision for tearing down the blocky building to make way for the much taller, glassier skyscraper designed by Ms. Hadid. The book portrayed a tower made up of a   retail base, an     hotel, 55 stories of   condominiums, topped by a sky deck. The Kushners also renamed the tower 660 Fifth, casting aside the "666" reference that some people may connect with the number for Satan in the Bibleâ€™s Book of Revelation. The financial summary in the white book described the redevelopment as a $6. 7 billion project.
