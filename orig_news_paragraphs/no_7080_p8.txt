Ross explained that this "authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to conduct comprehensive investigations to determine the effects of imports of any particular item into the United States on the security of the country. " He said this has been invoked before, notably in regards to the Arab Oil Crisis. He listed the areas the investigation will look at: domestic production needed to meet national defense requirements, the industryâ€™s capacity to meet such requirements, related human and material resources, importation of quantity and use of goods, close relation of national economic welfare to national security, loss of skills and investment, substantial unemployment, decrease in government revenue and impact of foreign competition on specific domestic industries and impact of displacement by excessive imports.   and countervailing duty cases present a problem according to Ross.
