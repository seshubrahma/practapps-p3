If that means it’s anywhere near as good as her   collection, "This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage," I’ll be happy. Also on my    pile, two very different memoirs: John le Carré’s account of his path from spy to novelist, and Lauren Collins’s book about falling in love with someone when you do n’t speak his or her language. With luck, you’ll find some personal bookmarks on this list as well.
