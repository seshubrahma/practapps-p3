China has continued to call for dialogue to stabilize the situation on the Korean Peninsula and views the THAAD deployment with hostility.   Though there’s a concern that THAAD could up the ante in an arms race, Beijing’s concerns largely have to do with the   system’s powerful radar, which could be used to monitor activity inside China, experts say. South Korean businesses have been feeling the pinch in recent weeks due to the deployment, including Lotte, the conglomerate that owns the land where THAAD will be placed. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly denied any knowledge of restrictions being placed on South Korean businesses over THAAD.
