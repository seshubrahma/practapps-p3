The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what federal help his administration might offer Chicago to combat homicide. But California Republican Rep. Darrel Issa told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" that Emanuel needs to communicate with Trump to combat crime. " What Rahm needs to do is he does need to work with   Trump when he’s President and ask for the federal help that will allow him to break up these pockets of very bad people and let his police work on commuting policing," he said.
