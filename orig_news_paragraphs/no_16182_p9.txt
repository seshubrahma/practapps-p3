If realized, that sum would leapfrog the Trump super PACs over similar groups, who have struggled to raise large dollars. At least four other groups have tried to raise cash for independent expenditures, but none have demonstrated that they are financially viable, and some have missed their fundraising goals by tens of millions of dollars. The campaign has had an uneasy relationship with the PACs, not officially sanctioning them given Trumpâ€™s populist rhetoric. Yet Democrats have pilloried Trump on television all summer, and without a major PAC, Trump is sure to be heavily outspent on advertising, perhaps by unprecedented margins.
