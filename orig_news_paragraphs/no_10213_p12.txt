That question was left open by the Supreme Court in Heller, and we have no need to answer it here. Because Plaintiffs challenge only policies governing concealed carry, we reach only the question whether the Second Amendment protects, in any degree, the ability to carry concealed firearms in public. Based on the overwhelming consensus of historical sources, we conclude that the protections of the Second Amendment —  whatever the scope of that protection may be —  simply does not extend to the carrying of concealed firearms in public by members of the general public. With almost a quarter of the United States under the Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction, however, the Second Amendment effectively ends when people leave their front doors in those states.
