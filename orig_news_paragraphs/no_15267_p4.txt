At the end of the review, according to the order, DeVos will be asked to "rescind or revise any regulations that are identified" as oversteps. In particular, the order asks for DeVos to review the Every Student Succeeds Act, an   education law, and Common Core, education standards that were initially adopted by most states but have drawn the ire of conservative critics in recent years. Democrats slammed the executive order as nothing more than empty rhetoric on Wednesday, with a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee flatly saying, "this EO changes absolutely nothing." "Trump isn’t signing it to actually improve education for American students, he is doing it to put a fake point on the board within his first 100 days because he doesn’t have any accomplishments of significance," said Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
