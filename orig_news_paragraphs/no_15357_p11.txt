The vast majority of health insurance is provided by US citizensâ€™ employers, although tens of millions of Americans remain uninsured. In an attempt to improve the system, former US President Barack Obama passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, during his first term. A signature achievement of his administration, it came to be known as Obamacare. It was designed to increase the array of healthcare benefits provided by insurers and levied a tax on the wealthy to help pay for it.
