Radcliffe’s new   show examines privacy in the digital era. It is set to run from July 5 through August 7 at New York City’s Public Theater. Radcliffe’s latest film, Swiss Army Man, opened to $116, 000 from three theaters this weekend for a strong $38, 000   average, according to Box Office Mojo. Radcliffe plays a flatulent corpse whom   Paul Dano must ride to safety off of a deserted island in the wildly divisive movie that caused more than a few walkouts at Sundance in January.
