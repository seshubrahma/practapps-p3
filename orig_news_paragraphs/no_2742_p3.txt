Nearly a month after his stunning election upset ended a bitterly divisive presidential race, Mr. Trump flatly refused any responsibility for the rifts, saying, "I’m not president yet, so I didn’t do anything to divide. " But in the interview with Time, Mr. Trump repeated some of the harsh talk that marked his unorthodox campaign, and he declined to criticize or contradict President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who has called President Obama a "son of a whore" and has been accused of waging a campaign of extrajudicial killings of thousands of people suspected of being drug dealers. Told that his promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants who kill and rape Americans echo Mr. Duterte’s talk about annihilating drug dealers and users, Mr. Trump did not dispute the comparison.
