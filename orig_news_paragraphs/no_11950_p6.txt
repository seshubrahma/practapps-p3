The SPLC, a   hate crime watchdog, posted the incident in their "hatewatch" section despite the lack of details surrounding the suspect and his motive. " A black church in the Mississippi Delta was burned and vandalized with   graffiti in what law enforcement is now calling an attempt at voter intimidation," wrote the SPLC in their filed case, though it was the comments section that really showed the dangerous effect of narrative manipulation in the mainstream media. The SPLC is the same group that features the American Family Association, Info Warsâ€™ Alex Jones, and Breitbart contributors David Horowitz and Pamela Geller in their list of "extremists" alongside the Aryan Brotherhood, Black Panthers, and the Ku Klux Klan.
