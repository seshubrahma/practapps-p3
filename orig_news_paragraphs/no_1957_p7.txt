One prominent defection came last week when Kim   a former party chairman and Ms. Parkâ€™s presidential campaign manager, vowed to impeach her, saying she had "betrayed the people and our party. " The alleged conspiracy revolves around a secret presidential adviser and confidante, Choi   who was indicted on Nov. 20 on charges of exploiting her influence with Ms. Park to gain access to confidential government documents and to force businesses to donate $69 million to two foundations she controlled. Prosecutors said Ms. Park was an accomplice in the scheme, directing her aides to help Ms. Choi shake down major corporations like Samsung and Hyundai.
