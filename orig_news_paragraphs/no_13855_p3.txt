A senior transition official described the meeting between Trump and intelligence community officials as "cordial," not contentious. Trump asked questions and made clear his admiration for intelligence community employees, the official added. Based on the presentation Friday, which included new information, the official insisted that it’s the transition’s view that the hacking was intended to harm Hillary Clinton more than to help Trump.   This official pointed to what they were told at the meeting, that the cyberactivity began in late 2015 and early 2016, before it was clear Trump would be the nominee.
