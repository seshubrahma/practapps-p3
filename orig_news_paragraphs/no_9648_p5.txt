What the Republican Party needs to avoid blowing up is to get a binary choice between Mr. Trump and someone else. I think the evidence that we’re approaching that is the fact that Ted Cruz announced late last week that he’s going to open ten offices in the state of Florida. He’s probably not doing that to win Florida. He’s probably doing that to prevent Marco Rubio from winning it.
