Still, Senate candidates like both Toomey and Rubio are keeping their focuses squarely on their own races. The Monmouth poll out Tuesday shows Toomey running ahead of Trump, but still behind his Democratic opponent by four points. Toomey has yet to throw his support behind Trump’s candidacy and in a call with reporters earlier this month said he believes voters "will make a completely separate decision about the person they want representing them in the United States Senate. "  Rubio echoed a similar sentiment about his race, telling Raju, "You can’t take it for granted if the top of the ticket wins, and then you have a chance to win even if it doesn’t."
