Not a constitutional challenge, The issue in front of the court at the moment is not whether or not Trumpâ€™s travel ban is constitutional, but whether it will remain suspended for now. It all centers on his executive order issued January 27 with little explanation or advance warning. The order bars citizens of seven   countries    Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen    from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Friday, federal Judge James Robart of the US District Court for the Western District of Washington suspended key parts of the executive order nationwide.
