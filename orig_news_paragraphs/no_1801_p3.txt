The New York Times reported in August that Mr. Kushner had explored the possibility of either creating a media property or acquiring one, and his talks with Mr. Bourkoff were part of that effort, according to a person briefed on the discussions, who asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations. Within Mr. Trump’s campaign, top aides over the summer made reference to the possibility of running a media holding after the election, guided by the belief that the Republican nominee would win and such a property could help bolster his agenda, according to a person with direct knowledge of those discussions, who also asked for anonymity. At the moment, Mr. Trump’s campaign is led by Stephen K. Bannon, who operates the   website Breitbart. Mr. Trump’s campaign digital director, Brad Parscale, is close with Mr. Kushner and has done work for the Trump Organization in the past.
