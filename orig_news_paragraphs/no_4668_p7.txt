The lawsuit was reinforced by Obama’s directions to the nation’s   schools, which told administrators to accept and support any child’s claim they are transgender, to hide children’s sexual claims from their parents, and to punish other  children who decline to use pronouns favored by a "transgender" child   —   such as "him" or her "  —   even in science class. In the lawsuit against North Carolina, Obama’s lawyers claimed   facilities discriminate against men or women who want to live as members of the opposite sex. They insisted that 1970s civil rights laws actually require that a person’s feeling about their maleness or femaleness, dubbed "Gender Identity," be treated as more important than their actual male or female heterosexual biology.
