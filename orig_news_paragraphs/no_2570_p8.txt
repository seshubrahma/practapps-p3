Creating a new group would give Mr. Adelson more control over how his money is spent, at a moment when there are a number of super PACs that either exist or are being formed to support Mr. Trump’s bid. Other major donors, such as Rebekah Mercer, who supported the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, are considering backing Mr. Trump through other super PACs. Super PACs cannot coordinate with campaigns, and, so far, the Trump campaign hasn’t signaled formally whether any group has its tacit blessing. In two cases, former aides to the campaign have gone to work for super PACs that support Mr. Trump, despite "  periods" mandated by campaign finance laws when transitions like that take place.
