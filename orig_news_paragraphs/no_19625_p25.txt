As the  has documented, time and time again,       lawmakers in both the  and the Senate     have actively worked to derail any progress on such a     greenhouse   mechanism, which is seen by many     environmentalists and economists as the best way to put a price     on carbon given its relative simplicity. Tillerson’s support     for such a tax appears even more empty when you remember back     to when he first proposed it: in 2009, when Democrats     controlled both chambers and the President Obama —  backed         bill had not yet died a slow death in the Senate.      Tillerson’s backing would have been a potential       event if it had come back in the 1990s when Al Gore was     advocating for it and when Republicans had not yet closed their     eyes and ears to the science.
