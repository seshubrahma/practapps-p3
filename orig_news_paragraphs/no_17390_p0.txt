Washington (CNN) The 538 members of the Electoral College are set on Monday to make   Donald Trump’s victory official.   In all 50 state capitals and the District of Columbia, electors    chosen by the state parties of the candidate who carried their state, Trump or Hillary Clinton    will meet to cast their ballots. The gatherings will remove the last bit of drama from 2016’s unprecedented election season    and   efforts to persuade Republican electors to vote against Trump, in some cases in violation of state laws requiring electors to support the victor.
