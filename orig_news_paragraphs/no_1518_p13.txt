Our estimate for Mrs. Clinton’s lead over Mr. Trump nationally is 3. 7 points our friends at FiveThirtyEight have a slightly smaller estimate of 3. 4 points, but our overall probabilities of winning differ by 12 percentage points. This is a small difference, but a notable one. We believe one source of the difference is in the ways we believe states will (or won’t) swing together, and how much they’ll shift.
