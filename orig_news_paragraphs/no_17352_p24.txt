" I just don’t recall in any other case where I felt as though the punishment was so inappropriate," Moye said. Moye recognized that because of his prior convictions, Moon was facing a mandatory minimum    life in prison without the possibility of parole    and said his team "bent over backwards" to try to avoid that.
