Last week, the United States and Israel sealed a $38 billion,   American security aid package to Israel, the largest ever granted to an ally. Officials in both countries have characterized the deal as proof that the   relationship is enduring, whatever the strains between the two men. On Monday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to have a brief session with China’s premier, Li Keqiang, a week after North Korea tested another nuclear device. The president is expected to press Mr. Li to use China’s influence to discipline the North, something the Chinese have resisted for fear of destabilizing an impoverished neighbor.
