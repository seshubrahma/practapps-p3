a payoff above 50 cents for a bet is a sign the market views a candidate as a winner —  for several days leading up to the Kasich deal on the evening of April 24. But, after the deal, Cruz has crashed and despite two desperate measures —  the announcement of his vice presidential pick Carly Fiorina and the Pence endorsement —  has not recovered. Almost instantly after the Pence deal, Trump took a commanding lead over Cruz. While at one point on April 24 the markets had Trump under 40 cents, by midday April 25, the markets —  in response to the   deal —  had corrected themselves to have Trump at over 60 cents.
