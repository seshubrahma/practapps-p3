Donald Trump won 94 of the 95 counties in Tennessee during the Republican primary in addition to trouncing Hillary Clinton there during the general election. So, the idea that the "proud residents" of Tennessee would clutch their proverbial pearls and take great issue with the Tennessee band representing the Volunteer State seems a bit more than laughable. According to the AP, Marist College and Talladega College have also experienced some resistance to the idea of taking part in the inauguration. Somehow, despite potentially not having the bands of Marist, Talladega College, and Tennessee, Donald Trump will have to find a way to become president.
