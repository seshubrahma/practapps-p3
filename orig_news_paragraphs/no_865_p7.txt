Imports of consumer goods rose by $2. 4 billion in January, with a particularly strong rise in imported cellphones. That reflects the relative strength of the U. S. economy. American consumers have rising incomes, and inevitably they spend part of that income on imported goods. In effect, the higher trade deficit in January is in significant part caused by U. S. economic strength.
