Lynch expressed great pride in the community and its unity "in defiance of terror and in defense of our most cherished ideals." "We stand with you today as we grieve together and long after the cameras are gone, we will continue to stand with you as we grow together in commitment, solidarity and in equality," she said. Lynch’s trip comes a day after authorities released details of Mateen’s communications with police during the June 12 mass shooting at Pulse nightclub, where 49 people died and more than 50 others were wounded. On Tuesday, law enforcement officials told CNN that Mateen had visited the club earlier in the night before his attack, possibly to assess the club’s security.
