A former governor with deep ties to the state, Manchin has wide name recognition in West Virginia but faces   as a Democrat in a state that voted for President Donald Trump by 42 points over Clinton last November.   Manchin charts own path in   West Virginia, Jenkins, who previously served as a Democrat in the West Virginia Senate, was elected to the US House in 2014 as a Republican, defeating incumbent Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall. Jenkins was   in 2016.   The video also hits Manchin on his 2013 proposal to expand background checks for gun purchases following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.
