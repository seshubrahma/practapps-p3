Clinton has no known drug allergies, does not smoke, use tobacco products or illicit drugs and drinks occasionally, according to Bardack, who also details her exercise regime: yoga, swimming, walking and weight training. Clinton is up to date on health tests, including a colonoscopy and a few other tests not often seen in a presidential candidateâ€™s health disclosure: gynecologic exam, mammogram and breast ultrasound.
