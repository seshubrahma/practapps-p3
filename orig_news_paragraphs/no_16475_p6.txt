Among blacks in North Carolina, 88% say they support Clinton, 7% Johnson and just 3% Trump. Among Hispanic voters in Arizona, 57% back Clinton, 20% Trump, 15% Johnson and 5% Stein. A key component of Trump’s pitch to these groups is his claim to be able to improve their economic situation, yet in both states,   broadly trust Clinton over Trump on handling the economy, with Hispanics in Arizona breaking 61% to 36% in Clinton’s favor and blacks in North Carolina breaking 85% for Clinton to 12% for Trump. There’s a gender gap between Clinton and Trump in North Carolina, but women and men in Arizona are largely on the same page.
