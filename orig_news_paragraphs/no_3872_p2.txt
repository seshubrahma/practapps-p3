There were several reasons that the federal trial court and the appeals court could have dismissed the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. Instead, on Feb. 9 the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the TRO. Although longstanding constitutional principles should require the Washington State lawsuit to be dismissed because EO 13780 has provisions different from EO 13769, and thus any legal challenge should have to start over at the beginning, the plaintiffs have asked Judge Robart instead to regard the new EO as a continuation of the first EO and continue to block the policy. On Mar. 9, Oregon was permitted to intervene as another plaintiff in Washington and Minnesotaâ€™s case.
