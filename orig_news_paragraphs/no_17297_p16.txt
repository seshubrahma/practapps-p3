Manchin, a moderate, had been scheduled to meet with Trump in New York Friday about a possible job in his administration but it was postponed until Monday so he could deal with the minersâ€™ issue.   Democrats are worried Manchin might leave the Senate to work for Trump, which could lead to a Republican pick up of his Senate seat.   Manchin is leading a pack of coal Senate Democrats    including Brown, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania,  each of whom is up for   in two years     to bolster the insurance benefits. Manchin has the support of at least one Republican, his fellow West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, while GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio is weighing whether to join the Democrats as well.
