Here is a powerful list of shocking, damning, specific facts about the Obama economy: GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the only real determinate of economic growth. Barack Obama is the only president in the history of America to preside over seven straight years of GDP growth under 3 percent. The White House economists just announced that GDP for Obama’s last year will be 1. 9 percent. Obama will therefore become the only president in America’s history to never produce a single year of 3 percent or higher GDP.
