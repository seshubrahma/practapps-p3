Monday on CNN, in offering her analysis of the House Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, network political analyst Gloria Borger said President Donald Trump suffered "the worst and most perilous day" of his "young" presidency.   Borger said, "You know, I think if you take a step back for a minute, Wolf, you would have to say this is the worst and most perilous day of Donald Trumpâ€™s young presidency. In this hearing over the last bunch of hours, we have seen the director of the FBI rebut Donald Trump directly. He said, first of all, there was no wiretapping by the former president of Trump Tower.
