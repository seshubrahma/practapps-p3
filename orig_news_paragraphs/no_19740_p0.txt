Something stunning happened on Capitol Hill yesterday: Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee practically stood shoulder to shoulder with senior officials from the U. S. intelligence community as they declared that America’s spies were right after all: The Russian government sought to interfere in the U. S. presidential election by hacking into   email and leaking information. It was a striking bipartisan rebuke to   Donald Trump, who has consistently cast skepticism on allegations of Russian involvement and seemed to disparage the intelligence community. Perhaps in anticipation of that committee hearing, Trump was already backpedaling on Twitter before it started, declaring, "The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!" What Did the Senate Hearing Reveal About Russian Hacking?
