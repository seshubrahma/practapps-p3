Opponents say it is discriminatory. Pence, Trump’s running mate, signed a controversial religious freedom bill in Indiana last year that clarified that the government can’t "substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion" and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be "substantially burdened" can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits. The measure soon attracted national controversy. Soon after signing it into law, Pence, under heavy pressure from LGBT groups, signed a "fix" for the bill prohibiting businesses from using the law as a defense in court for refusing "to offer or provide services, facilities, use of public accommodations, goods, employment, or housing" to any customers based on "race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or United States military service.
