The short answer is this: a     definitional change. The wrong rural income number came from the bureau’s Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement, a reliable source of detailed information on income and poverty that economists and policy makers have relied on for decades. But that report wasn’t devised to provide solid estimates in   geographic detail. One reason is that the Current Population Survey’s sample is too small for precise geographic estimates.
