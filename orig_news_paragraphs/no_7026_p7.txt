The argument advanced by plaintiffs HIAS (formerly Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) that asked Judge Chuang to tell both the President and Congress they must allow 110, 000 refugees into the United States in FY 2017  is both unusual and misleading.
