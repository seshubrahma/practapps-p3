" A Trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they are being placed," Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told an enthusiastic crowd of more than 5, 000 who greeted him at the Sun Country Airlines hangar of the Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport on Sunday.
