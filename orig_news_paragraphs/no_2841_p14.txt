Still, some of Mr. Trump’s loyal backers are rousing one another with talk of insurrection should Mr. Trump be defeated. In Wisconsin, David A. Clarke Jr. the sheriff of Milwaukee County, posted on Twitter on Saturday that it was "pitchforks and torches time," along with a photograph of an angry mob wielding weapons. Mr. Clarke addressed the Republican National Convention in July and appears regularly on television as a Trump campaign surrogate. Also, elements of Mr. Trump’s crowds have turned violent.
