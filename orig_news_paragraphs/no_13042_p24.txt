The axis refers to our moral evaluation of a policy, product, or technology.   means the lowest evil, 0 means neutral, and 100 means our highest ideal. In today’s debate,   is the   use of fossil fuels ("dirty energy") and 100 is a society completely powered by "green" energy, usually solar and wind. A good policy, on this scale, is one that helps us get off fossil fuels and onto green energy. With each proposal, Democrats are "arguing to 100" —  arguing that a given policy is bringing us closer to the ideal and away from the evil.
