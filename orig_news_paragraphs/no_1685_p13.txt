In the letter released by the Clinton campaign, Dr. Bardack said that she had examined Mrs. Clinton, 68, on Friday for a prolonged,   cough, discovered "small right   pneumonia," put her on antibiotics and advised her "to rest and modify her schedule. " At the Sept. 11 ceremony, she said, Mrs. Clinton "became overheated and dehydrated," but was "rehydrated and recovering nicely" later that day. Criticized for concealing Mrs. Clintonâ€™s illness, her aides apologized on Monday and promised to release more information about her medical history.
