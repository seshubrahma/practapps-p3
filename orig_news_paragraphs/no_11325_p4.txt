In February, Clinton visited the set of Rhimes’ Scandal and posed for pictures with the show’s cast, including Washington and actor Tony Goldwyn, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention earlier this week. The stars of the series also hosted a fundraiser for Clinton’s campaign in Washington, D. C. in April. Rhimes has also been a vocal critic of Clinton’s chief opponent, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The most recent season of Scandal featured the character of Hollis Doyle, an unabashedly sexist, xenophobic billionaire oil magnate running for president as a Republican who was not so subtly based on Trump.
