[The assault by gunmen and suicide bombers Wednesday on Tehran’s parliament complex and the shrine of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini killed 17 people and wounded more than 50.   Mourners were paying respects to those killed at a ceremony in parliament on Friday morning, in the presence of newly   moderate President Hassan Rouhani. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei initially played down the attacks this week, describing them as "firecrackers" that "will not have the slightest effect on the will of the people". At Friday’s funeral, however, he turned his wrath for the attacks on the United States and Saudi Arabia, his country’s fiercest rivals.
