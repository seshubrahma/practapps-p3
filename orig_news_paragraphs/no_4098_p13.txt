Once again we might ask: Is all this noise simply journalistic hype?     Weâ€™ll have a better handle on that question this spring, when Georgians go to the polls to fill the vacancy in the 6th Congressional district left by the departure of Tom Price, now Secretary of Health and Human Services.   Price himself handily won   to the House last year, but Trump won the district by just a single percentage point.   And so, of course, the Democrats will seek to make the voting a referendum on Trump, not Price.
