Donald Trump has made his opposition to the   Partnership a focal point of his campaign. To date, he is the only candidate to respond to Jeff Sessions’ candidate questionnaire, which addresses the critical issue of trade. Marco Rubio previously endorsed the TPP, although he now says he will not tell voters how he will vote on the deal until most of the primaries are over. While Cruz now says he will not support the TPP "in its current form," Cruz had previously supported Obama’s trade agenda.
