Muslim Americans, already alarmed by the election of Donald J. Trump, said Friday that Mr. Trumpâ€™s choices for crucial posts heightened their fears of discrimination, violence, deportation and even detention. Many said they worried that a more hostile America could prompt more Muslims to join forces with terrorists. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said "Islam hates us," endorsed the idea of a government registry of Muslims and proposed suspending immigration by Muslims or people from some   countries. In interviews on Friday, many Muslims said that they were not sure before the election how seriously to take such talk, hoping that it was more political hyperbole than policy, but that the personnel moves of the last few days had confirmed their worst fears.
