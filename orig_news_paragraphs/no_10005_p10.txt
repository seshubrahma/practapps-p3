Congress last month issued a nonbinding resolution opposing UN action, instead highlighting the importance of direct negotiations between the parties. The last time the UN Security Council passed a resolution that was critical of Israeli settlements was in 1980 just before President Jimmy Carter left office. Recently, President Carter has written an   in the New York Times calling on President Obama not to veto a   UN resolution and to facilitate unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, during the QA segment of the press conference, when asked by this reporter how Egypt can play a role with the incoming Trump administration regarding future engagement in   negotiations, Bolton responded that he believes a lot of "repair work diplomatically" is needed for the U. S. to be a force for some stability in the region.
