When the interagency review is completed, the administration looks forward to working with Congress on this issue. On March 29, Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of U. S. Central Command (CENTCOM) told Congress that the U. S. needs to have military action as an option on the table given Iran’s continuing belligerence and support for terrorist groups in the Middle East and beyond. " Iran poses the most significant threat to the Central Region and to our national interests and the interests of our partners and allies," Votel said in his prepared testimony.
