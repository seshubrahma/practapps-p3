Again and again, the lawyers’ and judges’ discussion went beyond Trump’s executive order to parse the President’s own statements    on the campaign trail, on Twitter and in speeches as President. Normally, the courts give Presidents enormous latitude in crafting measures aimed at securing the country. But in Trump’s case, judges    such as US District Judge Derrick Watson, in Hawaii, who used Trump’s own words in explaining why he issued a worldwide restraining order on the ban    do not sound convinced that the administration is telling the truth when it claims the travel ban is about security. Instead, they suspect it’s about religion.
