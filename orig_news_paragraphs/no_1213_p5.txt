The president is a   fan of Fox News, sitting for interviews with its   hosts and conferring privately by phone with Rupert Murdoch, the network’s executive chairman. Mr. Trump has bragged to associates that he now refers to Mr. Murdoch, one of the world’s most powerful media moguls, by his first name, according to a person who is friendly with both men. But the president has a particular rapport with Mr. O’Reilly, whose hectoring braggadocio and   nostalgia for a bygone American era mirror Mr. Trump’s own. A regular guest on "The O’Reilly Factor," Mr. Trump has attended baseball games with Mr. O’Reilly, praised his collection of   political books, and, as   granted him a prominent interview that aired during Fox’s Super Bowl pregame show.
