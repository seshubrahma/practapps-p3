The new administration’s decision to withdraw from TPP puts these benefits at risk and could leave a dangerous vacuum in the region, undermining US security and prosperity. It will likely give momentum to agreements in Asia that exclude the United States and do not promote high standards, strengthen China’s already muscular hand in the region and undermine our allies and partners.   We urge the administration to use the opportunity of withdrawal to meet with our TPP partners, outline areas of concern and devise a negotiating agenda to rectify its deficiencies. The administration should also look for new ways to open markets and advance the high standards that are critical to economic progress in the 21st century.
