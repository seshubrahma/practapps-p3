" For us, the terminal is a default shelter," said Phil Mellor, 55, who said he had largely relied on Grand Central for shelter since he lost his job as a security guard several years ago and his life began spiraling downward. Now, he said, he survives on "what the tourists throw out" and spends nights sleeping on the No. 6 train when the terminal is closed. The stationâ€™s dining concourse, on the lower level, with its popular food kiosks and ample seating, attracts diners as well as several dozen homeless people.
