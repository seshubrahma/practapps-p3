I am grateful to Sean Spicer and the members of the Trump team for taking action to give value to innocent Arab life. For the past two days, I was in a news blackout due to the Passover holiday. The festival ended, and I saw that my inbox was filled with media asking me to comment on Spicerâ€™s remarks about Hitler, poison gas, and the Holocaust. As a rabbi, I cannot broadcast on any Jewish holy day.
