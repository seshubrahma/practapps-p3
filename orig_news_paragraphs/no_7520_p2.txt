Rubio scored 16 percent and Kasich was in fourth place, with 15 percent. The March 2 to March 4 poll included 638 likely GOP primary voters. The two polls are every different from a poll by American Research Group, released late Saturday, which showed Kasich beating Trump, 33 percent to 31 percent. That ARG poll was conducted March 4 and March 5, and it shows Kasich doubling his   rating of 17 percent.
