The two leading Democrats, Attorney General Kamala Harris and Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, have both raised millions of dollars and spent heavily heading into todayâ€™s election.   On the GOP side there are a host of GOP candidates but because none of them are raising appreciable amounts of money to engage in meaningful voter contact, it is likely that votes from Republicans will end up being diluted amongst them.

The X factor is the 27% of likely voters who have not yet made up their minds.
