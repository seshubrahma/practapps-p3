The entry of these individuals, subject to national security checks, is in the national interest," notes the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in explaining the executive order, which President Trump signed on Friday. The executive order also allows the U. S. government to "prioritize refugee claims" from members of persecuted religious minorities in the predominantly Muslim countries covered under the ban, such as Christians and Yazidis. In 2011,   Obama instituted a similar ban, although it is unclear if it included the religious minority exception. There were neither protests nor backlash from the mainstream media in response to Obamaâ€™s measure.
