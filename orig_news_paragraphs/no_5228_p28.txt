Interestingly, just as the hinge year for cyberspace was 1969 —  when that fateful first electronic message was sent —  the same year was a banner year for outer space. I’m referring, of course, to the moon landing: On July 20, 1969, the command module Columbia of the Apollo 11 mission, carrying two astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, set down on the lunar surface.   Back on earth, billions of people watched it happen, live on TV. In the long run, the moon landing might well have been, as Armstrong said, "one giant leap for mankind," but in the short run, it was a giant leap for the USA.
