Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich will have no easy excuse if Mr. Trump continues to prevail. While Mr. Cruz faces the more immediate test in Indiana, Mr. Kasich will have to make swift use of his free hand in Oregon. Though the stateâ€™s primary date is May 17, the election there is conducted by mail, and voters will begin to receive their ballots this week. Ron Saxton, a prominent Kasich supporter in Oregon, said the deal "puts more pressure" on Mr. Kasich and Mr. Cruz to perform strongly against Mr. Trump.
