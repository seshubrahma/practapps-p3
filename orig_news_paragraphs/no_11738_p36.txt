" Finalizing the   employment eligibility was an important element of the immigration executive actions President Obama announced in November 2014. Extending eligibility for employment authorization to certain   dependent spouses of   nonimmigrants is one of several initiatives underway to modernize, improve and clarify visa programs to grow the U. S. economy and create jobs," said the February statement.
