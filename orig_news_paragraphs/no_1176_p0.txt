■ The Senate Judiciary Committee, in a      vote, sent the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch for the Supreme Court to the full Senate for consideration. ■ Democrats now seem to have the votes to filibuster Judge Gorsuch’s nomination. ■ But Republicans will most likely vote to change Senate practices later in the week so that Judge Gorsuch could be approved with a simple majority vote. ■ The tenor of the Judiciary Committee strongly suggests that the full Senate debate on Judge Gorsuch will be even more contentious.
