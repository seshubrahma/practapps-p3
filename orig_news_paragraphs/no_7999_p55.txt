But that was then. Today, Black Lives   activists have a complete hammerlock on the Democratic Party, and so Hillary Clinton, panting after the 2016 nomination, has felt compelled to walk back the Clintons’ earlier centrism. In particular, Hillary, on behalf of her husband, has repeatedly apologized for Bill’s signing of a tough 1994 crime bill. Moreover, the 2016 Democratic platform is a feast of leftist cliches about crime, including, Democrats are committed to reforming our criminal justice system and ending mass incarceration.
