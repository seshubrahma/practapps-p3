They make this case by pushing unrelated arguments about how Clinton supports "border security" —  which has nothing to do with the fact that she endorsed, championed and, is now campaigning, on open borders immigration policies that would allow virtually unlimited amounts of foreign migrants to enter the country on U. S. visas. These   "fact checks" rarely mention how many migrants would be imported into the country under a Hillary Clinton Presidency. While Bill Clinton described the immigration policies of 2001 as "open borders," his wife has championed policies that would only open our borders even further. For example, the 2013 Gang of Eight bill Clinton supported would have tripled green card issuances —  permanently resettling 33 million foreign nationals on green cards in the span of a single decade —  and would have doubled foreign guest worker visas to compete for American jobs.
