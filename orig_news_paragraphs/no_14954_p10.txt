At least $87 million have been set aside for the city of Flint, Michigan.   It will go toward replacing Flint’s water pipes. The old ones are made of iron and lead and that contributed to a major problem that started in 2014 when to save money, the state of Michigan switched Flint’s water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River.   The river water was more corrosive and it wasn’t treated properly, so it ate into the old pipes and brought lead to the city’s residents, some of whom suffered health problems after this happened.
