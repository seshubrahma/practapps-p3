The policies pushed by the tech industry are often criticized by immigration hawks for depressing the wages of American workers. As Breitbart Texas reported, the tech industry has increased their lobbying for more   foreign workers since Trump took office, claiming that they have a shortage of Americans with the skills they need. The rally is also purposefully being held days before Trump is set to meet with Indiaâ€™s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Because Indian nationals are the biggest beneficiaries of the   visa, lawmakers in the foreign country have been lobbying Modi to demand Trump drop his ongoing   legal review of the   system and its impact on Americans.
