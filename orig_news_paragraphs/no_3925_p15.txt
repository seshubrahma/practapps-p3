Media reports have called the Operation Cross Check arrests of criminal aliens a   effort by ICE officials and the Trump Administration, despite the fact that this operation has been carried out in the past. More than 2, 000 criminal aliens were rounded up in March 2015, Breitbart Texas reported at the time. The nearly 700 arrests in last weekâ€™s operation pales in comparison, yet the mainstream media appears to have lost total perspective in its attacks on the men and women tasked to protect our nation from these criminals. As reported by Breitbart News, the #DayWithoutImmigrants was "a political dud" however, some who decided to skip work, including those who did not show up in order to protest were fired.
