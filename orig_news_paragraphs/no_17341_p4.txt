But Senate GOP leaders, aware of the close margins for Tillerson and the  â€™s strong desire to get the   confirmed, could use a backup plan. If Tillerson were defeated in committee, according to aides in both parties, committee chairman Bob Corker,   could use procedural tools and precedents to get his nomination to the floor for a confirmation vote anyway.    Corker, who has become close to Trump and was himself a finalist for the top State Department job, could ask his members to move the nomination to the floor with a vote of "disapproval" from the committee. While that label could be somewhat damaging to Tillerson, it might be worth the price if Senate GOP leaders believe they have the votes to confirm him on the floor.
