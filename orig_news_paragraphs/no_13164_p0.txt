Professors at Florida International University (FIU) are now demanding the institution implement "sanctuary campus" policies where illegal immigrant students would be shielded from federal immigration laws. [In a letter to university officials, professors from FIU’s gender and anthropological studies departments asked that the university "develop a plan for protecting undocumented students and refuse to cooperate with any efforts to identify, detain, or deport undocumented students even if DACA is repealed or any other laws or policies change," the Miami New Times reported.   "DACA" is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals enforced by the Obama Administration, which allows illegal immigrant students to go to college legally. Under   Donald Trump’s proposed immigration crackdown, DACA would likely be thrown out, asking illegal immigrants to return home and enter through the country legally.
