" I said I’d ask her, and she was eager to go, which I think shows a willingness to get things done," said the aide, Melanne Verveer, who became Mrs. Clinton’s White House chief of staff. But many Republicans are not sure how she would use power, given that they think she abused her authority and was overly secretive by using a private email server as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton has already indicated that she is willing to take executive action on issues if Republicans do not work with her, like expanding background checks for gun sales and ending corporate inversions aimed at avoiding taxes.
