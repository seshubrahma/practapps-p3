The hacked email sent to Podesta from Kendall included a 1998 affidavit signed by Broaddrick. The document states: "During the 1992 presidential campaign, there were unfounded rumors and stories circulated that Mr. Clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies" and goes on to say: "I repeatedly denied the allegations and requested that my familyâ€™s privacy be respected. These allegations are untrue and I had hoped that they would no longer haunt me, or cause further disruption to my family."   This affidavit was part of the lawsuit filed by Paula Jones against Bill Clinton for sexual harassment.
