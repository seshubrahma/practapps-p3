In a presentation this week, Carrier’s management told employees that the fan coil line would be the first to close in   eliminating 300 to 400 jobs. But as that line closes, about 100 jobs will be saved temporarily by the creation of a new night shift making   furnaces.    furnace production is not set to end until   to late 2018, while the final line to close,   furnaces, won’t he shuttered until early 2019. That staggered schedule has given workers some hope that if a compromise between the new administration and the company does emerge, it may revolve around keeping the gas furnace production lines open, even if a smaller number of jobs are relocated to Mexico in the meantime.
