So what happened? Officials with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have not explained why the family was placed in custody. Spokespersons for both agencies declined comment. Court documents on ICE detainees are usually not available for people facing deportation because of executive orders issued by President Donald Trump.
