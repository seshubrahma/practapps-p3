On field trips to downtown museums I’d hear comments like, "Do you know what you’d see down here at night?"   I’d think, "Yes, a lot of tourists on Michigan Avenue and   commuters trying to get home after a late night at the office."   Of course, crime is a factor in any large city, but I wondered why there were such stereotypical views of city life.
