Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump will not head to Milwaukee for a previously scheduled visit of a   factory after the company decided it wasn’t comfortable hosting him amid planned protests, an administration official said Tuesday. Trump had been scheduled to tour the factory Thursday where he also planned to sign executive orders related to American manufacturing. The visit had not been publicly announced, but White House staffers were already on the ground in Milwaukee setting up for Trump’s planned visit to the factory on Thursday.
