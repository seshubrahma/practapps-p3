Ryan said there was zero evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to interfere in the election. " We have seen no evidence from any of these ongoing investigations that anybody in the Trump campaign or the Trump team was involved in any of this," he said during a press conference. Ryan added that there still wasnâ€™t evidence than any American colluded with the Russians to sway the election to Trump, and he added that members of congress frequently communicate with ambassadors of other countries.
