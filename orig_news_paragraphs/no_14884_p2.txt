The date of the invoice and the $750, 000 listed on it match the details logged in an    ledger, first reported on by the New York Times, which purports to be from Yanukovych’s party, listing the series of secret payments now under investigation. Manafort’s name appears in the handwritten ledger 22 times as the recipient of payments amounting to $12. 7 million, according to   authorities in Ukraine. With this new document, Leshchenko believes he has evidence that Manafort personally invoiced at least one of these payments from Yanukovych’s political party.    investigators in Ukraine have alleged Yanukovych and members of his party ran a corrupt regime.
