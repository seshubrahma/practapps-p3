Hours before the vote, The Daily Beast reported that, according to officials in the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump’s top adviser, Steve Bannon, wanted him to make a list of his House GOP enemies so they might be punished.   When this last   tactic failed, Trump and Ryan slammed on the brakes and canceled the showdown vote. CNN and other networks reported the debacle in real time and both men were left humiliated and diminished. No one should be surprised that Trump’s first big legislative initiative collapsed in a cloud of chaos.
