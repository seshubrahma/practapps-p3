The other case was brought by the attorney general of Hawaii and other individuals who claimed the ban exceeds the Presidentâ€™s statutory authority and violates the Constitution. The plaintiffs are challenging not only Section 2 of the order    the restriction on travel    but another section of the order pertaining to refugees. On March 15, Judge Derrick K. Watson of the US District Court for the District of Hawaii issued an injunction blocking both sections. Watson, relying upon statements that the Trump made as a candidate for the presidency, held that the "stated secular purpose of the Executive Order is at the very least secondary to a religious objective of temporarily suspending the entry of Muslims" in violation of the Constitution.
