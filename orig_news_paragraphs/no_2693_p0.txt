Every day when Lt. Cmdr. Shay Rosecrans crossed into the military detention center at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, she tucked her medical school class ring into her bra, covered the name on her uniform with tape and hid her necklace under her   especially if she was wearing a cross. She tried to block out thoughts of her    daughter. Dr. Rosecrans, a Navy psychiatrist, had been warned not to speak about her family or display anything personal, clues that might allow a terrorism suspect to identify her.
