___ 2. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama,   Donald J. Trumpâ€™s pick for attorney general, received a surprisingly gentle welcome at the start of his Senate confirmation hearing. He appeared to assuage Democrats by saying that that waterboarding is "absolutely" illegal and that he did not support barring Muslims from the United States, and even the most liberal senators declined to vigorously confront him on allegations of racism from three decades ago. The whirlwind week of hearings continued with retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security nominee.
