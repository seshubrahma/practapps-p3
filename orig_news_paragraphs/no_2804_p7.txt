During the primaries, it was easier to find common ground among Republicans and   voters. At the outset of this election season, I knew very few people who were behind Trump more often, I found myself in arguments about whether Marco Rubio was too young, whether Ted Cruz was too annoying, whether Jeb Bush was too   â€¦      well, too Jeb Bush. Even in those more amicable days, however, when I voiced my categorical opposition to Trump, I would see a head shake slowly or eyes look away for a moment.
