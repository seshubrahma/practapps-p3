Trump’s original executive order, signed a week after he took office, banned citizens of seven   countries from entering the US and temporarily suspended the entry of all refugees. A federal court issued a temporary stay that halted implementation of the travel ban earlier this month, a decision that was later upheld by a federal appeals court. The new travel ban will exclude legal permanent residents and existing visa holders from the ban entirely, sources familiar with the plans told CNN earlier Tuesday. While sources caution that the document has not yet been finalized and is still subject to change, there will be major changes: ·         The new executive order will make clear that legal permanent residents (otherwise known as green card holders) are excluded from any travel ban.
