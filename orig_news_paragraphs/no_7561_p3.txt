The issues that I have been talking about are the issues that really are the issues  the American people. Why the middle class is declining. Why kids are leaving school $50, 000  70, 000 dollars in in debt, and to expand social security. Those are the issues, frankly what I think is that people in the democratic process want real debate about the real issues.
