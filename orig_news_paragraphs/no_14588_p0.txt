Washington (CNN) Washington, DC residents, upset that a Utah congressman is meddling in their local politics, are using their voices and money    and setting up a PAC    to try and help oust him.   Rep. Jason Chaffetz represents the 3rd Congressional District in Utah, but residents in the District have a bone to pick with him. He serves as the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which under the Constitution has the right to block legislation passed by DC’s council.
