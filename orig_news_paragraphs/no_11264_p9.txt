Hillary Clinton has been for it and against it, so if she gets elected they might yet try to get it through. So their best hope is to elect a     president and try to move it through in the lame duck session in my opinion. Thatâ€™s my best political judgment. So there is an awareness that the people do not support it, and there is an attempt to keep the discussion out of the election debate.
