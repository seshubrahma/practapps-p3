Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) Hillary Clinton’s   super PAC, Priorities USA, is planning to knock Donald Trump for comments the Republican presidential nominee made mocking a reporter’s disability as part of their largest ad buy of the campaign.   The super PAC will begin airing an ad in a host of swing states this week that features Dante Latchman, a    Nevadan who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer on his spine. The ad, which shows Latchman saying he doesn’t "want a president who makes fun of me," is backed by $10 million, according to a release from the group first shared with CNN.
