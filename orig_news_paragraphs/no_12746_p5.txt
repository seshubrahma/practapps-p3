Further, it is not easy to reschedule exam rooms at this late date. Finally, postponing the exam would throw off the rest of the schedule as well. Therefore, I am making the exam optional. I will calculate each student’s grade both with and without exam 2, placing all of exam 2’s weight on the final exam when exam 2 is omitted.
