A meeting between the president and the Pope in May would increase pressure on Mr. Trump to fill that chair prior to his trip, even though the presence of a U. S. ambassador is not a prerequisite for a state visit to the Holy See. Historically, Republican administrations have been swifter in naming ambassadors to the Holy See than Democrats. Bill Clinton didnâ€™t name Raymond Flynn ambassador until March 1993, and Barack Obama appointed Miguel Diaz in May 2009. George H. W. Bush, on the other hand, appointed Tom Melady in February of 1989, and George W. Bush named Jim Nicholson as ambassador shortly after his election.
