This fall, the Education Department moved to revoke the status of the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) the largest accreditor of   colleges. Colleges have to be accredited for their students to get federal aid such as loans and Pell Grants. ACICS was accused of insufficiently policing its colleges, in part because it raised no red flags about Corinthian Colleges, which lost access to federal aid amid accusations of false marketing. Pulling the plug on the accreditor was a clear signal from the Obama administration that accreditors should play their gatekeeper role more forcefully.
