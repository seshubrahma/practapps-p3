According to the US, China has reclaimed more than 3, 000 acres in the Spratly Islands since the beginning of 2014. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan have also reclaimed land in the South China Sea, but their land grab    the US says approximately 100 acres over 45 years    is dwarfed by Chinaâ€™s massive, recent buildup. The Philippines, which lies geographically closest to the Spratlys, has troops stationed in the area, as do other claimants.   The US takes no position on the territorial dispute in the South China Sea but its warships have conducted "freedom of navigation" operations near the reclaimed islands, eliciting warnings from Beijing.
