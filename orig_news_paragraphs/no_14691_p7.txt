According to a report from the Congressional Research Service, at that time a growing number of Argentines were using the program as a way to illegally immigrate to the United States, staying past the   limit as the South American country faced a devastating economic crisis.   In a report released last year, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that 153, 166 visitors from the visa waiver program overstayed in fiscal year 2015    less than 1% of the nearly 21 million participants in the program that year. Deportations without court hearings are more common than you think. People who entered with visa waivers and then stayed past the limit arenâ€™t the only ones who could face swift deportation if they get detained.
