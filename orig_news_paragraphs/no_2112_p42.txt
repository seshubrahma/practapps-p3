The Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and the countermove by the Iranians to send its Iranian Revolutionary Guards there through Syria, began in June 1982, weeks before Malcolm Kerr was to start the new job.

Malcolm Kerr arrived in August, expressing hope that the destruction and death closing in on the campus could be kept outside its walls.
