The report includes notes from the interviews of Clinton and other witnesses in the investigation.   The notes, called 302s, represent an FBI agentâ€™s memos on the interviews and will be provided along with other investigative material.    The material is designated classified so it will need to be reviewed by congressional officials in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. And due to its confidential status, it cannot legally be shared with the public.
