The man running Donald Trump’s campaign has been hundreds of thousands of dollars by Saudi Arabia to lobby against Israel and to lobby against moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and Donald’s lobbyist campaign manager has now brought in an army of Washington lobbyists to run every aspect of the campaign. As Carly Fiorina has powerfully pointed out, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are flip sides of the same coin.
