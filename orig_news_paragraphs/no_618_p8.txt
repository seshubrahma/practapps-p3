Mr. Netanyahu has said in the past that he would not evacuate Beit El under any agreement with the Palestinians, even though it lies outside the major settlement blocs that Israeli leaders have more generally insisted on keeping. Founded in 1977 on private Palestinian land originally seized by Israel for military purposes, the settlement was later approved by the Israeli courts under the rubric of general security. Now it is home to about 6, 500 people who mostly live in modest,     or   buildings. There are plans in the pipeline for at least 300 new apartments in   buildings to be constructed on a rise by the entrance to the settlement.
