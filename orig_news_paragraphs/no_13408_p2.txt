The episode kicks off as the town of South Park gathers to watch a fourth grade girls’ volleyball game but instead of speculating about the action of the actual game, all the crowd and announcers want to do is predict who will stand or sit during the National Anthem, including Randy Marsh, who has a $100 bet on one of the players sitting down. When the Anthem concludes, everyone files out of the arena. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison  —   an avatar for Donald Trump   —   quickly realizes that he and his running mate Caitlyn Jenner’s chances to win the U. S. presidency are becoming more likely, especially after seeing the results of a new Gallup poll between he and his opponent Hillary Clinton, aka Turd Sandwich.
