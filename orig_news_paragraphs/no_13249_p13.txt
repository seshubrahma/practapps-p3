President Obama infamously returned the White House bust of Churchill to the United Kingdom almost immediately upon taking office. I think America would be wise to heed Churchill’s words and do the right thing, especially now that they’ve tasted the sour flavour of Obama and globalism. Whoever the next President is, they should ask for the bust back. America’s greatest advantage is that patriots are everywhere.
