Louis Nelson in Politico notes President Obama’s comments in a recent interview with New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait, in which Obama says that he sees "a straight line" starting from the vice presidential nomination of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin to the rise of the tea party movement to the candidacy of Donald Trump. [From Politico:  The path that brought the Republican Party to nominating Donald Trump as its candidate for the White House began in 2008, President Barack Obama said in an interview published Monday, when Sarah Palin joined John McCain’s GOP ticket. " I see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the   nominee to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the Freedom Caucus, the tea party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican Party," the president told New York Magazine.
