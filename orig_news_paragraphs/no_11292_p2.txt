The poll shows the "strong support" and "somewhat support" numbers for various policies. That is important because those details help explain Americans’ contradictory desire to help their kids and also help foreign migrants.

Trump’s promise to start "immediately deporting" illegals who have committed crimes gets 75 percent strong and somewhat support, and only 7 percent strong opposition.
