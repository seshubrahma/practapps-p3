During a radio interview on Sunday, legendary standup comic and staunch Israel supporter Jackie Mason took issue with Sen. Ted Cruz’s attacks on opponent Donald Trump concerning the billionaire’s positions on Iran and Israel during the most recent debate. ["I’m in shock that Cruz has the nerve to look him in the eye and accuse him of the exact opposite of what he said," stated Mason, speaking during his regular segment on "Aaron Klein Investigative Radio," the popular weekend talk radio program. Continued Mason:   Trump has been saying a hundred times, at every debate and on the street corners, every place you go and every time you say hello to him, he tells you how much he loves Israel.
