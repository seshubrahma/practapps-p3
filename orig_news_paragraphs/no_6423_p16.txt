One’s opinion on the present state of affairs has nothing to do with racism and should not be equated with it. It must finally be noted that nowhere in Mr. Wood’s purported "analysis" does the question of electoral motivation even come up. He unscientifically concludes that Trump voters are "motivated" by racism despite the fact that they were not even asked why they voted for Trump in the first place. As any serious academic knows, correlation does not imply causality.
