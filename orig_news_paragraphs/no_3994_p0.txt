Scalia on the Supreme Court, who died Feb. 13, creating the current vacancy. ["It is obviously a great pick by the president," said Sen. Benjamin E. "Ben" Sasse (R. .) who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and was one of the guests invited to the White House for the announcement.   " I think it’s going to be really hard for people, who are serious about the Constitution to oppose this guy," he said.
