For publishers, the books have been reliable cash cows. Bill O’Reilly’s historical "Killing" series has more than 17 million copies in print. In the weeks leading up to the election, the   lists were dominated by partisan polemics by Dinesh D’Souza, Michael Savage, Edward Klein and Gary J. Byrne, whose   book "Crisis of Character" sold some 247, 000 hardcover copies, according to Nielsen. But now, without conservatives filling the role as the voice of opposition, the urgency and potency of   books will almost certainly be diminished.
