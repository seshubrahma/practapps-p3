The film, which was screened for select media and political audiences here in Midtown, Manhattan, on Wednesday and will be again on Thursday, brings to life the revelations of several parts of the Clinton Cash book. It shows on the big screen in graphic detail how the Clintons used their influential connections worldwide to enrich themselves and their millionaire and billionaire friends while empowering many times corrupted world leaders and furthering plight of the world’s needy and poor in places like Africa and Haiti —   all while jeopardizing U. S. interests by allowing Russia’s Vladimir Putin to have financial control of U. S. nuclear materials. This reporter saw the film at the screening on Wednesday.
