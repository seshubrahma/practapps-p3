Democrats also won a competitive race in Nevada, where Catherine Cortez Masto held off Republican Rep. Joe Heck to retain the seat being vacated by retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid.   Those were Democrats’ only three victories in a night that saw Republicans win nearly every close race, retaining their House and Senate majorities and guaranteeing the party has full control of Congress when   Donald Trump is sworn in on January 20, 2017.
