Potential names for Clintonâ€™s chief of staff include former vice presidential chief of staff Ron Klain, campaign Chairman John Podesta, top aide Jake Sullivan, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and HHS Secretary Silvia Mathews Burwell. Sullivan is also the top contender for national security adviser.   Clinton is also thought to be likely to build her White House team from her list of campaign staff, including longtime aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden, campaign manager Robby Mook and engagement chief Marlon Marshall. Communications director could be Jennifer Palmieri, who plays that role on the campaign, or longtime aide Philippe Reines.
