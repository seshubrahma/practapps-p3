Christians believe in God, the Creator of heaven and earth, who loved his creation so much that he entered into it through the womb of a woman to become one with his creatures in their suffering. This understanding of God has huge implications for the society that forms with Christianity as it foundation: we believe in a creator who made us in his image.   The Christian God invites us to make beautiful things in his honor, and the great pantheon in the west is an expression of this divine permissiveness. Art, literature, music and drama in the west are expressions of the licence given to Christians to explore themselves and their relationship to the ineffable.
