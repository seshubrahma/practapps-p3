The politburo does not want transparency. They want deceit and they want comfort food for the American people so they can continue to be boiled alive like frogs. We have begged for politicians that will be transparent, and now we have one, and he is letting the American people in on a corrupt process, the elite panic. Let me say this to my mishpacha: I believe if we can ever achieve peace in Israel, it is Trump who may be able to broker the deal.
