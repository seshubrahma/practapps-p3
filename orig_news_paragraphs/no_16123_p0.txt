Cleveland  (CNN) Social conservatives won early victories in the debate on the Republican Party platform as delegates gathered here for their first full day of meetings before next week â€™s Republican National Convention, fighting back efforts to moderate on LGBT issues    including the use of restrooms for transgender people    and strengthening party provisions opposing abortion rights.   The debate over social issues carries extra weight this year, as conservatives and evangelical voters look to ensure the platform still reflects Republican orthodoxy despite the presumptive nomination of Donald Trump, who has more moderate views on abortion rights, for instance, than the 2012 platform.
