Mr. Trump made several swings through Arizona and capitalized on Republicans’ dislike of Mrs. Clinton and their frustration over illegal immigration, vowing to build a wall along the border. Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Gov. Jan Brewer were some of his most vocal backers, especially on immigration issues. Gov. Doug Ducey was among those who introduced him at rallies and urged Arizonans to vote for him. Mrs. Clinton sought to tap into frustrations among Latinos over Mr. Trump’s   talk and a favorable ballot that included a   increase and Mr. Arpaio’s bid for a seventh term as sheriff of Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix.
