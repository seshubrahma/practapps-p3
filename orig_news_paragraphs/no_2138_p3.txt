Although Mr. Trump claimed credit for SoftBank â€™s $50 billion investment in the United States, those plans predated the election, and Mr. Son has owned a controlling stake in Sprint, among other companies, for several years. A Sprint spokeswoman, Adrienne Norton, said that the 5, 000 jobs are part of the 50, 000 increase Mr. Son promised, but that the new positions would be financed by the mobile phone carrier.
