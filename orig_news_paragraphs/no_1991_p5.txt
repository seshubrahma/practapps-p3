During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to roll back the abortion rights guaranteed by the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, and he suggested  "punishment" for abortion providers and their patients. In his first   television interview after he won the presidency, he repeated his desire to see Roe v. Wade overturned and said, of women seeking abortions, "Well, they’ll perhaps have to go   —    they’ll have to go to another state. "
