The second attack occurred just over two hours later in the coastal city of Alexandria, where a suicide bomber tried to enter St. Markâ€™s Cathedral. Surveillance footage, later aired on a private Egyptian television channel, showed a man wearing a bulky jacket being directed into a metal detector at the church gates, where he paused to be searched by a police officer. A moment later, a giant blast rang out. At least 17 people were killed, including a district police chief and a police officer, and an additional 48 were wounded, according to the Health Ministry.
