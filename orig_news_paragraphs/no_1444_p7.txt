Charles Spies, a Republican election lawyer who advised the "super PAC" that supported Jeb Bush, said Mr. Trump would have to put in an enormous amount of his own money to   his campaign and win over big donors. He suggested an appropriate figure would be $100 million to $200 million. Mr. Spies said Mr. Trump should also forgive the loans he had made to his campaign, to reassure contributors that he would not use their money to repay himself.
