We matched the data to the C. C. E. S.â€™s postelection survey, which asked individuals about their health care and how they voted in the 2016 presidential election. The end result: an estimate for how much every respondent of the survey would gain or lose under the Republican plan, based on age, income and county. Like any result based on a survey, the estimates are imperfect. But the Republican plan offers less assistance to older and   Americans, especially in rural areas, according to the Kaiser data.
