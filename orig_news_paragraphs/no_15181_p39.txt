Another program that could be changed to a block grant is Social Security Income, which provides as much as $733 a month in cash assistance to 8. 4 million poor and disabled people, including 1. 3 million disabled or blind children. Many of the children who receive SSI live with a single parent and receive special education. Under block grants, states could make it harder for parents with disabled children to receive benefits or could cut the monthly amount of money they receive.
