According to the federal complaint, the local ordinance required 50 parking spaces for houses of worship based on a    standard ratio, or an average of three people arriving in one car.

The societyâ€™s complaint stated that applicants "dutifully revised their site plan and brought back professionals to testify time and again, only to find that the board had generated yet more requirements.
