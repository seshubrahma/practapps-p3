The "Fahrenheit  " director   lightened the mood with a brief Trump impression and an anecdote   about his high school run for a seat on the school board, which   he claimed made him the first teenager in his homestate of   Michigan to serve public office. ’ ’    He encouraged the crowds to run for public office and condemned   the nomination of charter school advocate Betsy DeVos as   secretary of education.
