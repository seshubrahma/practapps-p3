At this point, Democrats might be heading toward a landslide victory, capturing the White House by large margins, securing control of the Senate for the first time since 2010 and possibly, just possibly, taking over a majority of the House of Representatives (though the odds of that remain low). Republicans are running scared and there is ample reason for them to feel this way. Pivoting to a "New Trump," as some are calling it, won’t be easy. It isn’t easy for any candidate at this point in the campaign and it certainly won’t be easy for Donald Trump.
