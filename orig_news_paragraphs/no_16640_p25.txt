Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said North Carolina is Clinton’s "best chance" to win a state that Mitt Romney carried four years ago.   " Polls consistently have showed her holding a narrow plurality in the state, built on strong support among   and an ability to win over some better educated suburban whites in the Charlotte area and the Research Triangle who liked Romney but find Trump out of sync with their values," said Garin, who advises the   super PAC Priorities USA. Thursday’s visit is her fifth since she clinched the nomination on June, while Clinton’s campaign and her aligned super PACs have spent close to $15 million advertising on TV in the state.
