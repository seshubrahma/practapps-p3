But neither Dr. Hawking nor anybody else was able to come up with a convincing explanation for how that happens and how all this "information" escapes from the deadly erasing clutches of a black hole. Indeed, a group of physicists four years ago tried to figure it out and suggested controversially that there might be a firewall of energy just inside a black hole that stops anything from getting out or even into a black hole. The new results do not address that issue. But they do undermine the famous notion that black holes have "no hair
