 (CNN) Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Friday denied calls by his Democratic colleagues to bring Attorney General Jeff Sessions before the panel in the coming days to testify about his meetings with the Russian ambassador. But that doesn’t mean Sessions isn’t going to provide a response to the Democratic lawmakers’ questions about the meetings, which they outlined in a letter to Grassley on Friday calling for a hearing. In response, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said, "In light of the letter received from Senators late this afternoon, the Attorney General will respond to their questions along with his amended testimony on Monday."
