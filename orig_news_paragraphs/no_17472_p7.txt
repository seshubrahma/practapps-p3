The Russian Defense Ministry said influential Islamist groups such as Ahrar   and Jaysh   have signed up to the process. But the Syrian army has asserted that groups linked to Fateh   of which Ahrar   has been the most prominent, will be excluded from the deal. One source in Ahrar   which receives extensive support from Turkey, acknowledged that it is involved in the negotiations. But late Thursday the group said on its Twitter feed that it "has reservations about the proposed agreement" and had not yet signed.
