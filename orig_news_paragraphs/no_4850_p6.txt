but of course it was picked up on the   machine by TSA. The officer who caught it recognized me from TV, I showed them my Defense Department ID, and I was issued a fine but allowed to board my flight. At the same time, since Reagan falls under Arlington County, I was required to appear in County Court also at a later date. On August 8th 2016 the court fined me $150 and the gun was confiscated.
