According to the source, the aides expect Trump to be a more polished, reserved candidate than the boisterous and    candidate that has been seen across the country on the campaign’s trail. The source says Clinton has done some prep with "bombastic Trump," but more have been with a more reserved candidate. Earlier in the process, Clinton spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump’s Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him and studied his positions with the hopes of getting under his skin with her familiarity.
