By this point, Eric Trump, Ivanka Trumpâ€™s brother, had already reached a breaking point with Lewandowski and expressed his frustrations about the campaign operations to his father, according to a senior campaign source.   It was ultimately Ivanka Trump who sat down with her father on Sunday and convinced him to let Lewandowski go     even offering an ultimatum of sorts about her own continued involvement with the campaign, according to sources with knowledge of this conversation.   The development suggests that Kushner    who is already involved in building a transition team for Donald Trump should he win the White House in November    could play an increasingly prominent role in guiding the Trump campaign.
