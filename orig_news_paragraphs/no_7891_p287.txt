Kevin Bray, who is on the ground volunteering for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, told Breitbart News he was asked to leave a polling location on Tuesday where he was passing out flyers. Bray was in Green County, Missouri at the James River Assembly of God where the public would cast votes on Super Tuesday. The County Clerk Shane Schoeller told Bray he had to leave the property since it was private property. Bray argued that he was 25 feet away from the door, obliging to the law, but that he shouldnâ€™t have to leave if the premises is being used as a polling site.
