It was jumping and dancing and fluttering and at one point strapped on black leotards and pink leggings and broke into an entire yoga routine with arched back hissing cat and downward dog and then stretching fruit tree. Mr. Kaine’s left eyebrow consumed so much of Mr. Kaine’s political face energy that it threatened to entirely shut down whole right side of Mr. Kaine’s face, which nearly went completely limp.
