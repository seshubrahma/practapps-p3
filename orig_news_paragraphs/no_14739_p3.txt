In the memoâ€™s conclusion, acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan wrote that if the requested changes were implemented, CBP "optimistically" would project a hiring increase of fewer than 450 border agents per year, from 485 annual hires to 917 annual hires.   " This assumes an increase in yield rates for the BPA entrance exam phase, the polygraph phase and the fitness test," he wrote.   Trump has requested 5, 000 more agents be hired, and McAleenan said the agency is already struggling with attrition.
