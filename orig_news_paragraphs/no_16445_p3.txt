The main Trump group, Rebuilding America Now, is not scheduled to file a campaign finance report this weekend, though the group’s chief strategist, Ken McKay, told MSNBC this week it had raised more than $10 million this year. A second Trump group, Great America PAC, raised only $2. 4 million this month, much of it from small donors. And an   PAC, Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC, got $2 million more from Bob Mercer, a reclusive   close to Trump’s new campaign leadership.
