Xi has been meticulously setting the stage for the 19th Party Congress this fall, where he will be "elected" for a second   term and where he is planning to put in place his choice of new members of China’s highest political body    the Politburo Standing Committee    that will allow him to extend his rule thereafter. For this to happen as planned, the one thing he needs in China’s most important international relationship is stability. Approaching his first meeting with a President notorious for spontaneous tweets, we can imagine his anxiety. But while giving Xi what he needed, Trump also set the agenda for the rest of the year to focus on what he wants: specifically, demonstrable movement in reducing China’s persistent bilateral trade deficit in ways that will allow Trump to claim that he has added good American jobs, and stopping North Korea’s nuclear advance.
