I will calculate each student’s grade both with and without exam 2, placing all of exam 2’s weight on the final exam when exam 2 is omitted. I will then take, for each student, the maximum of the two final grades (with and without the exam). Those maximum scores will then be used for the final curve. So, feel free to make either decision tomorrow (or today, if you are reading this in the AM).
