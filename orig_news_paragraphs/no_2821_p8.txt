Some of the party’s most promising candidates from those districts attended the gathering, which featured California chardonnays and "red to blue" cards distributed to donors identifying which candidates had the most potential to flip Republican seats. Mr. Luján, who heads the House Democratic campaign committee, said Mr. Trump’s toxic standing with women had put a range of additional Republican incumbents in jeopardy, according to several people who attended the presentation. Alixandria Lapp, a Democratic strategist who leads a "super PAC" focused on House races, told the group that the Bergen County, N. J. seat held by Representative Scott Garrett was the kind of Republican district where Democrats could make gains. Democratic strategists say they believe as many as a dozen districts could become competitive late in the race, depending on Mr. Trump’s fortunes.
