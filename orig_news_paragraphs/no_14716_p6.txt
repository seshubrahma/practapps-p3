Meanwhile, Trump conspicuously omitted mention of economic ties or global concerns like climate change and human rights. His worldview is a more extreme version of the approach taken during the first term of the George W. Bush administration when singular emphasis on military force, or "hard power," drew the United States into draining wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, squandered the global goodwill engendered by the   attacks, caused   to spike and frayed American alliances.   Despite an obsession with his own personal brand, Trump seems oblivious toward the brand value of what Joseph Nye has called the "soft power" that comes from projecting appealing aspects of American society and character abroad.   He is also indifferent to my own concept of "smart power," or the imperative to engage a broad range of tools of statecraft, from diplomacy to aid to private sector engagement to military intervention.
