Camille Paglia: I was wrong about Donald Trump, Well, Trump may still be a carnival barker, but he’s looking more and more like a president!   Along with most media pundits in the Northeast, I found it improbable if not impossible that Trump could survive his    cascade of    flubs, from carelessly categorizing Mexican immigrants as rapists to hallucinating about "thousands’ of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers from the mean streets of New Jersey.   Surely he would soon implode and pouf into fairy dust!
