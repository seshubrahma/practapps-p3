So far, hedge funds and their employees have contributed more than $173 million towards political campaigns for the 2016 election, more than triple the amount they gave during the last presidential election cycle in 2012, and more than eight times their contributions in 2008, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics (on which AFR based its report)   …     Including contributions from both hedge funds and private equity firms, Trump and groups supporting him have commanded $239, 250, a more than   increase from the mere $2, 054 he’d received in the first half of this year, according to the CFRP’s latest data. But at the same time, Clinton has managed to win another $20 million from those funds, bringing her total hedge fund and PE firm haul to $45. 2 million, up from the $25. 6 million reported over the summer.
