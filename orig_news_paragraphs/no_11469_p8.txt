It is possible, for example, for Cruz to win the state if he wins all of the "Safe Cruz" seats (18 delegates) and "Leans Cruz" seats (33 delegates) wins all or most of the " " seats (24 delegates) and either prevails in the statewide vote (13 delegates) or wins about half of the current "Leans Trump" seats. Cruz’s task in the state is made easier by the fact that there are so many places where he can compete with Trump. His best targets are in the Los Angeles and Inland Empire regions, where he has been polling well.
