The purpose of the hearing was to evaluate proposed changes to the program by the Department of Homeland Security, which are designed to address criticisms of the program. Some of the changes include raising the threshold of money required to benefit from the program, from $500, 000 to $1. 35 million for the minimum level, and to tighten the requirements to qualify as a "Targeted Employment Area"    to ensure that such designations are reserved for areas that actually would benefit high unemployment areas.   A Government Accountability Office report has found the program is susceptible to fraud, and found that the vast majority of investors combine unemployment data from multiple census areas to qualify for TEA, rather than a single census area affected by the project.
