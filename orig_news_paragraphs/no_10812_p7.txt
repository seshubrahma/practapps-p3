One D. C. alternate delegate who supports Rubio told Breitbart News on condition of anonymity that: If Rubio is not the nominee, and Trump becomes the nominee, asking Marco Rubio to be the V. P. candidate would unite the convention and the Party. Additionally, it will help to balance a New York, very moderate to liberal Republican with a Christian conservative V. P. If the convention and Party do not unify and come together, I do not see how we can win in November. If Trump is the nominee, I see Rubio as the best option to balance Trump’s northern, moderate to liberal version of Republican because of Rubio’s proven conservative record in the State House and the U. S. Senate.
