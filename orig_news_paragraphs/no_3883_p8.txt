Reagan and Meese made good on that philosophy when Reagan elevated Scalia to the Supreme Court. With Bork —  who was even more conservative than Scalia —  nominated to the Court, the Left saw the possibility of an eventual Supreme Court majority that would destroy their   march to achieve their agenda without earning the votes of the American people. Consequently, Sen. Ted Kennedy ( ) led the charge to destroy the unbelievably   Bork, purely because Bork was an unapologetic conservative who openly explained his judicial philosophy. The   Senate voted down Bork’s nomination.
