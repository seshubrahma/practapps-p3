Fast forward to this past week (September 19th) we see how true this is for journalists behaving like partisans and propagandists with axes to grind. Applebaum demonstrated a new level of apoplexy when she published an aggressive attack under her own byline in the Washington Post against the ruling Polish party she hates so much for vanquishing her husband and their cabal. In this article she attacks those in Poland she labels "conspiracy theorists" for doubting the integrity of the   investigation of the downed plane which was shrouded in secrecy and lacked transparency on every level. As all Poles know, the fuselage still has not been returned to Poland despite it being Polish property.
