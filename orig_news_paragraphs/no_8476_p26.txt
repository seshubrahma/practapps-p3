The game here is to create a ridiculously broad definition of "nationalism"  —   basically, if you think open borders and sanctuary cities are bad, or that America’s trade policies ought to benefit Americans, you’re in!   —   and then equate this ersatz "nationalism" with racism, and then progressives can feel good while sticking the fascist label on suburbanites and   Americans.   That’s how hideously    our elites have become: they think the very concept of responsible citizenship is now a hideous   idea, disturbingly reminiscent of Germany on the eve of Hitler. In Europe, the elite’s disdain for the prerogatives of its own citizens has created a migrant crisis that is tearing their societies apart.
