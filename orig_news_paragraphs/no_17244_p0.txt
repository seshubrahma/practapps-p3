Washington (CNN) Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein said early Sunday she would "escalate" her statewide recount efforts in Pennsylvania through a federal lawsuit, after announcing she would drop it.

But shortly after midnight Sunday Stein tweeted about plans to continue on the recount bid.
