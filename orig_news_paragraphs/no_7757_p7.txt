A spokesman for the Clinton campaign has not responded to a request for comment at this time. The Clintons have largely aimed to avoid answering when pressed on this matter, but at this time presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is pushing the issue extraordinarily hard. In an interview on Sean Hannityâ€™s program on Wednesday night, Trump is expected to use the term "rape" with regards to Bill Clinton for the first time. Trump has promised he will push the Clintons on these questions throughout the course of the election.
