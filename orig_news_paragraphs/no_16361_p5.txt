The book of Exodus admonishes us: "You shall not oppress a stranger (ger) for you know the feelings of the stranger, having yourselves been strangers in the land of Egypt " (Exodus 23:9). By ger, commonly translated from Hebrew as "stranger" or "sojourner," the Bible refers to an immigrant who is an outsider in the place where he now lives    a resident who has no family or clan to look after him, and who is therefore vulnerable to social and economic exploitation.
