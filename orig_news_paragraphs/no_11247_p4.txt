Indeed, as recently as just last month, Speaker Ryan ushered through Congress an omnibus spending bill that completely funded President Obama’s   2012 executive amnesty for DREAMers. His bill also gave federal grants to sanctuary cities, as well as funding the resettlement of illegal aliens within the United States, the release of criminal aliens, and tax credits for illegal aliens. Meanwhile, Ryan’s omnibus failed to provide funding for the mandatory completion of a     border fence that Congress promised the American people with the 2006 Secure Fence Act —  even as Speaker Ryan constructed his own   security fence around his posh mansion in Janesville, Wisconsin. Yet far from simply funding amnesty, Ryan’s omnibus funded an expansion of immigration levels.
