Last summer, the W. N. B. A. fined several players for wearing black   in support of Black Lives Matter at pregame practices following the next game after the fine was announced, some players refused to discuss basketball, instead using the postgame news conference to talk about police shootings. (The W. N. B. A. rescinded the fines soon after.) Last month, Breanna Stewart, the league’s reigning Rookie of the Year, attended the airport protest at LAX. Stephen Curry, arguably the world’s most popular basketball player, may be following the W. N. B. A. lead.
