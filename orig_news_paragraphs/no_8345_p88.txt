Clinton says she is for   tuition but she disagrees with Sanders on a few points. Clinton says Sandersâ€™s plan will force Governors like Scott Walker to spend millions to make public education free and she is "skeptical" that those like Walker will do so. Sanders says   kids deserve a free education like rich kids. He says free tuition at universities should be "a right" for all Americans.
