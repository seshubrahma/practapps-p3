Democrats on the Senate committee charged with reviewing Ms. Chaoâ€™s nomination by   Donald J. Trump made it clear that they have no objections to her, suggesting that she will be easily confirmed in a full Senate vote. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the top Democrat on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, praised Ms. Chao for acting with "grace and excellence" in her previous government service. " I certainly look forward to you, in this new administration, doing the same," he said.
