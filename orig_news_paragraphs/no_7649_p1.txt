I do not, however, support and vehemently oppose the blatant   of the cause of the tragedy in Orlando. [Hillary Clinton tells us lax gun control laws are the root cause of the Orlando tragedy in which 50 of Americaâ€™s young adults and children were barbarically murdered. Nothing could be further from the truth.   Blaming lax gun control laws is not only dead wrong, it will cost more American lives because it hides the real cause of the Orlando tragedy from the American people.
