Donald J. Trump vowed during the presidential campaign to take military action against Iranian ships that approached American vessels in a threatening manner. " With Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldnâ€™t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water," Mr. Trump said at a rally in September. There were 35 close encounters between American and Iranian vessels in 2016, most of which occurred during the first half of the year, and 23 encounters in 2015.
