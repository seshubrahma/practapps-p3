That helps explain why Mr. Trump’s support among Republican voters remains quite high, even though the first few months of his presidency have been plagued by scandals and political setbacks, and even though his overall national approval ratings are now very low. He has been careful to recast every potential scandal and policy struggle as a battle against the Democrats and other outside groups. Mr. Trump has insisted, for instance, that the F. B. I. investigation into his campaign staffers’ contacts with Russia is meaningless "fake news," and that the real issue is whether President Obama wiretapped him before the election. (There is no evidence thus far that any such wiretapping took place.)
