The Koch network, uncomfortable with Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposals on trade and immigration, sat out the presidential election entirely, turning its advertising dollars and activists to   races. Both the Club for Growth and the Koch network also played a critical role in killing a proposal backed by Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In March, as the repeal vote approached, two   groups pledged to spend upward of $1 million on ads defending any Republican who voted against the replacement legislation. Now, some of the same groups are organizing visits to lawmakers and paying for an online advertising campaign attacking the border tax proposal.
