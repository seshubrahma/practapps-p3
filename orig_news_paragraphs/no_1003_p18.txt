Gett, a   app popular in Europe, moved in last year to the same floor, offering a technology training bar for drivers to get help using its app along with signing bonuses, free coffee and treats. Other   apps have set up driver centers elsewhere in the city: Juno has a center near La Guardia Airport that serves about 150 drivers a day Via has a center in Manhattan that, among other things, offers free parking for new drivers. But leave it to Uber to open a sprawling center in the Falchi building, replacing a smaller center in the neighborhood.
