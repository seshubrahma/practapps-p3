Donald Trump tried to refocus his campaign after a rough few days. He made his most sustained attack on Hillary Clinton, calling her "a   liar" in a speech that included many inaccurate and misleading statements. Mrs. Clinton, who on Tuesday criticized Mr. Trump’s business and economic ideas, laid out her vision for the U. S. economy. And the Libertarian Party’s candidates, former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, held a town hall tonight.
