Media Research Center president Brent Bozell called on Univision to remove Jorge Ramos from his position after the Latino anchor called on fellow journalists to end their impartial coverage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in an   published in Time Magazine and an appearance Thursday night on Fox News’s Kelly File. ["By deciding to openly take sides and urging all journalists to be as unethical as he is in his coverage of this year ’s U. S. presidential election, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos has rendered himself incapable of serving as a credible, impartial news anchor for Univision ’s millions of viewers," Bozell said in a statement.
