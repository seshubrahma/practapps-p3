Among voters not affiliated with either major party, Trump leads by 13 points, but 27% of these voters either like another candidate or are undecided. Perhaps more troubling for Clinton is that she now trails by 17 points among white voters after the murder last week of five white policemen in Dallas which Trump has attributed to   rhetoric by President Obama, Clinton and others. This is a noticeably wider gap than we have seen previously, while her support among black and other minority voters remains unchanged.
