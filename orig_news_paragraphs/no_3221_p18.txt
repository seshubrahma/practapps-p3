Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection) the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline. The law is clear in the power it gives the President, in the statute cited above  —   8 U. S. C. 1182( f). Like the Ninth Circuit decision before, the Hawaii judge goes out of his way to pretend this statute does not exist. Indeed, it is never addressed in any real way in the court’s entire opinion (much of which appeared   prior to the oral argument).
