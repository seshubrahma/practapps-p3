" Pence said of North Korea: For more than a generation, North Korea’s leaders have sought to develop nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles on which to deliver them.   They have impoverished their people and embittered the region in their pursuit of this dangerous goal.   For more than two decades, from the Agreed Framework of 1994, the   Talks from year 2003 to ’09, to the strategic patience of the recent past, the United States and our allies have worked to tirelessly to peacefully dismantle North Korea’s nuclear program and alleviate the suffering of its people.
