The Pope avoided the question of immigration policy, stressing rather the pastoral responsibility of priests and bishops to care for the faith of those who are far from home. He invited the Mexican bishops not to forget members of their flock who have gone abroad, insisting rather that they need hearts "capable of following these men and women and reaching them beyond the borders. " "Strengthen the communion with your brothers of the North American episcopate, so that the maternal presence of the Church can keep alive the roots of the faith of these men and women, as well as the motivation for their hope and the power of their charity," he said. Francis suggested that much of what the Church has to offer is its understanding of the universal brotherhood of all humanity under the fatherhood of God, asking the bishops to witness together with the U. S. bishops that "the Church is the custodian of a unifying vision of humanity and that she cannot consent to being reduced to a mere human â€˜resource.
