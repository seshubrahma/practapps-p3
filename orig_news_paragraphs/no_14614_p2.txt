The announcement will come a day before Trump’s first joint congressional address on Tuesday, when he is expected to lay out his agenda, legislative priorities and budget proposals in greater detail.    Trump is first expected to address the budget outline when he meets at the White House on Monday with governors from around the country.    The broad strokes of the budget proposal described Sunday to CNN are in keeping with Trump’s policy proposals during the campaign, when he called for substantial hikes to military spending and vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare.    The proposed cuts to agencies like the EPA also do not come as a surprise.
