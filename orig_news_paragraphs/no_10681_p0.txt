As Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) gains on Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, Democrats will have their final debate before the Iowa caucuses on Sunday evening in South Carolina.   Clinton and her surrogates have attacked Sanders on gun control and health care in recent weeks as enthusiasm for Clinton’s candidacy has waned. Clinton will likely sharpen her attacks against Sanders tonight and may show Sanders what a politician who wants to actually win the nomination looks like. It will be interesting to see if Sanders finally draws sharp contrasts with Clinton tonight and attacks her ties to Wall Street while raising questions about her husband’s alleged sexual indiscretions and whether Hillary played a role in covering them up and silencing her husband’s victims.
