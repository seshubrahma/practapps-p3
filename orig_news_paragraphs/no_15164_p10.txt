The US has recently leaned on China    North Korea’s main ally    to apply pressure to Pyongyang to curtail its nuclear ambitions. Trump held a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month and has hoped to use trade as a negotiating tool for Xi’s cooperation on North Korea. The Trump administration has touted some successes on that front in the past week, including the suspension of coal shipments from North Korea to China.
