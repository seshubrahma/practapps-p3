Polling is sketchy in the state, but Trump is thought to be favored to grab Arizona’s 58 delegates. It is unlikely either Cruz or Kasich can prevail in the state while each is on the ballot. Were Trump to somehow lose both states on Tuesday, it would be a serious blow to his efforts to secure the necessary delegates ahead of the GOP convention in June. The likliest outcome of Tuesday  —   Trump and Cruz winning all of the delegates in Arizona and Utah, respectively  —   would leave the race essentially unchanged heading into the final states.
