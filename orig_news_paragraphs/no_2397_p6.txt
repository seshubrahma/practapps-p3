Of all of these states, the only one where Mr. Trump has really been close in the polls is Nevada. But Nevada is also the state where we know the most about the results because of early voting, and it hasn’’t brought good news for Mr. Trump. Democrats have largely replicated the turnout from 2012 (when President Obama ultimately won the state by about seven points) thanks in no small part to a strong turnout among Hispanic voters. Many analysts, like the Nevada politics guru Jon Ralston, have concluded that Mr. Trump has basically lost the state already.
