[A successful business woman, mother, and star, Ivanka has become one of her father’s most effective surrogates, especially with women. Ivanka spent several hours listening to the concerns of voters and touted her father’s education and economic policies during a whirlwind tour around the state. Her father will hold two rallies in North Carolina on Thursday as several polls show Trump recapturing the lead in this critical battleground state.   An overflow crowd greeted Ivanka during her first stop at the Mecklenburg County GOP Headquarters in Charlotte.
