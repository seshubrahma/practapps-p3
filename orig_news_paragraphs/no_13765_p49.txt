Once again, I appreciate my friend and family ’s support more than I can say. On the line, I met some of my temporary cellmates, including a man who’d been convicted of   murder for stabbing his wife in the neck after a domestic disturbance and another young man who told me he had been brought in on seven felony charges and was facing a bond of $300, 000. This was the situation I found myself in for filming a demonstration and facing a charge that was so minor that the bond was $250.
