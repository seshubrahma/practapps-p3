Already, the Senate judiciary committee and House oversight committee have been stonewalled on their requests for documents, particularly for the memos FBI Director James Comey reportedly wrote about his conversations with Trump about the Russia investigation. And leaders of the Senate intelligence committee have asked to meet with Mueller to detail the path ahead. On Thursday, the FBI declined to provide documents to the oversight committee, saying in a letter that the bureau was undergoing "appropriate consultation" with Mueller. The letter prompted a sharp response from House oversight chairman Jason Chaffetz, who told acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe that the committeeâ€™s investigation is "central" to its oversight responsibilities.
