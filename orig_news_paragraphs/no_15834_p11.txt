Trump’s first talks at NATO headquarters in Brussels had to be shifted to the afternoon to accommodate Merkel’s schedule with Obama, according to people familiar with the meeting’s planning. This week, Obama met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after delivering remarks in Montreal that warned against authoritarianism    remarks that were seen as veiled jabs at Trump. Both Merkel and Trudeau participated in     meetings last month in Sicily, where Trump was isolated on issues like climate change. Republicans close to Trump say Obama’s active schedule with foreign leaders has caught the President’s eye as he works to develop his own relationships with world leaders.
