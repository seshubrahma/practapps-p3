A ballot initiative she led to establish vouchers in Michigan failed in 2000. The next year, she established the Great Lakes Education Project, which became an ardent proponent of charter school expansion, and has donated generously to candidates who have supported it.

Even Republican supporters of charter schools say the law has allowed failing charter schools to expand or replicate.
