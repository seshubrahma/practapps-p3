When signing his action calling for a   lobbying ban for administration officials, Trump referred to a ban imposed by his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Like Trump, Obama campaigned on a vision of Washington reform, promising to target the revolving door of political service and lobbying jobs. Once in office, he ordered a   ban on administration officials from lobbying. Trump said on Saturday Obamaâ€™s ban was insufficient.
