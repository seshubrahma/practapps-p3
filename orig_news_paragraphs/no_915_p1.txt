It is the first time that someone associated with Mr. Trump has confirmed any type of contact with Guccifer 2. 0, which claimed to be a Romanian hacker and took credit for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. But Mr. Stone insisted in an interview that the contact had been brief and involved nothing more than the exchange of a few direct messages, well after the party committee had been hacked. " Even if he is a Russian agent, my cursory exchange with him happens after he releases the D. N. C. stuff," Mr. Stone said on Saturday.
