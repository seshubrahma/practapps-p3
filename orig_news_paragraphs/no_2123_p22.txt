Mr. Trump may have business interests around the world, but his power is concentrated at a single Midtown Manhattan address: 725 Fifth Avenue. With a gleaming exterior that shoots to the sky, a lobby decked with marble and a collection of   tenants, Trump Tower is his primary residence as well as his companyâ€™s headquarters. To get to work, Mr. Trump steps onto the private elevator in his gilded   penthouse, presses 26 and waits a matter of seconds. When the doors open, he is at his office, surrounded by Mr. Garten, Mr. Weisselberg and other top executives.
