Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart is set to join The Late Show with Stephen Colbert during its live coverage of the Republican National Convention this week in what could be part of a push to boost the CBS   programâ€™s disastrous ratings. [According to the Hollywood Reporter, Stewart will join Colbert on his program during its live coverage this week and will appear on the show Monday. It was not immediately clear how often or in what role Stewart would participate on the CBS flagship   program.   As Breitbart News previously reported, Colbert is set for two full weeks of live coverage beginning with the Republican National Convention this week and continuing with the Democratic convention in Philadelphia later this month.
