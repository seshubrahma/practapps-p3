The Trump team needs to better stay on the offense with their reform agenda, take out the trash, and get on with governing," said Scott Reed, the top political strategist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, in a typical critique. Mr. Trumpâ€™s aides were heartened by his relative calm even amid the flap around Mr. Sessions. And he stayed on message during his appearance on the Gerald R. Ford and on Friday in an appearance in Florida, declining to weigh in then as new reports emerged about previously undisclosed meetings between additional advisers and the Russian ambassador. Mr. Trump is not one to spare the blame when he has hit difficult patches in the past, and his rebuke of Mr. Sessions reflected that.
