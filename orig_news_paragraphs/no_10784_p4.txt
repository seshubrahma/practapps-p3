Claire Williamson ’17 said it became harder to express conservative viewpoints during the controversies surrounding Calhoun College and the title"master" last fall. Students who did not hold the "popular vocal opinion" of renaming the college and changing the title were seen not only as wrong, she said, but as bad people. " I would say it’s a frustrating   to be a   moderate or conservative on campus," Williamson said.
