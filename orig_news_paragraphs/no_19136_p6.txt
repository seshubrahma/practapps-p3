This week’s Washington Post report, citing tax records,   revealed Trump had not made a single donation to his charity   since 2008 and sometimes used money from others through the   foundation to pay off legal expenses. " ’    The money relating to those expenses, which reportedly amounted   to $258, 000 from the Trump Foundation, may have violated   " " laws that prohibit nonprofit leaders from using   charity money for   or the benefit of their     businesses, according to The Post. ’ ’   Trump, according to the report, also spent roughly $50, 000   of foundation money on a pair of portraits, advertisements for   his hotel chain, and a signed football helmet.
