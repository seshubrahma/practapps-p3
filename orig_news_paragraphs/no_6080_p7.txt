All I can say is, in this case consistency exists.   Ignore the apoplectic left for a moment and realize that success by the Trump administration is their greatest fear. Since the election of Barack Obama they have lost over 1, 000 elected seats  â€”   state legislatures, house, senate and governorships combined. The party leadership is now firmly controlled by the progressive left and their infighting is over who is more left as I observe the battle for the Democratic National Committee chair.
