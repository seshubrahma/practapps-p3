A spokesman for Kelly declined to comment for this story. Andrew McCabe will likely remain acting director until a permanent director is nominated, according to one source familiar with the process.    Earlier Tuesday, Sen. Jon Cornyn, who was interviewed over the weekend by Sessions and Rosenstein, announced he was withdrawing his name from consideration.   "Now more than ever, the country needs a   independent FBI director," Cornyn said in a statement.
