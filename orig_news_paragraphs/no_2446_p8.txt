4. Hey, I find it really ironic that all the groups that think they have a   mandate to enforce "tolerance" are so intolerant of controversial views and people that run counter to their own. Maybe the moral and ethical standards of Mr. Bannon are not that repugnant in the end, like Trump who has said some unfortunate things, as has everyone, that he regrets? If political correctness gets pushed to the maximum, business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing.
