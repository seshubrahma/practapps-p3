The bloodsuckers in the Sacramento legislature who get paid $178 a day in per diem funds on top of their bloated salaries just for walking in the door to their job every day are not freeloaders. No, you  —   the burdened,   taxpayer are the freeloader for simply asking the government of California be more fiscally responsible with the money they already have instead of stealing more of your money without your consent to pay for programs that are already funded but have been raided for pet projects and personal enrichment. Brown’s comments on taxpayers are not the first time he has shown intolerance to people struggling under California’s tax and regulatory burdens.
