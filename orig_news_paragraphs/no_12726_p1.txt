In addition to the editorial, the editors crafted a fake "front page in Donald Trump’s America" edition of the Boston Globe dated Sunday April 9th, 2017.   In their editorial, the editors seem to propose that Party elites use Sen. Ted Cruz as a cat’  to deny Trump the nomination, then ultimately give the nomination to someone who is not currently running   —   such as Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney. Although the paper seems to advocate giving Mitt Romney the nomination, the paper endorsed Barack Obama over Romney in the 2012 election.
