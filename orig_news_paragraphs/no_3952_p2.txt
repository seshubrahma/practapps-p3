According to the video, they allegedly planned to place explosive "stink bomb" devices at the party and, if those failed, to trigger the fire sprinkler system, forcing attendees to evacuate outside in cold weather conditions.   One activist is also heard on the video to threaten the city government of Washington, D. C. and the police: The message has to be, we do not recognize the city government either. If you try to close us down we will look for your house, we will burn it. We will physically fight the police if they try to steal one of our places.
