The Freedom Caucus finds itself in Trump’s crosshairs after members of the group torpedoed Republicans’ health care bill last week, refusing to vote "yes," and killing an early attempt to fulfill one of his campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare because many believed it did not go far enough. During the Republican primary, Trump was viewed favorably by Republicans who   as "conservative" and "very conservative," according to an October 2015 Gallup poll, the same ideological space occupied by the Freedom Caucus. According to a 2015 Pew study of 36 known members, the group is further to the right than the rest of House Republicans. They were also more popular than Trump in November, winning by larger margins.
