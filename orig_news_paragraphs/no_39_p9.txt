A fragile consensus against torture, said Jos√© Miguel Vivanco, the regional director for the Americas for Human Rights Watch, could be shattered "when you have the White House openly advocating for torture. " During the campaign, Mr. Trump declared that "torture works," and he vowed to "immediately" reinstate techniques like waterboarding because "we have to beat the savages" of the Islamic State, who "deserve" such treatment even if it is fruitless. Since the election, Mr. Trump has indicated that he might be reconsidering his position, citing the firm stance against torture by James N. Mattis, his Pentagon nominee.
