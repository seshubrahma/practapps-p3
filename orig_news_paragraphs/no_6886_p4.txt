â€”   comes one the same day that a group of French soldiers foiled a terror attack in Paris. Shooting the Egyptian citizen assailant as he charged the patrol with a large knife, the soldiers hit the   killer five times in the stomach and leg. In 2016 a French Catholic priest was martyred by beheading by an Islamist killer as he celebrated mass in his parish Church.    State killers have launched a number of other attacks in France over the past two years, including the murder by stabbing of a senior police officer and his wife, the Nice attacks, and Bataclan bombings.
