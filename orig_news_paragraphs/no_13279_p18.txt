I didn’t need an invitation,  —   Kirstie Alley (@kirstiealley) August 19, 2016,   As Breitbart News reported, President Obama spent time during his annual Martha’s Vineyard vacation golfing with Seinfeld   and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Larry David on Thursday. Meanwhile, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was in Louisiana on Friday to meet with flood victims and hand out food and supplies. Obama received heavy criticism from Trump as well as from local paper the Baton Rouge Advocate, which penned an editorial calling on President Obama to cut his annual summer vacation short to meet with victims of the flood, which the Red Cross has called the greatest natural disaster in the U. S. since 2012’s Hurricane Sandy.
