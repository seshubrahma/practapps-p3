As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt created a "federalism unit" in his office, explicitly designed to fight President Obama’s health care law and environmental regulations. " You could see from him an increasing effort to delegate environmental regulations away from the federal government and towards the states," said Ronald Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. Although Mr. Obama’s climate rules were not completed until 2015, Mr. Pruitt and a handful of other attorneys general began planning as early as 2014 for a coordinated legal effort to fight them.
