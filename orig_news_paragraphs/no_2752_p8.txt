The rising insecurity poses a problem for   Donald J. Trump, who has offered few insights into how he intends to approach the battle against   and crime in the hemisphere. His campaign language suggested a strategy of containment, its centerpiece being the construction of a wall along the American border to thwart drugs and illegal immigration. Some analysts worry that, as part of this approach, Mr. Trump may withdraw the limited American support for initiatives in Mexico that seek to strengthen the rule of law, fortify state institutions and repair communities damaged by crime. But a   American approach may only give more space to violent criminal groups in Mexico and elsewhere, destabilizing the region, analysts said.
