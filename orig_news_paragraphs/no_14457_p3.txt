Celebrity chef José Andrés, who is locked in a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for pulling his restaurant from the Trump hotel project in Washington over Trump’s   immigrant rhetoric, announced he would close most of his restaurants Thursday as part of the protest. The Trump International Hotel did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for Thursday.   Schools were preparing as well. A bilingual charter school in Northwest DC planned to close, and DC public schools were preparing for possible walkouts.
