Clinton was advised in 1998 to take   medications to prevent deep vein thrombosis blood clots when she traveled on   flights, Bardack wrote. Blood clots can be a serious health risk for travelers, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They can form in the deep veins of the legs when a person sits still for an extended period, such as during long flights. The problem turns serious if the blood clot breaks off and travels to other parts of the body, such as the lungs.
