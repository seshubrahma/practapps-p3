Price said this week he still likes the idea of   pools.   Research shows, though, they are limited in their ability to help give "insurance for everybody," as Trump said he wanted to do. A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found prior to Obamacare, the states with   pools offered coverage that was expensive, and only a small fraction of the people who needed the coverage actually got it.    Price told Gupta that while they did not work "terribly well" in the past, it’s because they weren’t funded to the "degree they should be" and the pools weren’t big enough to be cost effective.
