Duterte is facing a case before the International Criminal Court for allegedly using "death squads" to curb   violence as mayor of his native Davao City, a position he held for 22 years before assuming the presidency. He has claimed to have personally participated in these death squads, wandering the city at night and shooting people dead. President Trump invited Duterte to the White House during a telephone conversation this weekend, a move that baffled observers who have noted Duterteâ€™s consistent   rhetoric since taking office in June 2016, as well as his record of supporting extrajudicial killings vigilante justice against drug criminals. The two world leaders reportedly engaged in a "very friendly conversation" in which Trump offered to host Duterte in the White House.
