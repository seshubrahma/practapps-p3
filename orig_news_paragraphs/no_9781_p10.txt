I am upset about the disrespect for law enforcement and the killing of the innocent. I am upset about the tax code. I am upset about an educational system that gets its agenda from the likes of Bill Ayers. I am upset about the lack of clarity in a foreign policy that has made our country weak and on the road to decay.
