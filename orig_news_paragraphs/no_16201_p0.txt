 (CNN) The US Secret Service is investigating an informal adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign after he called for Hillary Clinton’s execution. Al Baldasaro, a New Hampshire state representative, told radio host Jeff Kuhner Tuesday that Clinton "should be put in the firing line and shot for treason." "The U. S. Secret Service is aware of this matter and will conduct the appropriate investigation," said Shawn L. Holtzclaw, a spokesman for the Secret Service.
