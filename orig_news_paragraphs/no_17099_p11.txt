Americans have a right to a president who not only avoids corruption by personal conflict of interest but the appearance of corruption. This is true even if Trump ignored any   in making all of his decisions, and even if he were to order his subordinates to do the same.   US law requires every other employee of the executive branch, except the president and vice president, to sell assets that create conflicts with official duties or to recuse themselves from all government matters that affect those financial interests. Every other president has voluntarily complied with this law, even though not legally required to do so.
