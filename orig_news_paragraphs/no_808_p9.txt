Pyle, an adviser to the Trump transition and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have worked for years to undermine   policies. Mr. Trump has cited Mr. Pyle’s group as being influential in shaping his energy and climate proposals, including his campaign pledge to withdraw from the Paris deal. " The two greatest obstacles to a Clexit (climate exit from U. N. Paris agreement) are probably Ivanka and Tillerson," wrote Marc Morano, a former Republican Senate staff member who now runs Climate Depot, a     website that promotes the denial of climate science, in an email.
