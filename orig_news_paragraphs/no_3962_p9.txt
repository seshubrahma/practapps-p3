The Post detailed the evolution of Soros’s financial backing: While Elias will not discuss the funding for his project, Soros’s spokesman Michael Vachon said Elias approached them with a set of proposals for challenging state restrictions that would be helpful "up and down the ballot.

And they agreed with Elias that there was work to be done beyond what the civil rights groups, to which Soros also contributes, were doing.
