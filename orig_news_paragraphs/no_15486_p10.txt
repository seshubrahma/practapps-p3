In this respect, the issue is not whether the public supports or opposes what he has done, but that Americans will quickly move on to the next story. President Trump will do everything in his power to make that happen with more outrageous statements and actions.

That tactic worked well in the campaign, during which voters could barely keep up with every new Trumpism.
