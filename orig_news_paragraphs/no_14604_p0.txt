ATLANTA (CNN) Democrats selected former Labor Secretary Tom Perez over Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison as their new chairman on Saturday, concluding a hotly contested race to lead a battered party as it tries to channel the   Trump energy of its base into an electoral rebound.   Perez defeated Ellison in a   vote among the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s 435 members who cast ballots Saturday.   It took two rounds of voting to select a winner after Perez found himself just one vote shy in the first ballot.
