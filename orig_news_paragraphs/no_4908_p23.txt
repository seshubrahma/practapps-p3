In anticipation of a U. S. troop increase, NATO members have already been considering increasing their troop numbers also. McMaster, who was one of the architects of the Iraq war troop surge and headed an   task force in Afghanistan, is described as the "driving force behind" the more kinetic strategy, according to the Washington Post. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also backs the plan, according to the Post. McMaster is also connected to masterminds of the surge, former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, and retired Army Lt. Gen. Jack Keane.
