Whether intentionally or not, Donald Trump is evoking classic   themes that have historically been used against Jews and still reverberate today," Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the   League, a group that fights discrimination, said in a statement. Mr. Greenblatt said the group feared that white supremacists might see the comments as tacit encouragement. " Mr. Trump focused on the very issues and themes that obsess conspiratorial  : They believe that there is an elite group of Jews who control the media, the government, and banking, and who are trying to destroy white America," he said.
