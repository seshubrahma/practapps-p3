Last year, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a suicide attack south of Damascus near the Sayeda Zeinab shrine, which is revered by Shiites. Also Saturday, Mr. Assad said in an interview with the Hong   Phoenix TV that his military planned to target the city of Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic Stateâ€™s   caliphate, but that any foreign troops entering Syria without permission would be considered "invaders. "   forces backed by the United States are also advancing on Raqqa. When asked how he felt about President Trump, Mr. Assad said he was optimistic because Mr. Trump had said that he intended to step up the fight against the Islamic State.
