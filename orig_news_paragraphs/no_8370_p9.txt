He praised Trump’s immigration team, and looked forward to how a President Trump might repair decades of damage to America’s immigration system: I tell you this in all sincerity: Donald Trump has the best, most seasoned, and knowledgeable group of people advising him on immigration policy issues, of any Republican candidate to run for President, probably in American history. He’s got people who really grasp what Obama has done, how to turn it around, how to fix it, working with point people in Congress like Jeff Sessions.   If Trump were to win, he’d be in a position really advance some real, meaningful, true immigration reform that would restore the rule of law,   the American people to determine how many people can come in, and how the rule of law and the borders are controlled.
