As Gawande explains:  States with higher ratios of   physicians have lower rates of general mortality, infant mortality, and mortality from specific conditions such as heart disease and stroke.   Other studies found that people with a   physician as their usual source of care had lower subsequent   mortality rates than others, regardless of their initial health. All right, so how might all this be reflected in a   health plan?   We can start by recalling the Republican critique of Obamacare and, before that, of Clintoncare â€”  that being the failed effort by Hillary in the 1990s.
