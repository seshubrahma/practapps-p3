Obama is   as he keeps telling us. Now is the time for him to show just how different he is from the presumptive Republican nominee who excels at praising himself. He should admit his Syria policy failed and move quickly to take the advice of his own State Department officials and achieve much, including removing the onerous baggage of his foreign policy failures from Hillary Clinton.    If he launches the kind of limited operations suggested by the memo, he would hand Clinton instead of the current calamity a policy that has the potential for putting Syria on track for a possible solution, and would have the added benefit of being more defensible on the campaign trail.
