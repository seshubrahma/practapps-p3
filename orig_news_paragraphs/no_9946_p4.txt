That issue, along with a recent controversy over the police shooting of an unarmed man by a Chinese American police officer in New York, has opened fissures in the Chinese American community between older, more progressive generations and newer, more conservative arrivals. " You do have an undercurrent of conservatives in the Chinese American community, specifically among   Chinese," said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor of political science at UC Riverside. His research shows that   Chinese Americans are more likely to embrace conservative views on issues such as affirmative action and race in general.
