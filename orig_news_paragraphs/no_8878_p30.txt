I refuse to believe for a second that Sidney knew anything about this, but in the week that we talked, the White House "found" and released Ms. Willey’s correspondence with Clinton. I say "found" because when these same letters had been subpoenaed in the Jones case in January 1998, they couldn’t be located anywhere. Just another day in Clinton’s Washington. Speaking to Klein, Willey demanded that Hillary Clinton take a lie detector test to answer for what she says the former First Lady did to her and other women.
