This innovation manifests itself in the latest biopharmaceuticals, medical devices and surgical techniques, as well as rapidly evolving health IT and quality and outcomes measurements. Because our policymakers avoided price controls and tried to create competitive marketplaces for many of these products, weâ€™ve driven down prices for consumers and expanded options for patients     all while promoting innovation. We also have a tradition of valuing choice in our health care system.
