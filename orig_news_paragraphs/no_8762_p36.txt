The ability to set aside funds will be particularly helpful to women,   workers and minorities, who are statistically more likely to reduce time working outside the home in order to provide unpaid care. PROPOSAL: The Trump plan will guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave by amending the existing unemployment insurance (UI) that companies are required to carry. The benefit would apply only when employers donâ€™t offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the program so that taxes are not raised.
