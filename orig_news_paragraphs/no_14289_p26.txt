Attorneys involved with the case worked with State Department officials to help the family obtain an emergency waiver to navigate around the ban.   Mushkaad Abdi, 4, Somalia, Samira Dahir hadnâ€™t seen her    daughter, Mushkaad, since she was a few months old. Dahir had just gotten a visa for herself and her two other daughers when Mushkaad was born. She would have had to start the immigration process over if she remained in Somalia, so she decided instead to leave Mushkaad with a family friend and bring her two other daughters to the United States.
