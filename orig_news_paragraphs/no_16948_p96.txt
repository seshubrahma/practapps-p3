But let’s examine the jobs situation Trump outlined. Trump didn’t specify a time period so we will look what’s happened over the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. There are now 144. 7 million workers in America, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s up from 134. 1 million at the start of Obama’s administration in January 2009 and from 132. 7 million when Bush took office in January 2001.
