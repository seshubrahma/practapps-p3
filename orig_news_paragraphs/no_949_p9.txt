Another judge added six months to Maher â€™s sentence for "verbally assaulting a public officer while on duty" after he demanded that the police remove his handcuffs while in court for a 2014 appeal. Maher spent almost all of that period sealed in a small cell in a   wing at Tora Prison, a notorious complex on the outskirts of Cairo, built during British rule, that houses about 2, 500 political prisoners and common criminals. Hidden behind    walls, the vast compound encompasses seven prison blocks, ranging from a   facility for policemen and judges convicted of taking bribes to the supermax "Scorpion Prison," a labyrinth of cells largely reserved for Islamists and April 6 leaders.
