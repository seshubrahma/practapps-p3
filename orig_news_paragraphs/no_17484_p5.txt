I was just an    kid back then, one whose father had moved to Moscow to oversee the first joint   filling stations in the country. My dad thought wise to enroll me at the only middle school he believed would give me a good international background and also allow me to pursue my   learning.   I was one of only three Italians attending the school. My two best friends    Kim and Nicky    were both American.
