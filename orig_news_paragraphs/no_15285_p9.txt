Japan won’t tolerate repeated provocative actions by North Korea and asked the Japanese public to remain calm, Suga said. Tokyo’s subway operator temporarily halted train service Saturday morning after the missile launch, the Tokyo Metro said.   All trains stopped running for 10 minutes, then resumed service after it was confirmed the launch had no impact on Japan’s safety. An estimated 13, 000 people were affected, an official said.
