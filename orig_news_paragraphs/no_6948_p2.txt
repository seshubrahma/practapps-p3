According to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Independent, the    Revenant star and fellow actor Tobey Maguire enlisted the services of beautician   Hamilton, who made the   trip from Sydney, Australia to Los Angeles to ensure the stars’ brows were just right for the big show. While the artists’s eyebrow services are reported to cost a relatively affordable $200, Hamilton  —   whose previous clients are said to include Beyoncé, George Clooney and Kim Kardashian   —   told the Herald that when traveling for work, her costs are covered by her clients.
