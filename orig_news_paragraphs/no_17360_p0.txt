Washington (CNN)   Donald Trump is not planning to divest from his businesses but will also not be involved with his companies when he enters the White House, the Wall Street Journal’s Monica Langley told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Thursday night. Speaking on "Anderson Cooper 360," Langley said that even though Trump’s adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. are involved in transition meetings right now, once Trump enters the White House, they’ll focus on the businesses. But, she predicted, Trump’s family is not going to sell any of the properties or real estate in their businesses.
