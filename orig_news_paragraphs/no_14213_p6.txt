But, as CNN’s Rene Marsh and Chris Isidore reported, a 2014 State Department report found that only 3, 900 workers would be required to build the pipeline over a year’s time.   If the work is spread over two years, 1, 950 people would get jobs directly related to the pipeline’s construction. Once built, the pipeline would only require 35   employees to run it.   TransCanada, the company that has proposed building the pipeline, does not dispute those figures.
