Thus, the additional 65, 000 Syrian refugees would come on top of the roughly 33, 000 refugees and asylees the U. S. already admits from the Middle East each year. Adding in Clinton’s refugee admissions from across the Muslim world, this means that under Clinton’s plan, the U. S. would admit at least 105, 000 thousand refugees from the Muslim world in a single year, based on data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Foreman similarly did not seem to grasp that these refugee numbers are annual figures. If elected President, Clinton would presumably be in office for more than one year.
