At the C. I. A. there was a sense that Mr. Pompeo’s nomination signaled an end to Mr. Trump’s   dismissals of accusations about Russian meddling, and a readiness to start taking intelligence seriously. A new administration often brings an infusion of energy and ideas, and most at the agency are eager to get to work under Mr. Pompeo, according to a current C. I. A. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they could not be quoted by name. But there are already suggestions from some corners of the Trump camp about a need to reorganize the intelligence community, which has stoked concerns at the C. I. A. of a "hostile takeover" by leaders who want political cheerleading, not cleareyed analysis, Mr. Lowenthal said. How Mr. Pompeo gets along with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, is likely to prove crucial.
