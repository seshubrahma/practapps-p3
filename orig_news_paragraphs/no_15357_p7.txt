Australian residents are able to see doctors and optometrists, as well as receive some minor surgeries, usually free of charge. The partial cost of pharmaceuticals is also covered under the separate Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Residents get hospital treatment at no charge, although you canâ€™t choose your doctor. It is partly funded by a 2% levy on all taxpayers, although that can be reduced or even waived for people earning low incomes.
