Eyewitness accounts   The attack began just after 10 p. m. on London Bridge, just north of an area replete with cafes and bars, and near the London Bridge rail and underground interchange. Witness Mark Roberts, who was on the bridge at the time of the attack, told CNN the van was traveling south across the River Thames at a high rate of speed and was swerving as it struck several people, knocking one person "about 20 feet into the air.
