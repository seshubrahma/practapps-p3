Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton slammed Republican rival Donald Trump for what she called "sexually predatory" behavior during a fundraising trip to California, which included events in Los Angeles and San Francisco on Thursday, as well as a surprise visit to a San Francisco campaign office, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. [The former Secretary of State, whose husband’s own "sexually predatory" habits are a matter of public record, sought to tarnish Trump, praising Michelle Obama’s speech Thursday in New Hampshire, in which the current First Lady became emotional as she described her negative reaction to Trump’s   comments on a 2005 Access Hollywood video in which he joked about groping women.   (As numerous critics pointed out, the Obamas frequently heard similar comments from the   artists whom they have fêted at the White House, whose lyrics feature frequent mysogyny and sexual references.)
