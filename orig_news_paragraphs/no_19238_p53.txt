Not only are there a lot of outsiders intervening but   this also involves a vicious internal war. There are many who   believe the Alawites will fight to the death because they believe   that, should they lose power, the majority would take, would show   no compassion for them. They ruled that country for a long time,   ruthlessly. It is a vicious civil war that makes one want to cry   every day.
