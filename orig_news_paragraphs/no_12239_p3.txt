In July, the Virginia rapper tweeted a photo of himself video chatting with Clinton to his 1. 3 million Twitter followers. A few days later, the rapper posted a photo of himself wearing a "Delete Your Account" shirt, a reference to Clinton’s Twitter diss directed at Trump. Clinton’s partnership with Pusha T could be an attempt to shore up support among younger voters, a group with whom the Democratic candidate has struggled to attract support in recent months. Pusha T rose to prominence as   of the   group Clipse in the late 90s and early 2000s before setting off on a solo career and later connecting with Kanye West, who named the rapper the president of his G. O. O. D. Music record label in November.
