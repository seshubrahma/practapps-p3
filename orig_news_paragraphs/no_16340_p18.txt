Clinton has emerged one of the least accessible candidates to run for president this year, rarely taking question from her traveling press corps. Clinton last held a formal press conference on December 4, 2015, in Fort Dodge, Iowa. Since then she had held 11 "gaggles"    or informal press conferences    taking questions from a few members of her traveling press corps. The last such huddle was on July 31 in Ashland, Ohio.
