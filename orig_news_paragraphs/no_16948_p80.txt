Based on Trump’s comments calling on Russia to take the action he did, we rate Clinton’s assertion as true. Clinton also said the following regarding Russia’s alleged role in supplying WikiLeaks with the hacked emails being published from Podesta’s account: "We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin."   Earlier this month, US intelligence officials confirmed that emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee were the work of Russian intelligence, with the approval of Russia’s   leaders.   That included the Director of National Intelligence    representing all US intelligence agencies which include civilian and military agencies    and the Department of Homeland Security.
