Throughout this bitter election campaign, liberal celebrities like Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lawrence, Lena Dunham and   Miranda used their powerful media platforms to sing Hillary Clinton’s praises. Now they’ve invited their online followers to join them in processing her loss and protesting the impending administration of Donald J. Trump. " I want to live in a #CountryOfKindness where #LoveTrumpsHate," Lady Gaga wrote on Twitter the day after the election.
