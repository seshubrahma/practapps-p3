I understand what Spicer was trying to say   —   namely, that there were areas where Assad was even worse than Hitler, insofar as the Damascus butcher used chemical gas on the battlefield, something, interestingly, which Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany used in World War I but the Wehrmacht seemed not to have used in battlefield conditions in the Second World War. Yet Spicer was wrong because all of Europe was a battlefield during that war, and the gas chambers where 1. 5 million Jewish children met their end was history’s most horrible use ever of chemical agents in war. But Spicer apologized
