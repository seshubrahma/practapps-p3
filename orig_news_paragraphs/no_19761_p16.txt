One example, however, came in early 2013, when New Jersey’s Chris Christie publicly shamed   Boehner after he abruptly scrapped a vote on legislation providing aid for Hurricane Sandy recovery just before Congress adjourned. Members of the state’s House delegation then threatened to withhold their support for Boehner as speaker unless Boehner promised to reschedule the vote. The bill passed, and New Jersey got its money. Kasich, who served in the House for 18 years until 2001, now has a national profile as a result of his presidential run.
