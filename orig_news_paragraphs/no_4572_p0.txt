Observers on Twitter noted Friday afternoon that the White House’s page on climate change, a creation of the Obama administration, appears to have been taken down shortly after Donald Trump assumed the nation’s presidency. [In its stead, the new White House published an explanation of what the Trump team is calling the "America First Energy Plan. "   At press time, the link to the White House page publicizing a plan to combat climate change leads to a blank page. RIP @WhiteHouse climate webpage.
