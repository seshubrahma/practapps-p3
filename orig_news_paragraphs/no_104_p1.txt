Since the late 1990s, the population of the   bumblebee has declined by nearly 90 percent, a result of a combination of factors, including exposure to pesticides, climate change, habitat loss and disease, federal wildlife officials said. The species, once found in 28 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces, is found today only in small pockets of its   habitat. The designation will accelerate efforts to protect the bees’ habitat and to reduce the use of pesticides that are killing them. It is the latest in a flurry of   efforts to protect the environment and preserve President Obama’s legacy on climate change.
