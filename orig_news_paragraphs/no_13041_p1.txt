Huffman announced on Wednesday new measures the site would take against "toxic users and poorly behaving communities," singling out the   Trump community,   in his statements. Huffman said that "while some of the moderators [of The_Donald] have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective. "   Breitbart was provided chat logs that show not only have the moderators of The_Donald cooperated with Reddit staff as best they can to adhere to the site â€™s rules, they have done so while moderators of other subreddits put heavy pressure on Reddit staff to ban The_Donald.
