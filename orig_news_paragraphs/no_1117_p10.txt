The coming exit from the European Union has already turned Britain inward, with the government and the country’s powerful tabloid news media fixated on the particulars of its withdrawal: the uncertainties of whether the country will maintain access to the bloc’s single market demands that the country take control of its borders to stunt immigration and an insistence on "reclaiming sovereignty" by returning lawmaking powers to London. Those themes of national sovereignty and curbing immigration resonate across the Continent, which is why some saw the British exit as a political precursor and the European Union as an endangered species. In December, however, Austrians narrowly elected a   president, Alexander Van der Bellen, over Norbert Hofer of the   Freedom Party. In Spain, the populist Podemos party underperformed polling expectations last year and the conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, stayed in office.
