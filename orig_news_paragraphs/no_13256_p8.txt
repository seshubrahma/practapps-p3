Local resettlement agencies, whose plans are almost always   by the Obama administration, have recently submitted plans to the Department of State that indicate they want to increase the number of refugees resettled in the state in FY 2017 by 38 percent, to 5, 600, up from 4, 000 in FY 2016. Public health and security problems related to an increased number of refugees are a concern in several other states whose vote may turn the outcome of the election. Security problems were highlighted on Saturday when Dahir Adan, a Somali refugee, stabbed ten people in a Minnesota mall and Ahmad Khan Rahami, an Afghan immigrant, allegedly detonated bombs in New Jersey and New York City. Public health concerns exist in several states where refugees have been diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB) as well.
