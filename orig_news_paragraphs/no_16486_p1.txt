In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper Thursday, Trump didn’t clarify whether he still supported forcibly deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, although he did suggest any solution would take time and that securing the border would be his first priority. He also said he would only support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants who first left the US and returned.   Anyone following Trump’s presidential bid knows that one source can be trusted to usually mystify and occasionally clarify Trump’s    thoughts on the news of the day: his personal Twitter account.   These tweets help trace Trump’s thoughts on illegal immigration from his controversial campaign announcement last June up to Friday morning.
