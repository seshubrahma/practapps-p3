Congress has responded to the State Departmentâ€™s program parsimoniously, allocating the special visas piecemeal through its annual defense policy bill. Since the end of 2014, lawmakers have set aside about 7, 000 visas for Afghan translators and interpreters. As of July 10, fewer than 3, 000 of those visas remained, but about 12, 000 individuals have at least started the application process, according to the State Department. Applicants must apply by Dec. 31 in order to be considered.
