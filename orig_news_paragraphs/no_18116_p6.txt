’ ’   DeLay resigned from Congress in 2006 following his deputy chief   of staff pleading guilty to conspiracy and corruption charges as   a part of the Jack Abramoff scandal. DeLay was   earlier indicted on charges of conspiracy and money   laundering as a part of a campaign finance investigation, which   led him to step down as House majority leader. He was later found   guilty but subsequently had the convictions overturned and    he was acquitted.
