With his recent clutch of wins in the northeast, and a possible win in Indiana May 3, Trump may roll into California with unstoppable momentum. He will defend his strong leads in the San Francisco Bay Area, along the Central Coast, and in Southern California (outside Los Angeles and the Inland Empire). He will even seize territory from Cruz in his Central Valley stronghold, perhaps taking Fresno and districts near Sacramento. Cruz will be held to no more than 14 of the stateâ€™s 53 congressional districts, and Kasich will be a   losing to Trump in liberal metropolitan districts.
