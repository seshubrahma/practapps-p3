In addition, OSHA’s ability to charge companies with failures to properly record workplace injuries may be severely curtailed. For years, the agency had taken the position that it had up to five and a half years after an alleged violation to issue a citation to a company. But a court in 2012 found that OSHA’s interpretation was inconsistent with what the court called the "clear" wording of the law, which gave the agency only six months to bring charges. In December, the Obama administration issued a rule aimed at circumventing the court decision and restoring the      period.
