" At its core, the spirit of Ramadan strengthens awareness of our shared obligation to reject violence, to pursue peace, and to give to those in need who are suffering from poverty or conflict," Trumpâ€™s statement said.    Addressing the terrorist attack that largely targeted children at an Ariana Grande concert, he added that "such acts only steel our resolve to defeat the terrorists and their perverted ideology."   The decision to invoke the act of terrorism that took 22 lives and injured dozens more in a routine holiday statement was a break from the Obama administration, which did not mention terrorism in its annual statements on the Muslim holiday.
