PolitiFact, a news site that ordinarily tries to rebuff conservative attacks on the left, admitted that Clinton’s proposal would dramatically increase the number of Muslim immigrants and refugees admitted into the US. Politifact noted, though, that the screening process to accept refugees ordinarily takes   months, suggesting that the US would be able to maintain national security under Clinton’s proposal. The site did not mention, however, that the Obama Administration has recently cut the screening time for refugees from the Middle East to just 3 months. If support for an outright temporary ban on all Muslim immigration is surging, one can imagine voters would overwhelmingly support efforts to at least increase screening of immigrant hopefuls.
