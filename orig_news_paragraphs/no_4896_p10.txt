Your leadership and voice of support during the FY11 continuing resolution debate was essential to defeating the most dangerous legislative attack in our   history. With your help, Planned Parenthood survived and emerged stronger than ever  â€¦      I am grateful for your tremendous leadership and partnership, and I look forward to working together in the future.
