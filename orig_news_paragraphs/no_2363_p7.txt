Only a strong performance will offer Mr. Trump hope of reversing his slide and starting a   effort to persuade undecided voters that he is qualified to be president. " He understands this debate is very important for him," said Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is a senior adviser to Mr. Trump and is helping prepare him for Sunday.
