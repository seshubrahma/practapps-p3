On Mar. 9, Oregon was permitted to intervene as another plaintiff in Washington and Minnesotaâ€™s case. The attorney general of New York has announced that the Empire State would seek to intervene in that case as well. The previous day, on Mar. 8, the State of Hawaii filed its own separate lawsuit challenging the order in the federal district court in the Aloha State. Hawaii is represented by former U. S.
