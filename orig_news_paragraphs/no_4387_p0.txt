Wednesday in Ranchos Palos Verdes, CA at the annual Code Conference, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said the barrage of "fake news" and hacked emails released during the 2016 presidential campaign had to have been from the Russians and "guided by Americans. "  Clinton said, "I think itâ€™s fair to ask, how did that actually influence the campaign, and how did they know what messages to deliver? Who told them? Who were they coordinating with, and colluding with?"
