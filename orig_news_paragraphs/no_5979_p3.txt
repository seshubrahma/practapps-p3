" Any military actions entailing the aggravation of the situation in Syria certainly influence the course of the political process, especially such actions that were committed against the Syrian armed forces," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennadiy Gatilov said, according to SANA. On Thursday, news reports confirmed an American airstrike near a military base in   Syria, in a region which multiple parties to the Syrian Civil War agreed to treat as a safe zone. The region also housed some U. S.  Syrian rebel groups.
