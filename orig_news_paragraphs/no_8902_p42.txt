However, as conservative columnist and   author Ann Coulter has explained, the fabric of America was not made by immigrants of all religions and from all parts of the globe —   in fact, America was not founded by immigrants at all, but rather by British Colonists and European Christian settlers. The American colonies were originally part of Britain, and its entire legal, political, and social structure derived from centuries of Western heritage embodied by America’s founders. Nor did Haley mention that the history of   third world immigration actually began in 1965, when a Ted   measure was enacted that eliminated the Calvin Coolidge immigration caps. As a result of that change, today 9 in 10 green cards go to countries outside the western world that share no common history with America.
