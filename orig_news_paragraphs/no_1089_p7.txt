Mr. Kushner attended the initial meeting with Mr. Kislyak to explore whether a channel could be set up between the Russian government and the incoming administration to improve relations between the United States and Russia, Ms. Hicks said. They also discussed how the United States and Russia could cooperate on issues in the Middle East, an area Mr. Kushner has been deputized to take the lead on, she said. Mr. Kislyak asked for a second meeting to "deliver a message," Ms. Hicks said. Mr. Kushner sent Avrahm Berkowitz, a White House aide and longtime associate.
