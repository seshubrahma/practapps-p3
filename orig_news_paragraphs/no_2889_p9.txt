John Kerry just gave an eloquent eulogy for the   solution," said Ali Abunimah, a   activist who helped found the Electronic Intifada, a website focused on the Palestinian side of the conflict. While Mr. Netanyahu still formally supports a   solution, few believe his heart is in it, and voices on the far sides of the conflict are increasingly talking about a   solution, albeit one conceived in starkly different ways. From his right flank, Mr. Netanyahu faces calls within his coalition to give up the   formula and instead annex parts of the West Bank. From the other side, some Palestinians now advocate a single state from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River in which everyone has an equal vote, knowing that Palestinians would ultimately outnumber Jewish citizens in such a country.
