But the President will keep his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, as a regular committee member    a move that came under fire    while the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will not be regular attendees.   The committee is a   group of agencies focused on national security that was established by President George H. W. Bush in 1989. Former acting CIA chief Michael Morell on Monday sharply criticized the move to add Bannon to the group while limiting the involvement of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and DNI, calling it "unprecedented" in an appearance on "CBS This Morning." "I have never been to a principals’ meeting where the views of the DNI and the views of the chairman are not relevant," said Morell, who advised Hillary Clinton’s campaign for president.
