Thatâ€™s higher than the 26 that did so in 2012, the lowest number since 1920, but not much higher," Michael Barone wrote in a Washington Examiner February article. In 2016, 400 of the 435 members of Congress elected were in districts where the presidential candidate of the same party won 218 Republicans won in districts where Donald Trump won the presidential vote, and 182 Democrats won in districts where Hillary Clinton won the presidential vote.
