Last week, Mr. Obama appealed to Mr. Trump "to think long and hard" before scrapping the program. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the   Senate Democrat, said on the floor and on Twitter that he would do "everything in my power" to save the program and protect "Dreamers who have stepped forward to contribute" to the country. Rights groups have been encouraging immigrants up for renewal on the program to reapply quickly. But they are generally urging newcomers not to apply.
