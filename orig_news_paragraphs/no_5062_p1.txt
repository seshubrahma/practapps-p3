Lowrey posted the Tweet Jan. 17, three days before Trumpâ€™s inauguration. The Tweet disappeared not long after it was posted, along with all her social media accounts. The bio on her profile said she was a "a Louisville Vixen and aspiring WWE diva" before the account was taken down, the Daily News reported. No charges have been announced against her yet, but her former employers have already issued statements denouncing the Tweet and have severed ties with her, WAVE reported.
