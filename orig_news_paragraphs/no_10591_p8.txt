Besides my   Twitter is known for pernicious and arbitrary account suspensions that follow an opaque and byzantine logic, the   permanent banning of top conservative accounts, and "shadowbanning," a practice so insidious I can only assume it’s the work of a James Bond villain hired by Twitter for cultural diversity. Facebook, meanwhile, is currently being sued in Germany for not censoring enough content on its platform. Two lawyers are currently taking Mark Zuckerberg to court, alleging that content posted on his platform violates the European nation’s stringent laws on hate speech and glorifying Nazism.
