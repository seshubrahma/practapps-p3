Amos and Danny did these studies where   theyâ€™d give their lab subjects a wheel of fortune with the   numbers one to 100 on it and have them spin the wheel. And then,   after subjects get a number, they ask them what they think the   percentage of countries in the United Nations come from Africa.    And people who had spun a high number would guess a higher   percentage than people who had spun a low number. Amos and Danny   showed that you could anchor the mind into answering a question a   certain way by giving them a totally unrelated piece of   information dropped before.
