Philadelphia (CNN) Chelsea Clinton will introduce her mother ahead of her Thursday night nomination acceptance speech with remarks she has been writing "for a couple weeks," her spokeswoman, Erika Gudmunson, said Tuesday. It will come a week after her friend, Ivanka Trump, introduced her father at the Republican National Convention to much fanfare. For Chelsea Clinton, itâ€™s a responsibility that Gudmunson said the mother of two is taking more seriously than any speech she has ever given before.
