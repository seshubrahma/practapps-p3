DES MOINES, Iowa  —   Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, is calling on Fox News debate moderators Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace to ask the GOP presidential candidates where they stand on Obamatrade. ["It absolutely is a critical issue for the future of America," Sessions told Breitbart News in an exclusive phone interview late last week.   This is no little matter that needs to be decided in some secret room and secret negotiations. I don’t see how anybody that conducts a debate can fail to ask about this critical issue.
