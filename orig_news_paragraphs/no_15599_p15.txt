As Trump moves on from Saudi Arabia, the presidential lessons will continue. His campaign rhetoric will again intrude when he lands Monday in Israel, where he’s determined the time is not right to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as he said he would on the campaign trail. In Rome, he isn’t likely to repeat his claim from a year ago that Pope Francis is "disgraceful" for making critical comments about Trump’s plans to construct a border wall with Mexico. At the European Union headquarters in Brussels, the open questioning of the bloc will likely be kept at a minimum.
