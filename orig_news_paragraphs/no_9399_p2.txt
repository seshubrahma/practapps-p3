A   image of the confrontation, which looks like an armed standoff, suggests that one police officer was black and the other was white. One officer reportedly fired a Taser but the other fired live ammunition. On Thursday evening, the San Diego   reports, "about 50 to 75 people  —   a smaller crowd than previous nights   —   took over the intersection of Broadway and Mollison Avenue" and "stopped passing vehicles and broke several of their windows" at about 8 p. m. according to police.
