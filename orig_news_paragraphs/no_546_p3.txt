The Department of Defense, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the extent to which the plan, which originated in the militaryâ€™s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was considered. Aside from sensory deprivation, the memo suggested that additional pressure tactics be permitted against prisoners, including those that "maximize cultural undesirability," but it did not mention the brutal physical coercion techniques, such as waterboarding, later approved for use in the C. I. A. prisons. The memo is included among several government documents provided during the discovery process in a lawsuit brought in federal court in Spokane, Wash. against Dr. Jessen and the other psychologist, James E. Mitchell, by two former C. I. A. prisoners and the representative of a third man, who died in custody. The documents, along with others previously released, are helping to fill in gaps in the historical record about the interrogation program of the George W. Bush era.
