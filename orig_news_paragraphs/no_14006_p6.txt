Yesterday afternoon, U. S. President Barack Obama gave his final news conference while in office.   It was likely the last time heâ€™d speak in public as president.    A lot of subjects were covered, increasingly strained U. S. relations with Israel and Russia, the relationship between the White House and the media, a recent move to reduce the sentences of more prisoners than any other U. S. president.   It all came up.
