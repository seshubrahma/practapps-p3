Ted Burdick, the previous chief investment officer there, stepped down after just eight months on the job, though he remains with the firm. Others who have held Ms. Fitzpatrick’s role have been caught up in the internal politics of the firm, and at times clashed with Mr. Soros himself. Ms. Fitzpatrick may be at less risk because, unlike some previous chief investment officers, she will be reporting to the family office ’s board of directors, rather than just Mr. Soros, who is the chairman of the board.
