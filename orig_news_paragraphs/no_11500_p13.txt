While corporate media is now recycling smears used 30 years ago to deny Sessions a federal judgeship in the 1980s, even individuals who voted against Sessions’ confirmation at the time ultimately came to regret their decision. " My vote against candidate Sessions for the federal court was a mistake because I have since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian," said the   Democratic and Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, Arlen Specter. As the Weekly Standard‘s Mark Hemingway reports, the smear campaign against Sessions collapses upon even a cursory review of Sessions’ actual record, which includes desegregating schools and taking on the Klan in Alabama.
