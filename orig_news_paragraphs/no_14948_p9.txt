Opposition to government run health care has been a foundation of the Republican party for three or four generations now, so it is difficult to see House Republicans walk away from efforts to protect the American people from this awful law," said Michael Steel, former spokesman for   Speaker John Boehner. " At the same time, after last week, itâ€™s difficult to see how the entire conference can find a unified position." "I think the divisions that have existed for some time look and feel particularly acute now that we have a Republican President," Steel added.
