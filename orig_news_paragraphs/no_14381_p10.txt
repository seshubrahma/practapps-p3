The region is dealing with the affects of what could be the most significant storm of this winter.   When the snow emergency is declared in places like Boston, Massachusetts, you know the weather is bad.   Blizzard conditions, whiteouts, more than 1, 600 flight cancellations, the closure of the largest school district in the United States, and the warnings to people not to leave their homes except in an emergency.   This is all because of a storm system thatâ€™s affected more than 60 million people in some way.
