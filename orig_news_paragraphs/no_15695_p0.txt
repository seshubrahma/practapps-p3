 (CNN) The mayor of Portland, Oregon, is trying to stop what he describes as two upcoming " " demonstrations as his city continues to mourn the stabbing deaths of two residents who intervened in a possible hate crime. Mayor Ted Wheeler on Monday called on the federal government to revoke the permit for a rally set for Sunday, and to deny permission for a second rally on June 10. The two gatherings    backed by different organizers    are planned for a park on federal land, which gives federal authorities control over issuing permits.
