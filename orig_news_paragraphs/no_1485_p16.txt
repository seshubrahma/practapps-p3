" This is an example of what voters are totally fed up with," said Liesl Hickey, the former executive director of the House Republican campaign arm, alluding to the F. B. I. â€™s decision to not recommend charges. But Ms. Hickey, pointing out that Mr. Trump refuses to release his income tax returns, noted that the candidate also bore his own baggage on the very argument he is making against Mrs. Clinton.
