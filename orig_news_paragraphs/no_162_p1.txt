More than once, the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors. But despite its unremarkable profile, Innate has some surprisingly influential boosters in Washington. The congressional liaison to   Donald J. Trump’s transition team, Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, is the company’s largest shareholder and sits on the board. Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Mr. Trump’s nominee to be secretary of health and human services, purchased shares of Innate four times in 2015 and 2016, according to congressional financial disclosures, totaling between $60, 000 and $110, 000.
