[While U. S. ships "generally" have a Chinese shadow while operating in the region, it is uncommon for them to be shadowed by a Russian ship in that area, one official said.   Both the Chinese ship and Russian ship are   ships, the official said. The Chinese ship has been identified as the   Auxiliary General Intelligence (AGI) ship Tianlangxing. The Russian ship has been identified as the   AGI ship Kurily  —   the same type of ship that was reportedly patrolling the U. S.’s east coast earlier this year.
