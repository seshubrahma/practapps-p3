As a result of the successful whistleblower program, the   Commission has awarded more than $100 million, since inception  —     virtually all during Chair White’s tenure  —   to whistleblowers who   provided key original information that led to successful   enforcement actions. ’ ’ Under Chair White’s leadership, the Commission made   significant enhancements to its examination program, including   increasing staff by about 20 percent by hiring new examiners   where funding permitted and redeploying staff from other program   areas to heighten focus on the   investment management   industry. ’ ’ The exam program also increased its use of advanced   quantitative techniques to enable examiners to detect misconduct   by more quickly analyzing large amounts of data.
