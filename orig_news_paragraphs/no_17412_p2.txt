The brusque and opinionated Bolton is as loved in some quarters for his uncompromising conservatism as he is loathed in others    particularly among foreign service diplomats in the State Department    for his views and style.   Even Tillerson is said to have expressed reservations about Bolton, according to sources.    Members of the foreign policy establishment have proposed alternative candidates for the job. Elliot Abrams, a former deputy national security advisor to George W. Bush, and Robert Kimmitt, who previously served as Bushâ€™s deputy secretary of the Treasury Department and was an ambassador to Germany and had a top job at the State Department under President George H. W. Bush, have been gaining steam as possible deputies to Tillerson, sources familiar with the search said.
