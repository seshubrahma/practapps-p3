In other words, the students enrolled in community colleges within the county. And with community colleges costing a fraction of what     colleges cost, federal   borrowing and default rates also declined. In fact, the researchers estimate that 70 percent of the students who stopped borrowing because they switched to a different school would have defaulted on their loans had they remained at the   colleges. This would seem to push back at the idea, put forth by the   industry, that the rules around how and which schools gain access to aid hinder student achievement.
