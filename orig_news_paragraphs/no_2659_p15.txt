In its filings to the S. E. C. Exxon Mobil has reported that it has   its major assets and expects that future cash flow could sustain even its most economically challenged oil and gas fields. The company has conceded that a future   of assets is possible if its projections change. Still, most oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, predict that oil and natural gas prices will recover over the next few years and that demand for those fossil fuels will continue to increase along with growing populations and middle classes in emerging markets. The companies also say that projections are difficult without knowing what future   regulations will entail, or how new technologies might help curtail greenhouse gas emissions.
