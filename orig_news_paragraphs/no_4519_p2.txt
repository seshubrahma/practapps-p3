Everything is keyed to getting us back to 3 percent," White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters this week. Even though the average growth rate since the   War II era has been 3. 2 percent, the administrationâ€™s critics are skeptical or even mocking of its GDP forecast. They point out that last time the economy grew at 3 percent in a year was 2005 and ever since the Great Recession the economy appears to be on a permanently slower track. Official estimates from the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Reserve, as well as those by many private forecasters, see growth closer to 2 percent or even lower.
