Indeed, this election has been ugly. It has consistently raised more questions than answers, provoked more problems than solutions. So much so it makes you wonder if the whole system isnâ€™t falling apart. I used to think Congress and Washington were broken, but this electoral season reveals broader and deeper dysfunctions: the intractability of the   system, the dubious role of the media, and the polarized, crass, uncivil, uneducated, sensationalist, shallow and   national culture.
