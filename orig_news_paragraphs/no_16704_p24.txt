Mr Trump: You have justified unconstitutional policies, like a ban on Muslims entering the country, on the grounds of national security. Is it not reasonable for Americans to wonder what else national security can justify? If for example it is too risky to allow Muslims into America, why should we permit those Muslims already here to stay?
