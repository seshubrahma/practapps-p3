A Gallup poll of Muslims in the UK found that not a single Muslim in the 1, 001 people polled thought that homosexuality was morally acceptable. That is compared to 58 per cent of the overall British population who think fags are alright. The same poll found that just 35 per cent of French Muslims and 19 per cent of German Muslims thought homosexuals were morally acceptable. According to a Channel 4 poll, 52 per cent of British Muslims believe homosexuality should be illegal, 23 per cent would like to see Sharia law in England, 39 per cent believe a woman should always obey her husband, as opposed to 5 per cent of English people overall, and 31 per cent consider it acceptable for a man to have multiple wives.
