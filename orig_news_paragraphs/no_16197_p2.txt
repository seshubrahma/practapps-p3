At no point in the last two months have Trump’s odds been higher than Clinton’s, although her odds are nowhere near their   high. At one point in June, Clinton’s odds for the presidency were at 80% while Trump was at 18%. At Trump’s highest point at the beginning of June    after he emerged as the presumptive Republican nominee    he was at 43% while Clinton was at 57%.   Don’t confuse the odds in the political prediction market with the information in public opinion polls.
