Consider George Marshall as Harry Truman’s secretary of state and defense, Colin Powell as Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser and George W. Bush’s secretary of state, or Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser under George H. W. Bush. What you want in these positions are individuals who have leadership skills, the capacity to master their briefs and the required management skills to handle large and complicated systems. Appointments should be judged by these standards, not whether they are generals, doctors, lawyers    or butchers, bakers and candlestick makers. Second, the idea that military leaders are by definition hawks and prone to use force casually and recklessly, while civilians are not, just isn’t borne out by the historical record.
