Despite the increase in violence, the senior administration official said the President’s national security advisers are still preparing to recommend Trump commit no more than 5, 000 additional US troops. US officials are also seeking an increased troop commitment from NATO military partners. The official said Trump will be presented with an "ambitious" review of the US’s policies in South Asia that will go beyond recommendations on the US fight in Afghanistan to include US policy toward neighboring India and Pakistan. Trump has not been briefed on the full strategy, but has been receiving "periodic updates," the official said.
