This is how Trump’s game is played. Someone "hears" something and repeats it so someone else can "hear" it and soon enough, Vince Foster’s suicide becomes a murder and President Obama is   Muslim. (If you need help understanding how dangerous Obama is, just refer to Trump’s insinuation, made in June, that "there’s something going on" between the president and Islamic extremists who plot and carry out terror attacks.)
