During the three day period between October 4 and October 6, 2, 682 refugees were resettled in the United States. Thatâ€™s an average daily rate of 894 refugees for those three days. Should the Obama administration maintain that   average for the remaining 359 days of FY 2017, it would end up resettling 325, 000 refugees for the year, which would be a record high for the   year old program, which was initiated by the Refugee Act of 1980. Congress has not granted the Department of State, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or the voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) in the lucrative and politically powerful refugee resettlement industry the budget authority to bring refugees in to the United States at the extraordinarily high pace at which the program has operated during the first six days of October.
