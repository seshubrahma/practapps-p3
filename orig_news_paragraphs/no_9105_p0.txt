From Steven Shepard writing at Politico:   The Trump Bump has arrived. After wrapping up an acutely fractious primary in which Donald Trump and his opponents lobbed scores of personal, playground insults at one another, the presumptive GOP nominee has quickly unified the vast majority of Republican voters around one goal: defeating Hillary Clinton, his prospective Democratic opponent. Entering the general election trailing by about 7 points, Trump has rapidly erased most of that gap: As of Friday, Clintonâ€™s advantage was down to roughly 2 points, according to the HuffPost Pollster average.
