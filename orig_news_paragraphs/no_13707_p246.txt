If the Obama administration does not pursue a criminal indictment of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trumpâ€™s White House would. At the end of a friendly town hall interview aired on Wednesday night, Fox News personality Sean Hannity asked Trump whether, as president, he would pursue a criminal indictment of Clinton should Attorney General Loretta Lynch "cover" for Clinton and avoid indicting her. " You have to," Trump responded, to uproarious cheering.
