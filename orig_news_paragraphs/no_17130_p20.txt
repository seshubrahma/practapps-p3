But maybe Trump appreciates someone who can throw a punch. After all, Romney warned Trump was a "phony," a "fraud" who was playing the American public for "suckers" and once said he wanted to be able to look his grandchildren in the eye and say he took a stand against the GOP nominee. Would Romney be allowed to speak for the President? Even if the two men put personal animosity aside, the starchy Romney would be an incongruous figure in a team that includes firebrands such as new White House adviser Stephen Bannon and the next national security adviser Michael Flynn.
