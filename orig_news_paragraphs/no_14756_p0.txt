Washington (CNN) Illegal Southwest border crossings were down 40% last month, according to just released Customs and Border Protection numbers    a sign that President Donald Trumpâ€™s hardline rhetoric and policies on immigration may be having a deterrent effect. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly himself announced the    numbers, statistics that CBP usually quietly posts on its website without fanfare. According to CBP data, the 40% drop in illegal Southwest border crossings from January to February is far outside normal seasonal trends.
