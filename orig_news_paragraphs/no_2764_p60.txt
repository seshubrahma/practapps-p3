I made one last attempt to press him for an idea of what Melania will be like compared to other first ladies. We know there will be opulence. We know that she loves Valentino and Chanel and Manolo and fur and diamonds and that she doesnâ€™t like prints or going without makeup. When Melania did the Vogue cover, the writer Sally Singer said that the bride of Trump, compared in the piece to a Bond girl, had "a slightly   idea of femininity" because she refused to pose for Mario Testino without makeup or perfectly styled hair.
