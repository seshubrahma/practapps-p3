As Pat Buchanan has explained: It was a tariff enacted in June 1930, nine months after the Crash of 1929, which occurred, as Milton Friedman won a Nobel Prize for proving, when the stock market bubble, caused by the Fed’s easy money policy, burst.   had nothing to do with a Depression that began in 1929 and lasted through FDR’s first two terms. This is a liberal myth. Buchanan has been debunking this liberal myth for over two decades, writing in 1994: Americans today are being indoctrinated in false history. And high among the falsehoods is that ‘free trade’ with foreign nations made America prosperous, and protectionism always made her poor.
