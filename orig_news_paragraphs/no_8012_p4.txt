Ross has made a name for himself in recent years as the lead "roaster" on Comedy Central’s popular series, having roasted everyone from Justin Bieber and David Hasselhoff to Charlie Sheen and Donald Trump. He’s also the star of his own Comedy Central show called The Burn with Jeff Ross, which has run for two seasons thus far. As is his style, Ross has courted controversy with some of his jokes in recent years. In a promo for his show from 2012, Ross posted a meme saying he was "glad" that actor Charlton Heston died.
