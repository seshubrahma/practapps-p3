Iowa is the battleground state where Trump is most comfortable right now. Trump has had a comfortable lead in all three Iowa polls this month —  from Emerson, Monmouth, and Quinnipiac —  and the RealClearPolitics polling average currently gives Trump a 6. 3 percent advantage in the Hawkeye State walking into the debate. Fit Iowa and Nevada in the Trump column and he is up to 232 electoral votes. Next up is Maine’s Second Congressional District.
