Ron Burkle, an American investor and philanthropist, made a generous donation to help Dilbireen and his family, LaStaiti, the film producer, said. LaStaiti added that he made the connection to Burkle through British film producer Lex Lutzus, who helped raise funds. " For a child who has been through so much, he has such a remarkable spirit and was always smiling and always happy, which was just very uplifting, actually," Sabir said of Dilbireen.
