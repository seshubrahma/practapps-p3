On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Mr. Trump suggested that some of the threats and vandalism could be a politically motivated effort to "make people look bad," rather than actual expressions of bias, according to people who took part in the meeting. Despite the arrest, "we hope our elected officials will directly confront the wave of hate violence that we’ve seen since the election," said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Project. The authorities said the person who made the calls had sent them through the internet and used sophisticated software to disguise his location and camouflage his voice, which slowed the investigation. When the Israeli police searched the suspect’s house, investigators confiscated computers, an antenna and other equipment.
