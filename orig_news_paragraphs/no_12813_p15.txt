We support the right to   up to and including secession for that nation. We defend the right to independent   organization necessary to achieve this liberation, including the right to separate   parties. We support struggles of national liberation for all other nations brutalized by imperialist oppression whose homelands are within the borders of the United States, such as the Native American nations of the US, the Hawai’ian nation and the Puerto Rican struggle for national independence. Maria Poblet is Causa Justa :: Just Cause’s executive director.
