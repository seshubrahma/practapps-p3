In a blog post published on Sunday, Mr. Cernovich wrote "the White House Counsel’s office identified" Susan E. Rice, President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, "as the person responsible for the unmasking" Trump associates who were caught up in the electronic surveillance of foreigners. Similar reports were published by other news organizations. " Unmasking" is the process by which a   official, such as a national security adviser, requests the identity of a person whose name has been blacked out in an intelligence report.
