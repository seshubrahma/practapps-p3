Secret Service and Washington Metropolitan Police officers discovered a map of the White House when they arrested Wahl, who did not have a criminal history before these three incidents.   She was charged with unlawful entry and pleaded not guilty in District of Columbia Superior Court on Wednesday, records show. Wahl was released and given a stay away order with an initial status hearing set for April 27. A message left with her attorney after the Wednesday hearing was not returned.
