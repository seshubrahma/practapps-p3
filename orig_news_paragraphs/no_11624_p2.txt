The Trump campaign will collect the first $5, 400 from each donation, half of which is earmarked to pay the campaignâ€™s primary election costs. The remainder of the donations will be split between the RNC and the individual state parties, to cover     efforts, voter contact and outreach and "party building" activities. Each state party is able to accept $10, 000 from individuals through its own federal election account. The 11 state parties participating in the joint fundraising effort are Arkansas, Connecticut, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
