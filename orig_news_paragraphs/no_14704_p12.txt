The vast majority of   holders have only bachelor’s degrees. At the three companies with the most   employees, 80% of visa holders possess only bachelor’s degrees, according to Ronil Hira, an associate professor at Howard University who studies the   program and outsourcing industry. Critics maintain that people with bachelor’s degrees are not necessary to fill the   skills gap and that they are just taking jobs from Americans. Of the 85, 000 visas handed out annually, 20, 000 are reserved for people with advanced degrees.
