Carl Paladino, a western New York builder,   Republican candidate for governor of New York and political ally of   Donald J. Trump, came under fire on Friday for racially offensive comments about President Obama and the first lady, who Mr. Paladino said should be "let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe. " Mr. Paladinoâ€™s comments were published in Artvoice, a weekly Buffalo newspaper. They came in response to  an   feature in which local figures were asked about their hopes for 2017.
