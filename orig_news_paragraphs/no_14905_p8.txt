But Nunes’ announcement raises the question of whether the   or associates were identified in intelligence reports circulating in the covert community. A House member on the Intelligence Committee told CNN the communications in question were   people talking about Trump, not Trump himself.   Nunes later told CNN’s "The Lead with Jake Tapper" that "  Trump and his team were put into intelligence reports." "Clearly there is a lot of information in the reports that I’ve seen, which were dozens, that would lead me to believe that the last administration and numerous agencies had a pretty good idea of what   Trump was up to and what his transition team was up to and who they were meeting with," Nunes told Tapper.
