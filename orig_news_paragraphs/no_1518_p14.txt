We believe one source of the difference is in the ways we believe states will (or won’t) swing together, and how much they’ll shift. This is illustrated best by seeing our electoral distributions side by side: The FiveThirtyEight histogram is wider and flatter than ours. It assigns a greater chance that something highly unusual will happen, while ours thinks that the course of this election will look pretty much like the ones that have come before it. For example, we think there is only about a 1 percent chance that Mrs. Clinton will get fewer than 160 electoral votes.
