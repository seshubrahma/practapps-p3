’s life not a genuine Muslim life, when seen from this angle, it may even prove to be an   life. I saw Nawaz in New York in September, while he was in town   for Quilliam’s American chapter. We had made plans to meet at a Soho hotel for a drink, but he was running late. When I asked after him, the concierge either didn’t know his real name or pretended not to.
