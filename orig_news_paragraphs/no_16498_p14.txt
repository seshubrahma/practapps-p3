" It just becomes very hard and difficult to understand how the Trump campaign gets to 270," said one of Mitt Romneyâ€™s 2012 strategists.   The kind of landslide victories that candidates like FDR in 1936 and LBJ in 1964 enjoyed might no longer be possible, given that the electorate is so polarized in many states. But Clinton holds a strong lead in most of the key battleground states and there is little evidence that Trump can "turn" blue states into red.
