The plan is seen by supporters as a way to signal U. S. commitment to the region, amid concerns over North Korea’s illicit nuclear weapons program. Additional military assets in the region could also help give the U. S. more deterrent power. Last month, U. S. Pacific Command ordered the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson to head north towards North Korea as speculation grew that Pyongyang was planning to conduct its sixth nuclear test on the weekend of its late founder’s birthday. Although the carrier would not actually arrive for weeks, North Korea did not conduct a test that weekend, instead holding a large military parade.
