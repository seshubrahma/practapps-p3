" Erdogan first expressed his condolences for the Peshmerga fighters killed and showed regret for the ones injured in Turkey’s bombing of PKK positions on Mount Shingal," according to the KRG’s statement on the meeting. The statement reportedly did not mention an apology from Erdogan, merely "regret" and a demand that the PKK leave the region. While mending fences with the KRG, the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reports that clashes between Turkish soldiers and YPG fighters in Syria continued Friday.
