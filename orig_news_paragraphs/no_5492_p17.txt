The Trump administration reportedly unofficially informed Planned Parenthood it would have to cease performing abortions to keep its taxpayer funding. House Republican leaders  —   with support from the Trump administration   —   put forward the American Health Care Act (AHCA) legislation that contained a provision to defund Planned Parenthood for a   period. Though conservatives were successful in thwarting the bill because it failed to fully repeal Obamacare, Trump would likely have signed it if Congress had passed it, ending Planned Parenthood’s funding for a year.
