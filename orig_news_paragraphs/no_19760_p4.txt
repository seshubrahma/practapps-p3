* * * Anthony McGinty, 54, is a retired D. C. homicide detective now living in Pasadena. McGinty’s tenure in the nation’s capital, where he attained the rank of detective first grade, coincided with that city’s darkest era, when it was known as the murder capital of the United States. A Marine veteran who served in the second Gulf War and was stationed variously in Okinawa, Kosovo, Honduras, and the Mediterranean, McGinty is quiet, keeps his hair shorn close to his scalp.
