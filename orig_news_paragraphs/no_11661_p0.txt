On his show on Wednesday, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh offered his analysis of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump’s rise, which he argued wasn’t a sign that conservative orthodoxy was winning the day, but instead it is a pushback against the   Democratic Party and President Barack Obama.   And that according to Limbaugh is a sign of the rise of nationalism and populism overtaking conservatism. " What’s happening here, nationalism, dirty word, ooh, people hate it, populism, even dirtier word," Limbaugh said.
