The proposals, which Mr. Trump outlined in the politically critical Philadelphia suburbs along with his daughter Ivanka, represent a new attempt to court female voters who polls show have been alienated by his bombast and history of provocative remarks about women. " Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the   factory worker, the family worried about security or the mom struggling to afford child care," Mr. Trump said at a rally here. Mr. Trumpâ€™s decision to put forward such a plan represents a different approach from the one taken by previous Republican presidential nominees.
