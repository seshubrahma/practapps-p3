Campaign rhetoric, And while Trump has diverged in some ways from past precedent in his approach to the conflict, he is also shirking some of his hardline   rhetoric from the campaign trail in favor of more traditional US policy. Despite pledging during the campaign to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the US embassy to the city, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their own, Trump last week backed off tentative plans to announce the bold move during Trump’s visit to the city amid a wave of warnings from US foreign policy officials and Arab diplomats. Administration officials told CNN last week that Trump would not announce the embassy move during the trip, but did not rule out a future decision on the topic.
