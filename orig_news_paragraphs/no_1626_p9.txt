Few presidential candidates have indulged their impulses and spoken    as much as Mr. Trump, a political outsider who is used to playing the tough guy in boardrooms and business negotiations. Assuming the role of party   has been a struggle for him, and even now, as he tries to follow a new script, he has not abandoned the caustic tone that has defined his candidacy. His evolving language on immigration reflects his conflicting desires: In the space of a few hours on Tuesday, he said he was open to "softening" his   policies toward some people who had entered the country illegally and then whipped up a rally in Austin, Tex. with promises to make Mexico pay for a border wall.
