Trumpâ€™s greatest opportunity may lie with former supporters of Bernie Sanders, who dominated the youth vote before he bowed out of the race and endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. A poll last month showed that a whopping 50 percent of millennial Sanders supporters are unprepared to back Clinton, with 13 percent backing Trump and a further 37 percent backing third party candidates. " At this point in the campaign, Clinton has a clear advantage with   year olds, but Donald Trump can make great gains if he can connect with disaffected millennials and get them out to the polls," said Walter Kawecki of VoterLabs.
