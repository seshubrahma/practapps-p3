President Donald Trump praised Americaâ€™s   values, vowing to defend them from an increasingly dangerous world, in a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday. ["America will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God," Trump said. " That faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas, and lock arms at home to ensure equal rights for every man, woman, and child in our land. "
