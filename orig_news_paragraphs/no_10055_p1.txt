Foremostly, the editor in chief of Foreign Policy magazine, David Rothkopf, is a Democrat who helped President Bill Clinton sign the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) while serving as U. S. Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. And how could we possibly believe this is anything remotely exceptional when the history and present of Foreign Policy (FP) magazine is so tied up with the globalist establishment? It was founded by Samuel P. Huntingdon, of "Clash of Civilizations" fame and a   Democrat and foreign policy hawk. Huntington noted in 2004 that the global elites "have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the eliteâ€™s global operations".
