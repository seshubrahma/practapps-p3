Bishop Georges Khazen, who serves   Catholics in Aleppo, agreed that there should have been an investigation as to who perpetrated the chemical weapon attack before any military response, telling the   Fides news agency that the U. S. action "opens new disturbing scenarios for all. " The Pentagon confirmed the launch of 59 Tomahawk land attack missiles on Thursday night as a retaliatory move following what appeared to be a chemical attack on civilians in Idlib province. "
