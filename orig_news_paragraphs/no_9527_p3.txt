I’ve generally voted conservative for the past 15 years, and the only reason I never changed was because I wanted the ability to vote in local elections. " "The popular view is that conservative Democrats now switching parties are of a certain type  —   uneducated whites bordering on racists, who live in   towns in   states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia or farther south, who have just found conservatism through the rough rhetoric of Trump," Zito writes. Challenging that view are analysts who argue these Trump Democrats are often   as with the police officer Zito interviewed, and can be found in   and   suburbs, as well as dying   towns. It’s a notion that runs counter to the conventional wisdom that Trump’s rise was caused by some failure of conservative thought.
