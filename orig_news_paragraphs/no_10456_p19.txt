Libyan intelligence worked with the CIA and the US intelligence during the Iraq war to arrest members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) who had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda. The LIFG has been a U. S. designated terrorist organization since 2004. According to a West Point study conducted in 2007, Libya contributed far more foreign fighters in Iraq to fight American troops per capita than any other country. It was Hillary Clinton’s State Department that gave a contract to the February 17th Martyrs Brigade in Libya to protect America’s Consulate, who were known sympathizers to Al Qaeda and are main suspects in the Benghazi attack on the U. S. consulate that killed U. S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.
