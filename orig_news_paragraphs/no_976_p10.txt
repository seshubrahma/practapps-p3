The state inquiry was more narrowly focused on whether the mayor or his aides violated state election law in 2014 by directing campaign donations to county committees to evade limits on contributions to five individual State Senate candidates. The decisions by the two offices that handled the inquiries were disclosed separately on Thursday morning, but the timing was coordinated. The United States attorney’s office, along with the F. B. I. conducted the federal investigation and the Manhattan district attorney’s office oversaw the state one, assisted by the F. B. I. The federal investigation examined at least a dozen different circumstances, mostly in which donors to his 2013 campaign, his nonprofit or both sought action from the mayor, including several in which they had direct conversations with Mr. de Blasio.
