On Wednesday, Griffin was fired from her gig on CNN’s New Year’s Eve program, which she had   alongside Anderson Cooper since 2007.   Griffin said her termination was "hurtful."   Griffin also lost an endorsement deal with Squatty Potty, a line of bathroom footstools, and has had at least five of her   gigs canceled since the photos were released.   Griffin and Bloom believe the comedian has received harsher backlash because she is female.
