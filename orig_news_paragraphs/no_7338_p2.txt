When I was the Director of CPAC, I introduced Donald Trump when he first spoke at the conference in 2011. When Trump spoke it was already a controversial conference because GOProud, a now defunct organization for gay conservatives and their allies, was allowed to be one of over 150 participating organizations. There were calls for boycotts (mostly by groups that had never sponsored CPAC) and a few speakers who decided to decline their invitation because of GOProudâ€™s inclusion. Not only did Trump come to a conference that many in the mainstream media consider to be part of a "fringe" movement, but he came at the invitation of GOProud.
