Mr. Seagalâ€™s foray into Russia calls to mind other American celebrities who have drawn attention for their visits to countries whose ties with the United States, if they exist at all, have been exceedingly cold. Dennis Rodman, the former professional basketball star, has made a series of bizarre trips to North Korea, even as that country detained and paraded American visitors in a geopolitical spectacle. In January 2014, Mr. Rodman even took part in birthday celebrations for Kim   the North Korean leader, who is said to be a fan of basketball. Mr. Putin, for his part, is a fan of the kind of   movies that Mr. Seagal has executed in his Hollywood career, Reuters reported.
