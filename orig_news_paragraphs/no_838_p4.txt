Mr. Hwang did not elaborate, but his comment came days after The New York Times reported that President Trump’s national security deputies recently discussed various options against North Korea, including the possibility of reintroducing nuclear weapons to South Korea as a bold warning. " If North Korea gets a hold of nuclear weapons, its consequences are too horrible to think about," Mr. Hwang said. In his New Year’s Day speech, the North Korean leader, Kim   said his country was in the "final stage" of preparing for its first ICBM test.
