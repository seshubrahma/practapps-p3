So Bill did what Bill always does: He dug into the literature. Soon he showed up at my desk in Washington with a grin, toting an      pile of Pentagon testimony and public documents from companies like Raytheon, which makes missile defenses, describing a program called "left of launch" that allows for the sabotage of an adversaryâ€™s systems before anyone presses the big red button. These blended   electronic warfare and   cyber attacks, with some loud echoes of the techniques used in "Olympic Games," the code name for the Iran sabotage. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, I briefed Dean Baquet, our executive editor, and Matt Purdy, a deputy managing editor, about our line of reporting, and they immediately urged us to dig deeper.
