It will likely not be too long before we see Clinton campaign in the state following on the heels of high profile surrogates such as her daughter, Chelsea, Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders. The math is becoming truly daunting for Trump. In our current outlook, which is just a snapshot of the current state of play and not a projection of what will happen on November 8, the states solidly in Clinton’s corner or leaning in her direction add up to 307 electoral votes    well above the required 270 to win the White House. Trump’s got 179 electoral votes either solidly or leaning his way.
