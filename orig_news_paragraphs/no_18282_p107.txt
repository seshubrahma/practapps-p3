Like ICE agents yanking people   out of their homes. It’’s terrible. I saw an interview with the   Homeland [Security] Secretary Kelly, who said, "Well, if we knock   on their homes"  —   what do they call it?   ?      in America? So if we knock and we talk to them and   we find out they’’re here illegally, they’’re criminals.
