Even without much life experience, Dykeman has a great deal to say about life. " Family of Earth" is ultimately a tribute to the authorâ€™s father, who was 60 when she was born and died when she was 14. Cleverly organizing her book into 14 chapters, each accounting for a year of her life with her father, Dykeman somehow manages to make even her infancy and toddlerhood worthy of reflection.
