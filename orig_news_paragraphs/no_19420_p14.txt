" ’ ’    "We are doing what journalists throughout said mainstream media   are supposed to do: Challenge the conventional wisdom, hold   politicians’’ feet to the fire, ask tough questions, report facts   that are in many cases inconvenient truths for career   politicians, and give a voice to the millions of people worldwide   who have had theirs taken away from them by world elites who   consider the ordinary person beneath them," Boyle said.
