Mr. Oettinger has found both critics and detractors. Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German member of the European Parliament, likened Mr. Oettinger’s remarks to those of Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president of the United States. " This is the moment where EU leaders can prove that they won’t let someone like Trump   top decision maker," Mr. Albrecht, a member of the Greens, wrote on Twitter.
