The Texas law was passed in 2013 by the   Texas Legislature and turned a Democratic state senator, Wendy Davis, who conducted an   filibuster against the law, into a national political star. Last June, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, largely upheld the contested provisions of the Texas law, saying it had to accept lawmakers’ assertions about the health benefits of abortion restrictions. The appeals court ruled that the law, with minor exceptions, did not place an undue burden on the right to abortion. Justice Breyer said the appeals court’s approach was at odds with the proper application of the   standard.
