And why donâ€™t they stop right there, and turn to the American people, and apologize to us? Apologize to the thousands of Americans and families who have victims, their own sons and daughters, moms and dads who have been killed by some of these illegals, these criminals? Never once have they talked to the parents of murdered children here in my state, and yet they would gladly apologize in a second to the leaders of Mexico, to leaders in Europe. And finally, we need leaders like Donald Trump, or whoever the Republican nominee is, that stands up for America, and finally puts american families, our security, our military first for once.
