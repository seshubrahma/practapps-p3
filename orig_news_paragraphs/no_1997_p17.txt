The United States has a particular kind of One China policy, meant to accomplish three main goals: keep positive relations with Beijing, with which the United States has a host of agreements and interests protect and assist Taiwan, a fellow democracy and prevent the outbreak of war. Though the United States officially broke off relations with Taiwan in 1979, it maintains a nonprofit center known as the American Institute in Taiwan, which acts as a barely unofficial embassy. The United States has also worked to promote Taiwanâ€™s democracy and has sold it advanced military equipment, though these sales have declined in recent years. In this way, the United States is able to deny Taiwan recognition, yet also ensure it is strong enough to remain functionally independent.
