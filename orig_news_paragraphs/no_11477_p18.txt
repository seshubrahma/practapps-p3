That’s exactly what’s been happening under this Democratic rule. They’ve been feeding other countries, sending billions and billions to other countries, and we have people in the inner cities in our poor white communities, poor Hispanic, poor black, poor Arab communities, Asian communities, that need that money. We have homeless veterans that need those millions and billions. And so, once I started breaking it down on the issues, and stopped really thinking about it emotionally, I realized that as an American, if I didn’t take off my Democratic or my Republican hat, that I would be voting for the downfall of the country.
