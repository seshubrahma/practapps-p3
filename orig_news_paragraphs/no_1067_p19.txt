When Polk left the White House he came home to Nashville, and his wife stayed there for decades afterward," Mr. Van West told The Nashville Scene last week. On Wednesday, Mr. Price, the curator of Polk House, gave a tour of the   historical property. It was late afternoon and there were no other visitors. The handsome   home was built by Polkâ€™s father in 1816.
