■ Sheri A. Dillon, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, took the stage to describe how her client would turn over his business assets to a trust. "  Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests," she said, adding that Mr. Trump’s sons will make all decisions for the company "without any involvement whatsoever" from Mr. Trump. She said Mr. Trump would resign from all positions he holds with the Trump Organization, as would his daughter Ivanka. ■ Ms. Dillon said that the Trump Organization would be allowed to make no new foreign deals during the presidency and that any new domestic deals would be subject to strict restrictions.
