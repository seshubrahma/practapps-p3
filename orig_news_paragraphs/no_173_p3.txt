Melanne Verveer, executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and former ambassador at large for global womenâ€™s issues under President Obama, said that "to just look at this election through the gender lens is not to understand it fully. " Though many women saw Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, as the most qualified candidate, other women felt no tug to help one of their own shatter a glass ceiling and instead "reached a conclusion that they might be better off with a change," Ms. Verveer said.
