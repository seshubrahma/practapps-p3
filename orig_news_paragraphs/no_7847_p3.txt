The Cruz campaign stated that the office openings will allow volunteers to connect quickly with the campaign as they make campaign calls and walk door to door. Cruz logged his first state win in the     caucus state of Iowa. Since then candidate Donald Trump has taken the lead in delegates with 384 to Cruzâ€™s 300 prior to results from the four Tuesday, March 8 primary elections. Cruz won his home state of Texas in the March 1 "Super Tuesday" contest, delivering a large chunk of his delegate count.
