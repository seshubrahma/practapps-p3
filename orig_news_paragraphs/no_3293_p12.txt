U. S. officials have not said anything about the plans for upgrading the immigration tests and vetting, partly because Trump has not yet been able to get many of his   nominees confirmed by the Senate.

C. audience on Tuesday that "we have a sacred duty and that is the continuation of the United States as we know it: To protect our way of life and the exceptional people we are. " Australiaâ€™s reform government has an easier task than Trump, who must overcome roadblocks built by progressive judges, media and Democratic legislator and Democratic legislatures in a   federal government for 330 million people.
