Sen. Steven Daines (R. .) warned Warren that when she quoted Sen. Edward Kennedy saying in 1986 that Sessions was a "disgrace to the Justice Department," she was in violation of Senate Rule XIX. The rule forbids senators demeaning the character of fellow senators, regardless of whether they are speaking in their voice or quoting someone else. After Daines warned Warren about her referring to Sessions as a disgrace, the Massachusetts senator began to read from a   letter from Coretta Scott King. In the 1986 letter, King wrote that Sessions used his power as a federal prosecutor to keep black citizens from voting.
