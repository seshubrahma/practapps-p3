In one very terse exchange, Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, said he was doing everything he could to not accuse Sessions of lying in his testimony before the committee.

" Sessions did not say that he met twice with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, which angered Democrats last week.
