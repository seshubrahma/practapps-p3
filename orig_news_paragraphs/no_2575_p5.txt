Mr. Trump appeared briefly chastened on Tuesday night, delivering a prepared victory speech free of vulgarity or racial attacks. But he quickly reverted to a more improvisational style, complaining in multiple interviews that Republicans had been wrong to criticize him for denouncing a federal judge because of  his Hispanic heritage. Still, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan assured colleagues in a conference on Wednesday that he remained supportive of Mr. Trumpâ€™s candidacy. Mr. Ryan had  criticized him this week for using "racist" language in criticizing Gonzalo P. Curiel, a United States District Court judge overseeing litigation involving Mr. Trump.
