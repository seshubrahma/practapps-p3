The governing party of Matteo Renzi trails on 27 per cent. The new polls are particularly bad news for Italyâ€™s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, reports Euractiv, as he has staked his career on a programme of reforms that M5S opposes. He has promised to resign his position should his government lose the forthcoming referendum on his package of reforms for Italy in October. Italy, like other European nations uses   elections which generally have worked to deprive   parties of office.
