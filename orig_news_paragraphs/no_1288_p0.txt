Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Monday that the Fed was shifting its focus from stimulating the economy to keeping growth on an even keel. She said the economy was "pretty healthy," thanks in part to the Fedâ€™s   stimulus campaign, which the central bank is moving to end. " Looking forward, I think the economy is going to continue to grow at a moderate pace," Ms. Yellen said during an event at the University of Michigan.
