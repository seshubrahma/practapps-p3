After all, it seemed not to match the Trump they just saw on TV, even though the Times story was posted after the Arizona event. Here’s the top of the piece: This 11 p. m. version made no mention of Trump’s invitation to have individuals join him onstage to share the names of relatives who they said were killed by illegal immigrants. Nor did it refer to Trump’s line that his enforcement priorities would include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays and those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals. That doesn’t sound like a stark turnaround from the old Trump.
