From a peak of 1. 58 billion, annual U. S. ticket sales have declined 16% from its 2002 high  …    or just over a quarter of a billion seats per year. This decline occurred while the population, number of theaters, and number of movies made annually all increased. The slide also started before the proliferation of social media, cheap flat screens, streaming services, and the like. A large segment of the American public is finding other things to do  —   and political lectures won’t help buck that trend.
