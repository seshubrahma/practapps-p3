The Pentagon does not consider the two groups linked. The Turkish government warned Tuesday that it would advance on Manbij because of the presence of the Kurdish fighters, though US military officials said they have long left the town. The agreement between the Manbij Council and Moscow could be aimed at deterring a Turkish advance by placing Russian and Syrian troops between the town and the Turkish military. A US defense official told CNN, however, that there werenâ€™t any visible indications that Turkey was launching such an offensive.
