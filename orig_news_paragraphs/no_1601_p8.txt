He was a top adviser to Richard M. Nixon’s presidential campaign in 1968, softening the candidate’s   unapproachable image. He was also a   debate coach, working with President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and readying Vice President George Bush for debates with Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988. According to Gabriel Sherman’s 2014 book on Mr. Ailes, "The Loudest Voice in the Room," Mr. Ailes played a crucial role before Reagan’s second debate with Vice President Walter F. Mondale in 1984. During a prep session, he asked Reagan, who had performed badly in the first debate, how he would handle being asked about his age.
