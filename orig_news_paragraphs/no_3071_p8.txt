Mr. Grannis worked on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security with responsibilities for intelligence, aviation security, and science and technology from 2003 to 2005 and was Senior Policy Advisor to Representative Jane Harman on matters of national security from 2001 to 2003. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security would neither confirm nor deny that Grannis was the author of, or had reviewed, the leaked draft document, though it did appear to be authored by someone associated with his area of responsibility within DHS. " The report was incomplete and had not been subject to the extensive interagency review process required of finished intelligence products," spokesperson Gillian Christensen tells Breitbart News, adding: Further, the report does not include data from other intelligence community sources.
