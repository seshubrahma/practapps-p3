Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testifies in front of the Senate intelligence committee and directly contradicts repeated assertions by the Trump White House that Comey was disliked and distrusted by the rank and file at the FBI.    Trump sits for an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in the afternoon, in which he insists he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Rosenstein memo    throwing two days of White House spin out the window    and acknowledges that Comey’s interest in the Russia investigation played a role in his dismissal. (The White House had repeatedly insisted the Russia investigation had nothing to do with Trump’s decision.) As a cherry on top of the day, Trump gets into a Twitter fight with comedian    and longtime nemesis    Rosie O’Donnell.
