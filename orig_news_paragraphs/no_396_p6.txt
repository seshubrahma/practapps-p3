During a   hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats painted Mr. Sessions as an extremist legal savant for Mr. Trump in support of   ideologies, while Republicans portrayed him as a   lawyer and    prosecutor who would enforce the law as written. " How could we possibly conclude that this nominee will be independent?" asked Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She said that Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general fired late Monday, showed "guts" and independence in refusing to defend Mr. Trumpâ€™s executive order banning immigrants from seven largely Muslim countries.
