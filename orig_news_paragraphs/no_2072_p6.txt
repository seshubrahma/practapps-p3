Other studies compared women who had abortions with women who chose to give birth, two groups considered so different that many experts said little could be learned from comparing them. Other studies also failed to account for whether women had previous psychological issues, which turns out to put them at greatest risk for mental health problems after abortion. The Turnaway Study accounted for mental health history and focused on women who were close to or beyond the limit of when a clinic would perform abortions, so researchers could compare women who wanted abortions at the outset. Clinic cutoff limits vary somewhat by state, but also by individual clinic decisions.
