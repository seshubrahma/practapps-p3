Explaining why politicians in Belgium were so happy to look the other way when it came to Islamism, he said: "The leftist parties would have vanished from Brussels without the support of the Muslim population here. And we have to let people know in the United States that according to demographic reports, we now have approximately   per cent Muslim population, and this is   every day by the migrant invasion. " According to these demographic trends, we will have a Muslim majority in 15 to 25 years in Brussels, because of high birth rates and the migrant influx.
