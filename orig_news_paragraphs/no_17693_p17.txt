The United Nations will regret this vote and I hope the   Obama administration will realize the massive mistake they made   on their way out of the door. " ’ ’   Nikki Haley, Trump’’s pick to replace Samantha Power as the US   ambassador to the UN, said during her Senate confirmation hearing   last week that the UN is a body that is "often at odds with   American national interests," and called the US’’s decision to   abstain from the Israel vote "a terrible mistake. " ’ ’    She said that while the US should reexamine its   "disproportionate" financial contribution to the UN, she doesn’’t   think there should be "a slash and burn" of the US’’s support for   the organization.
