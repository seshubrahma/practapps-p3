A sitting senator, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, added his voice to Trump’s attack in remarks before the GOP nominee took the stage, saying "they will not succeed" in manipulating the election. Asked for comment in light of Trump’s remarks, the office of Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan vouched for the integrity of the US electoral process Saturday afternoon. " Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity," said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan.
