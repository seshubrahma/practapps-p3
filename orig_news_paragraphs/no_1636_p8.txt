A documentary, "Weiner," released in May, traced the disastrous campaign and the effects on Ms. Abedin, who is shown near tears after the sexting revelations were made public. ■ According to a New York Times report, Ms. Abedin learned only on Sunday while the couple were in the Hamptons with their son that Mr. Weiner had sent a photo of himself and the boy to the unidentified woman. ■ Mr. Weiner’s ties to the Clinton campaign make his explicit messages a useful weapon by the Trump camp in the bruising race to the White House. Indeed, Mr. Trump released a statement on Monday that said the episode was an issue of national security.
