Former federal prosecutor Laura Coates chimed in that while she did not believe Trump fired Comey for the reasons he stated, Comey had given President Trump reason to fire him. Comey "was wrong to usurp the role of the Attorney General," she said, and noted that he had justified doing so again last week in testimony before Congress. Host Don Lemon pushed back against Dershowitz and Coates, noting that he agreed with Toobin that the simpler explanation  —   that Trump was trying to cover something up   —   was more likely.
