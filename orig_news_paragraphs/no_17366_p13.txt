Hacking continues, Russian cyberhacking activity has continued largely unabated since the election, including against US political organizations, US officials briefed on the investigation told CNN. Among the attempted cyberbreaches are phishing attempts targeting Clintonâ€™s campaign, one official said. The attempt to breach the Clinton campaign was unsuccessful, investigators believe.   The attempts appear to trace back to some of the same Russian hackers behind the breaches of Democratic Party organizations in the past year, one official said.
