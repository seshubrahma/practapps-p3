I look forward to working with Sen. Graham, and with the incoming Administration of   Trump, to significantly reduce or even eliminate U. S. funding of the United Nations, and also to seriously reconsider financial support for the nations that supported this resolution. For those who have put your name to this despicable attack on Israel, you did so with full knowledge of the consequences of your actions. And for those who acquiesced or facilitated the UN resolution —  especially President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and Ambassador Power —   history will record your abiding and shameful legacy undermining our friend and ally Israel.
