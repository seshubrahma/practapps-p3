One group of women had another set of signs: "Democrats for Trump" "Teacher for Trump" and "Suburban Moms for Trump. " There was a "Cubans for Trump" sign, a "Latinas for Trump" sign, and also a "Latinos for Trump" sign, on which its owner had listed his preference for an end to open borders and illegal immigration.   And in the back of the bleachers behind the stage, there were several "Gays for Trump" signs, one of which incorporated the rainbow Gay Pride flag.
