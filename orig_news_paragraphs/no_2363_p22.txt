The group includes Ms. Conway and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, as well as Stephen K. Bannon, the campaign’s chief executive, and Mr. Trump’s    Jared Kushner. Mrs. Clinton is also practicing. At a "Family Town Hall" in Haverford, Pa. on Tuesday, she nearly leapt out of her chair to respond to a    high school student who said she worried that Mr. Trump’s comments about women hurt the body image of girls her age. Her formal preparations include drills and mock debates with Mr. Podesta and Karen Dunn, a Washington lawyer Jake Sullivan, her chief policy adviser Ron Klain, a veteran presidential debate coach, and Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign’s communications director.
