To help boost ratings, ABC scheduled the latest episode of Modern Family, which also features themes of homosexuality and   parenting, before the show’s second installment, although this did not prove effective. When We Rise is not the first   series to receive poor ratings. Shows including USA Network’s gay murder mystery series Eyewitness, (also directed by Hasak) as well as CBS’s Doubt, starring transgender actor Laverne Cox, were both canceled after their respective first season for failing to attract audiences. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has pledged to uphold Barack Obama’s executive order protecting LGBT federal employees from discrimination.
