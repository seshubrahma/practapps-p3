Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer   journalist and immigration activist who  revealed that he is undocumented in The New York Times Magazine in 2011, said that gestures like Ms. Laraâ€™s were part of a larger effort on behalf of undocumented people to be open and upfront about their status. " Being undocumented is part of her identity, as is being a Latina," he said Thursday. He added, "For many undocumented people, this is our way of telling people that we are not who people think we are. "
