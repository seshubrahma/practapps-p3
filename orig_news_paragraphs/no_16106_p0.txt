Warsaw, Poland (CNN) President Barack Obama said Friday that the nation was "horrified" after what he called "a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement" in Dallas. The White House announced Friday evening that the President would cut short his European trip by one day and visit Dallas early next week. It was the second somber statement about shootings on American soil the President made from Europe in less than 12 hours.
