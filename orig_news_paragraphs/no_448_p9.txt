President Trump has taken some heat for his phone manners since it emerged that he pretty much chewed out Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia before hanging up on him. Apparently Mr. Trump is unrepentant. According to the new online newsletter Axios, Mr. Trump had an unpleasant conversation with the chief executive of Uber, Travis Kalanick, after the brash entrepreneur quit  the president’s business council in protest of his executive order banning some foreigners from entering the country. Some in Mr. Trump’s "inner circle" suggested that Mr. Kalanick was cutting off his access to the White House.
