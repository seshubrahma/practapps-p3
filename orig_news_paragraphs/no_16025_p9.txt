Those views match up well with what the rank and file of today’s Republican Party already believes.    For example, nearly 70 percent of Republicans support Trump’s ban on Muslims coming to the United States. On immigration, 70 percent of Republicans support building a wall along the Mexican border and a 2015 CNN poll found that 63 percent of Republicans support deporting all of the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants     both positions Trump has vocally championed during his campaign.
