A    resident of the attacked town, Mariam Abu Khalil, said she had left home for her examination on the Quran  —   scheduled for early morning because fewer bombings were expected then   —   when the attack took place. On the way, she saw an aircraft drop a bomb on a   building a few dozen yards away. In a telephone interview Tuesday night, she described an explosion like a yellow mushroom cloud that stung her eyes.
