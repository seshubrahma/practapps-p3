The Ricketts family, which financed much of the   advertising barrage during the primary, includes a fellow Midwestern governor    Nebraska’s Pete Ricketts    who has praised Pence’s "steady, strategic leadership. "  Pence, however, has not inspired them to change their position and donate to the Republican ticket, according to a source close to the Ricketts family. The same is true for Paul Singer, a New York   worth $2 billion who had been supporting Pence, according to a Republican source. Pence does have strong allies who could decide to help the   ticket.
