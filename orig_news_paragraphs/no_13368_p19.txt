Rubioâ€™s claim that "it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace an American worker," is simply not true. Replacing American workers with   workers is legal. As page 35 of the Department of Labor Strategic Plan plainly states: "  nondependent employers are not subject to the conditions, and their   workers may be hired even when a qualified U. S. worker wants the job, and a U. S. worker can be displaced from the job in favor of the foreign worker. "
