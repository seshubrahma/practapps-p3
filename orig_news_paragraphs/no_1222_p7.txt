A few elections aren’t enough to prove that turnout is really shifting. But there are other signs of higher Democratic enthusiasm, like the millions who marched and protested a day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, or the abundant   for Mr. Ossoff. Parties out of power have long tended to do very well in midterm elections. It has been less clear why  —   maybe because of turnout, or because voters swing across parties to check the president.
