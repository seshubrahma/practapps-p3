Although Ivanka Trump does not have a formal title in her father ’s administration, she was spotted in the West Wing on Sunday by the White House pool reporter. She was a key adviser throughout her father’s campaign, and is expected to continue to play an important role in the Trump White House.   The first daughter formally stepped away from the Trump Organization and her namesake apparel and accessories brand earlier this month, writing at the time that she was planning to focus on settling in her children to their new home and schools.
