The report also found that the wall, which will secure over 1, 250 miles of the southern border between the United States and Mexico, could take three and a half years to build, meaning it would be completed at the end of 2020, potentially when Trump is out of office. The current Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) retired Marine General John Kelly, previously said the construction of the wall could be completed in under two years. However, Trump dismissed claims of an inflated cost, writing in a tweet that "I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the design or negotiations yet.
