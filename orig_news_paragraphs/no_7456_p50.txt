Trump seems to gather his   campaign style from his career in business. He does not look at campaigning like a traditional politician, and he baffled the pundits and political consultants throughout the primaries by successfully storming his way to the nomination with less than 100 staffers compared to what amounted to standing armies his opponents like Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) had built. Since he has become the GOP nominee, he has rounded his campaign out with many more staff nationwide —  at the headquarters up at Trump Tower in New York City and throughout the states like this —   but he still has that businessman mentality at heart.
