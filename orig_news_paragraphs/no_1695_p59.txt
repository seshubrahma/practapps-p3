Other candidates are Rob Goldstein, the    chief operating officer and driving force behind Aladdin’s growth Mark McCombe, 50, a former HSBC executive who looks after the firm’s big clients Rich Kushel, 50, who oversees   investment strategies for clients and Gary Shedlin, 52, the chief financial officer.
