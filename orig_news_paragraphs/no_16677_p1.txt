Threats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the White House and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif. and most recently after the attacks in New York and New Jersey. Polls generally show that voters trust Trump more than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism.    Trumpâ€™s tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the   border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise.   While a majority (63%) of white,   Americans say immigrants from Muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks.
