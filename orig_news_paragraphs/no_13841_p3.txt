Band members said Thursday they were excited for the chance to represent the    ensemble and their college.   Head drum major Devon Julian, 21, of New Orleans, said it would be "an honor and an accomplishment. "   "Not too many people could say they were able to march for a president of the United States in an inaugural parade," Julian said in the Talladega College band room.
