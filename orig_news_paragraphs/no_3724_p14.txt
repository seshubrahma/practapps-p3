That is not what Trump said, but apparently the media had decided any and all attacks on NATO, from everyone, constitute agreement with Trump. Various levels of pushback and panic fill the bulk of CNN’s article, including the   German Foreign Minister,   Steinmeier, portraying the alliance as "rattled" by Trump’s remarks, and relaying "concerns" from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. " A strong NATO is good for the United States, just as it is for Europe," declared NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu.
