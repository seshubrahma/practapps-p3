—  a   poll conducted after Labor Day had him up three points over Clinton while a JMC Analytics poll had him up four and a PPP poll and a Suffolk poll each had Trump leading by a single point. But a bevy of other surveys since then —  a Monmouth poll showing Clinton up 5 points, a   poll with her up 4 points, and New York Times and Fox 13 polls with her up one point in each —  have come out dampening his momentum. A new Emerson poll in Florida has Trump up by 1 point, while Quinnipiac and University of North Florida polls have Trump down 5 points and 3 points respectively.
