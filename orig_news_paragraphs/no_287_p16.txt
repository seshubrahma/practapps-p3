The Trump broadside on Wednesday, coming as the Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, was to begin preliminary talks in Washington, was a new low in bilateral relations. Mr. Videgaray orchestrated Mr. Trump’s visit to Mexico during the campaign last year, when he was finance minister. The move drew such widespread condemnation that Mr. Videgaray resigned. After Mr. Trump’s victory, Mr. Videgaray’s fortunes revived and he became foreign minister.
