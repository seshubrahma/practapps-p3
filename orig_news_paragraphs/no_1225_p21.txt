In my experience, the successful men that I have met have not lacked confidence in their abilities. Through the Women4Climate initiative we are asking young, talented and potentially powerful women to believe in their abilities, believe in their chance, because our planet needs them. What challenges do you see in light of President Trumpâ€™s sharply differing views of climate change compared with those of President Barack Obama? Whatever happens at the White House, I am convinced that together, cities, businesses and citizens will save the planet.
