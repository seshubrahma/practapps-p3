At an earlier meeting about two weeks into the administration, Ms. McFarland invoked Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign slogan, telling the assembled group of career staff members, most of whom had been in the same roles during the Obama administration, that they needed to "make America great again. " It was not clear whether Dina Powell, whom General McMaster brought in as deputy national security adviser for strategy, would succeed Ms. McFarland as the principal deputy. The official in that role leads interagency "deputies committee" meetings in the Situation Room involving the No. 2 officials from national security agencies and government departments.
