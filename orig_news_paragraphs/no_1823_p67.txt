Most visitors can expect to pay $40 to $60 per night, but pricing is annoyingly dynamic depending on demand (the highest rate I’ve seen was $104, lowest was $33). Traditional hotels aren’t really Brooklyn’s strong suit, but I had a decent experience at the Red Lion Inn  Suites, close to Boerum Hill in Gowanus.
