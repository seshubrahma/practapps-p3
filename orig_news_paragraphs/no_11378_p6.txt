I’m a big believer that Steve Bannon is a lot smarter than Donald Trump and he is really driving this. I think Steve Bannon has gotten to the point where there is a high probability Donald will not win, so he is playing this whole thing out to the benefit of Breitbart News. When you watch him tonight, ask how many things are Donald saying that are truly Donald’s perspective and his positions, versus things —   could they help Breitbart News?
