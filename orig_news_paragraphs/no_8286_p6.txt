Another video that says it is paid for by "Friends of John McCain" attempts to portray Dr. Ward as a   conspiracy theorist by branding her as "chemtrail Kelli".   After her State Senate office had received numerous questions about chemtrails, Dr. Ward facilitated a meeting between constituents concerned about chemtrails and experts who explained what was really going on   â€”   hardly a controversy. McCain can sling a lot of mud with the more than $10 million his campaign has raised so far, with more likely on the way given his deep connections to political insiders and GOP money men.
