A cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC posts a public notice on its website describing an attack on the political committee’s computer network by two groups associated with Russian intelligence. According to the post, two   groups called "Cozy Bear" and "Fancy Bear" tunneled into the committee’s computer system. In response, a blogger called Guccifer 2. 0 claims that he alone conducted the hack, not the Russians. As proof, he posts internal DNC memos and opposition research on Trump.
