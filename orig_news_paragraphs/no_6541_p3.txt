The controversy arose last week after students received their yearbooks and two students noticed that their Donald Trump shirts had been censored out of their class photo, one by cropping and another by photoshopping. A third student found that a Donald Trump quote she wanted to be printed next to her photo was left out. A few days after the story was picked up by the national media, the teacher responsible for the censorship was placed on suspension. Superintendent Dyer later confirmed that the teacher, Susan Parsons, a   veteran of the school district, was put on suspension with pay while the district decided what else it might do about the incident.
