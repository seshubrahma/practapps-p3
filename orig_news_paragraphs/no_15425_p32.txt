Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn’t find anything and continued to believe Clinton’s practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges. After Clinton’s loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part. Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour: "I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey’s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off." After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.
