Congress can remove a justice through impeachment for corrupt behavior or other abuses of office, but this has never happened. Chief justices are sworn in by the outgoing chief justices. Associate justices are sworn in by the current chief justice or one of the other associate justices. Each justice oversees at least one of the 12 Federal Judicial Circuit Courts.
