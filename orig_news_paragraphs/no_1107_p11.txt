Cathy Han, a real estate agent in New York who specializes in marketing   properties to Chinese buyers  —   including apartments in   buildings   —   said she was not surprised that the home had been purchased by a Chinese buyer. " When I saw it was Trump’s birth house property for sale, I knew immediately it would get a lot of attention from Chinese buyers," Ms. Han said.
