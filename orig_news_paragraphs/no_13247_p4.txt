Trump has also vociferously attacked   trade authority, which the American Jobs Alliance’s Curtis Ellis has explained would "surrender [Congress’s] constitutional authority" and "strip Congress of its ability to vet or amend" international trade deals. By a minimum of 92 percent, GOP voters oppose Ryan’s expansive immigration polices, and by a nearly    margin they believe that Ryan’s globalist trade deals will reduce wages, not increase them. It is interesting that National Review, rather than going after Ryan —   who directly violated a pledge that he made to the Republican electorate and the publication’s readership —   has instead decided to go after Trump. It is similarly noteworthy that while National Review is pulling out all the stops to keep Trump from assuming control of the White House, the publication has been effusive in its praise of Sen. Marco Rubio, who like Paul Ryan, has pushed for massive expansions to immigration that would disenfranchise the GOP electorate and, according to polling data, would put conservative policy victories perhaps permanently out of reach.
