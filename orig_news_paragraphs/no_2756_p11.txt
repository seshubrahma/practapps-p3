A senior adviser to Mr. Trump on Thursday indicated that his oldest daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Mr. Kushner, are likely to take formal roles in the White House, saying the transition team believes there’s an "exception" to the   law. " The   law apparently has an exception if you want to work in the West Wing, because the president is able to appoint his own staff," said the adviser, Kellyanne Conway, who was Mr. Trump’s final campaign manager, on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" program. Ms. Conway said that whichever children went into the White House would need a "complete distinction and separation" from Trump business ties, which she called a "sacrifice" for them.
