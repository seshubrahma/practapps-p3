Washington (CNN) Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard acknowledged Friday that Hillary Clinton is the presumptive Democratic nominee    but the Bernie Sanders backer isn’t ready to support the former secretary of state. " I think there’s a Democratic presumptive nominee at this point," Gabbard told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" when asked if she was still supporting the Vermont senator.
