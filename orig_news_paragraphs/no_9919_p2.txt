" When Breitbart News reached out to Ryan’s office to ask if they had issued a public press statement about the attack, they did not respond. The Speaker’s official Twitter page is similarly quiet about the Ohio refugee attack. A review of his Twitter page shows that in the days following the attempted mass slaughter, Ryan’s team posted 33 tweets and retweets about #CuresNow, as well as roughly 23 tweets and retweets about Speaker Ryan’s #ABetterWay agenda, and 10 tweets and retweets about   Donald J. Trump’s cabinet picks.
