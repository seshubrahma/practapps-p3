President pro Tempore of the California State Senate Kevin de Leon, who has defiantly announced the state would oppose President Donald Trumpâ€™s plans for the enforcement of immigration law, said in a statement issued Thursday: There are reports that ICE today executed raids across Southern California. I have asked federal officials to disclose how many children, men, and women they have detained what the processing time will be what the rationale is for their detention and I asked that everyone be offered access to an attorney. De Leon announced an update on February 1 to his "California Values Act" bill that would effectively make California a sanctuary state.
