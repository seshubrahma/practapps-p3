It was clear to Democratic lawmakers, many of whom chided Comey at various points of the   briefing for his role in investigating Hillary Clinton’s emails, that Comey never reached out to Wasserman Schultz, the lawmaker said. Wasserman Schultz later said in a statement to CNN that she wouldn’t compromise any information said in the meeting but that Comey should clarify the agency’s policies when investigating the hacking by foreign governments. " There are further questions that must be answered by Director Comey, who must provide more clarity on this and other questions that have arisen surrounding the FBI’s handling of Russian hacking during the 2016 election cycle," she said in the statement.
