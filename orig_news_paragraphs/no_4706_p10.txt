Here Rhodes did more than repeat the false accusations in the Forward: he also took aim at Gorka’s notable criticism of radical Islam, a threat Rhodes and his former boss refused even to pronounce. The culmination of this new "echo chamber" came last weekend, with an NBC News piece that tried, and failed, to prove Gorka’s associations with Hungarian extremists but smeared him anyway, citing a fraudulent organization. And so a smear that started with a discredited report on an   blog has been promoted, via the Forward  —   which has an actual problem with antisemitism, having linked Zionists absurdly and outragously with Nazis   —   into the front ranks of the mainstream media and finally to the big network news stage, but remains essentially empty. It is the "echo chamber," reborn  —   or, rather, undead, a sort of zombie, totally impervious to truth.
