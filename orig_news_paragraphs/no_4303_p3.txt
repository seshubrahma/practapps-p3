Reporters at Thursday’s White House press briefing repeatedly questioned Spicer whether the White House was satisfied with its vetting of Flynn before he became the national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn  —   a retired   Army general who had led the Defense Intelligence Agency   —    "was a career military officer who maintained a   security clearance throughout his career in the military" and that his clearance had been reissued by the Obama administration in 2016 after Flynn’s trip to Russia.
