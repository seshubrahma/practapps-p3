In 2013, the country’s highest court ruled that Japan’s elections existed "in a state of unconstitutionality," due to the extra voting power wielded by rural voters. (This warning, however, failed to prompt   changes to the system.) The result has been policies that hurt the urban majority but benefited the rural minority. Michael Thies, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, credited the power of the rural vote in Japan with delaying structural reforms to the economy, such as lowering the country’s onerous food import tariffs and decreasing   agricultural subsidies.
