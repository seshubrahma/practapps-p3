  Mayor Carlos Giménez has instructed county jails to comply with all federal immigration detainer requests on Thursday, only one day after President Donald Trump issued an executive order to cut federal funding from sanctuary cities. [In 2016, the county ignored approximately 100 detainer requests from U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which would have cost the county about $52, 000 to implement, according to the Miami Herald.   According to a report from the   Center for Immigration Studies,   County refused to honor 771 detainer requests from January 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015. That’s at least 871 illegal aliens allowed to remain in the U. S. including 575 with criminal records.
