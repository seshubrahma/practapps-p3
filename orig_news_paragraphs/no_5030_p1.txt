[Mario and Miriam de la Pena: Their son Mario Manuel de la Pena was murdered by the Castro regime in 1996 at the age of 25, while serving as a volunteer pilot for the humanitarian operation Brothers to the Rescue. He flew almost a hundred    missions before his plane and another Brothers to the Rescue aircraft were shot down by a Cuban   over international waters, killing three U. S. citizens and one legal resident of the United States.    The unprovoked attack on two unarmed,   planes was a blatant crime against humanity and violation of American law. The shootdown was condemned by both the United Nations Security Council and the U. N. Commission on Human Rights.
