And then we’ve got some smart and entertaining counterprogramming. The books I’m most interested in this week are all very personal stories. First up is Ann Patchett’s new novel, "Commonwealth," which she calls her most autobiographical to date. If that means it’s anywhere near as good as her   collection, "This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage," I’ll be happy.
