Hunter’s oddly purple prose is instead the sycophantic behaviour of a provocateur who’s been exposed, beaten and then bullied into conformity. These men of   are neither embraced by the original communities that harboured them, nor accepted by the new communities they surrender to. Instead, they’re paraded in front of the public, like a captured foe at a Roman Triumph, before, at best, being quietly forgotten. I come not to bury Jack Hunter, for clearly he’s already six feet under.
