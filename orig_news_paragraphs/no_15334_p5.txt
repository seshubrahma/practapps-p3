She is, though, expected to give her version of events when she informed the White House about her concerns that Flynn may have been "compromised" by the Russians, contradicting Spicer’s comment that Yates was simply giving officials a "heads up" about the   security advisor, the source said. Her appearance will bookend a week’s worth of testimony and inquiry about the investigation, starting with Wednesday’s Senate judiciary committee hearing with Comey, where Russia will be a big topic of discussion. Comey is also expected to meet behind closed doors Thursday with members of the House intelligence committee.    The Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing Yates’ testimony is also seeking to have former national security advisor Susan Rice testify before the committee next week, Sen. Lindsey Graham,   Carolina, the chairman of the panel, told CNN.
