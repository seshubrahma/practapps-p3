Dallalâ€™s husband was a translator for the US military and was allowed into the United States last summer after applying for asylum under the Special Immigrant Visa program.   Dallal was on her way to reunite with him when she received a document at the Irbil, Iraq, airport advising her she would not be allowed to travel to the United States. " I was about to get on the plane, and they called my name," she said.
