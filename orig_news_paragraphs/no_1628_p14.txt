"Trump Revealed" deftly charts his   building of his gaudy brand and his often masterful manipulation of the media. It provides a succinct account of Mr. Trump’s childhood, when he says he punched a teacher, giving him a black eye. It also recounts his apprenticeship to a demanding father, who told him he needed to become a "killer" in anything he did, and how he learned the art of the counterattack from Roy Cohn, Joseph McCarthy’s former   man, whom Mr. Trump hired to countersue the federal government after the Justice Department brought a case against the Trump family firm in 1973 for violating the Fair Housing Act.
