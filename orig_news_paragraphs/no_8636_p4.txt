The Republican frontrunner immediately returned fire by blowing the lid off the DC Media’s 20 year   of around a dozen women who accuse both Bill and Hillary of victimizing them. In the case of Monica Lewinski, Paula Jones, and Gennifer Flowers, no one questions Bill’s predatory   dishonest behavior, and we all were witness to Hillary’s role in attempting to silence and destroy these women. This is why this New Hampshire poll is also very bad news for a DC Media dedicated to electing Hillary Clinton president. Their   plans are crumbling right along with hers.
