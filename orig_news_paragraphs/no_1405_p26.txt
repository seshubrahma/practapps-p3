In a speech on the Senate floor as Congress returned from a break, the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, sought to yoke Mr. Trump to his counterpart, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  —   and to every Republican running this fall. Mr. Reid pointed out that Mr. McConnell, interviewed on NBC on Sunday, had "repeatedly refused to say Donald Trump’s attacks on Judge Curiel’s ethnicity are racist. " " This is precisely the type of failure that gave rise to Donald Trump in the first place," Mr. Reid said.
