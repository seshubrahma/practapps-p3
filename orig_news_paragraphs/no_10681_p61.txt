Sanders says that   are missing the main point that Republicans and Democrats hate each other in Congress. He says that is a mythology created by the media and he has a point as establishment Republicans and Democrats agree on things like amnesty legislation, etc. and hate politicians who stand up for voters. He points out the main problem is that lobbyists control Congress instead of voters.
