Clinton’s lead is consistent with most   polling of the Buckeye state, where Clinton is generally shown leading by   digits.   The Monmouth poll found Clinton and Trump performing about the same with voters of their respective parties, which suggests there is growing party unity as the election approaches and both candidates continue to work to shore up their base. Trump is backed by 83% of Republicans, and Clinton gets the support of 88% of Democrats.   Meanwhile, independents back Trump and Clinton in equal measure    35%    with a full 20% saying they’ll go for Johnson.
