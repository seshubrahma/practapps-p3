The Administration’s omission of the Jewish people in a Holocaust remembrance statement is an historical mistake," she tweeted. Asked about the White House explanation that the President didn’t want to exclude any of the other groups Nazis killed by specifically mentioning Jews,    League President Jonathan Greenblatt told CNN after Friday’s statement was issued that the United Nations established International Holocaust Remembrance Day not only because of Holocaust denial but also because so many countries    Iran, Russia, Poland and Hungary, for example    specifically refuse to acknowledge Hitler’s attempt to exterminate Jews, "opting instead to talk about generic suffering rather than recognizing this catastrophic incident for what is was: the intended genocide of the Jewish people. " Downplaying or disregarding the degree to which Jews were targeted for elimination during the Holocaust is a common theme of nationalist movements like those seen in Russia and Eastern Europe, Greenblatt said.
