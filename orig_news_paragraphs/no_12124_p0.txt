Sunday on CNN’s "Fareed Zakaria GPS," when asked about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, President Barack Obama said he expected that Americans will say "no" to Trump’s policy measures.   Obama said, "There’s a long tradition in the United States of inclusion, immigration, diversity, but also people once they’re included in what they consider to be the real America, worried about outsiders, contaminating, polluting, messing up a good thing. That’s not new. That dates back to the beginning of this country.
