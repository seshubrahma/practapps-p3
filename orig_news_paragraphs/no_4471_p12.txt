How about we NOT send U. S. troops to some godforsaken nation of primitives? My reasoning is: It will cost us trillions of dollars we will sacrifice the lives of an untold number of our best young men in combat (and little girls   —   thanks, liberals!) and we will accomplish absolutely nothing, apart from creating a new stream of "refugees" and making the primitives even angrier with us, if that’s possible.
