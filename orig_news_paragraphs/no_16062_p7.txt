Sherrod Brown: The senator from Ohio is a swing state liberal with political experience who could energize the Democrats. He has a long record of hitting hard on the economic issues that have so concerned Democratic and Republican voters and he could help make sure that Trump does not steal the swing states that will be essential to his victory.   Brown has the ability to play well with blue collar workers who are looking for evidence from either party that they will keep listening to them once the ballots close.
