This poll, from Franklin and Marshall College, shows a tightening of the race since its past surveys. Trump has held a lead in Pennsylvania since October, but the lead is decreasing as other candidates drop out of the race and support consolidates behind his remaining challengers. Kasich has been the primary beneficiary of this, seeing his support surge from 3 percent in January to effectively tied for the lead today. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is currently third, with 20 percent support.
