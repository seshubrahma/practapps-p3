" I just want to reassure people that what   Donald Trump said on election night, he absolutely meant from the bottom of his heart. He is preparing to be the president of all of the people of the United Satates of America, and to watch him bringing together people of diverse views, bringing together people that differed with him strongly, seeing him talk to leaders around the world, I just want to reassure every American that in the days ahead, I’m very confident that they’re going to see    Donald Trump be a president for all of the people, and we embrace that principle and we’re going to work hard to make that principle every day that we serve.
