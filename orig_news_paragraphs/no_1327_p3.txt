Mr. Stier declined to discuss the details of the meeting, including its participants, saying it was designed to provide a "safe space" for frank and confidential discussions about the transition process. But he said it was vital that the preparations begin now, removed from the chaos and rancor of the presidential campaign and the pressures of a White House bent on pressing Mr. Obamaâ€™s agenda while there is still time. " Campaigns were always loath to do early or aggressive   planning for fear that they will be accused of measuring the drapes or being presumptuous, so they ended up doing it at the last minute," said Mr. Stier.
