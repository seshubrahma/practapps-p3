On a muggy afternoon in April, Angelina Iles, 65, folded herself into my passenger seat and took me on a tour of her beloved Pineville, La. a sleepy town smack in the middle of the low, wet state. We drove past     houses and   businesses   —   shuttered restaurants, a decrepit gas station   —   as Iles, an   retired lunchroom worker and community activist, guided me toward the muddy banks of the Red River.
