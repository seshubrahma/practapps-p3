In a blunt footnote, the judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said that while the government "identified the seven countries in the executive order as countries of concern in 2015 and 2016," it had not "offered any evidence or even an explanation" for how the national security concerns justified an "urgent need" to reinstate the executive order.   Trump said later that his administration was working on something that would be tailored to the concerns of the court    although the precise details are still under wraps.   In an appearance in Munich on February 18, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly suggested that the President was contemplating "releasing a tighter, more streamlined version of the first executive order" that would pass muster with the court and ease due process concerns because it would have a   roll out plan aimed at diminishing the chaos caused after the first order was released.   One source confirmed the rollout plan to CNN and reiterated that government lawyers believe it should withstand legal scrutiny because it will make clear that the travel ban will not impact   holders.
