Originally an entrepreneur, Mr. Johnson has cast himself as an alternative to Mr. Trump by focusing on reducing the size of the government while embracing a   approach to social issues. He advocates abolishing the income tax, removing regulations on internet companies and moving aggressively to balance the federal budget. But much of Mr. Johnsonâ€™s message has focused on social policy. His support for abortion rights and legalized marijuana appeals to many young people, while putting him out of step with his former party.
