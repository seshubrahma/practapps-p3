Marjorie Dannenfelser of the   organization the Susan B. Anthony List issued a statement praising Conway and Bannon: I have known and trusted Kellyanne Conway my entire professional life. No one is better at understanding what real people are thinking and how to connect with them than Kellyanne. She and Steve both understand the importance of effectively communicating the   position and leveraging the passion of the   grassroots in winning elections. No two could be better positioned to help Donald Trump to take on and expose Hillary Clintonâ€™s extremism in this general election.
