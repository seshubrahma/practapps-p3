Marine Le Pen and her National Front in France, and Frauke Petry and her Alternative for Germany party, which outflanks even conservative stalwart Angela Merkel, going for her fourth term as chancellor with some real headwinds of her own.

Le Pen may eventually face a tough race with moderate candidate Emmanuel Macron.    Although there are several examples of European populist candidates, Wilders may be the closest to the Trump model.
