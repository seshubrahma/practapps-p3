Berkeley, California (CNN) Protests that erupted at UC Berkeley ahead of a planned Wednesday appearance by   commentator Milo Yiannopoulos caused $100, 000 worth of damage to the campus, the school said Thursday.   The university blamed "150 masked agitators" for the unrest, saying they had come to campus to disturb an otherwise peaceful protest. Two Berkeley College Republicans "were attacked while conducting an interview" on the campus on Thursday, UC Berkeley also said in a prepared statement.
