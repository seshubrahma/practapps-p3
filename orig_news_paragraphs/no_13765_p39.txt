Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t have my reading glasses, as they had been taken into property during processing, so I was unable to read the rules and regulations. Sometime around midmorning, more prisoners were brought into our cell temporarily, including DeRay. The cell was extremely crowded at this point, but when I noticed DeRay was there, I walked over and introduced myself, and we briefly spoke. I updated him about what I knew was going on from my conversations with my wife and the National Lawyers Guild.
