In an interview Thursday afternoon with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Sen. Cory Booker said, Conway "clearly broke the law." He tied the incident into a broader criticism of Trump’s businesses, which he said remained a major cause for concern and caused the President to violate the Emoluments clause of the Constitution.   Different government agencies have different penalties for rules violations for employees using public office for private gain, with some imposing a   suspension to removal, and others recommending a two week suspension to removal for the offense. It’s the latest in a string of ethics concerns raised about the Trump administration’s relationship with the family’s private businesses since he assumed office.
