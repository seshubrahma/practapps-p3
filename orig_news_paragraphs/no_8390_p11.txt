Our highest court will become Socialist, and she will restrict what America was founded on, our freedom to become a small business owner and pursue our own personal dreams. She has blood on her hands from the Benghazi terrorist raid. Four of our American patriots died, and when the parents stood over their loved ones’ coffins, she lied to them about the cause of their sons’ deaths. The pendulum of freedom is not balanced.
