Sajwani eventually reached a private settlement with the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority and avoided jail time. " The case was settled on terms including the cancellation of the conviction," a spokesperson for Sajwani’s company told CNN, noting that Sajwani was not present for the trial in which he was found guilty.   The Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on Sajwani’s case.
