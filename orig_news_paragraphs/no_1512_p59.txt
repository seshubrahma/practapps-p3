The preferred strategy is to keep their politics local, "talking to voters like they’re running for sheriff," as Ward Baker, the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s executive director, put it to me. The exemplar of this "Mayberry R. F. D. " strategy is Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire’s   junior senator. Ayotte, like Kirk, won office in 2010 in what had recently been a swing state she now faces one of the Democratic Party’s top Senate recruits, the state’s sitting governor, Maggie Hassan. Ayotte has been a relentless presence in her state’s diners, farmer’s markets and   pageants this year.
