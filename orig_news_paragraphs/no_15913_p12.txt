At only 44   and not known to have been in ill health, Perepilichny’s death was initially declared "unexplained" by British police until traces of gelsemium, a poisonous flower, were discovered in his stomach.   A state coroner’s inquest into the case began in Britain on June 5 and was upended when BuzzFeed reported a week later that the U. S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the body that oversees all U. S. spy agencies, concluded with "high confidence" that Perepilichnyy was killed on orders by Vladimir Putin.    Citing more than a dozen past and present intelligence officials in the U. S. UK and France, BuzzFeed alleged that the British government was suppressing crucial evidence. BuzzFeed said that the British government refused to comment on the report.
