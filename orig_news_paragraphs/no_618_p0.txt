BEIT EL, West Bank   —    There’s the Friedman Faculty House, the Rabbi Morris Friedman Center for Computer Sciences, a Friedman fitness room at a   academy, a playground and a plaza. The plaques dedicating sites around Beit El, a religious Jewish settlement deep in the   West Bank, attest to years of financial, emotional and family bonds nurtured by an American lawyer, David M. Friedman, and his wife, Tammy.
