WASHINGTON   â€”    President Trump turned the power of the White House against the news media on Friday, escalating his attacks on journalists as "the enemy of the people" and berating members of his own F. B. I. as "leakers" who he said were putting the nation at risk. In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Trump criticized as "fake news" organizations that publish anonymously sourced reports that reflect poorly on him.
