That’s why George Romney, Mitt’s dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico. At end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories, that Donald has been relying on, some of the more extreme ones insist, that you must not only be born on US soil, but have two parents born on US soil. Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, [Sen.] Marco Rubio ( ) would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified, and interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified, because, Donald’s mother was born in Scotland.
