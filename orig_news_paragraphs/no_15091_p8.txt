But now with this issue also on the table, I think, frankly, my own judgment is that Tillerson goes to Moscow more emboldened because the Russian President Putin, who makes the decisions, now sees that this administration will take military actions when it thinks certain lines have been crossed," he added.   Tillerson, who has shied away from the limelight since taking office, has been front and center this week defending the strikes. When the US fired 60 Tomahawk missiles at the airbase from which the attack was allegedly launched, it was Tillerson, along with national security adviser H. R. McMaster, who initially briefed reporters at Trump’s Florida resort,   . No ’hard evidence’ Tillerson has been pointed in his criticism of Moscow since the attack, but has so far stopped short alleging complicity.
