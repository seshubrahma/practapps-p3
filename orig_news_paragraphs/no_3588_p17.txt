For news sources like the Independent, the ostensible fight in defence of multiculturalism is even more important than the news story itself, let alone   positions. Over the past 16 hours, the Independent has published and promoted at least seven separate articles targeting the critics of mass migration or lax security. I cannot for one second imagine being that editor and having the callousness to shout across the newsroom: "Letâ€™s hammer Nigel Farage for what he said on Fox!" while young girls are still bleeding in hospitals in England.
