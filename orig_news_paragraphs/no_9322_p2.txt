However a recent Facebook post by the Des Moines   group seems to contradict this statement, implying that Iowa State purposefully raised the price of the event in order to censor MILO. The Facebook page states, "If you haven’t heard yet Iowa State University has gotten wind of the peoples’ frustrations about how an event like this could possibly be allowed at their school facility just WEEKS after there was a second occurrence of white   posters popping up on campus. They know Milo loves to provoke, troll, and offend as many people as possible so they told the hosting organization, ISU StudentsForTrump, that they will need to pay for the extra event security to the tune of $2, 000 total or the event has to be cancelled.
