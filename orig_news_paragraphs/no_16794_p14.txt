Trump’s decision not to release his tax returns is a complicated issue politically, and the controversy shows the complications of someone like Trump, with a vast business empire, running for president. On the one hand, conservatives have long viewed the Internal Revenue Service with disdain and it has long been a plank of the Republican Party’s orthodoxy that taxes should be lowered across the board. The GOP also sought to make political capital out of claims that the Obama administration used the IRS to target the   status of conservative grassroots and Tea Party groups.   So it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Trump’s core voters, who harbor deep suspicion of the federal government, would applaud his efforts to avoid some tax liability    as long as he acted within the law.
