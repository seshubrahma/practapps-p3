For important school events and   parties, we would all go to the US embassy where the cool big kids were. Stepping inside the American embassy was like exploring a city within a city, protected by a red brick wall with barbed wire. There were shops where I could buy my beloved Doritos chips and Oreo sandwich cookies. As I write, the   School of Moscow is currently closed for the winter break and it is not yet clear what its fate will be.
