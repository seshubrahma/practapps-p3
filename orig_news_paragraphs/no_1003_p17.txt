The drivers, who are considered independent contractors under federal labor guidelines, receive a single universal license that allows them to drive a taxi, livery or black car, making it easy to switch allegiances. The epicenter for the driver wars has become Long Island City, Queens, where both Uber and the Taxi and Limousine Commission have offices in the Falchi building, a renovated   warehouse with an artisanal food court. Lyft was the first to stake a claim on the fourth floor of the building in 2014 with a    center where drivers are welcomed with pretzels and soft drinks while Lyft employees spin   tunes on a Sonos wireless sound system. Gett, a   app popular in Europe, moved in last year to the same floor, offering a technology training bar for drivers to get help using its app along with signing bonuses, free coffee and treats.
