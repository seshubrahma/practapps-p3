Jeb Bush, I would say the same thing to you. You signed a pledge. I would say the same thing to other candidates who have not stepped forward and said ‘I’m going to support Donald Trump,’ because  you wouldn’t have been on the ballot, you wouldn’t have been able to run for president had you not signed that pledge.
