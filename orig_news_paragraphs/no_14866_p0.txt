 (CNN) The Secret Service acknowledged Friday afternoon that the man who breached White House security last week was on the grounds for more than 15 minutes. The statement from the Secret Service came after a source told CNN earlier Friday about the length of the incident and the agencyâ€™s resulting investigation. In its statement Friday afternoon, the Secret Service offered some information about the incident and said the "investigation is ongoing," so far including more than 50 interviews and a review of radio transmissions and video footage.
