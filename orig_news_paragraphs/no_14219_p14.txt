Six people were killed and five wounded victims were in the hospital last night.   Police say there were 39 other people in the mosque who were not hurt. Witnesses said they saw at least two gunmen opened fire at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center and police have arrested one suspect.    But there are still a lot of questions about the attack.
