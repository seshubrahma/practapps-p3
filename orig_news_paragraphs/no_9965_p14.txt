Real leaders care about the people who work for them, and they understand how important it is to take care of your people and to make sure morale stays high. And for me, [Trumpâ€™s questions] demonstrated a genuine concern for our people, but it also showed a real understanding of leadership. In 2014, ICE was ranked 314th in morale among 314 federal agencies surveyed by the Office of Personnel Management. Reports note that under the Obama administration, morale has plummeted as ICE officers have been "handcuffed" from doing their jobs and enforcing U. S. immigration law.
