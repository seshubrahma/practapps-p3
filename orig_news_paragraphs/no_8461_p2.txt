The illegal alien accused of assaulting Pharis had been arrested six times in just the 15 months leading up to her rape and murder, but he was never removed from the country. There is no public record that House Speaker Paul Ryan has ever spoken out about Pharis’ sexual assault. Instead, five months after Pharis’ sexual assault, Speaker Ryan voted to grant federal funding to continue the sanctuary policies which local authorities say were responsible for Pharis’ death. In 2014, when Pharis’ assailant had been arrested on prior felony drug and sexual assault charges, ICE issued a detainer for the illegal alien, "but the Santa Maria’s sheriff’s office declined to honor [ICE’s detainer] because of a local sanctuary policy," wrote Senator Chuck Grassley’s office.
