Senator Lamar Alexander (R. .) Chairman of the Senate Health Committee said argued that Obamacareâ€™s repeal will only take place when there is a practical alternative, saying: I think of Obamacare like a collapsing bridge. If your local bridge were "very near collapse," the first thing you would do is send in a rescue crew to repair it temporarily so no one else is hurt. Then you would build a better bridge, or more accurately, many bridges, as states develop their own plans for providing access to truly affordable health care to replace the old bridge.
