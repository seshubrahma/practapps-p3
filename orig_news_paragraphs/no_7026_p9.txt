( a)(2)," the plaintiffs requested in the prayer for relief section of the complaint filed on March 10, four days after President Trump signed Executive Order 13780. Plaintiffs HIAS and IRAP are arguing that Trump’s executive order limitation of refugees to 50, 000 in FY 2017 was "pursuant to the President’s congressionally delegated authority under  8 U. S. C. § 1182( f)," which reads as follows: Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in any fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 shall be such number as the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation, is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest. (emphasis added) HIAS and IRAP fail to acknowledge in their complaint that the "earlier proclamation setting a limit of 110, 000" refugees to be resettled in the United States in FY 2017 was not a Constitutionally authorized executive order, or even a "proclamation," but instead was the statutory "presidential determination" for FY 2017 made by former President Obama on September 22, 2016.
