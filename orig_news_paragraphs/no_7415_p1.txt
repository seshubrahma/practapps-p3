[Tensions ran high at Trump’s latest rally, when U. S. Secret Service agents briefly formed a protective ring around the presidential candidate, then left the stage and allowed him to continue speaking at an airport hangar outside Dayton, Ohio.   Trump’s campaign said the agents rushed the stage after a man attempted to breach the security buffer. The man was "removed rapidly and professionally," spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. A defiant Trump has denied that he has encouraged violence at his events.
