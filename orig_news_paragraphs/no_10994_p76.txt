: Kelly asks Cruz about women in the military. Fox News allows a  "Texans for Rubio" volunteer to ask Cruz a question about the issue. She asks why Cruz thinks young women are less capable or owe less of a debt than young men. Cruz thanks her for her service and says women are capable of doing "incredible things" but when it comes to the military, we shouldnâ€™t be governed by political correctness.
