In a Public Policy Polling survey released a week ago Ward and McCain were tied   in a head to head matchup. Arizonans dissatisfied with McCain could be let down with three minor polling Republican Senate candidates dividing the    crowd. At between 2 and 4 percent polling Alex Meluskey, Scott McBean, and Clair Van Steenwyk could be McCainâ€™s salvation, providing the cushion he needs to squeeze through to November according to the PPP poll. If those three were to step out of the race Ward stands a better chance to succeed in the August 30 Republican primary election.
