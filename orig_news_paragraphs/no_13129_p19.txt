Four states are voting on Saturday, so no poll will reflect any voting changes that may result from Thursday night’s debate. Even if a magical polling fairy were able to factor all of these variables into its estimates, it still couldn’t account for the large number of people who don’t make a final decision until the final hours of the campaign. In Virginia, Marco Rubio beat Donald Trump by almost 30 points among the people who decided whom to support in the   days before voting. This, more than anything else, accounted for the closeness of the race in Virginia, where every public poll had predicted a   win for Trump.
