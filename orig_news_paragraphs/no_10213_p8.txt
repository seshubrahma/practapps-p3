So a federal district court ruled against the plaintiffs in Peruta, holding they had no Second Amendment right to carry firearms outside the home without the government’s permission. However, a   panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed that ruling in a   decision in 2014, in an exceptionally   opinion by a famed Reagan appointee, Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain. Then California Attorney General Kamala Harris became involved in the case, asking the appeals court to rehear the case en banc. For every other federal appeals court, that means all the   judges on the court rehear the case together.
