Struggling to deliver nukes, Bruce Bennett, a a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, says that despite North Korea’s apparent progress on a warhead, it doesn’t yet have good enough missile and rocket technology to deliver a nuke. A key question is whether they have the technology that would allow the missiles to   the atmosphere. North Koreans have this capability for the intermediate range Musudan missile, which can hit South Korea and Japan. It’s a harder technological feat to achieve   capability for an ICBM, which is subject to higher temperatures and greater velocities.
