The key is watching the Real Clear Politics average movement in state polls between late June, when Hillary Clinton would have clearly won in a landslide, and July. While national polls have moved a few points toward Trump,  the problem with national polls is that they are skewed by lopsided results in 37   or   states, such as California, New York and Texas. For example, California’s population is so large that it would add 5 points to Hillary Clinton’s national polling score if the state’s voters shifted from 51 percent favoring Clinton to a 100 percent for Clinton. But that theoretical poll shift would not increase Clinton’s actual total of electoral votes because she already has the state’s 55 electoral votes in her pocket.
