Republican campaign veteran Roger Stone tells Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon, "I have reported, and I stand by this, that a number of the billionaires who are funding Marco Rubio have told him that he has until the Florida primary on March 15th to show some leg. If he cannot win his home state primary, it will be very hard to continue to justify his campaign. At that point, I think it is abundantly clear that Mitt Romney is waiting in the wings. "
