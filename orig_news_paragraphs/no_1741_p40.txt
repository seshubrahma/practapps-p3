Thomas Jefferson bought the property from King George III of England for 20 shillings. Today, it is owned by a nonprofit company started by Mr. Clarke. He bought the bridge in 2014, using a $9. 1 million loan from the State of Virginia. Mr. Clarke planned to revitalize flagging ticket sales to the bridge, then hand over the property as a state park.
