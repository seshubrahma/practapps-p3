You usually need multiple days to call voters back and get a representative sample. ■ Well over half of adults ought to be reached on cellphones in a typical national survey about 40 percent of Americans do not have a landline at all. A poll of registered voters off the voter file can have a somewhat smaller number of   voters, since the poll can typically be weighted by partisanship, and registered and likely voters are less likely to have only a cellphone (they’re older, more affluent and often less mobile than the population as a whole). ■ Pay attention to sample size.
