Washington (CNN) White House press secretary Sean Spicer flatly denied Friday that the White House apologized to the British government after citing an uncorroborated Fox News report to allege that a UK intelligence agency spied on President Donald Trump at the behest of former President Barack Obama. Earlier in the day, however, a senior administration official told CNN that Spicer and national security adviser H. R. McMaster offered what amounted to an apology to the British government for Spicerâ€™s comments on Thursday, when he cited a Fox News report that said British intelligence helped wiretap Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign.
