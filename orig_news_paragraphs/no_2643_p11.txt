Still, the group remains a potent force in the Middle East, and its loyalists overseas continue to present a significant threat. Could that be addressed by a new plan that focuses on, as Mr. Trump said, "cyberwarfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare" in addition to military action? Unlikely, say defense officials and analysts. The United States and its allies are already focusing on those fronts, and have been especially successful at targeting the Islamic Stateâ€™s financial strength by striking its   infrastructure and seizing territory, depriving the group of its tax base.
