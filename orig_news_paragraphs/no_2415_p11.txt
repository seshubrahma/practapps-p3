Forsaking the agreement, the president insisted, would undercut the United States’ standing in the     region as a reliable counterweight to an expansionary China, economically and militarily, for America’s allies there. The other countries have approved the pact or are in the process of doing so, but without the approval of the United States, it does not take effect. That tension could well be evident later this month, when Mr. Obama and his trade representative, Michael B. Froman, attend the annual   Economic Cooperation summit. The Americans will have to explain their failure on the trade agreement to foreign leaders gathered in Lima, Peru, while China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is there seeking progress toward an emerging alternative to the   Partnership
