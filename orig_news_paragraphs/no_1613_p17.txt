" The easiest way for Trump to sidestep the whole Ukraine story is for Manafort not to be there," said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who has become a counselor to Mr. Trump. In North Carolina on Thursday, Mr. Trump was informed of the newest such report: an Associated Press article that, citing emails, showed that Mr. Manafortâ€™s firm had orchestrated a   lobbying campaign in Washington without registering as a foreign agent. That was enough, according to people briefed on the calls, for Mr. Trump to call Mr. Bannon and Ms. Conway.
