The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on NBC’s "Meet the Press" on Sunday that Judge Gorsuch would be confirmed this week. " How that happens really depends on our Democratic friends, how many of them are willing to oppose cloture on a partisan basis to kill a Supreme Court nominee   —   never happened before in history, the whole history of the country," Mr. McConnell said.
