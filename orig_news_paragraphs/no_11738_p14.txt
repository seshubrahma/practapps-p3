In fiscal 2014, for example, 124, 326 new   visas were approved. That’s far above the 105, 000 combination of the supposed 85, 000 a year cap and the universities’ 000 extra  . The   gap is waived away by   advocates as duplication and unused visas. The numbers of "cap exempt"   are also shown in the federal reports, such as this 2014 report and this 2013 report, but the numbers are broken up and unexplained.
