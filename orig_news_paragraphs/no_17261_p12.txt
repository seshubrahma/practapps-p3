We will not achieve the kind of clearly defined victory comparable to those that we won in previous wars against nations," Obama said.   As part of his visit to the Tampa military installation Tuesday, Obama met with Special Operations troops, the elite forces who have carried out some of the more significant missions of his tenure. He argued for an approach that has relied heavily on those special operators to carry out surgical missions to take out terrorists, as well as train local forces to combat ISIS. He also again addressed the use of drones to take out terrorists, a program thatâ€™s drawn legal scrutiny and outrage in countries that have been targeted.
