Mr. Trump has a penchant for dropping unwelcome surprises during visits between the United States and Mexico. Last month, on the first day of a trip to Washington by Mexicoâ€™s foreign minister, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to build a wall between the two countries. Then, this week, just before Mr. Kelly and Mr. Tillerson touched down in Mexico, his administration released policies that vastly expanded the potential for deportation of undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump is certainly not the only American president to clamp down on illegal immigration.
