Another Trump campaign email, reportedly out in the state of Washington, shows the campaign isn’t prepared there as well, missing an important deadline notification. " Donald Trump’s team is encouraging its supporters in Washington state to sign up to be a potential Trump delegate. The only problem: The campaign’s local crew sent its email on Friday  —   two days after the filing deadline to appear on the printed ballot in Saturday’s conventions and caucuses," Politico reports.
