Donnelly pointed out in his article that the U. S.’s Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 states that U. S. policy should oppose the human rights violations of the Castro regime, to maintain sanctions "so long as it continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights" and to "be prepared to reduce the sanctions in carefully calibrated ways in response to positive developments in Cuba. " Donnelly also cited President Barack Obama’s 2016 memorandum that said normalizing relations with Cuba would help human rights. "
