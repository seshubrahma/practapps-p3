I asked a few people, no one seemed to have the ballots for my last name. At that particular time, I had to do my   speech because I was running for national delegate. I came back and said I donâ€™t have a ballot and I went to Andie, the president of the Cherry Creek Republican Women in Colorado, and she looked at her board.
