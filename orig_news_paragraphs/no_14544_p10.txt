We might put the question to Trump’s inner circle, to men such as Stephen Bannon, whose former job as executive chairman of the   Breitbart News made him the darling of white nationalists everywhere or to Stephen Miller, who has campaigned against "Islamofascism," on the belief that the US and Western civilization are at war with Islamic jihadists. It’s certainly high time to pose it to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and    Jared Kushner,  both observant Jews. What they perhaps don’t want to realize    but Bannon knows all too well     is that racism is a famously mobile form of hatred.
