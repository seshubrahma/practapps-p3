(A senior State Department official said Mr. Tillerson did say it, to Mr. Trump, over dinner a little more than a week ago.) On his first trip, to Europe, Mr. Tillerson went out of his way to reassure allies of the United States’ commitment to NATO, doing little to repeat the "America First" notion that Mr. Trump has promoted. In Asia, Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to visit the Demilitarized Zone on the border with North Korea, and it seems almost unimaginable that he would repeat Mr. Trump’s warning as a candidate that the United States may pull back from the region. So why is the man many in the State Department call T. Rex so quiet?
