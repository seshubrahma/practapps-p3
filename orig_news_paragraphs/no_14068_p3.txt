In Sunshine Acres mobile home park near Adel in Cook County, five people remained missing on Sunday, Duke said.   Residents who survived said they experienced a few minutes of terror that one said felt "like a nightmare on Elm Street," referring to the popular horror movies. And when they emerged from their hiding places, they saw overturned cars, debris and scores of damaged mobile homes.   "As soon as I walked out the door, people were screaming, screaming for help," said Phillip Gibbs, 24, who hid in the closet with five other family members.
