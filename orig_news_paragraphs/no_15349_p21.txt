Instead of the Obamacare subsidies that are tied to income and premiums, the GOP plan would provide Americans with refundable tax credits based mainly on age to purchase health insurance. The legislation would also allow insurers to charge higher premiums to those in their 50s and early 60s, compared to younger consumers. It would also significantly curtail federal support for Medicaid and allow states to require   adults to work. After 2020, states that expanded Medicaid would no longer receive enhanced federal funding to cover   adults, and those that hadnâ€™t expanded would be immediately barred from doing so.
