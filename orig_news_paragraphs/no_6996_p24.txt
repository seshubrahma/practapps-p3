Journalistic standards be damned, the establishment media sees themselves on a mission to save humanity, so of course they aren’t going to apply the same standards to Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. Committee to Protect Journalists director Joel Simon agrees with this assessment and admits to The Hollywood Reporter that he sees Obama —  who has repeatedly gone after whistleblowers and maintained a wall of secrecy that even CPJ was forced to admit was horrible —   is entirely different than Trump: What’s fundamentally different is the overt hostility with Trump, the attacks on individual reporters, the threats to weaken libel laws.
