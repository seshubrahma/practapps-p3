Among those in attendance to support Trump were both the Republican nominees for Floridaâ€™s first and second congressional districts, Florida State Rep. Matt Gaetz and Dr. Neal Dunn. Both Gaetz and Dunn are heavy favorites to win their bids for each of those open seats. Others there to show support for Trump were Rep. Jeff Miller ( ) the outgoing member of Congress for Pensacola, and Trump advisers Gen. Michael Flynn and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The event was not without protesters.
