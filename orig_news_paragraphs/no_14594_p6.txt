Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania tweeted that it was "deeply disturbing" that the White House would try to meddle in an FBI investigation.   " The notion that @POTUS Admin would call @FBI  ask them to publicly downplay an ongoing investigation into Russia ties is deeply disturbing," he said. The direct communications between the White House and the FBI were unusual because of   restrictions on such contacts.
