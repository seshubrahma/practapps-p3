The DMN editor told the managing editor of Poynter, it was his hope that the subscribers who cancelled their subscriptions would come back to the publication. He said, "I believe The Dallas Morning News offers a lot of value to readers â€”  even when they disagree with a particular editorial view. " Given the anger shown in terms of comments after the endorsement (3, 500 reported by Mullin) it remains an open question if readers will forgive the publication. The DMN editor declined to give the actual number of cancelled subscriptions.
