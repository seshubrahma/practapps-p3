Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads. Apple’s rapid growth here in central Texas, where it now employs about 6, 000 people, up from 2, 100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world’s largest technology company and their economic impact. At Apple’s sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven    buildings field about 8, 000 customer   calls a day, manage the company’s vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them. Employees here help run Apple’s iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company’s American operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads.
