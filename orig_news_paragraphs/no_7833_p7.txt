Levin elaborated that Trump’s comments about women, and the   theory wouldn’t play well, and that Trump was "limping" across the finish line to the nomination. He further criticized the media and Trump for preventing "the liberty message, the Constitution message, the conservative message, the Reagan principle message" from getting out. Levin concluded by sarcastically suggesting someone should pitch "Fox  Friends " a story that one of Trump’s relatives was seen with John Wilkes Booth.
