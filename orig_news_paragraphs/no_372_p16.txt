Mr. Boente, who has been a prosecutor with the Justice Department for 31 years, had no hesitation about accepting the acting attorney generalâ€™s job given his "seniority and loyalty" to the department, Mr. Stueve said in a telephone interview on Monday night. As acting attorney general, Ms. Yates was the only person at the Justice Department authorized to sign applications for foreign surveillance warrants. Administrations of both parties have interpreted surveillance laws as requiring foreign surveillance warrants be signed only by   Justice Department officials. Mr. Boente was   as United States attorney and, though the situation is unprecedented, the White House said he was authorized to sign the warrants.
