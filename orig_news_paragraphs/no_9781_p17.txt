When the enemy has a knife at your throat, the last thing you need is a HUG. When you can’t get a job and put food on your table, you don’t need a hug. When you see the systematic flooding of illegal immigrants that do not assimilate and are indoctrinated into socialism, hugs are not needed. I mean, hugs are great at a wake or in romance or at church.
