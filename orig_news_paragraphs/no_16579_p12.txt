The Commission on Presidential Debates    which Johnson, along with Green Party nominee Jill Stein, sued    has an established threshold of 15% support among an average of five national polls to qualify for the debates. Johnson made clear from the outset his goal was to secure an invitation. Asked by Fox Newsâ€™ Chris Wallace in late August about what exclusion from the debates would mean, Johnson said, "I would say game over."   The first debate is September 26, the cutoff point for the qualifying period is looming and short of a stunning upset, Johnson will not be on the stage.
