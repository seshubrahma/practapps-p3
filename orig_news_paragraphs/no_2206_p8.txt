No one wants terrorists to be able to buy guns or explosives," Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on the Senate floor on Monday. The two other measures that failed included one offered by Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who led a filibuster last week to make a point on guns. His measure sought to tighten background checks for most gun buyers. Republicans offered a measure that was more focused on the mental health system.
