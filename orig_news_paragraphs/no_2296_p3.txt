After the F. B. I. warning, Arizona took its voter registration database offline from June 28 to July 8 to allow for a forensic exam of its systems, Mr. Roberts said. The F. B. I. in its notice to states, said the voter information had been "exfiltrated," which means that it was shipped out of the state systems to another computer. But it does not mean that the data itself was tampered with. It is unclear whether the hackers intended to affect the election or pursued the data for other purposes, like gaining personal identifying information about voters.
