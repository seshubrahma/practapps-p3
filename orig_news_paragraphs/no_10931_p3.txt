pundit Maria Cardona falsely attributed the line from my article to Breitbart’s former Executive Chairman, Steve Bannon, who recently joined Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. This of course was done on purpose to try and paint Bannon in a negative light. As usual, when leftists can’t find any actual dirt on someone they have to create it out of thin air.   So why did the popular   website Snopes give a "mixed truth" rating to a clear lie?
