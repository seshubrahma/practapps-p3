So far the administration has not publicly identified who it believes may be behind the hack. However, intelligence and law enforcement officials have told CNN Russia is the most likely suspect. The hack of the DNC was originally discovered as being two separate breaches, both by hacking groups identified by cybersecurity experts as working for the Russian military and intelligence complex. One hack was said to have lasted a year and targeted internal communications, the other was for a few months and targeted opposition research on Donald Trump.
