" This, in my view, was an unnecessary and frankly harmful open dispute over an issue, which is not nearly as important as the United States and Australians working together," McCain said. McCain later questioned Trumpâ€™s handling of a recent raid in Yemen    his first military operation, which resulted in the first death of a US soldier on his watch    saying he wants a full briefing on the issue. The raid was greenlit by Trump shortly after taking the oath of office, but multiple officials told CNN the mission had been planned months in advance and had been briefed to   Barack Obama.
