These policies, such at Syrian and other refugees and the Iran Deal are Clinton policies, but they are really policies of President Barack Obama, Caddell said. In a a change election, Clinton made the decision to run as the incumbent or as the president’s third term, but even her own voters are yearning for a change and expressing an unease, Caddell said. While Obama skates, Clinton is the one on the campaign trail taking ownership of the president’s policies, he said. The Sept. 20   poll exposes critical disconnects between Clinton’s supporters and the rest of the electorate, as well as fissures among her own supporters, he said.
