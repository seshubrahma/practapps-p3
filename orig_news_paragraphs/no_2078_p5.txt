The incident complicates already testy relations between China and the United States, ties that have been further frayed by   Donald J. Trumpâ€™s phone call with the president of Taiwan. Mr. Trump angered Chinese officials by holding a phone conversation with President Tsai   of Taiwan, an island that Beijing deems a breakaway province of China. It had been nearly four decades since a United States president or   had such direct contact with a Taiwanese leader. In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Mr. Trump also criticized China over its trade imbalance with the United States, its military activities in the South China Sea and its links to North Korea.
