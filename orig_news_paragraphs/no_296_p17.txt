Only about a quarter of the   cars sold in the United States are imported, though Japan remains the source for many   components as well as design work. One of Mr. Trumpâ€™s complaints about Japan, repeated for decades by American trade negotiators, is that its economy is organized to keep foreign products out even without overt trade barriers like tariffs. By this logic, American carmakers have failed to penetrate the Japanese market because dealers and regulators collude against them. (Japan imposes no border taxes on cars the United States adds a 2. 5 percent levy to most imported Japanese vehicles.)
