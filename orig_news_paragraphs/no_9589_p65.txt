Christmas and Christianity are worth fighting for.

There are so many things that we owe the religion as a debt of gratitude, I canâ€™t listen many of them without this turning into a pep rally for Jesus and his Apostles. Thinks about some of the things Christianity brought to western civilization: In the twelfth century marriage came to be counted as a sacrament by the catholic church.
