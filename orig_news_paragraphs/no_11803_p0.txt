President Barack Obama is giving up on some of the American manufacturing jobs that went to Mexico, telling an Indiana resident that many of those jobs are not coming back. [During a town hall in Elkhart, Indiana, Obama was asked a question about manufacturing by a man who was once employed by Carrier Corporation in Indiana before the plant announced plans to move to Mexico.   " What we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back," Obama said bluntly during the event broadcast on PBS.
