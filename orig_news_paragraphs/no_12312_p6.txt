During the lecture, an   protester rushed towards the stage with a sign that read "Roses are red, Violets are blue, Milo we are woke to tolerate you. " The protester was quickly ushered away from the stage by a University administrator.   In the middle of the lecture, one student stood up with a sign that read, "Free Speech [does not not equal] Hate Speech," suggesting that Yiannopoulos’ lecture contained hate speech and therefore shouldn’t have been permitted on campus.
