Some might say that May sounds like a populist, but that’s a misreading of the   PM. She isn’t saying that the mass, or the mob, should rule she’s saying, instead, that wise leaders, having won a popular mandate, should rule —  and rule with the   of the people first in mind. As such, May summons up the ghost of one of Britain’s greatest conservative leaders, Benjamin Disraeli, prime minister for seven years and an important figure in British politics for four decades.
