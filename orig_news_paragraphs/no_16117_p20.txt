Zakaria asked how the president thinks Guzman managed to escape prison in Mexico.   In 2001, Guzman broke out of a   prison by reportedly hiding in a laundry cart. In 2015, he escaped again through a prison shower which led into a vast underground tunnel. He was recaptured in January 2016 in his native Sinaloa state after a shootout that killed six of his people.
