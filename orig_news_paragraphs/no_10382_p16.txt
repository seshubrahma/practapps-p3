As I drove through that gauntlet, I was scared not knowing if my car would be a target and they tried to intimidate everyone! I had several protesters run up to my car and threaten me at the stop light right past where the police line ended. That was scary and I pumped the gas and drove away. I ended up going about 25 minutes out of my usual way out of that area in Chicago.
