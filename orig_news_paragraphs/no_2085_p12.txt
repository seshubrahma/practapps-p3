If there are any objections, the House and Senate then immediately split up to consider them and have just two hours to decide whether they support the objection or not. Both chambers will then reconvene and share their decisions if both the House and the Senate agree with the objection, then they will throw out the votes in question. But Congress has never sustained an objection to an electoral vote in modern times. After any and all objections have been resolved, the results are considered final.
