Last week, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that people on the government’s terrorist watch list should be barred from buying firearms, a stance that contradicts that of the N. R. A.

" A lot of people are on the list that really maybe shouldn’t be on the list, and their rights are being taken away," he said.
