Tillerson will meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday before flying to South Korea. Tillerson will arrive in China on Saturday, March 18, and meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He is expected to bring the same message of responsibility for the North Korean regime to Beijing as he did to Japan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, however, is attempting to convince reporters that they expect minimal conflict during Tillersonâ€™s visit.
