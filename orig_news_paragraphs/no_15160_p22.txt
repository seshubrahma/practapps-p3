Bulent Tezcan, deputy chairman of the main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, or CHP, said his party would contest the result in Turkey and, if necessary, at the European Court of Human Rights. " The only decision that will end legitimacy debate and ease people’s concerns about the judiciary is for the High Election Board to cancel the referendum," Tezcan said. Turkish opposition parties have three days to appeal the referendum results under the election law, CHP lawmaker and human rights lawyer Sezgin Tanrikulu said.
