Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has made clear heâ€™s winnowed down his list of potential Supreme Court nominees    and may be days away from making the announcement.   Trump himself said on the campaign trail that he would look at judges William Pryor and Diane Sykes as top contenders, and has touted his list of 20 possible choices from conservative legal circles. Sources close to the search say as things stand now, Judge Neil Gorsuch has emerged on top of the list as well as Judge Thomas Hardiman.
