As DeVos was confirmed in the Senate, Rep. Thomas Massie ( ) introduced legislation in the House that would eliminate the federal department of education. " Neither Congress nor the President, through his appointees, has the constitutional authority to dictate how and what our children must learn," Massie said in a press release announcing his bill that is only one sentence long. With legislation to that end already introduced, DeVos could reach out to Massie and work with him and the billâ€™s other sponsors to dismantle her department in an organized manner.
