Snoop Dogg launched into a   tirade against former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in a pair of videos posted to his Instagram page Monday, attacking the governor and action movie star for commuting the sentence of Esteban Nunez, who knifed an unarmed college student to death in 2008, but refused to grant a stay of execution to a Crips gang  .

Nunez, now 27, was released from prison on Sunday after serving less than six years of his sentence.   WATCH (explicit Language warning):
