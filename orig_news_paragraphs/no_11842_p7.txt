Abbott said, there is "no opportunity to sit it out," people must participate "if we are going to put America back on the right track. " He admitted, "I may or may not agree with everything that Donald Trump stands for," but added that he did not agree with everything that Romney or McCain stood for. Abbott cited as examples, regulating the energy industry, or international issues such as ISIS or the immigration system, and empathically stated, "I know that Hillary is far worse for America than Donald Trump would be. " "
