Thursday on MSNBC’s "The 11th Hour," George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley reacted to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision to uphold a stay by a lower to halt President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting immigration to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations.   Although the court ruled in the opponents of the Trump order’s favor, the law still was on Trump’s side and that the Trump administration was using the "virtually the identical arguments" the Obama administration had used in defense of its immigration policy. " Well, it was a poorly crafted executive order, and it was a terrible rollout," Turley said.
