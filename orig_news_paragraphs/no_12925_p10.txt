The report makes no reference to the fact that the UKIP 2015 General Election manifesto indeed pushed the British government to increase its NATO defence spending budget to the required two per cent of GDP per the NATO charter. The report also neglects to mention that Mr. Farage has credited NATO for keeping the peace in Europe since the Second World War, often lauding the efforts of the group that is intrinsically linked to the Atlantic Council. But the reportâ€™s partisanship is perhaps revealed by the fact that the foreword is written by Radoslaw Sikorski, the former minister of Foreign Affairs in the Polish government under Mr. Donald Tusk. Mr. Tusk is now President of the European Council.
