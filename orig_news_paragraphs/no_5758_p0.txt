The top Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee called on the Treasury Department Tuesday to end the policy of designating   financial companies as Too Big To Fail. [In a letter sent Tuesday, Senator Tom Cotton and nine other Republican Senators urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to "use the all tools available" to reverse the Obama administration’s policy of having a federal council designate   financial companies as "systemically important financial institutions," a designation that brings with it stringent supervision by the Federal Reserve, new capital requirements, and costly regulatory burdens.   Critics of the policy claim that designating nonbank companies as SIFI’s is counterproductive because it creates the impression that were the companies to fail despite regulation , the government would act to bail them out.
