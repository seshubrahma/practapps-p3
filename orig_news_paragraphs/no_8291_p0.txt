Comic legend Jackie Mason, who has dubbed himself "The Ultimate Jew" in his standup routines, came out swinging in defense of Steve Bannon against baseless news media claims of   and extremism. [Speaking during his regular segment on this reporterâ€™s radio program, "Aaron Klein Investigative Radio," Mason said that the news media is lobbing false accusations at Bannon as a "fraudulent excuse" to smear the incoming administration because reporters are "insanely furious" at the election of   Donald Trump.   " If a cat walked past his house they would claim that he is persecuting animals," stated Mason of the news media coverage targeting Bannon.
