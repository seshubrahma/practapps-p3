CNN has asked Pence’s campaign whether he still believes the case he made in 1997, but his campaign has not yet responded.   It’s another example of Pence’s social conservatism.

He wrote in 1999 that Disney’s movie "Mulan" was liberal propaganda as he argued against women in military combat roles.
