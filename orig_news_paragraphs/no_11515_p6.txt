It is astounding that no Democrat is willing to put country over politics and simply ask the question whether their party has a problem. They may just be so concerned with maintaining power, that they see Hillary Clinton as the best way of doing so, and that think she will continue to deliver the bacon that they are willing to put up with any of her transgressions to get her elected. It is more likely, however, that it explains the liberal attitude toward the rule of law. The rule of law, after all, is fundamental to a free and constitutional government.
