Considering the poll’s 4. 4 percent margin of error, New Hampshire currently has a   race for second. Kasich, Rubio, Bush and Cruz are all well positioned to finish runner up in Tuesday’s primary. Chris Christie is much further back with just 6 percent support, down slightly since January. All the pundit talk about Marco Rubio having momentum going into Tuesday’s vote looks hollow against this poll.
