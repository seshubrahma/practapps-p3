Black activists stormed Trump’s stage before the presidential frontrunner took it, and as security worked to remove them, more broke out in violent altercations throughout the crowd.   Due to security concerns, Trump and his campaign called off the rally. " Mr. Trump just arrived in Chicago and after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight’s rally will be postponed to another date," the Trump campaign said on  Friday night.
