["The Chinese are now being alerted that they should not think of the United States as a pushover anymore," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chairs its Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats subcommittee.   The   campus activist, folk singer, and screenwriter said, "What the Chinese have a right to be concerned about are actions and policies, specifically how they relate to the agreements that we have with China about Taiwan. " It is possible, he said, to improve our relationship with Taiwan within the context of the Taiwan Relations Act, which President James E. "Jimmy" Carter passed to replace the mutual defense treaty between Taiwan and the U. S. and to establish a protocol for maintaining relations with Taiwan, while deferring to the PRC as the actual Chinese government, of which Taiwan was a de jure province, yet a de facto independent state.
