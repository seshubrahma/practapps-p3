Any effort to appeal to the   members of the House Freedom Caucus was always going to repel Republicans in swing districts, especially those won in November by Hillary Clinton. The objections to the House outline went far beyond the most moderate corners of the conference, and included people like Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey and one of the most active   members of the House, and Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, who objected to the way his state, with particularly high health care costs, would have fared. " The congressman isnâ€™t one to often label himself," said Matthew N. Shuckerow, a spokesman for Mr. Young.
