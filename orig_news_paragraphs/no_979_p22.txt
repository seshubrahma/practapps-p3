People with credit card debt are likely to see an immediate increase of about a quarter percentage point in their interest rates. The effect on   loans is less direct, but the average rate on a   mortgage rose by half a percentage point over the last year. The nationâ€™s largest borrower, the federal government, will also feel the pinch of higher rates. The Congressional Budget Office expects federal interest payments, measured as a share of the economy, to double over the next decade.
