Trump indicated Sunday he won’t hesitate to anger China until the country comes to the bargaining table on trade and severs ties with North Korea.   " I mean, look, we’re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy at the borders when we do n’t tax them, with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing, and frankly with not helping us at all with North Korea," Trump said.
