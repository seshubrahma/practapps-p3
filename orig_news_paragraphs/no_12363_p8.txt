The Judgment Fund is also available to pay amounts owed under compromise agreements negotiated by the U. S. Department of Justice in settlement of claims arising under actual or imminent litigation, if a judgment on the merits would be payable from the Judgment Fund. A spokesperson for the Judgement Fund confirmed to this reporter that the payment for the compromise that was reached on interest, of approximately $1. 3 billion, has indeed been provided out of the Fund. The Fund spokesperson refused to comment on the mechanics of how a settlement payment was made. The spokesperson did not reply to a   question about whether the remaining $1. 3 billion was transferred in cash or by any other means.
