Somalia elects an "American" president, Yesterday, Somalia’s Parliament elected former Prime Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo, a dual   citizen, as the country’s new president. Farmajo was declared victorious after incumbent President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud dropped out of the contest following the second round of voting. The 328 members of Parliament met at an air force hangar in Mogadishu to cast their votes because of fears of a terrorist attack. With the doors to the US appearing to close, many Dadaab residents now wanted to go back to Somalia, according to Abdi Maalim, a freelance   journalist.
