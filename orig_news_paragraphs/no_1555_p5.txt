Mr. Leierer, whose family lives about an hour outside Dallas, submitted an application the day after the ambush. His was one of 467 applications that poured into the Dallas Police Department in the two weeks after the shooting, more than three times the number during a similar period a month earlier. Police officials said applications were still coming in, giving the force of 3, 500 a    pool of applicants to fill a class at a police academy that has in recent months struggled to find recruits. For some, an announcement that the city was hiring police officers presented an opportunity for a steady job, with benefits, albeit one with modest pay, shifting hours and risks.
