It seemed like a long time and we weren’t even hearing sirens from local police officers which tells me they probably did not yet know what was going on. Eventually the shooter started circling around third base. This is my understanding.   Of course I’m down on the ground and helping the guy who’s got a bullet hole in his leg, and the shooter starts coming around home plate towards where we are, outside the fence line.
