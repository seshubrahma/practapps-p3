This bold initiative demands a national pledge to develop a new web of deep water ports, airports, roads,   networks,   rails and oil and gas pipelines     the infrastructure that makes permanent security and economic growth possible. It will stimulate some $1 trillion in investment over the next 10 years and draw in countries that account for 80% of the worldâ€™s energy consumption    all the while redefining global trade patterns. Ultimately, our return on investment will be measured in sustainable revenue, jobs and unfettered access in a peaceful environment.
