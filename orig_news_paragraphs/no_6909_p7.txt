Senate Bill 14 was signed into law in 2011 by   Rick Perry. In July 2016, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc found that Texas’ voter ID law had a discriminatory effect under the Voting Rights Act but reversed the district court’s finding of discriminatory intent, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The   ruling held that the law did not constitute a poll tax but ruled that the lower court must put an "interim remedy" in place to mitigate the "discriminatory effects" in time for the 2016 Election.
