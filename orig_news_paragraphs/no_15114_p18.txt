Speaking to reporters Thursday, Chinese Customs spokesman Huang Songping confirmed that China stopped all North Korean coal imports after February 18. Huang said that from January 1 until that   date, China had imported 2. 67 million tons of coal from North Korea, 51. 6% less than the same quarter in 2016.   But despite the drop off in coal, the value of North Korea imports to China rose 18. 4% in the first three months of 2017 compared to a year earlier.
