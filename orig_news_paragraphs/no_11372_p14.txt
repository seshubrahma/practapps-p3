In honor of the Hyde Amendmentâ€™s 40th anniversary, national   group Susan B. Anthony List publicly launched the "Save Hyde" Declaration, which has been signed by more than 13, 000 grassroots activists and 35 federal legislators. " A majority of Americans oppose the use of their taxes to fund abortion," said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, adding: In the face of this   consensus, the two presidential candidates have staked out opposite positions. Donald Trump wants to enshrine this policy into law, while Hillary Clinton wants to repeal it.
