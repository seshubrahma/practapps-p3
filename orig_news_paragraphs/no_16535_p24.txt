Clinton has cited her desire to use a single BlackBerry as part of her motivation to use a personal email address. Clintonâ€™s aide Huma Abedin told the FBI that Clinton often would use a new BlackBerry for a few days before returning to an older model because of her familiarity, according to the report. The FBI found that 13 different mobile devices were used with her two known phone numbers, and thus may have sent emails with her private account.
