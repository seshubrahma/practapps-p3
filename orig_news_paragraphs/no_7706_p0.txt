At the Reagan Library on Thursday, Gov. Mike Pence cast Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the mold of President Ronald Reagan. An unapologetic Reagan Republican, Pence effectively positioned Trump as the natural heir to the legacy of America’s fortieth president, reasserting the themes that Pence showcased during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. ["There’s so much that’s different in terms of their style and background," Pence acknowledged, but he posited that despite these differences, "there are fundamental similarities between these two men. "  Noting that both Reagan and Trump were "mocked and dismissed" by establishment talking heads as "little more than a celebrity and an entertainer who entered politics late in life," Pence marveled at their ability to reach the American people over the heads of the elites and the media to carry their message. The Indiana governor equated the Reagan Democrats of the 1980s to the Trumpocrats of 2016, and checked off key boxes for conservatives by noting similarities in Reagan and Trump’s economic policies and national security concepts.
