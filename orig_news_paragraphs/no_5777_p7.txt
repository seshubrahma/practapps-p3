Legal scholars KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor of The Volokh Conspiracy at The Washington Post argue that the preponderance standard established by the "Dear Colleague" letter of the Obama administration "told all of the more than 7, 000 colleges that receive federal money to use the lowest possible standard of proof" in determining the outcome of sexual assault cases on college campuses. President Trumpâ€™s Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos was harshly criticized by the left for donating to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) which supports the notion that the burden of proof in campus sexual assault cases should be higher and that all accused should be afforded proper due process.
