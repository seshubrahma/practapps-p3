I am going to do that through the 287( g) authority, which would mandate that every locality, every jail in the state will check immigration status   …     and hand inmates over to the federal government if they’re here illegally. Stewart sought to draw a contrast between his own immigration agenda and that of his main opponent in the GOP primary, putative   and narrowly defeated 2014 U. S. Senate Candidate Ed Gillespie, whom he called a "squish Republican" despite his own pledges to be tough on immigration. Stewart has hit Gillespie for serving as a lobbyist for Tyson’s Food as it was charged, and later acquitted, in a human smuggling investigation in connection with its labor practices. Tyson’s widespread use of refugee and   immigrant labor has continued to come under criticism from   immigration groups.
