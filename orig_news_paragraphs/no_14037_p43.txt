Now reach for hope    to overcome this fear , I’m sad and fearful today, not just because a great President is leaving office after performing his duties with excellence for eight years, but because there is virtually no indication that the incoming President is actually ready to lead, to inspire, to empathize, to focus, to mature, to change, to act responsibly and to truly understand the power, duty and responsibility of his new position.   Today feels like the final episode of a reality TV show, and that tomorrow we’ll all just watch something different to entertain us.
