The New York Times reported that the Rubio and Kasich campaigns are now openly planning on a "brokered convention" to stop Trump in the back rooms in Cleveland. The New York Daily News reported that Barbara Bush has vowed revenge against Trump for ending the "low energy" campaign of her son Jeb, and that the Bush clan is   in the effort to stop Trump. The News reported that Jeb may transfer the $25 to $30 million in SuperPAC funds he has left to an   effort. The power brokers’   game is clear stall Trump just short of the magic number of delegates needed to be nominated on the first ballot with the knowledge that many delegates bound on the first ballot by Trump primary and caucus victories would be unbound on a second ballot.
