In dismissing Broaddrick’s freshly relevant narrative now that Hillary is running for office and she is accused of attempting to silence Bill’s accusers) Mitchell actually missed several major "new" details about Broaddrick’s dealings with Bill and Hillary Clinton.

It speaks volumes about the sorry state of affairs of the news media today that it takes a reporter based 5, 000 miles away in Tel Aviv to conduct these interviews and to provide a forum for Broaddrick to first go public after nearly a decade of silence.
