Mr. Trump said he hoped to develop a "great   relationship" with President Obama, with whom he said he had an unexpected rapport. " I really liked him a lot, and I am a little bit surprised that I am telling you that I really liked him a lot," he said. And Mr. Trump gloated about defying the polls and the expectations of his own party to win the presidency, and boasted of how he had taken his revenge on Republicans who kept him at a distance and then lost their own races.
