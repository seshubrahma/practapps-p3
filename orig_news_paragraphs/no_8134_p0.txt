A homeless woman quietly demonstrating in support of Donald Trump near his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday was violently harassed and abused by a group of people who surrounded her, yelled insults at her and appeared to knock her to the ground. [The woman can be seen in a series of videos posted to YouTube sitting silently while holding signs in support of the Republican presidential nominee, including one that read, "20 Million Illegals and Americans sleep on the streets in tents. Vote Trump. "
