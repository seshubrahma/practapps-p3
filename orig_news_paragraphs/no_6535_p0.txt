President Donald Trump announced that he has selected Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for the Supreme Court, keeping his promise that he made to Republican voters in May 2016. ["When Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February, I made a promise to the American people: If I were elected president, I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court," Trump said at the White House during the announcement. " I promised to select someone who respects our laws and is representative of our Constitution and who loves our Constitution and someone who will interpret them as written. "
