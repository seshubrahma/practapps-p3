Saturday nightâ€™s ABC Presidential debate marked the 8th consecutive Republican debate in which   favorite Marco Rubio was not directly asked about his support for the   Partnership agreement. [The failure of the ABC moderators to press Rubio on the issue is significant, as he is the only   candidate who refuses to tell voters how he will vote on the   Partnership.   Last year, Rubio endorsed the deal on multiple occasions. In an April 29   in the Wall Street Journal, Rubio wrote: "We must rebuild our own military capabilities, conclude and pass TPP, and renew our support for freedom and the rule of law in Asia. "
