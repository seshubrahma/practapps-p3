GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trumpâ€™s vow to build a wall along the U. S.  border seems to be spurring more illegal immigration in recent months, according to Reuters. [The news agency says there has been an increase in illegal immigration at the southern border as migrants seek to make it into the United States illegally before Trump gets into office and it is too late.   " They think they need to take advantage while they can," Blanca Rivera, a manager of the Ciudad Juarez migrant shelter, told Reuters.
