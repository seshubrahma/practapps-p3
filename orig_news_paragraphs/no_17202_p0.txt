Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) Wisconsin election officials pledged Monday they would oversee a fast and fair recount of the presidential vote there, as they race to beat a federal deadline for getting it done, but they declined a request to conduct the new tally by hand saying that can only be ordered by a court.    The Wisconsin Elections Commission signed off on a breakneck pace that would have local officials coordinating the recount    which was sought by the Green Party    with them this week and starting the actual recount near the end of the week. State officials must have their new tally completed by December 13, according to federal law.
