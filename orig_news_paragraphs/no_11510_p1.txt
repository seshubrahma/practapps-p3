Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is a distant fourth, with just seven percent support. The winner of Ohio secures all of the stateâ€™s 66 delegates. After Florida, it is the biggest single prize on the March 15th Big Tuesday contests. The poll, conducted Saturday through Tuesday with a 3. 5 percent margin of error, is the first to show Kasich with a lead since August.
