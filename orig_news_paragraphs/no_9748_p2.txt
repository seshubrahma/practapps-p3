Which is why it’s so curious   —   and saddens us  —   this lack of accountability with the lies of Cruz’s own campaign. Cruz’s campaign chairman, U. S. Representative Steve King, is lying, and good for Dr. Ben Carson for calling this out. King, who’s previously asked for and received my endorsement, time and resources to support his own election, is still lying about my altruistic support of Mr. Trump, and he’s refused to provide any evidence to the contrary.
