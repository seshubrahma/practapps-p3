I am for   whoever the   picks. I think there are huge   advantages to Rudy Giuliani, frankly. I think that if you want   someone who is going to go out and be a very tough negotiator for   America and represent American interest in the way that Trump   campaigned, I think that probably Rudy is a better pick and has   the right temperament.
