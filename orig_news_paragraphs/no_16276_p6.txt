In the hours before the Democratic National Convention was called to order, WikiLeaks hijacked the news cycle by releasing a trove of emails from the Democratic National Committee, which revealed that Democratic Party officials were hoping Clinton would beat her rival, Bernie Sanders. While the revelations did not directly involve Clinton, they dealt a harsh blow to her campaign. They caused a commotion, forced the resignation of party head Debbie Wasserman Schultz and embittered Sanders supporters, some of whom may now refuse to vote for Clinton. While the revelations came from WikiLeaks, the hacking, carried out months earlier, had already been revealed in June.
