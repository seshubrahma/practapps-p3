Americans know better. They know that the only realistic and, to borrow from this week’s language from Mr. Trump, humane policy is to find a fair and safe way to allow   undocumented immigrants to get right with the law and go about their lives, paying taxes, having a valid Social Security number, and earning a legal status.    No cutting the line. No "special" path to citizenship.
