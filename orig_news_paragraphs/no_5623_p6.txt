Some changes were made to the memos after they were signed by Kelly. For example, the phrase "In my judgment, such [advance parole] authority should be exercised sparingly," was added to the section in the border security memo that shuts down Obamaâ€™s backdoor "advance parole" amnesty process. The enforcement memo adds a section giving   officials more authority to enforce the law, saying "the Director of ICE, the Commissioner of CBP, and the Director of USCIS may, as they determine is appropriate, issue further guidance to allocate appropriate resources to prioritize enforcement activities within these   example, by prioritizing enforcement activities against removable aliens who are convicted felons or who are involved in gang activity or drug trafficking.
