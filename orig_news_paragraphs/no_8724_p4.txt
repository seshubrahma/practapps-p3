He continued, "Now all of this is interrelated. If Bernie Sanders beats her in Iowa and New Hampshire, which I think he will, that will show that she is in very tough shape politically, and with these polls out with the results in there might be a lot of pressure for someone else to get in the race, like Biden. " He added, "And if there is a chance that she could be indicted and the indictment could knock her out of the race and free her delegates that are already on the ballot to commit to Biden and run as Biden delegates you could still see that happen over the course of the next four to six weeks.
