As had been the case since the first debate, the mood in the Clinton orbit was buoyant. Fallon mentioned that he wished the bad Trump stories could be spread out a little bit, allowing voters to hold and fully savor each in turn, rather than being   them day after day. After a few minutes, another press aide, Nick Merrill, popped his head out of the conference room,   in my direction and said the doctor would see me now. I had not talked to Clinton in person for more than a year.
