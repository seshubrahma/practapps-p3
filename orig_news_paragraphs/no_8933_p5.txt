Obama’s new agreement will help the two governments "collaborate to educate workers [in the United States] about their employment rights and provide them with the resources needed to protect those rights," said the statement, which cited the cooperation between Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and Mexican Ambassador Carlos Sada. The new agreement will use federal tax dollars to train Mexican consular staffers to use U. S. discrimination laws to aid Mexicans in the United States   —   even if they are not legal workers. U. S. officials promised to join events at Mexican consulates that are intended to help Mexican nationals get jobs in the United States.
