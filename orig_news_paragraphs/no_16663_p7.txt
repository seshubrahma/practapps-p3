Now, nearly half a century later, many critics    including   writers    take a more benign view of Styronâ€™s book, noting that at least it sparked interest in slave narratives while inspiring a number of truly great novels by Toni Morrison, Charles Johnson, Edward P. Jones and others.    In my view, a novelist must have absolute freedom to write anything    as long as the writing is good, honest and deeply felt. Then culture will, in due course, separate the wheat from the chaff. Bad, inauthentic writing tends to disappear.
