The foreign policy establishment is only too aware that no one is better qualified to drain the swamp at State than John Bolton. In short, the Iraq War architect argument that Bolton’s opponents are using against him is a ruse intended to play on Mr. Trump’s opposition to the Iraq War. I am confident that as   Donald Trump and his team look at John Bolton’s entire record, they will see a man committed to making America safe again with a sophisticated understanding of national security who knows how to be tough and how to use diplomacy.   They also will find someone who will work hard and loyally to bring the Trump revolution to the State Department and the world.
