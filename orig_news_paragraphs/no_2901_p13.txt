Democrats have won a consistent set of 18 states in every presidential election since 1992, giving them a base of 242 Electoral College votes even before counting some of the biggest swing states. As a result, the last two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, would have needed to capture nearly all the contested states on the map in order to win. At an earlier point in the campaign, Mr. Trump had hoped to leverage his support from   whites and independent voters to put some overwhelmingly Democratic states in play, including New York and Massachusetts. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign chairman, said this month that Mr. Trump intended to compete in strongly Democratic states like New Jersey and Oregon.
