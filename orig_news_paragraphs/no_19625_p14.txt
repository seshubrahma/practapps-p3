During each of the six campaign     cycles during which Tillerson has been CEO, Republican     candidates have received roughly $9 out of every $10 spent by     the   PAC, roughly the same share they had been     under the man Tillerson replaced, Lee Raymond (who     memorably  the Kyoto      Protocol that was a predecessor to the U. N. climate deal struck     in Paris). Total political spending by Exxon’s PAC, meanwhile,     has soared under Tillerson’s watch from less than $900, 000 in     2004, the last full cycle under Raymond’s reign, to more than     twice that in each of the past three election cycles. If     Tillerson actually feels at odds with the Republicans he will     soon join in the Cabinet, there is no evidence of this in his     financial decisions.
