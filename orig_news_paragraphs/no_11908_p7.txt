Trump’s speech on the podium came after he taped an interview with Bishop Wayne Jackson, who along with his wife Dr. Beverly Jackson, serve as the senior pastors for the inner city Detroit church. The interview will air next week.    After the interview, before Trump’s speech, he sat in the front row of the church’s pews for the opening of the Saturday service —  and even danced along a little bit with the black leaders as the service opened up with a few upbeat songs. Later in the day, with Carson as his guide, Trump visited Carson’s boyhood home in Detroit —  walking down Carson’s street talking to the people there, many of whom seemed supportive of what Trump is doing.
