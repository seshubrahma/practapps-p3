New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer has declared that he will conduct an official audit of the New York City Board of Elections in response to many claims of polling irregularities and errors throughout the cityâ€™s primary voting system Tuesday. [Stringer released a statement Tuesday afternoon casting doubt on the integrity of the New York primary on both sides of the aisle and indicting the Board of Elections (BOE):   There is nothing more sacred in our nation than the right to vote, yet election after election, reports come in of people who were inexplicably purged from the polls, told to vote at the wrong location or unable to get in to their polling site. The people of New York City have lost confidence that the Board of Elections can effectively administer elections and we intend to find out why the BOE is so consistently disorganized, chaotic and inefficient.
