Whether policing the southern American border to prevent unwanted migrants from entering the United States or examining passenger manifests to ensure   suspects cannot enter through Mexico, the authorities here have been a critical component of Americaâ€™s national security strategy. In 2014, Mexico launched Plan Frontera Sur to safeguard its southern border from migrants trying to enter from Central America. The plan has essentially served as a dragnet 1, 000 miles south of the Texas border, catching hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans en route to the United States. Some experts and officials have suggested that Mexico could simply ease up on its border patrols, granting passage to large numbers of Central Americans.
