Do I have to do the whole true history of Progressivism? How it birthed Planned Parenthood to exterminate blacks how it started unions to prevent black workers from taking white jobs how the first gun laws were to prevent blacks from defending themselves against the KKK how they tore down black neighborhoods and replaced them with ghettos how they turned black men into criminals by passing more and more laws during Jim Crow and segregation how they continued it further with drug laws and mandatory sentencing  â€¦      And this is the part where you tell me the parties switched sides: that in the 60s, the racist left the Democrat Party and joined the Republican Party. Allow me to pop your bubble.
