Already the President’s schedule is filling up. The White House announced Monday that Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi would visit on October 18, a   affair that will stretch into a late State Dinner. A government funding battle also seems likely to occupy the President’s time this month. Many of the states that officials say Obama will target    including Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Michigan    are easily accessible in a single   on Air Force One, but would leave few moments for other business at the White House.
