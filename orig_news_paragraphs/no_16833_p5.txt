Among urbanites, 25% see at least some of their local police as prejudiced vs. just 10% among those who live in rural areas. In general, Americans have broadly favorable opinions of their local police, 86% view them favorably, 10% unfavorably, with blacks and other   a bit less likely to hold a favorable opinion (91% of whites have a favorable view, 77% of all   and 69% of blacks feel the same). The Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged after several incidents in the last few years in which unarmed black people were harmed or killed at the hands of police, holds a narrowly   favorability rating: 44% view it favorably, 40% unfavorably, and 16% have never heard of the movement or do nâ€™t know how they feel about it.
