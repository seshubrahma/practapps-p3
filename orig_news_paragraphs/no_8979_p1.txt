[Speaking to a group of supporters in Houston this week, Culberson said existing law allows the Trump Administration to not only stop future funding to these jurisdictions, but actually take back past funding. Culberson, who chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, said he has briefed members of the Trump transition team about the report from the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of Inspector General (OIG). The report details the defunding process.   Using the "power of the purse" entrusted to Congress, Culberson told the gathered supporters that he has been able to "step on the air hose" of the DOJ and force the certification of ten sanctuary jurisdictions as not being in compliance with 8 U. S. C. § 1373, an existing law that requires 100 percent cooperation from local and state jurisdictions in order to receive DOJ grant funding.
