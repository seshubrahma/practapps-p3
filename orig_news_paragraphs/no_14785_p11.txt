Walden made clear that the provision that would sunset Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion in 2020 was drafted in consultation with key players, including wary   governors, lawmakers and the White House itself.   Walden’s comments came as sources told CNN the White House, after two days of meetings with conservative lawmakers and outside groups, is amenable to cutting that transition window down to 2017. A separate source noted that the White House was in agreement on the language during the final stages of drafting the bill this weekend.   As it stands, there are no changes planned in the House bill in the weeks ahead, the source said.
