Washington (CNN) New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman showed up at the Javits Center on election night expecting to celebrate the triumph of his home state’s Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.   He left, after a period of "talking people off the walls and off the ledges," preparing to do battle with another New Yorker, Donald Trump    again.   In the weeks since, Schneiderman    who led the Trump University fraud lawsuit    and the nation’s other Democratic attorneys general have leapt to the forefront of the   resistance, taking on his executive order banning immigration from seven majority Muslim countries.
