Am I dreaming this? It’s theoretically possible that Trump could still build a wall, but he’s just massively lengthened the odds of ever prevailing. Sure, you can let the other team build a   lead in first half and still come back to beat them, but it’s a lot easier if you don’t go into halftime 20 points down. Trump entered the presidency with the only kind of power that matters.
