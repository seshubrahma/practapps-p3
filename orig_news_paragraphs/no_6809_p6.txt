Greenblatt did not mention those either. Like Trump, Obama utilized section 212( f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to legally justify the ban. The clause states: Whenever the president finds that the entry of aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, the president may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or   or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
