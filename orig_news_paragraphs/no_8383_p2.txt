As Breitbart’s Adelle Nazarian reported: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg scolded "malicious" employees for crossing out and replacing the phrase "Black Lives Matter" with "All Lives Matter" on a wall at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters. The wall is meant to allow staff to express random thoughts on it. Zuckerberg sent the message in a private, internal memo addressed to Facebook employees. According to Silicon Beat, the memo was first attained by Gizmodo, which took a screenshot of the message.
