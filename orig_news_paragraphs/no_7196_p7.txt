Politico notes that other senators, such as Sen. Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, have "simply declined to answer questions about their TPP position. " "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has yet to take a stance on TPP and declined in an interview to say whether he even has any concerns," Politico writes. Politico notes that with Trump as the party’s standard bearer, "  Republicans" up for reelection have been forced to walk a "tightrope" between trying to appeal to Republican voters —  who are skeptical of   "free trade" —  and appease Republican donors and organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and Club for Growth that lobby for more global trade: The upended politics of trade offer a major conundrum for   Republicans running for reelection this year, particularly in Rust Belt states that could help determine control of the Senate next year.
