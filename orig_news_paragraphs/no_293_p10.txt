Mr. Bushâ€™s successor, Bill Clinton, was the one to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through a divided Congress.

It eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the nations, and set in place processes to get rid of regulatory and other barriers. The idea was that over time a company in Ohio could do business with a firm in Ontario as easily as it did with one in Indiana.
