At the beginning of March, Trump had the support of 30 percent of Republican voters in Wisconsin. On election night April 5, he received 34 percent of the vote, even though two major challengers, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson, bowed out after that early poll. In other words, even though the Republican contest went from 5 candidates to 3, Trump only grew his support in Wisconsin by 4 points. Trump’s share of the vote in Wisconsin, in fact, was just a little bit lower than his share of the vote in neighboring Illinois and Michigan, two states he won, even though there were fewer candidates in the race in Wisconsin.
