However, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department does not recognize this as a lawful hold based on the   v. Clackamas County, Oregon Federal Court ruling. Two weeks before the attack, Martinez was "cited" as opposed to arrested for possession of meth, because of California’s Prop 47 which I’ll address in a moment. On July 16, 2015, eight days before assaulting Ms. Pharis, Martinez was arrested for felony possession of a dirk or dagger, as well as possession of drug paraphernalia. He was additionally charged with two misdemeanors, two $10, 000 warrants, failure to appear, and violation of probation.
