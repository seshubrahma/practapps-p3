  Donald J. Trump may have leapt from   success to the highest echelons of political power. But that does not mean he is ready to give up the   part just yet. Although Mr. Trump is not starring in NBC’s coming season of "The New Celebrity Apprentice," the   is still involved: Mr. Trump will be credited as one of the show’s executive producers, a spokeswoman for Mark Burnett, the creator of the "Apprentice" franchise, said on Thursday. MGM, Mr. Burnett’s studio, declined to comment on what the   would be paid for his participation in the new season, which will feature Arnold Schwarzenegger as the show’s   businessman.
