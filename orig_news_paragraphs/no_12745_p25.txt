One of his few missteps occurred in 2015, and concerned religious liberty. Pence was caught flatfooted when the mainstream media joined the LGBT Left condemning Pence’s signing of Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) which guaranteed that Hoosiers could live their daily lives and operate their businesses consistent with their religious faith. This created a legislative backlash in which Pence eventually signed a "fix" of RFRA, one that left   businesses without the protection in the first statute, while preserving protections for clergy, churches, and   institutions. The very next year, in 2016 Pence regained his footing to push for religious liberty, opposing a proposed "SOGI" bill (sexual orientation and gender identity) that would have conferred special rights upon LGBT individuals.
