  Not only does Erick Erickson want Mitt Romney to restart a search for a   candidate to challenge Donald Trump, he also wants Romney to consider being that person. The conservative blogger wrote for The Resurgent on Friday that he would "gladly work for a Romney Presidency given the choices between" Democratic   Hillary Clinton and Trump. Erickson, who has said he would never vote for Trump, opposed Romney during his previous presidential runs. On Wednesday, Yahoo News reported that Romney has ruled out an independent bid for president and is not trying to get any other Republicans to take up the mantle despite remaining hopeful for someone else to surface.
