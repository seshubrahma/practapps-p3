I can’’t comment on why the Brits did one thing and   the Americans did another. I think there was a common threat and   chose to address them in different way, and I’’m not criticizing   either of them for doing what they did, and we’’ll just do what we   can to help out and secure the safety of our operation, which is   vital for us.
