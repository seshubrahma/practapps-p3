After lunch at a local pub, just a few miles from where my grandparents used to live, we talked about Brexit, the war, American politics, Europe and our families. The setting could not have been more English, with the pale autumn sun setting over the rolling hills of Berkshire. Like my   Sir Michaelâ€™s maternal grandparents were German Jews who moved to England, where they did very well. Like mine, his family of immigrants became utterly British.
