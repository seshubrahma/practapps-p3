From this, Faggioli makes the illogical conclusion that Trump’s popularity among conservative Catholics is racially motivated. Just this week, however, an overwhelmingly white group of 36 prominent Catholic conservatives came out against Trump, which shoots Faggioli’s thesis to hell. To say, as Faggioli does, that "the white conservative Catholic church, whose members are now clinging desperately to Trump," are "terrified to lose ‘white supremacy’ within American society" is ridiculous in the extreme. Moreover, Faggioli wonders aloud how Trump can earn the votes of conservative Catholics despite his "more than   position" on the abortion issue, and concludes that the   cause has dropped in importance among Catholic voters.
