The collision affected Fitzgerald’s forward starboard side above and below the water line, causing significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room," the 7th Fleet’s statement said. A Navy official said the point of impact was where crucial communications equipment was located, knocking out    and other forms of communication on the ship and forcing the crew to revert to the use of satellite phones. Fitzgerald’s commander, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was evacuated by a Japanese naval helicopter while US military copters evacuated two injured US sailors.
