 (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May told US Republicans Thursday that the United States and the UK must "stand strong together" but said that the days of protracted military interventions in foreign countries were over. May heaped praise upon Republicans for their election victories in November, saying it was an "honor" to address them as "dawn breaks on a new era of American renewal. "
