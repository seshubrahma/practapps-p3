Although Muslims have served as judges at the state level, Qureshi would be the first Muslim to serve as a federal judge, according to the legal advocacy organization Muslim Advocates. Qureshi’s nomination comes right in the midst of a presidential race in which Muslims are the subject of much debate. Presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country until they are properly screened. It is unclear whether or not Qureshi’s nomination will make it out of the Senate with just a few months to go in Obama’s term.
