So, if Trump truly wants to be "our president," then itâ€™s time he visits the communities he has demonized and apologizes. True, Trump rarely ever apologizes, but that would be an excellent first step. He has to at least make it clear that he realizes his remarks about Latinos, Muslims, women, the disabled and Black Lives Matter were wrong. Next, he should name real leaders, not his surrogates from these minority communities, to visible places in his administration.
