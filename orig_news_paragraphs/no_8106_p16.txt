Dating back to her creation of "study groups" throughout American homes in the 1950s to inform grassroots voters about the evils of communism, Schlafly’s mission has been, in part, to educate the electorate and hold politicians accountable to the people. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Schlafly began the formation of her "Eagle" brand  —   devoted to inspiring conservatives across the nation to get involved and fight for conservative principles. The Phyllis Schlafly Report  —   her monthly newsletter designed to keep conservatives informed on the pressing issues of the day   —   is now entering its 50th year of publication with more than 600 reports published.
