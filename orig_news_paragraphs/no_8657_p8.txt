Rubio spoke after barnstorming across Nevada for two days, hoping to convert   odds into an upset win. His campaign staff informed Breitbart News on Tuesday morning that he will not be holding a victory party Tuesday evening as the results of the caucuses come in. Instead, he will be heading east to continue his campaign in Minnesota, where he has posted strong poll numbers lately. Rubio hit on many of the familiar points of his campaign stump speech, including a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, and a pledge to defend Americansâ€™ Second Amendment rights.
