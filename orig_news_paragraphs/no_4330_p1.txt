,  —   Joss Whedon (@joss) January 14, 2017,   Whedon  —   a longtime Democratic Party contributor and an outspoken   celebrity activist   —   has been on a social media tear since shortly before the election, when he reinstated his Twitter account to launch an   political PSA featuring the stars of his Avengers movies. Earlier this week, the    director went after actress Nicole Kidman after she said that the country should unite in support behind Donald Trump.
