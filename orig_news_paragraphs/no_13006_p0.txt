During Saturday night’s ABC News Republican debate, The Independent Journal Review’s Larry O’Connor (a former Breitbart editor) asked the Republican candidate’s (via videotape) how they intended to beat the narrative around Hillary Clinton becoming the first woman president. " In 2008 we saw how motivated an electorate can be when they think their vote is making history   …     how will you change that narrative? "  Trump responded with the claim that he does "very, very well against her in the polls, and I can tell you I am the last person she wants to run against. "
