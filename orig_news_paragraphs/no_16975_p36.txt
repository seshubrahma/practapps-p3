I have done it too many times to count. The thought of a powerful leader who lacks the basic humility to admit error and ask for forgiveness    not even from the God he professes to believe in    astounds me.   I voted against Donald Trump because I am a Republican. I accept that Trump duly won the Republican nomination.
