 (CNN) Russia has recently tested what is believed to be an   weapon, US sources with knowledge of the test told CNN.    The US tracked the weapon and it did not create debris, indicating it did not destroy a target, the source said. The Russian test, coming as   Donald Trump prepares to enter the White House next month, could be seen as a provocative demonstration of Moscowâ€™s capability in space.
