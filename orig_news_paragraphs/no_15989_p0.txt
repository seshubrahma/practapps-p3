Washington (CNN) Paul Ryan called the Democratic lawmakers’   Wednesday to protest inaction on gun laws a "publicity stunt," saying that House liberals were more interested in headlines than solving the problem. The speaker of the House also told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" that he was not planning on actively fundraising for Donald Trump’s   campaign, and that he saw possible agreement between his   message and Trump’s protectionist sympathies. But the   that began earlier in Ryan’s chamber earned his scorn.
