No one should be surprised. Paul Ryan is perhaps the best representative of a class of Republican elites who have utter contempt for what ordinary members of the conservative movement think and believe. Basically, if you care about anything other than free markets and maybe rolling back the state, you arenâ€™t a real conservative in their eyes. (The other membership requirements for this sort of Republican are a mobility scooter and a pacemaker.)
