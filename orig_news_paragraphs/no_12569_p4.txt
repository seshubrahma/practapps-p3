Donald Trump has left Louisiana after spending more than three hours touring communities devastated by the recent flooding. The GOP nominee visited   neighborhoods, where debris piled up in front lawns and on curbs as people continued to muck out their homes. During the visit, Trump met with first responders who conducted rescues in the flooding even as their own homes were damaged. And he spoke with volunteers at a church that was helping nearby residents with cleanup.
