Despite poor weather conditions I was Gung Ho for a big day at the Meadowlands. Honestly, I donâ€™t remember much about the game itself, but I do remember the wonderful time I had with my grandfather. I also remember my first encounter with Donald J. Trump. As the weather worsened at Giants Stadium, fans started to file out of the facility.
