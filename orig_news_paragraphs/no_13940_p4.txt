CNN didn’t report on details of those memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific unverified allegations. Shortly after CNN’s report, Buzzfeed released the unsubstantiated memos.   Once that happened, it didn’t take long for Trump to respond on Twitter, accusing news outlets of spreading "fake news" about him. He also retweeted a photo from his lawyer, Michael Cohen, of a (closed) passport and a caption denying a portion of the memos alleging that Trump’s lawyer had secretly met with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016.
