Margaret Huang, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement that the new order would "cause extreme fear and uncertainty for thousands of families by, once again, putting   hatred into policy. " The new measure will be phased in over the next two weeks to avoid the frenetic,   execution of the order in January, which prompted protests across the country and left tearful families stranded at airports abroad and in the United States. The redrafted order, delayed by a week so it would not overshadow Mr. Trumpâ€™s address to a joint session of Congress last Tuesday, represented a recognition that the rushed first attempt at the ban did not pass muster legally or politically.
