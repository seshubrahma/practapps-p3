The second Republican proposal came from Pennsylvania Sen. Pat   Toomey. He crafted legislation that would direct the attorney   general to create a new list of suspected terrorists who could be   barred from buying weapons. ’ ’    "We don’’t want terrorists to be able to walk into a gun store and   buy a gun, and we don’’t want innocent,   citizens to be   denied Second Amendment rights because he’’s wrongly on the list   with a bunch of terrorists," Toomey said during a Wednesday   speech on the Senate floor.
