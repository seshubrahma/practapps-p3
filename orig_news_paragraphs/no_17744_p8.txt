America has always   been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it   free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My   policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he   banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven   countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries   previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of   terror.
