Fish arenâ€™t like mammals as females get bigger, they make lots more eggs, so if you allow fish to get big and old, you get a lot more babies," explains Rebecca Goldburg, director of ocean science at the Pew Charitable Trusts. And since those babies can travel over long distances, protected areas act as conveyor belts that continually seed nearby fisheries with fresh stock. Historically, most of the ocean was effectively protected, by dint of being remote and inaccessible. Now, our technology allows us to fish, mine, and drill everywhere.
