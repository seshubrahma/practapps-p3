Flynnâ€™s offer of testimony for immunity has not been accepted yet. The Senate Intelligence Committee reportedly told Flynn it was "not receptive" to his offer "at this time" on Friday. Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said there are "many more witnesses and documents to obtain" before any immunity request from Flynn would be considered. Schiff took the opportunity to pronounce it was a "grave and momentous step" for a former National Security Adviser to the President of the United States to ask for immunity from prosecution," but he gave no sign of granting it.
