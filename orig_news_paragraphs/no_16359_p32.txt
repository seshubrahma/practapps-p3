Dar   Mosque has been labeled the "  mosque" by critics because two of the 19 hijackers had stopped by the mosque to attend Friday services just before executing the terror plot in New York. And from   Anwar   an   Muslim who went on to serve as a spokesman for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was an imam at the mosque. The   Commission explored how much he influenced the two hijackers directly. He was later killed in a US drone strike in Yemen.
