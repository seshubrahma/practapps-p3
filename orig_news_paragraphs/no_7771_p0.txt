Protesters at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, took to the streets to block traffic and advocate in favor of several progressive causes in response to the results of Nov. 8’s presidential election. [Although the protesters were primarily animated by Donald Trump victory in this year’s presidential election, the students that participated in Friday’s protest did so in support of a wide array of progressive causes.   One student carried a sign that read "Abort Pence," while others carried signs that demanded the end of the electoral college. Meanwhile, some students used the protest to advocate for a $15 minimum wage, while others chanted about illegal immigration.
