David Axelrod, a CNN political analyst and former strategist for President Barack Obama, encouraged his Twitter followers Tuesday to pay less attention to what Trump says and more to how he behaves. " Pressing issue of the day? Best to ignore, unless  until it becomes something more than an AM red meat serving from Dr. Trump  Mr. Tweet," Axelrod tweeted.
