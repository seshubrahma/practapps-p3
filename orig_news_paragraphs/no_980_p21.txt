This gorgeous     video alternates between the Amazon rain forest and a pristine lab to tell a fictive story of "bioprospecting" in the name of global consumerism. On the Hudson side of the sixth floor, Jessi Reaves’s alternately raw and beautiful hybrids of found furniture and sculpture provide both seating and ingenious commentaries on design, modernism and waste. Their snarling energy is matched by their neighbors: the creepy coagulations of color, plastic, resin, drawing and grommets that form the paintings of KAYA, a collaboration consisting of the artists Kerstin Brätsch and Debo Eilers. Some artists approach the unvarnished bluntness of the 1993 Biennial, with complexity.
