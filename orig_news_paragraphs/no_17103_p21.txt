Giuliani went on to describe coverage of his consulting work as "totally, totally and completely unfair and without any description of what I actually do."   " They make try to make it sound like Iâ€™m a world traveling lobbyist and what I am is a world traveling expert of crime reduction, terrorism, economic development and various aspects of international law and American law that is now becoming international law," he said. Giuliani defended his work for Middle Eastern countries like Qatar, which he said was a staunch ally of the United States at the time and claimed that he never worked for Saudi Arabia, which his former law firm Bracewell and Giuliani represented in Texas court cases.
