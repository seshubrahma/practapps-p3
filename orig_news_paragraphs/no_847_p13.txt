The ministry declined to specify when the system would be operational. But the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the deployment was likely to be completed in one or two months, with the system ready for use by April. The arrival of Thaad equipment was announced after South Korea’s acting president, Hwang   talked with Mr. Trump on the phone on Tuesday morning. The two leaders condemned the North’s missile tests as a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions and agreed to beef up the allies’ joint defense posture, strengthen sanctions and step up pressure against the North, Mr. Hwang’s office said.
