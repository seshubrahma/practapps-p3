After the meeting, Nunes told CNN the committee could start interviewing witnesses again in the coming weeks and said the committee was ready to bring in a separate group of witnesses before private testimony from FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, said on CNN’s Erin Burnett "OutFront" following the meeting that the panel still didn’t have any interviews scheduled and reiterated his call for public testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan. All three were scheduled to testify in March, but their hearing was canceled, to the dismay of Democrats on the committee. "
