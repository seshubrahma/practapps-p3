I’ve been one ever since, even when my belief was tested, as inevitably it was. Today, all of us who believe Sen. Cruz would make a great president  —   and conservatives generally  —   need to decide whether or not we support Donald Trump, now that he is the   Republican nominee. Some staunch conservatives have decided they can’t  —   to the point that they may help orchestrate a   challenge on Trump’s right. While I respect that view, I don’t share it.
