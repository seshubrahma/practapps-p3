Drawing from The Stepford Wives, Peele’s favorite film, the comic was able to develop a plot that exposed what he called the "  lie" that "we’re past" this "monster of racism"  —   a lie that Peele admits doesn’t flow from "red states. " One example of this "  lie" in the film is evident when Chris’s girlfriend fails to mention to her neurosurgeon father (Bradley Whitford) that her new boyfriend is black. Rose’s father constantly calls Chris "my man," admits that he would have voted for Obama for a third term, and said his father lost at the Olympics to Jesse Owens and has affinity for the Nazis.
