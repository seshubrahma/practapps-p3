But because of aggressive lobbying by the powerful real estate industry,   active developers like Mr. Trump were exempted from restrictions on using such paper losses to offset ordinary income. The tax value of Mr. Trumpâ€™s paper losses may well exceed his investment in the underlying properties, because he and other developers typically make minimal down payments and use as much debt as possible to finance a purchase.

Interest payments on mortgages and loans are deductible.
