That, at least, is what   Trump probably believes.   His promises to build a wall (that Mexico will supposedly pay for) deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and renegotiate NAFTA turned Mexico and its people into the perfect scapegoat for the ills affecting America    unemployment, stagnant wages, crime and drugs.   Throughout his campaign, we all hoped he would tone down such rhetoric so as not to alienate the Hispanic vote (too much, at least).
