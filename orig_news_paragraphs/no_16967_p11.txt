Chad A. Readler, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, filed an emergency motion with the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals lambasting the lower court’s order charging that if left to stand it would "irreparably" harm the campaign "as well as any unsuspecting citizen who falls in the district court’s  . "    "Intimidating voters is illegal, and the campaign does not remotely condone such conduct," Readler wrote. On Sunday, a   panel of appellate judges lifted the order, giving another victory to the Trump campaign.
