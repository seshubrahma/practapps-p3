We can sum up the Democrats’ strategy more concisely: In socioeconomic terms, they will go above the working class, and also below the working class. That is, they will be the party of George Soros and Al Sharpton. So no room, anywhere, for the blue collars. (Of course, if any of those   pipeline workers end up on public assistance, well, they’ll have a standing offer to join the Democratic fold.)
