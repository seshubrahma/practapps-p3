the same voters who Obama decried as "clinging to their guns and religion" in 2008.   It is ironic that these very social issues that the GOP economic elites want to excise from the platform has been one of the only reasons for blue collar voters to support the GOP, but that is a different story. The matter at hand is whether the GOP establishment is finally going to embrace the dreams and aspirations of those who, as the Jimmy Stewart character George Bailey once said, "do most of the living and dying in this town," or are they going to cling to an outmoded agenda that assumes that what is good for GE is necessarily good for the American people. Please note that being good for GE is not necessarily bad for America, but it also is not necessarily good.
