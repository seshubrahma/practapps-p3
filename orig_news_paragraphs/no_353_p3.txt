In a telephone interview hours later, Mr. Parsi said he had heard only second hand that Mr. Farhadi would not attend the ceremony on Feb. 26. Mr. Parsi said his intention with the message posted on Twitter was to show that under the new immigration policy announced on Friday, no Iranians would be allowed entry into the United States for 90 days. " The clarification of the law made it very clear that he canâ€™t come, whether a green card holder or an Iranian citizen," Mr. Parsi said of Mr. Farhadi, whose film "A Separation" won an Oscar for best   film in 2012.
