Paris (CNN) French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has been appointed prime minister, the Elysee Palace said Tuesday, after Manuel Valls stepped down from the role to launch a presidential bid.   Valls, 54, announced Monday he would put himself in the running to become the Socialist Party candidate for next year’s presidential poll and will have to go through primary elections to win the party nomination. Cazeneuve, 53, is best known for overseeing the nation’s security forces in response to a spate of terror attacks that hit the country, killing 229 people in two years.
