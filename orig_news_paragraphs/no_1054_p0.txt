WASHINGTON   —   House Republican leaders, facing a revolt among conservatives and moderates in their ranks, pulled legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act from consideration on the House floor Friday in a major defeat for President Trump on the first legislative showdown of his presidency. " We’re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future," the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, conceded.
