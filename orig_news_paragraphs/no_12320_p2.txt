In his day, Roosevelt —  like Trump, a rich New York   Protestant —  was also an improbable figure.   He was a war hero, a   appointee in two Republican administrations, and was also, in 1898, elected governor of New York State.

Notably, TR was a critic of the Republican   attitude toward business abuses.
