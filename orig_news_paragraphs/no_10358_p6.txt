Susan B. Anthony List’s Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the the     organization, praised Pence’s   record: Mr. Trump’s selection of Gov. Mike Pence as his Vice President is an affirmation of the   commitments he has made and will rally the   grassroots. Gov. Pence is a proven   champion both during his time in Congress and as Governor of Indiana. It was Mike Pence who led the effort to defund Planned Parenthood in Congress, and it was Gov. Pence who signed into law a historic bill protecting unborn children from lethal discrimination in the womb.
