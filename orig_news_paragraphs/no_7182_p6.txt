Woodrow Wilson’s war to make the world "safe for democracy" led to the deaths of 100, 000 American soldiers and the rapid expansion of federal power through unconstitutional government regulatory agencies. Wilson would not be confused for a conservative. Franklin Roosevelt seized the wartime "emergency" created by World War II to run for an unprecedented third term and then double down on Wilson’s unconstitutional executive measures by putting them on steroids during World War II. Those who voted for FDR to abolish bread lines had to wait in line for sugar during World War II.
