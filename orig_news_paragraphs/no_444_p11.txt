It is unlikely we have found the entire universe of people who have been removed," said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued for the immigrants at the hearing. Mr. Gelernt said that he would give the government another chance to furnish him with a list of detainees and those who were deported, but he added that if federal officials did not provide the list within "a short time"  —   perhaps as early as Friday   —   he would consider filing a contempt of court complaint against the administration. The case may emerge as the first of its kind to decide whether the Trump administration disobeyed Judge Donnelly’s ruling to keep legal visa holders in the country.
