The people at the top also get back the $80 billion in taxes they were paying to help the people at the bottom of the income scale get some insurance, the thing that was supposed to be permanent. (Among these taxes are increases in Medicare charges and a 3. 8 percent additional tax on investment income, both being collected exclusively from individuals earning $200, 000 or families earning $250, 000 or more annually.)   These are taxpaying households that have benefited and continue to benefit significantly from   healthcare. That only sounds inconsistent, until one sees who wins every time: the top.
