The Post’s Anne Gearan wrote from Johnston, Pennsylvania wrote: Hillary Clinton’s   bus ride across battleground Pennsylvania and Ohio was supposed to celebrate her nomination with running mate Sen. Tim Kaine, showcase her plans to add jobs and ring a bell for the fall election. It ended up being mostly about Donald Trump. At nearly every stop through two states Democrats must win in November, Clinton and Kaine talked about the Republican almost as much as they talked about themselves. She invoked him sometimes with   outrage, sometimes with a tone of disbelief and sometimes for laughs.
