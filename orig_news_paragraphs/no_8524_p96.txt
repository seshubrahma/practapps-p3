: Sanders rips Clinton for giving speeches behind closed door to Wall Street. He says "I kinda think if you are going to be paid $225, 000 for a speech," it must be a brilliant speech you want to share with the American people. Must have been a "Shakespearean speech," he says. Where was this Sanders earlier in the campaign?
