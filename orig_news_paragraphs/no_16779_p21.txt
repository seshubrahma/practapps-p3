One senator who wanted to talk more about the legislation before it became law was Bob Corker,   the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.    Corker said he tried to arrange a meeting this weekend with Senate leaders, Obama, and Secretary of State John Kerry to discuss "a better route" for the legislation. " We were unable to get the meeting," a frustrated Corker said on the floor.
