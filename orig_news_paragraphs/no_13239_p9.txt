Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in the words of Emerson’s release, is also "trouncing" Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary. Clinton takes 71 percent compared to Sanders’ 23 percent, a   lead for the former U. S. Senator from New York —  who was elected after her time as First Lady to President Bill Clinton. In a general election matchup, either Democrat wins easily against any of the remaining three Republicans —  although Trump stands the best chance of beating either Clinton or Sanders in the Empire State. At this time, Clinton beats Trump 55 percent to 36 percent in New York, while Sanders beats Trump 53 percent to 36 percent.
