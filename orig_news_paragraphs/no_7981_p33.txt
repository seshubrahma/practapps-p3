Coulter and Marlow saw the media’s "fake news" fixation as the first volley in a new wave of censorship. Coulter noted that as far back as her college days,   have been itching to impose speech controls, even as they fulminated against the Religious Right for its alleged   impulses. Another warning sign of the censorship impulse is the Left’s drive to associate Trump, and every media outlet that isn’t relentlessly hostile towards him, with racism and white supremacy, in a bid to   those organizations and individuals. Coulter laughed as she quoted herself saying she doesn’t think David Duke really exists, "because I only hear about him every four years when Democrats or the media need to smear a Republican. "
