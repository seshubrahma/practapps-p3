The chat marks the first publicly reported call between a US President or   and the leader of Taiwan since Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   It is perhaps the first major sign of the unpredictability that Trump has vowed to bring to   US relations with the rest of the world. The call, first reported by the Financial Times, risks throwing   relations into a tailspin before Trump takes the oath of office January 20.   And it has prompted questions over whether Trump intends a shift in US policy, or if this was a blunder by a team with limited experience of international affairs.
