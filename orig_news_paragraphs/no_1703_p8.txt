" Mrs. Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, recently announced changes that would take place at the Clinton Foundation, which relies heavily on foreign donations, in an effort to eliminate the potential for the appearance of conflicts of interest if she becomes president. Those changes were announced after Mrs. Clinton faced intense scrutiny, including from Mr. Trump, over the foundation’s foreign donations. Mr. Morell, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton who worked with her while she was secretary of state, said he and Mr. Vickers sought the letter after Newsweek reported that Mr. Trump has had business dealings with questionable figures in China, India and Russia, and claimed to have had negotiations with Col. Muammar   before he was toppled as the dictator of Libya.
