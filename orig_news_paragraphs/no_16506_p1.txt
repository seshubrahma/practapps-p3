As a white guy who served two terms as Governor of New Mexico, a border state with by far the largest percentage of Latino residents in the nation, I really wish the nativists and panderers alike would just take a break, admit what the real problems are, and let common sense prevail. Thereâ€™s a reason why Donald Trump is now fumbling his way toward the "middle" on immigration policy, after having gained the Republican nomination on nativist promises to build a wall along our Mexico border and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Rounding up more than 11 million people    a population larger than all but the 7 largest states in the union    is a ludicrous notion to begin with. Everyone knows it, including Donald Trump.
