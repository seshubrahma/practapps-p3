Tillerson did not have any specific meeting listed in his public schedule at the time of the speech. His public schedule just said he was spending the day holding meetings and briefings at the State Department.   Despite his notable absence, the State Department would not officially confirm he was not in attendance, referring all questions to the White House. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
