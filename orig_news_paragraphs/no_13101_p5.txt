When I heard that, I could only think of the fact that Pope Francis has steadfastly refused all public calls to open the Vaticanâ€™s Holocaust files and bank records from World War II.   This issue is particularly timely because of evidence that the Vatican may have profited during World War II through secret investments in German and Italian insurers, and that those companies reaped outsized profits by escheating the life insurance policies of Jews sent to the death camps. When he was the cardinal of Buenos Aires, he said those files should be opened.   Now, as pope, he has avoided the issue.
