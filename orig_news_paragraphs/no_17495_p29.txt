Peter Woltz, who owns Timber Ridge Cattle Company in Osceola, said he planned to watch carefully to see whether Jeb Bush shares what he views as the "autonomous" style of his brother. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in the 1990s, "I thought his father did the right thing, he went in and resolved that situation and then pulled out," Woltz said. George W. Bush, he said, "really overextended his authority and really railroaded the [Iraq] invasion through without going through the proper channels."   After that experience, Woltz said he was far more interested in a candidate such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has emphasized the limits of government.
