Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pledged that she’ll continue to request presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump release his tax returns. ["We’re going to keep asking to see Donald Trump’s tax returns," Clinton stated while campaigning with President Obama in North Carolina on Tuesday.   It’s wrong that some millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries, and we’re going to stop it.   —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton)
