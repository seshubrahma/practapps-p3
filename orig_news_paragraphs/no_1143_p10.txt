There were conflicting accounts of what prompted Mr.   to dig into the intelligence. One official with direct knowledge of the events said Mr.   began combing through intelligence reports this month in an effort to find evidence that would justify Mr. Trumpâ€™s Twitter posts about wiretapping. But another person who was briefed on the events said Mr.   came upon the information as he was reviewing how widely intelligence reports on intercepts were shared within the American spy agencies. He then alerted the N. S. C. general counsel, but the official said Mr.   was not the person who showed the reports to Mr. Nunes.
