Washington (CNN) WikiLeaks on Saturday walked back a claim made by its founder, Julian Assange, that it was "working on" obtaining Donald Trump’s undisclosed tax returns. Assange’s remark came at the end of a contentious interview Friday with "Real Time" host Bill Maher, during which the two discussed WikiLeaks’ recent disclosure of Democratic National Committee emails and voicemails. Assange, who has vowed to release more information to damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign, was asked by Maher, a Clinton supporter, whether he plans to similarly disrupt Trump’s presidential prospects.
