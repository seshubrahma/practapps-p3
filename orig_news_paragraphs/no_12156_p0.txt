Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has unveiled his very own Snapchat filter for tonight’s first presidential debate, which refers to his debate partner Hillary Clinton as "Crooked Hillary. " [ The filter, which places a frame around video content, displays the words "Debate Day, Donald J. Trump vs Hillary Clinton," and is accompanied by fireworks as well as Trump’s campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again. "   It has been praised as a smart move from the Trump campaign, who seek to broaden his appeal to millennials, by creating specialised content for Snapchat, a platform generally used by younger people.
