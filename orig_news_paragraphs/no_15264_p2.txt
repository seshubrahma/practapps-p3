Two, enact a corporate tax reform featuring a brand new "border adjustment" tax, also known as tariffs and,     Three, enact sweeping income tax cuts and repeal the estate tax. All in, and roughly, this would be a $2 trillion loss (over 10 years) for the lower classes, 24 million of whom would lose health care coverage and all of whom would pay higher prices for basic goods under the "border adjustment" tax. It would also be roughly a $2 trillion win for the upper classes, who would benefit from repeal of the Obamacare taxes, the lowering of corporate tax rates, the slashing of income tax rates and the elimination of the estate tax.
