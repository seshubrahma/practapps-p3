With calls to end   sanctuary cities, create a deportation task force and maintain "zero tolerance for criminal aliens," Donald J. Trump laid out a   immigration plan on Wednesday in Phoenix that reverted to the tough, uncompromising talk on the issue that has powered his appeal to his strongest supporters.

" There will be no amnesty," Mr. Trump said with renewed determination.
