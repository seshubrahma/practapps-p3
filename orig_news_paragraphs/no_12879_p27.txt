Reports have documented Ryan’s longstanding support for the     policies desired by the party’s donor class. Despite the vocal objection of his Republican constituents, Ryan championed an omnibus spending bill last year that fully funded President Obama’s immigration agenda —  including funding for sanctuary cities, unconstitutional executive amnesty, the resettlement of illegal aliens within the United States, the release of criminal aliens, tax credits for illegal aliens, and a controversial expansion of Obama’s refugee resettlement operation. Dating back to his time as a Capitol Hill staffer in the   Ryan was part of the effort to derail the bipartisan immigration curbs inspired by Civil Rights leader and   Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. In 2013, Paul Ryan worked    with open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez to push the   amnesty agenda.
