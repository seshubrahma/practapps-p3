Trump appeared at the fashion show along with other celebrities. Other scenes in the film, which do not feature Trump, depict fully nude women.   The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.   The revelation that Trump has appeared in several Playboy videos comes as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton seeks to make Trumpâ€™s  derogatory statements and actions toward women an issue in the campaign.
