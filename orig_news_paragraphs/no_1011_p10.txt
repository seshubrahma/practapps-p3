The paper in Nature documents vast coral bleaching in 2016 along a   section of the reef north of Cairns, a city on Australiaâ€™s eastern coast. Bleaching indicates that corals are under heat stress, but they do not always die and cooler water can help them recover. Subsequent surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, conducted late last year after the deadline for inclusion in the Nature paper, documented that extensive patches of reef had in fact died, and would not be likely to recover soon, if at all. Professor Hughes led those surveys.
