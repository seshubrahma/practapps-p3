Mr. Trump is pressing down hard to win the state, campaigning in Miami on Friday and in Fort Myers on Monday, after a rally in Pensacola recently. Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton is not earning the same support among Hispanics, young people or white voters that Mr. Obama captured when he eked out a Florida victory four years ago in the country’s most   swing state. Mrs. Clinton could afford to lose here and still find other routes to victory. Mr. Trump’s electoral map is narrower he must have Florida in his column.
