In April 2012, Clinton indeed advocated for the "overthrow" of Syrian President Bashar   according to a State Department document released by Wikileaks as part of her email archive. (The email was undated but references a statement made "last week" to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak about "the toppling down of Assad. " Barak made that statement on April 19, 2012, dating Clinton’s email in late April.)
