The Cruz campaign understands that in places with few Republicans, such as San Francisco, a few votes can make the difference  â€”   and can earn just as many delegates as in heavy Republican areas. Given the current polling, there are three foreseeable outcomes in California: a large Trump win, a narrow Trump win, and a narrow Cruz win. A large Trump win could mean hitting the 1, 237 threshold, and winning the Republican nomination. A narrow Trump win could mean falling short of the 1, 237 threshold, but still putting Trump in position to make a bid for the nomination by entering into a unity agreement with either Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
