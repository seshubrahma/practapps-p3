After meeting his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minster Wang Yi, on Saturday, Tillerson stressed "renewed determination" by Beijing and Washington to "work together to convince the North Korean government to choose a better path and a different future for its people," without giving details. Although neither side brought up the subject publicly, Tillerson had been expected to raise the prospect of financial penalties on Chinese companies and banks that do business with North Korea. " The Trump administration is banking that threats of US military action in South Korea and tougher sanctions on Chinese entities will intimidate Beijing into changing its policies," said Ashley Townshend, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney.
