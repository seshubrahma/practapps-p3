Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette, the Trump campaign and super PACs have filed separate lawsuits asking state courts to prevent the recount, arguing that Stein, as the   finisher, is not "aggrieved" because she has no chance of winning in a recount. A hearing is scheduled Tuesday on those actions. Also Tuesday, a   committee approved legislation that would require candidates who lose by more than 5 percentage points to pay 100 percent of the estimated recount cost. Those candidates now pay $125 per precinct, which is Steinâ€™s case is nearly $1 million.
