After about 20 minutes in the hotel bar, Weiner was summoned by an aide, and we boarded a van that would shuttle us to the Wells Fargo Arena. We pulled out of the hotel driveway and promptly plowed into a parked limousine   —   with a loud crunching sound. No one was injured, though Weiner’s volunteer driver for the D. N. C. a local college student named Tim, was clearly shaken and upset.
