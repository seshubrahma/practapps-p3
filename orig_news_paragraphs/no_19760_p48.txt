Or think of the man who targeted Israeli airline El Al in a combined    attack at LAX on July 4, 2002. Or the unemployed   conspiracy theorist who came to LAX in November 2013 for no other reason than to shoot and kill a TSA agent. Sometimes, however, these events can be borderline absurd. In August 2016, a man dressed as Zorro, carrying a plastic sword, triggered an armed response by LAWA police unfortunately for Zorro, his appearance coincided with panic over a possible active shooter somewhere else in the airport.
