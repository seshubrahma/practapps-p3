Americans may soon find themselves living in a   autocracy, courtesy of   Donald Trump’s appointments of retired   military officers to top national security positions within his administration, claims an opinion article published in the Washington Post (WaPo). [  Trump has expressed disdain towards dictatorships, calling the late Cuban leader in a statement "a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. "   In an article published by the Post Monkey Cage blog, Peter White, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland, compares Trump to a dictator for trying to appoint more military officers to top posts within his administration than previous presidents.
