The Afghan Taliban made a similar demand in a statement issued soon after Trump won the U. S. presidential election in November 2016, telling the    to pull U. S. troops out of Afghanistan. Citing the statement, Khaama Press (KP) reported, the "Taliban urged the newly elected [U. S.] President to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan as it claimed victory in the ongoing war in Afghanistan, claiming that the [U. S.] should not further harm its prestige, economy, forces and generals in the country. " However, it is unlikely President Trump will heed the demand of the Taliban, which captured more territory under Barack Obama than at any time since its regime was overthrown by the U. S. military in 2001.
