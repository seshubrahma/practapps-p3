There were no witnesses to the attack. The victim had no memory of it, and DNA evidence was in its infancy and was not presented at the trial. The five youths were convicted almost exclusively on their confessions, which they testified were coerced by detectives. In 2002, another man, a convicted rapist and murderer, confessed to the assault, and his DNA did match semen that was found on the victim.
