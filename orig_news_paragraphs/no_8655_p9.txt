Last month, Miranda and Hamilton   Renee Elise Goldsberry headlined a   fundraiser for Hillary Clinton. The event, aptly named "Broadway for Hillary," was hosted by legendary   Billy Crystal. Those attending the $45 to $10, 000 event at the St. James Theatre were treated to performances by actress Julia Roberts, actor Hugh Jackman, and Emmy and Golden   actress Sarah Jessica Parker   â€”   all performing duets.
