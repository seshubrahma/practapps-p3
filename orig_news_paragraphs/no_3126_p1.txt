Menendez said, "When our products become more expensive if there is retaliatory tariff by Mexico, that’s going to affect jobs here in the United States. That’s not how you become the greatest job creator ever known to mankind. So, you know, our challenge is we need to work with Mexico and get our relationship to meet our mutual challenges, to create greater stability, greater economic growth, to control the traffic of people and at the same time protect ourselves against the scourge of gangs and drugs.
