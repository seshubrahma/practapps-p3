President Trump was lavished with extravagant royal pomp here Saturday, an elaborate start to a trip meant to bolster international partnerships but which aides now hope can reset a   narrative back home. The Presidentâ€™s stop in the enthusiastic Saudi capital is the first in a     swing across the Middle East and Europe. The itinerary will take Trump to the capitals of three of the great world religions and introduce him to the grueling pace of presidential foreign travel. Air Force One touched down in   at the King Khalid airport in Riyadh, where Trump was greeted on a red   tarmac by King Salman and other   Saudi officials.
