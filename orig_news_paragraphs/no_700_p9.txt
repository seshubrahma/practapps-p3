A police officer fired a live round of ammunition as a warning shot. " No one was hit, but it had the intended effect of clearing the scene so that police could make an arrest," Mr. Bystrom said. The clashes intensified, with up to 70 people throwing stones and objects, before the police finally got the situation under control around 12:15 a. m. he said.
