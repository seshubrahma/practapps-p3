Tensions have been on edge around the Persian Gulf this year. In early January, the US   destroyer USS Mahan fired warning shots at Iranian boats near the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow entrance to the Persian Gulf. The five Iranian boats came "within 900 yards or so" of the Mahan, which was sailing with two other US ships, a Pentagon spokesman said at the time.
