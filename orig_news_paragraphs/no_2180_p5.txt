Mr. Kasich, who only four weeks ago quit the presidential campaign  and has not endorsed Mr. Trump, has no idea "what role if any he will have," a spokesman said. He will be in Cleveland that week but has no plans, as of now, to partake in any official convention activities. Several other of Mr. Trumpâ€™s former rivals for the nomination have said they will not attend or have not committed. Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, will not be there.
