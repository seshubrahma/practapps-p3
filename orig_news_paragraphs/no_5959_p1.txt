Liberal Republican Sens. Susan Collins ( ) and Lisa Murkowski ( ) are those two senators who could force Pence to break a tie. Collins declared that she cannot and will not support DeVos. Murkowski said she tried to "get to yes" but could not. Should the vote come down   Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, could provide the   vote on confirmation.
