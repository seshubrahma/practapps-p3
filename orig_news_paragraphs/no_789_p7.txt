But Mr. Trump also used those he invited to send a darker message. In a passage on immigration, he pointed out four relatives of people murdered by undocumented immigrants he had invited the victims’ families to sit in the box with his wife, Melania.

Study after study shows that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than   Americans.
