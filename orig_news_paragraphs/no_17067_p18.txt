I believe we can do better than vilifying our neighbors and plotting their demise. I believe we can understand and value residents from the opposing America. I have learned that it is possible    to respect the Americans with whom I disagree, from both Americas. It is possible to listen to them, to suspend my own beliefs long enough to understand why my opponents feel so strongly.
