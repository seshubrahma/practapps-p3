The federal government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, who are required by the federal Refugee Act of 1980 to consult with states and localities prior to the placement of refugees in those states and localities, have largely ignored the statute’s consultation requirement in every state in the country in which the program operates. Instead of the legally required "consultation" process conducted in good faith to understand a state’s capacity to handle the economic, security, and public health burden imposed on taxpayers in that state, the federal government has conducted a series of window dressing meetings with state government representatives that fail to account for any of the state’s concerns. Even more significantly, the federal government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement have ignored their legal duty to consult with —  or even meet with —  county and other local governments in locations where the federal government has placed huge numbers of refugees. Oakland County, Michigan is one such ignored county government.
