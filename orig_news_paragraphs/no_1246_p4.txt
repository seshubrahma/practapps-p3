Russia and Iran, who back the Syrian government, have responded angrily to the strikes, while allies who criticized President Barack Obamaâ€™s cautious approach have welcomed the change. Some allies renewed their calls for a leadership change in Damascus, although officials in the Trump administration did not portray the strikes as the start of a broader campaign. " A lot of this is an emotional response, but nothing about this strike suggests that the fundamentals of the Syria conflict have shifted," said Noah Bonsey, a Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group.
