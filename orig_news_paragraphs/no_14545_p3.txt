Regardless of the reason, diplomats, analysts and current and former State Department officials say there are risks if the dead air continues.   A voiceless State Department, they say, allows other countries to set the narrative about US policy and events, unsettling allies and potentially shortchanging US businesses, citizens and interests overseas.   " If you don’t have the State Department engaging with the world in front of a camera, you lose the opportunity to shape the international interpretation of what US policy is," said Jeff Rathke, a former director of the State Department’s press office now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
