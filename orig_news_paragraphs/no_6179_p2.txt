Bin Hali said that another item to be discussed by representatives of member states is the "Arab League’s plan to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. " He added that ahead of the summit in Jordan on March 23, the representatives will discuss the terrorism spreading in the Arab world, and the role of Turkey and Iran in regional conflicts. Bin Hali also told reporters that Iran’s meddling in other states’ affairs must be stopped and that the member states of the Arab League must view this, as well as Tehran’s nuclear aspirations, as a shared interest.
