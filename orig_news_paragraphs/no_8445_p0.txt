The D. C. GOP has launched an investigation into the eligibility of its 2016 Republican delegate Rina Shah Bharara, after Breitbart News revealed that Bharara actually lives in Virginia. ["Absolutely unacceptable. Our General Counsel is investigating the findings of your article and he will make a determination on Mrs. Bhararaâ€™s status as a DC Delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention as expeditiously as possible," DC GOP spokesman Patrick Mara told Breitbart News Monday.   Bharara recently said on Fox News that she would support Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee, and she has also criticized both Trump and Ted Cruz after they warned of jihad threats from Muslims in the United States.
