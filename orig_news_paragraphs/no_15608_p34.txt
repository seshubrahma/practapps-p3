JCN has relatively minor asks of its   members: to donate a few thousand dollars a year, to put their names on letters or articles, and perhaps to testify before Congress once in a blue moon. It is in those ways quite dissimilar from the organizations created by billionaires Charles and David Koch, which bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from their supporters and offer them detailed briefings on their political activities at lavish conferences. That doesnâ€™t interest Marcus, who has told associates and aides that he has no interest in building a hefty political organization or a shadow party. In fact, Marcus had harsh words for the Koch network, which have had   fights with the Trump administration in its opening months.
