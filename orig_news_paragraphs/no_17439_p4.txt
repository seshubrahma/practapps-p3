The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment regarding the request. Some State Department personnel have expressed concern why individual names are being requested, but one State Department official familiar with the request said it seems to only mean to help the transition understand who is doing what job at the department. " Whatever names they have asked for thus far have been in the context of organizational charts and trying to get a sense of who is doing what jobs," the State Department official said.
