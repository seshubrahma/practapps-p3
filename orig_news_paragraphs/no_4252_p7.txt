A third prominent dissident, Agustín López Canino, told EFE, according to the U. S.  Martí news network, that he expects Trump to "be fair to dissidents and the exile community and condition the situation on human rights in Cuba, that facilitate a true presence of civil society" in the government. López Canino decried   Cuba as suffering under "ferocious capitalism," where   corporations are getting rich without the existence of a truly free market. The Ladies in White  —   a Cuban dissident group consisting of wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of political prisoners   —   have not explicitly weighed in on the new Trump policy.
