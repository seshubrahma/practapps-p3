In October, during the run up to the presidential election, recruitment figures were below expectations, with 119, 000 new jobs introduced, despite a forecast of 147, 000. The recruitment drive was particularly prominent amongst large and medium sized businesses, which supplied 90, 000 and 89, 000 of the new recruits respectively. The numbers have significantly exceeded original expectations, with economists polled by the Wall Street Journal predicting 170, 000 new jobs in the month of November.
