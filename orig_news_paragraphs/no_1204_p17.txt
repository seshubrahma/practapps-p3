The derailment on Monday happened about 9 a. m. as a New Jersey Transit train pulled into Track 9 at Penn Station. A derailment on March 24 took place when an Amtrak train left Track 6. Scot Naparstek, Amtrakâ€™s chief operating officer, said three cars in the middle of a New Jersey Transit train derailed on Monday, and workers had to place them back on the rails on Tuesday morning so they could remove the train. The accident damaged switch equipment on the tracks, leaving eight tracks unavailable for regular service.
