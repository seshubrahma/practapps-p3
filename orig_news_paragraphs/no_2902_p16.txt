W. in Maine, where Mr. Trump was campaigning on Thursday, said his members had been upset that Mr. Trump responded so personally to the Khans’ critical comments. " Bottom line, it’s about the fact that Mr. Trump attacked a Gold Star mother because of comments that the father made on behalf of the family," said Mr. SanPedro, a veteran of both Iraq wars.
