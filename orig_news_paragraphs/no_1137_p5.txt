To some critics, that suggests that much more change is to come, in difficult situations in a roiled Middle East that have never had clear solutions. Robert Malley, a former senior official in the Obama administration and now vice president for policy at the International Crisis Group, said the uptick in military involvement since Mr. Trump took office did not appear to have been accompanied by increased planning for the day after potential military victories. " The military will be the first to tell you that a military operation is only as good as the diplomatic and political plan that comes with it," Mr. Malley said.
