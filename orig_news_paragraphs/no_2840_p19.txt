Some 400 miles to the southwest and some four decades earlier, Wilma Dykeman, then in her 20s, was writing her own story of grace and moral gravity in Appalachia. Though she would go on to publish 18 books, many dealing with issues around civil rights and environmental activism, Dykeman’s memoir, FAMILY OF EARTH: A Southern Mountain Childhood (University of North Carolina, paper, $18) wasn’t discovered until her death in 2006. In print for the first time, it’s a haunting and exquisite book, not to mention a rare exception to the rule that no one so young should write a memoir. Even without much life experience, Dykeman has a great deal to say about life.
