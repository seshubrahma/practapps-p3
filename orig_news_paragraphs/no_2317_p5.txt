While prominent Republicans often speak highly of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Weld, few big names have come forward to formally endorse him. Mr. Johnson drew criticism from some Republicans last week when he took issue with the expression "illegal immigrant," and his views on fully legalizing marijuana remain out of step with mainstream politics. Still, Mr. Johnson’s supporters have expressed hope that   sentiment could help propel the Libertarians this year. On social media, many of Mr. Johnson’s backers say they hope that Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who has had a public  feud with Mr. Trump, might get behind the Libertarian ticket, but so far they have had no luck converting him.
