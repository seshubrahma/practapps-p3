Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump’s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall," the commission said in a statement. No other details were immediately made available. The statement provided no evidence that the audio issue affected the television audience of more than 80 million people. To CNN producers inside the debate hall, it sounded as if Trump’s audio was at a lower level at the beginning of several answers, perhaps as a result of him standing too far away from the microphone attached to his lectern.
