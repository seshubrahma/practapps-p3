House Speaker Paul D. Ryan was backstage with Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, whom he would soon introduce as the Republican nominee for vice president, whose appropriate but mild remarks would be completely overshadowed by Mr. Cruz’s spectacle.

" I don’t think they realized how strong the reaction was going to be," Mr. Gingrich said.
