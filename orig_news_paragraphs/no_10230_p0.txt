An exclusive video published by the Secure America Now shows an actor playing    nominated Hillary Clinton in a prison cell, piling onto the "Hillary For Prison" meme popular with both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders supporters.   Viewers can see a 360 degree video of Clinton in a cell wearing orange. WATCH: "Hillary Clinton has committed numerous crimes: from lying to the American people about Benghazi to deliberately putting national security at risk by using her personal server for classified information. Hillary Clintonâ€™s crimes should be putting her on the path to the jail house, not the White House," Secure America captioned the video.
