â€”   Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 26, 2016,   The poll is still within the margin of error of 3. 2 percent, but it is in contrast with many other polls that show Trump down in Florida. It does, however, show Clinton with a lead among Hispanics at 51 percent. Other highlights for Clinton in the poll include a commanding   lead in Miami, while Trump has   lead in the northwest part of the state.
