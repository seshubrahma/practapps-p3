The group cannot support Kelly or NBCâ€™s decision to give a platform to Jones and hopes NBC reconsiders its plan to broadcast the interview, said Nicole Hockley,   and managing director. Hockley, whose    son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the organization with Mark Barden, who lost his    son Daniel.
