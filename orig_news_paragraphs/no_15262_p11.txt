Getting a deal done by early 2018 or the end of this year was wishful thinking," said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Trump’s trade team, led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, was expected to begin the negotiating process for NAFTA soon and must trigger a   consultation period before diving into trade talks with Canada and Mexico. Ross said Tuesday at the White House that he hasn’t triggered the   consultation because US Trade Representative nominee Robert Lighthizer, a longtime trade expert and former Reagan adviser, hasn’t been confirmed by a full Senate vote yet.
