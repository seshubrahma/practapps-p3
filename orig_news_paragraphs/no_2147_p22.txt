Even though trial investigators did not know which patient was receiving Spinraza, "anecdotally, it just seemed quickly obvious to us that some patients were following a very different trajectory than what we were used to seeing," said Dr. John Brandsema of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, one of the investigators. He said that while the patients who improved were the most remarkable, the drug also appears to stop the progression of the disease in other patients. " It’s hard not to use very exaggerated terms when you are talking about this, because it really is a pretty major step forward," Dr. Brandsema said.
