["Can’t Stump the Trump" is an amateur YouTube channel where an anonymous college student mashed up news clips with 4chan memes to cheer on   Donald Trump, starting in the Republican primary  —   while simultaneously documenting his insane,    political ascent from an Alt Right perspective. It’s crudely assembled , it’s vulgar, and it’s become an online campaign tradition as infamous as Matt Drudge’s debate polls.
