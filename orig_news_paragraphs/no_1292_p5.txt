President Xi Jinping of China did not offer Mr. Trump any public commitments on North Korea or trade when they held their first meeting last week at    Mr. Trumpâ€™s club in Palm Beach, Fla. Even in private conversations, officials said, the Chinese leader was noncommittal. Mr. Trump has sought to link issues with China before. In December, he warned that if Beijing did not do more to curb North Korea, he would disavow the "One China" policy that has underpinned the diplomatic relationship between the United States and China for more than four decades.
