Mr. Kaine, the Virginia senator, and his wife, Anne Holton, who was Virginia’s secretary of education until she stepped down last month, reported income of $313, 441 for 2015. But aside from their earnings, the release was intended to put a spotlight on Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his own returns. Mike Pence, the Indiana governor and Mr. Trump’s running mate, also has not made public his tax data during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton’s spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement the release sets a "stark contrast" with Mr. Trump, whom she accused of "hiding behind fake excuses. "
