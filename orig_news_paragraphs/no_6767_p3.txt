Parliament speaker Ali Larijani also attacked the United States and Saudi Arabia, which he called "a tribal state very far from anything like a democracy". In a speech at the ceremony, Larijani denounced US sanctions against Iran over its ballistic missile programme. The US "knows that the Revolutionary Guard and its Quds force are the most important regional forces fighting terrorists" he said. The imposition of such sanctions "demonstrates their alignment with terrorists in the region" said the speaker, a moderate conservative.
