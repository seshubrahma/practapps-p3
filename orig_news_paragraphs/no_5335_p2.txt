President Trumpâ€™s "extreme vetting" proposals were thoroughly and exhaustively debated in the election, an election which he won handily. Moreover, his proposals were roundly smeared in the most negative terms as some kind of "Muslim ban" even before the election. No matter how crazy mad these protesters are, President Trump is carrying out precisely the plans he promised he would. Only in politics would a politician keeping his promises be so utterly scandalous.
