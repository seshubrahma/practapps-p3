All three Democrats voted for Obama. Hart’s Location, about 80 miles south of Dixville, first hosted midnight voting in 1948 but gave it up after the 1964 election when residents grew weary of the late hours and media frenzy every four years. Energized with new blood, town residents revived the tradition in 1996, and this year, the town has 41 registered voters. Millsfield is also making a comeback this year, though it’s unclear just when the town last voted at midnight or when its tradition started.
