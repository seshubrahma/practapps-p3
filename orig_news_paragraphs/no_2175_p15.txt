The Libertarian Party says it already will be on the ballot in 32 states and is working on the rest. It will pick its presidential and   nominees at a convention over Memorial Day weekend in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Weld suggested that the Libertarian message, which emphasizes civil liberties and small government, could appeal to younger voters. Discussing foreign policy, he spoke critically of the Iraq invasion of 2003 and of putting "boots on the ground" in the Middle East to project American strength.
