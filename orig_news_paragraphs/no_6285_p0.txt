The mayors of 15 large American cities, including some from   "sanctuary" jurisdictions, met with Attorney General Jeff Sessions in Washington Tuesday to discuss the DOJ’s efforts to cut funding from cities that frustrate federal immigration enforcement. [Session’s Justice Department sent a letter to eight sanctuary cities and the "sanctuary state" of California last week demanding they show compliance with federal immigration laws or lose law enforcement grant money. In a statement issued after Tuesday’s meeting, Sessions clarified what he expects from cities in states in the fight against illegal alien crime:   The Department of Justice will fulfill our responsibility to uphold and enforce our nation’s immigration laws, including 8 U. S. C. 1373.
