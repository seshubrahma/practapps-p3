As their statement of principle, the group adopted the Sharon Statement, which was drafted by    news paper editor M. Stanton Evans. Written "at this time of moral and political crisis," the statement is a succinct summary of the central ideas of modern American conservatism. Among those principles are the following: Free will and moral authority come from God political and economic liberty are essential for a free people and free institutions government must be strictly and constitutionally limited the market economy is the economic system most compatible with freedom and Communism must be defeated, not merely contained. This statement of principles denies the basic premises of Progressivism and liberalism.
