It is outrageous that a Western nation would ban a popular American commentator with millions of listeners and several New York Times bestselling books to "balance" its list, apparently fearing it would be accused of being biased against Muslims. Michael Savage has never advocated violence, and his political views are protected by the First Amendment, which is rooted in the   tradition that began with Britain’s Magna Carta. According to World Net Daily’s announcement of the petition, the ban made no sense in 2009 and still doesn’t eight years later. WND alleges that Savage’s ban was a gesture made to "balance" a list dominated by Muslim extremists.
