ICE asserts that Martinez’s tattoos tie the illegal immigrant to a local foreign criminal gang. Martinez’s mother and attorney refute that allegation. Martinez is facing an immigration hearing this week, where he is expected to be deported from the U. S. The potential deportation of Martinez by ICE shows a clear break from   immigration enforcement policies, where ICE only sought the detainment and deportation of illegal immigrants who had been convicted of crimes.
