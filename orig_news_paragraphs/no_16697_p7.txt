Late last year, the Clinton Foundation reported that it had amended its returns for four years because it incorrectly failed to report any government grants and instead reporting such grants as "other contributions," incorrectly categorized speech fees as contributions to the foundation and, as a result, failed to report some donors that now met the threshold for reporting, and failed to report some entities related to the foundation.   This year, the Trump Foundation admitted it had incorrectly reported the contribution to Attorney General Bondiâ€™s political organization by listing a different, similarly named entity as the recipient instead, although the foundation has not apparently amended its return for that year.   Both foundations plausibly assert these errors were inadvertent, and none of them rise to a level that likely would cause the IRS to pursue sanctions against either foundation.
