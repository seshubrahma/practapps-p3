There have been suggestions that Clinton would be easier for   Republicans to oppose than Trump, since he’s in the party. That’s absolute nonsense. It accepts the premise that voters are 100 percent responsible for every single thing a presidential candidate does in office, which is a   totalitarian idea.   On a practical scale, anyone who thinks Donald Trump would be more difficult for anyone to oppose in office than Hillary Clinton has simply lost touch with reality.
