Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And the response from students was overwhelming. Over a   period, more than 10, 000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump University’s programs. For example: Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump University’s   seminar "excellent" in every category, but also praised Trump University’s mentorship program in a glowing   minute video testimonial.
