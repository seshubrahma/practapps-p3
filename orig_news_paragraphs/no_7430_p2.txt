As part of the revelations, it was reported that earlier this year the FBI began investigating a possible connection between Trump and Alfa Bank, the largest private commercial bank in Russia. The Bureau was alerted to a series of electronic connections between a server owned by the Trump organization and two servers registered to Alfa Bank. The links were at first thought "questionable," but after its long investigation the FBI determined, "there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts," the Times reported. The Trump campaign reiterated that the investigation had proven what they already knew.
