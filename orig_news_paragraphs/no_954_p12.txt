Prosecutors said they had repeatedly asked the Russian government to hand over Mr. Belan but had gotten no response. Nonetheless, officials said that they believe criminal charges serve as a powerful tool to deter cyberattacks. For example, they said, Chinaâ€™s hacking against United States targets decreased after charges were brought against five military officials there in 2014 over damaging attacks against government and   systems. The action on Wednesday was the latest in a series of criminal prosecutions that American officials have brought since 2014 against cyberattackers who they charge were acting on behalf of foreign governments, including China, North Korea, and Iran.
