Twitter, who recently donated $1. 6 million to the ACLU, has repeatedly been accused of censoring conservative and libertarian accounts over the past few years, with numerous   users having been permanently suspended from the platform. Breitbart Senior Editor MILO, Pharmaceutical Entrepreneur Martin Shkreli, and rapper Azealia Banks have all been permanently suspended from the platform, while others have been temporarily suspended following political remarks. Despite the sanctioning of   accounts, numerous abusive users have been allowed to stay on Twitter. In July, Twitter refused to sanction an account that sexually harassed and sent violent threats to a female Breitbart News contributor, while rapper Talib Kweli was able to repeatedly call numerous black conservatives "coons," including Breitbartâ€™s Jerome Hudson, Sheriff David Clarke, and   activist Maajid Nawaz, without suspension.
