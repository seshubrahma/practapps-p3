There are good people in Hollywood, including good, misguided people, but the American film industry simply lacks the moral standing for its many lectures   —   including Streep’s lecture last night. It’s a shame that more people can’t see the empty moral core behind the glittering facade. This is a weak argument, as you might expect if you study what is publicly known about Meryl Streep and Donald Trump and ponder the former not having moral standing to criticize the latter.
