Last week, the Washington Post reported Trump may use his trip to Saudi Arabia to unveil plans for a new "Arab NATO"  —   a military alliance that would work to combat the threat of the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Trump could take advantage of these regional trends to nudge Sunni Arab countries not currently in a state of peace with Israel (only Egypt and Jordan have signed peace deals with the Jewish state) to come out of the closet and launch official diplomatic relations with Israel instead of behind the scenes diplomacy. Trump could also include these Arab countries in   talks in hopes of forging a larger regional deal that goes beyond the   conflict.
