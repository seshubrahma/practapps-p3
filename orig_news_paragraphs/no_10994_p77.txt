Cruz thanks her for her service and says women are capable of doing "incredible things" but when it comes to the military, we shouldnâ€™t be governed by political correctness. He says it is one thing to say we have many women who serve courageously but we should not be forcibly drafting women and putting them combat. He says it is "perfectly appropriate" and "wonderful" for women to volunteer for the Armed Services, but he says drafting women risks putting women in unfair situations.
