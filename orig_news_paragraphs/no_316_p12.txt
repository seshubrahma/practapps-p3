Mr. Ban won his United Nations job 10 years ago with the support of Roh   then the president, a progressive who handpicked him as a candidate. Critics called Mr. Ban a turncoat when he later appeared to align himself closely with conservatives, including Ms. Park. His popularity rating as a presidential contender has plummeted in the wake of Ms. Parkâ€™s scandal. Since he has returned home, Mr. Ban has defined himself as a "progressive conservative" who can mend an ideologically fractured country.
