"I will be honest with you, the President said we were through adding amendments , I’m sure he is as frustrated as many of us are," the Texas Republican    who met with Trump alongside Reps. Greg Walden, Fred Upton and Billy Long    said on CNN’s "Erin Burnett OutFront."   Burgess suggested Trump’s frustration stemmed from the Republican Party’s previous failed attempt at repealing and replacing Obamacare. Now, conservatives are struggling to get many party members on board for the new GOP health care bill, which would eliminate Obamacare taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others, and get rid of the individual mandate imposed by Obamacare.
