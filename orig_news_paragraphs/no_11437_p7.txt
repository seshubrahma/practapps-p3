During a speech at his rally in Houston, Cruz told the nation that he is the only candidate that has beaten Trump in a primary (this was prior to the announcement of Rubio’s Minnesota win). He now has four state victories. Rubio’s only victory came on the Super Tueday caucus in Minnesota. But even there, Rubio only won one more delegate than Cruz.
