That estimated cost came from the Tax Foundation, which performed an analysis based on the specific changes detailed by the Trump campaign, including the elimination of the   tax cut, the Tax Foundationâ€™s Mr. Cole said. The Trump campaign also issued a summary of the proposal that said Mr. Trump intended to reduce the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent, but made no mention of passthroughs. Mr. Mozloom said his group, which strongly advocates a   cut, was surprised and reached out to the campaign. A few hours later, convinced by campaign aides that Mr. Trump intended to keep the tax break, the N. F. I. B. renewed its endorsement.
