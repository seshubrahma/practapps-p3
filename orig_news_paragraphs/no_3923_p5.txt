The Clinton campaign aired just under 200, 000 ads at an estimated cost of just under $120 million during the last 9 weeks of the campaign, dwarfing the Trump campaign’s 76, 000 ads at a cost of $66 million. Clinton’s advantage becomes even more stark when one adds in the almost 50, 000 spots aired by Priorities USA Action, a   super PAC. There was some outside group spending on behalf of Trump, including the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which aired about 10, 000 ads on broadcast during the general election period   …     Clinton’s campaign also bought almost 300, 000 ads on local broadcast and national cable outlets, plus almost 700, 000 ads on local cable channels. In contrast, Trump’s campaign funded less than 100, 000 ads in both categories combined.
