Not without leaving a legacy, however. The series helped solidify the idea that distinguishing between real and fake, truth and fabrication, isn’t really important. I spent a day with the Robertsons in West Monroe, La. in the summer of 2012, between the show’s first and second seasons. The series was still building momentum, but even at that early stage, the Robertsons readily acknowledged that their "reality show" wasn’t real at all.
