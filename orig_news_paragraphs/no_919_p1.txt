Many of the dead were from neighboring Iraq. The Syrian state news service, SANA, said militants set off two explosive charges near the Bab   cemetery, just south of the Old City. Syriaâ€™s interior minister, Mohammed   who visited the site after the blasts, said they had killed 40 people and wounded 120. Other reports cited a higher death toll.
