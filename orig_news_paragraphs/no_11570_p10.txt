Bridges’s willingness to see where Trump’s presidency goes makes him one of the few celebrities in Hollywood to take a conciliatory approach to this year’s election result. Other stars like John Legend, actor Michael Shannon and the rock band Green Day have continued to speak out against Trump following his victory earlier this month. Bridges’ Hell or High Water opened to rave reviews earlier this summer and took in just over $27 million at the box office on a reported production budget of just $12 million, despite playing in just 1, 500 theaters. The film, which also stars Chris Pine and Ben Foster, will be released on DVD and   on November 22.
