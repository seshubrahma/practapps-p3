If Valls wins the Socialist nomination, he will likely face Francois Fillon of the Republican Party and Marine Le Pen of the   Front National in the first round of the presidential election next spring. The race begins, President Francois Hollande of the same party announced Thursday last week that he would not seek a second term as his popularity ratings plunge. It is the first time since 1958, when France’s fifth republic was created, that an incumbent president has not sought reelection. Hollande cited achievements under his watch, including opening up marriage to all couples, strengthening women’s equality and fighting against discrimination.
