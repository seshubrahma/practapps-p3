Pelosi was responding to a report late Wednesday by The New York Times that the scope of the hack of the DNC was broader than had been known. Citing sources familiar with the investigation, the Times reported that hackers compromised the private email accounts of over 100 party officials and groups, including officials in the campaign of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Governors Association    though a Democratic source said that the DGA inclusion was incorrect.   The cyberattacks did include a breach of private email accounts of a number of Democratic party officials, some with direct ties to the Clinton campaign, a US official familiar with the investigation confirmed to CNN. The official said investigators believe they now have a sense of how wide the attack reached.
