Washington (CNN) Mitt Romney is taking a potential offer to serve as Donald Trumpâ€™s secretary of state seriously, even as questions remain about whether Trump considers a Romney nomination as plausible. A source familiar with transition discussions said Romney is seriously considering the posting, which has not yet been offered. Romney is certainly discussing the prospect with his family members who often serve as his closest advisers, the source said, though a decision is not likely until after the Thanksgiving holiday.
