A San Diego State University student walking to her car was confronted by two men who made comments about Trump and Muslims, SDSU police said.   " Comments made to the student indicate she was targeted because of her Muslim faith, including her wearing of a traditional garment and hijab," university President Elliot Hirshman said in a statement. The men grabbed the studentâ€™s purse and backpack and removed her keys.
