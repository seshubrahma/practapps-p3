NY State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is examining the question, meaning Patton will enter office under a cloud.   There’s also an unrelated conflict issue in how Patton will handle her duty to regulate Spring Creek Towers, a vast,   complex in Brooklyn with nearly 6, 000 apartments that was built with federal help: in exchange for government financing, the owners of developments like Spring Creek agree to keep rents at a designated level that   tenants can afford.   Over the years, Donald Trump shed this type of   housing, but  the Trump Organization still owns 4% of Spring Creek Towers, worth an estimated $25 million    and the complex’s ongoing subsidies are regulated by none other than HUD. One wonders what kind of oversight Patton can fairly exercise over the Trump Organization that has employed her for so long.
