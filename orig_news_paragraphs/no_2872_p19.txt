Since oil export sanctions were lifted, Iranâ€™s production has risen almost a third, to about 3. 7 million barrels a day, with minimal foreign help. By reaching agreements with Total and Shell, Tehran now has the ambitious goal of reaching production levels of 4. 8 million barrels a day by 2021, which would give it added clout in OPEC and the ability to go    with Saudi Arabia in competing for growing Asian markets, particularly in India. In past decades, Iran has been aggressive in urging other OPEC members to use their position to manipulate the market for higher prices, while Saudi Arabia has often argued for caution. Saudi Arabia has held the upper hand in recent years, but Iran was a major player at the latest OPEC meeting, as the cartel decided to cut production for the first time in eight years.
