Breitbart News, however, went back and read the original   transcript of the 1986 hearing to separate fact from fiction. Upon reviewing the transcript and interviewing individuals with   knowledge of the case, the portrait that emerges is one of a faithful public servant derailed by discredited allegations. Contrary to the slander peddled first by Kennedy and regurgitated now by Warren, the evidence and testimony from the 1986 hearing depicts a man who cares deeply for the equal and just treatment under the law of all Americans, and who has stood at the vanguard of the various civil rights battles of our times. Sessions, whose favorite book is To Kill a Mockingbird authored by his fellow native Alabamian Harper Lee, was credited during the hearing for helping to obtain the first death penalty conviction of a white man for the murder of a black citizen in Alabama since before World War I.
