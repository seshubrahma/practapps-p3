" When Dr. Jessenâ€™s memo was written in April 2002, he was the chief psychologist at the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, a Defense Department unit overseeing training programs in which military personnel are subjected to simulated torture tactics and mock interrogation to prepare them for possible capture by regimes violating the laws of war. Dr. Jessen and most of his colleagues had no experience in conducting actual interrogations, but the Department of Defense legal counsel sought information from the agency on detainee "exploitation" beginning in late 2001. Dr. Jessen soon left his military position to help set up the C. I. A. interrogation program, along with Dr. Mitchell.
