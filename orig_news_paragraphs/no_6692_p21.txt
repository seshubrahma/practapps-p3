In fact, several senior House GOP aides and House GOP members in both Freedom Caucus and   Caucus offices confirmed to Breitbart News that had the bill gone to the House floor for a vote there may have been as many as 100 House Republicans who voted against it. There is no way that the Freedom Caucus comprised the majority of Republicans opposing the bill. Part of the reason why Ryan urged Trump to call off the vote he previously wanted —   several House GOP leadership sources close to the Speaker tell Breitbart News —  is because Ryan did not want the president to know what people like Sen. Tom Cotton ( ) and Sen. Rand Paul ( ) have been saying all along was true: the bill did not have much support inside the Republican conference in the House.
