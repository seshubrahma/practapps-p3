Tea Party for Trump is launching a     partnership with the National Rifle Association in Ohio and several other key states around the country, "including Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida," the group announced in a statement on Tuesday. [The groupâ€™s first meeting open to the public to explain the operational details of this partnership will be held this Saturday in Lewis Center, Ohio, just north of Columbus.   " The great thing about this project is that volunteers from anywhere in the United States can help     in these key swing states by simply signing up on our web site," Tea Party for Trump spokesperson Bill Hennessy said.
