White House spokesman Sean Spicer reportedly met with his staff near bushes on the White House grounds while nearby reporters sought comment, and Kellyanne Conway was dispatched to offer   gobbledygook to CNN’s Anderson Cooper. At one point, she complained to Cooper that people "are looking at the wrong set of facts."   The struggle of the administration officials tasked with cleaning up the   debacle resembled the frenzied effort of parents who do whatever they can to shield fellow diners when a child has a meltdown in a restaurant. They know they have lost control of the situation, but there’s not much you can do once the meatball has sailed across the room and the spaghetti has been dumped on the floor.
