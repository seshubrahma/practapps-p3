Just look at the number of requests for these   visas as proof. Last year, some 233, 000 visas were requested, far exceeding the 65, 000 cap that was set back in 1990    before the internet age changed our labor and skill needs.   Meanwhile, Trump has called the   a waste of time, misrepresenting and mischaracterizing the program along the way. Heâ€™s argued that the visa program actually outsources American jobs as opposed to creating them, which is what every academic study    including this one from the Journal of Labor Economics    says is reality.
