A police man told me to get away from the edge since they had people throwing bottles at the cars already.   The protesters still screamed and called us names as each car finally was able to leave the parking garage!. The police lines were very thick and also included police on horses.   As I drove through that gauntlet, I was scared not knowing if my car would be a target and they tried to intimidate everyone!
