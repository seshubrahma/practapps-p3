As president, Hillary will fight for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a full and equal path to citizenship, treats every person with dignity, upholds the rule of law, protects our borders and national security, and brings millions of hardworking people into the formal economy. That all appears on her immigration policy page under the subsection that says she will "fight for comprehensive immigration reform legislation with a path to full and equal citizenship" as president. The website also says that if she is elected president Clinton will "defend" the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive amnesty for illegal alien minors and the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) executive amnesty for adult illegal aliens.
