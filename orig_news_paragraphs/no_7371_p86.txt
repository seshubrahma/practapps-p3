The case we have to make to the American people, the case each person in this room has to make to the American people, is to commit to each of them is that we will defend freedom and be faithful to the Constitution. We will unite the party, we will unite the country by standing together for shared values, by standing for liberty. God bless each and every one of you. And God bless the United States of America.
