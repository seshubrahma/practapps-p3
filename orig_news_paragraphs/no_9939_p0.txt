The Nation magazine sports editor Dave Zirin accused Donald Trump Saturday on MSNBC’s "AM Joy" of telling San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to go back to Africa when the GOP presidential nominee suggested Kaepernick should find a different country to live in if he is upset with America.   Zirin told host Joy Reid, "The idea it’s okay for Donald Trump to go across the country bashing the United States, yet for Colin Kaepernick just to say, ‘ Wait a minute, we have a problem with police accountability,’ and he’s somehow the person who then Donald Trump gets to say effectively, go back to Africa.
