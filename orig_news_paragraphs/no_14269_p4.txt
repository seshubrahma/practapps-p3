These days, we are often failing that test. The fact that the violence at Berkeley caused windows to be broken at the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union is a vivid and sad symbol of how much respect for the First Amendment has declined in the United States. Part of Kingâ€™s genius was the realization that the five freedoms of the First Amendment provided the civil rights movement with the avenue to attempt to achieve full equality in our country. That a building named for the great orator has been vandalized to prevent speech should be an indication that we have a serious problem on some college campuses    and across the country.
