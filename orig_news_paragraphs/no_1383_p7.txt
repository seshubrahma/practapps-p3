Cohen’s faces the challenge of trying to seem hip as a franchise business with 130 stores. Cohen’s, unlike Moscot and Warby Parker, sells brands that are not its own (Gucci, Tom Ford and so on). A few weeks ago, however, it began selling a house line called the Collective simple frames that are meant to look as if they come with a free Smith Corona, and sell for under $100. Cohen’s also remodeled its flagship store, outfitting it with subway tiles and making it look like the kind of place a recent graduate of a   liberal arts college might come to shop.
