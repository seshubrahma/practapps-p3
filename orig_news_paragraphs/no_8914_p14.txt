A home state candidate should not be in the position of winning back support that has already moved to other candidates. That Rubio is in this position speaks volumes about the weakness of his campaign. It is interesting to note that last year, Florida Republicans moved up their presidential primary and chose to make it a    contest. This was an admitted play to help either Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio for their expected runs for the White House.
