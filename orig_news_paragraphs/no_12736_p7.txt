This political calculus requires a constant supply of "victims" in order to maintain political power. Massive immigration of unskilled, low wage workers who were resistant to and encouraged to avoid assimilation, provides the replenishment of the underclass and must be maintained to avoid slipping back into an E pluribus unum America. And I should add that I do nâ€™t believe that pluribus has to be defined to mean that the "many" have to be white.
