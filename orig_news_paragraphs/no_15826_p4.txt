Graff said that the pause was taken "not out of fear or out of danger, but out of an abundance of caution," and said the Air Force plans to resume operations on Saturday. There are 55   at Luke Air Force Base. Graff said that it’s still not clear what caused the oxygen incidents, but said that the pause was confined to Luke because "no other incidents have been reported" at any other Air Force bases since May 2. But the Luke   grounding is nevertheless the latest setback for the   a long delayed and   weapons program that’s become the Pentagon’s most expensive in history.
