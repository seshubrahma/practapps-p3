Conservatives and supporters of President Donald Trump have collectively taken to social media on the eve of the 89th annual Academy Awards to encourage a boycott of the film business’s biggest night, as Hollywood insiders and industry observers predict Sunday night’s show could be the most politicized in recent memory. [In a recent Facebook post, a conservative group called the Tempe Republican Women called on Trump supporters to avoid watching the Oscars to send a message to "arrogant, bitter, angry and divisive"   Hollywood celebrities.   " These arrogant, pompous, pampered soulless individuals declare that half of Americans are racist, sexist, and bigoted for voicing our political choice through Donald Trump," the group wrote, mentioning by name actresses Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence and singers Madonna and Miley Cyrus.
