Last time Mrs. Clinton set up Mr. Trump by bringing up his mocking of Alicia Machado, a former winner of his Miss Universe pageant, and needled him by inviting his billionaire adversary, Mark Cuban. This time, Mr. Trump, in prosecutorial mode, showed up with his own jury box. The tactics seem driven by the same recognition: that what happens in the 90 minutes of a modern debate matters less than the conversation before and after. It’s less about sustaining an argument than creating moments  —   generating news clips and viral memes, setting up your opponent to misstep (sometimes, as with Ms. Machado, days afterward) trying to drive the narrative.
