 (CNN) French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron has been the victim of a "massive and coordinated hacking operation," his campaign team said, slamming the attack as a   attempt to undermine him before Sundayâ€™s election. The document dump happened Friday night, less than 48 hours before the country votes in the final round of the presidential election, which pits the independent centrist Macron against the   Marine Le Pen.   The files were released just before 2 p. m. ET Friday, around four hours before the election campaign period officially closed with its restrictions on campaigning, reporting and polling.
