—    I ran a marathon and we proudly raised $3 million for the New York City public school system. My thing was, we had a lot of concerns and complaints about the educational system and how our children are treated. I’m a person of action, so instead of me talking about it, I wanted to go and work with the system and then show them a better way to do it.
