Fueled in part by Mr. Trump’s political success, violent clashes between the far right and far left erupted several times during the presidential campaign. In Anaheim, Calif. last February, three people were stabbed in a brawl after   disrupted a Ku Klux Klan rally. And in Sacramento in June, at least five people were stabbed and eight wounded when hundreds of counterprotesters, including   clashed with skinheads at a rally. But the confrontations seemed to shift into a new gear on the eve of Mr. Trump’s inauguration.
