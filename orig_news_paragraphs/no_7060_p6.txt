Senator Jeff Flake ( ) applauded the EPA’s rule delay and said that the agency protects the environment, instead of the previous administration’s   approach. Flake said, "It’s great to see the EPA working with Arizonans for a change. Nowhere are the flaws of previous administration’s     approach to regulating ozone more evident than in Arizona, a desert state where   ozone makes it impossible to meet the new federal mandate. While today’s move buys Arizona   time, I remain committed to advancing a solution that will provide permanent relief from this egregious and unworkable rule.
