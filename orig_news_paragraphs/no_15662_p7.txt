It was a deception, and only his brother Hashim knew that Salman actually returned to the UK, according to Ben Salem.   Asked if there was any indication Salman Abedi had received training in Libya or planned an attack inside Libya, Ben Salem said, "I don’t think so." Based on what the bomber’s brother has told the militia, "everything was prepared in Manchester" since the end of 2016, he said.   US officials told CNN this week that it is likely Salman Abedi received some ISIS training by traveling to Syria in the months before the bombing, according to information gathered in the preliminary investigation.
