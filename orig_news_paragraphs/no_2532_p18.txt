Lawyers for the city called the suit a "  ploy to nullify a legislative directive and eviscerate" the city’s promise to protect applicants’ privacy. The state’s freedom of information law, the city’s lawyers said, did not grant wide public access to the information of private individuals. On Tuesday, the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, submitted an amicus brief in support of the city, urging that state freedom of information requests "not become a mechanism for undermining governmental pledges of confidentiality. "
