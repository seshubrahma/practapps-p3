Last summer, Innate offered a select opportunity to United States investors, one that Mr. Collins’s friends and associates appear to have benefited from. Under what is known as a private placement, Innate sold a limited number of shares at a discount in an effort to raise capital. In company filings, Innate said one offering of the shares would be sold to "sophisticated U. S. investors" and would be used, among other things, to finance a clinical trial and to gain permission from the F. D. A. to start a process that could lead to applying for approval of the drug in the United States. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private American placement, as did several other of Mr. Collins’s associates and donors, according to the company filing.
