Still, for the U. S. once the unquestioned leader in space, the question arises: In losing interest in space exploration, is the U.

To be sure, some will protest that another, less ambitious, aspect of the space program is doing just fine: namely, the orbital satellite business.   That business is indeed huge according to one recent estimate, there are more than a thousand satellites orbiting the earth, some for surveillance, most for communication, and a few for various kinds of   research and development.
