Another factor    one beyond Gorsuch’s control    is likely also in play: the fiery atmosphere on Capitol Hill as Democrats vow to make the Supreme Court hearings one of the biggest fights in the early days of the Trump presidency.   Gorsuch’s name    previously unknown to many    only recently came on the radar of court watchers waiting anxiously to see who Trump eventually decided upon.   Trump met Tuesday to discuss the nomination with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein.   Gorsuch, 49, has been on the radar of some judicial conservatives for some time.
