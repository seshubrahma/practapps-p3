A group named Indecline, founded by Bum Fights creators Ryan MacPherson and Daniel Tanner, have claimed credit for the unflattering Trump sculptures, titled "The Emperor Has No Balls. " "Like it or not, Trump is a    figure in world culture at the moment," an Indecline spokesperson told the Washington Post Friday. The group approached a Las Vegas sculptor named Ginder, who happily took on the project.
