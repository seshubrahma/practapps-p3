The last time we saw John Oliver on "Last Week Tonight," the weekly comedy series he hosts for HBO, he was blowing up a giant 2016 sign in a soccer stadium, bidding farewell to a year that seemed unmatchable in its capacity for tumult and   news events. Then 2017 came along. As Mr. Oliver prepares for the   premiere of "Last Week Tonight" on Sunday, he returns to an arena where President Trump, the bÃªte noire of the   shows, has been in charge of the country for nearly a month. During that time, the Trump administration has already made the picture more complicated for many issues that Mr. Oliver has addressed in his   segments, like net neutrality, voter fraud, torture and nuclear weapons.
