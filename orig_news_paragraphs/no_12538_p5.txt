Vice President Humphrey did not campaign in any primaries, prefering to collect delegates at   caucuses. At the time of the convention, no candidate had enough delegates to secure the nomination outright. Kennedy was second in the overall delegate count, but his death had left these delegates uncommitted. Eventually, through the aggressive intervention of Democrat party leaders, Humphrey secured the nomination over   candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy.
