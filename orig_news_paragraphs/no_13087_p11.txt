The Obama administration has expunged all references to Islam from terrorist guidelines. Worse, it has enjoined the FBI from looking at the religious affiliations and commitments of potential suspects. This is the way the FBI was able to dismiss the warnings from Russian intelligence agents about the Boston Marathon bombers, who were Islamist militants. It is how American immigration officials allowed the   San Bernardino shooter to enter the country, despite her residence in a country that created the Taliban and protected Osama bin Laden and her association with a terrorist mosque.
