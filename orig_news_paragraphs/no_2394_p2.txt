" All those things did move the polls, but they didn’t fundamentally reshape the race," Mr. Cohn says. " The core underlying dynamic of this election hasn’t ever changed, and that’s that a majority of voters don’t really believe Trump is qualified to be the president, they don’t like either candidate, so when the news is good or bad for their candidate they become more or less likely to indicate their support, but there has never been a time in this race when Trump has been able to assemble a clear path to victory.
