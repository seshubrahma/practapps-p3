Jason D. Delisle, also of the   American Enterprise Institute, said Mr. Trumpâ€™s repayment plan would cost the government more and would give a huge break to students with higher student debt, usually those with advanced degrees. There has been some thought that Mr. Trump plans to turn student lending over to private banks and take the government out of the equation. But there is no evidence that Mr. Trump has endorsed that idea. Both liberal and conservative experts said the proposal would be dead on arrival on Capitol Hill anyway.
