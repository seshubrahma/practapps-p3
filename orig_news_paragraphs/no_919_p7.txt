When asked how he felt about President Trump, Mr. Assad said he was optimistic because Mr. Trump had said that he intended to step up the fight against the Islamic State. " I said since the beginning that this is a promising approach to whatâ€™s happening in Syria and in Iraq, because we live in the same area and we face the same enemy," Mr. Assad said.
