U. S. authorities are preparing to seek the arrest of WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange, according to reports. [CNN reports that, according to officials familiar with the matter, the U. S. is preparing charges to seek the arrest of Assange, who has resided within the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012. The Justice Departmentâ€™s investigation of Assange has been underway since 2010 when WikiLeaks first published classified documents obtained by US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.   Prosecutors first had issues pressing charges as they debated whether the information published by WikiLeaks fell under the First Amendment, but now believe that they have discovered a way to move forward.
