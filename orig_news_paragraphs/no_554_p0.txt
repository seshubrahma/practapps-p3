WASHINGTON   —   Weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, discussed American sanctions against Russia, as well as areas of possible cooperation, with that country ’s ambassador to the United States, according to current and former American officials. Throughout the discussions, the message Mr. Flynn conveyed to the ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak  —   that the Obama administration was Moscow’s adversary and that relations with Russia would change under Mr. Trump  —   was unambiguous and highly inappropriate, the officials said.
