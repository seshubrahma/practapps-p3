Just       imagine the   Republican governors would give       their   senators or the rowdy town halls where       Republicans members of Congress would find themselves burned       in effigy. It’s not a pretty picture. Honestly, the only way       repeal and delay makes sense is if you’re a         true believer who’d rather see the GOP destroy itself than       sell out.
