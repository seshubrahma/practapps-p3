The Citizenship and Immigration Services says the suspension, which may last up to six months, will help it reduce overall   processing times. The agency says it has been unable to process   petitions because of the high volume of new petitions and a significant surge in expedited processing requests in recent years.   Who will the suspension affect? The temporary suspension applies to all   petitions filed on or after April 3.
