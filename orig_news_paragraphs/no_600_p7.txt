A reconstruction of one key episode  —   the July 16 bombing of another hospital, known as M2, in the Maadi district   —   was carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research organization at Goldsmiths, University of London, which was asked to take an independent look at the video and photographic evidence of the bombing. Aleppo was divided in July 2012 between   and   areas. With the support of Russia, the Assad government began a major offensive in September of last year to take the city.
