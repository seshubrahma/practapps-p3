Hillary Clinton is that leader. As she has done her entire adult life, she will work hard to break down the barriers facing so many in this country, and she will stand up against the fear and hateful rhetoric used by candidates like Donald Trump. As she piles on victories, and with the pledged delegate count growing with each win, Hillary solidified her commanding lead tonight in the quest to become the Democratic nominee for president. As the campaign moves forward, educators across the country will continue to make their presence known because we know that Hillary will fight for every student to succeed, regardless of her or his ZIP code.
