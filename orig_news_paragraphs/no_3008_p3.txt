Breitbart News reported: The term "deep state" has been used to refer to deliberate leaks designed to undermine the president, but also to the willing collusion of elements of the mainstream media, the latent distrust and suspected opposition of elements of the intelligence services, but also the willing resistance of certain career civil servants in the agencies charged with carrying President Trump’s directions to fruition. Specifically, the primary purpose of the "deep state is to undermine a democratically elected leader’s agenda and ultimately overthrow that leader. A "deep state" is primarily powered by a steady drip of classified information, much like what has been taking place under the Trump administration. Nevertheless, various mainstream media outlets have dismissed the existence of an American "deep state" working against the Trump administration as a conspiracy theory.
