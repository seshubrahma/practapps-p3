"The reason that the West Bank has not turned into a haven for   terrorism and a launching ground for rocket attacks, in contrast   to Gaza, is because of the robust security cooperation between   the Israeli Defense Forces and the Palestinian Authority security   forces. The IDF and the Israeli government are the biggest   lobbyists of Congress in favor of continuing Palestinian aid,"   said Koplow.   ’ ’    According to Koplow, though the Israelis and their supporters in   the US may condemn the Palestinian Authority and their actions,   they continually fund and prop up the organization for a lack of   a better alternative.
