The Western Wall is part of an ancient retaining wall erected around the Jewish Temple.   The Temple Mount, site of the first and second Jewish Temples, is considered the holiest site in Judaism.         Trump toured the holy sites after a red carpet ceremony at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv and a meeting with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin at the presidentâ€™s residence in Jerusalem. Trump is headed next to a private social dinner with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
