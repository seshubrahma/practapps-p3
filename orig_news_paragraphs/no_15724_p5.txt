The New York Times, citing two senior administration officials, reported Friday night that Trump does not plan to invoke executive privilege, though they stressed the President could change his mind. The White House had no official update to CNN on Saturday. Legal experts are skeptical the President could successfully invoke the privilege to muzzle Comey because Trump has already written a letter about their conversations, talked about them publicly and even tweeted about them. In other words, they say, the President canâ€™t use the privilege as a sword in one context and a shield in another.
