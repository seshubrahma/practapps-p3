Young adults through those in their 50s should be investing in stocks most of what they won’t need over the next five years —  for example for down payments on houses, to pay college costs and as a cushion against a personal emergency. However, it is foolish to try to beat the market and pick the industries and companies that will benefit most from Trump’s program. Instead buy an SP 500 index fund, which covers about 80 percent of U. S. publicly traded equities, and perhaps allocate 20 percent to a similarly broad based international fund. At retirement, folks should be 50 percent in cash —  including money market deposits that are quickly converted to cash —  and only gradually invest in CDs as interest rates rise.
