#DeleteUber started to trend on Twitter Sunday, following a call to boycott the   service by   celebrities and   protesters. [The protest was launched after Uber did not participate in a strike organized by taxi drivers against President Trumpâ€™s temporary ban on travel from certain Middle Eastern countries.   Uber had announced in a   tweet that surge prices were temporarily halted in order to attract customers while other taxi companies protested and refused to pick up people from JFK Airport. In response to the controversy,   service Lyft donated $1 million to the ACLU, releasing a statement against President Trump and in support of refugees.
