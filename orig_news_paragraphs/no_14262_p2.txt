Rep. Kevin Cramer, also a North Dakota Republican, said he received word that the Army Corps will grant final approval and that congressional notification of the decision was "imminent."   The Standing Rock Sioux says the lawmakers’ announcements are premature, but the tribe’s lawyer says they will be prepared for another legal battle if the easement is granted. On Wednesday, Army Maj. Gen. Malcolm Frost said the easement has not yet been approved.
