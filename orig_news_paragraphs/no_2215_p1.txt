The    decision was the court ’s most sweeping statement on abortion since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, which reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade. It found that Texas’ restrictions  —   requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers   —   violated Casey’s prohibition on placing an "undue burden" on the ability to obtain an abortion.
