He said in a Facebook message: "My most sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims of the explosion."   Russia was once a hotspot for terror attacks, but the country has experienced relatively few in recent years.   In December 2013, a suicide bombing at a train station in Volgograd killed at least 16 people. The following day, in the same city,  a suicide bombing on a trolley bus killed 14 people.
