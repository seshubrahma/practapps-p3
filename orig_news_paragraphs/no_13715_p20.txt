One local citizens group, Secure Michigan, opposes the continuation of the federal refugee resettlement program in the state. " We the people of Michigan just lost a massive legal case to the DOJ and CAIR that will pay mosque developers $1. 7 Million and allow them to build a brand new "Shariahville:  â€”   houses, mosque, school, etc. in a residential area. These explosive refugee numbers from   countries warn us that Oakland County and the rest of Michigan will likely become infested with a collection of   Shariahvilles, where women are treated as property, unless some brave person can put stop to the invasion," a spokesperson for Secure Michigan tells Breitbart News.
