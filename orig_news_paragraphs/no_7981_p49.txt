I believe every New York Times   columnist  —    this is about the time I had to stop reading it, and I’ve been their most loyal reader since law school I read them every day I get the enemy playbook delivered right to my front door. I haven’t been able to do it, starting probably whenever the last   columnist wrote the deep think piece on the amazing similarities between Donald Trump and Adolph Hitler.
