Nehlen has said that while Ryan protects his family and his home with a border wall, Ryan has denied the American people those same protections. Last year, Ryan’s omnibus spending bill failed to provide funding for the completion of the 700 mile   border fence that Congress promised the American public a decade ago. Earlier this month, Ryan would not commit to bringing up legislation to fund a wall along the southern border to protect America’s families —   even as he was defending his use of his own personal border wall.
