The hearing quickly became a heated and partisan debate that reflected the nation’s political divide on how best to spend public money in education. Republicans applauded Ms. DeVos’s work to expand charter schools and school vouchers, which give families public funds to help pay tuition at private schools. Democrats criticized her for wanting to "privatize" public education and pushed her, unsuccessfully, to support making public colleges and universities  . Ms. DeVos, a billionaire with a complex web of investments, including in companies that stand to win or lose from federal education policy, was the first nominee of   Donald J. Trump to have a Senate hearing without completing an ethics review on how she planned to avoid conflicts of interest.
