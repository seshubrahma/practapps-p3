com, a community blog set up by Silicon Valley machine intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky. The purpose of the blog was to explore ways to apply the latest research on cognitive science to overcome human bias, including bias in political thought and philosophy. LessWrong urged its community members to think like machines rather than humans. Contributors were encouraged to strip away   concern for one’s social standing, concern for other people’s feelings, and any other inhibitors to rational thought.
