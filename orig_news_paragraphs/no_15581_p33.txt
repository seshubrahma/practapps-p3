And during that same week, I also talked to an Iranian imam on the streets of Dearborn (Well more accurately, in the parking lot of   restaurant). He had no reason to talk to us, but he was happy to. During our brief talk he admitted that he voted for Donald Trump. I say "admitted" because he was sheepish about it.
