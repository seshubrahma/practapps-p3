Texas Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz stated that the challenge issued by one of his super PACs to donate to veterans groups if fellow candidate Donald Trump will debate Cruz is "an opportunity for 1. 5 million apparently, to go to veterans charities" for someone who backed out "because he was very concerned about veterans" while Sean Hannity said he would be "glad" to moderate debate between the two on Wednseday’s "Hannity" on the Fox News Channel.   Cruz said, in response to the challenge [relevant remarks begin around 2:40] "I’ve got to say, Donald, when he backed out of the debate he said he was doing it because he was very concerned about veterans. Listen, we all care about the incredible brave men and women who served our country. This is an opportunity for 1. 5 million apparently, to go to veterans charities if simply Donald will respect the men and women of Iowa and answer their questions, rather than refusing to stand before them.
