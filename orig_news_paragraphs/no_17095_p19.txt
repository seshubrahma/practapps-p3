Bernie Sanders, whose populist primary campaign tapped into the sense of economic malaise and   fervor exploited by Trump.   Schumer’s critics have long pointed to his ties to Wall Street finance and big money donors to question his fealty to working class Democratic values. But Kessler said no one in American politics has a better understanding of the economic challenges facing voters.
