Israel’s defence minister has urged French Jews to move to the Jewish state, following the UN resolution condemning settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. [Five days on from the controversial resolution, which referred to parts of Jerusalem as "occupied" territory, Israel’s government is waging a heated rhetorical campaign against the 14 countries which voted for the motion, France and Britain among them.   The Israeli government is also determined to upend a planned   peace summit, due to be hosted by France in early January, during the final days of the Obama administration. Israel is concerned that the summit will be used by Obama to leave a final mark on the Middle East before Donald Trump takes over, The Telegraph has reported.
