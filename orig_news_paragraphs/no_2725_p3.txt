The son of a Xhosa mother and a   father, Mr. Noah recalls that "the only time I could be with my father was indoors": "If we left the house, he’d have to walk across the street from us. " It was dangerous, as a   child, to be seen with his mother as well: "She would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to drop me and pretend I wasn’t hers. "
