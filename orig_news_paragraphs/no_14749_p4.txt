A different congressional source was skeptical such a proposal could even pass Congress, given the Coast Guard’s important role in security. The Coast Guard has played a big role in drug and illegal migrant interdiction, issues Trump has pointed to as the rationale for why a border wall is needed.   A Coast Guard official told CNN that the service interdicted 6, 346 undocumented migrants and 201 metric tons of cocaine and 52, 613 pounds of marijuana in 2016.   The Coast Guard’s annual seizures at sea amount to more than three times the quantity of cocaine seized at US borders and within the country combined, the source added.
