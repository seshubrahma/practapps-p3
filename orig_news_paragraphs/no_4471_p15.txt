The Ninth Circuit was probably just about to release its opinion affirming a Hawaii judge’s revocation of Trump’s travel ban, but after Manchester, they’ll have to sit on it for a few weeks. Wouldn’t you rather be defending Trump for imposing a travel ban, building a wall and deporting "Dreamers," than for idiotic leaks about nothing? If Trump started removing undesirable foreigners, liberals would rush back to the airports, en masse, and forget all about Russia. The most humane response to terrorist attacks in the West is to kill a bunch of them for revenge, and then concentrate on our own problems.
