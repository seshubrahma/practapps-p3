One Republican said it’s still too early to decide whether to redirect resources to House and Senate races and notes the RNC is still relying on Trump to help raise money for the general election.   Instead, the goal of the conversation with Trump was to explain that his comments can cause consequences    not just for his race, but for the rest of the GOP ticket. Members of Congress are fighting their own tough reelection battles    ones that may cause them to split with Trump or be critical of the GOP nominee on occasion.   Priebus pointed out that if GOP senators don’t win reelection, the outcome will be worse for Trump because his administration would have to deal with a Democratic Senate.
