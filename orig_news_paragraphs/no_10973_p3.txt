In the 2016 election cycle, the Silicon Valley tech elites are almost exclusively backing the Democratic establishment and its candidate. Tesla’s Elon Musk donated directly to Hillary Clinton, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg wrote big checks to San Francisco’s Democratic Party organization, and Microsoft’s Bill Gates heavily funded three Democrat congressmen. Republicans over the last two decades did not mess with Silicon Valley’s outsourced employment business model, but that may have permanently changed with the withering and viral attacks by populist Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Perhaps in response, more than 180 Silicon Valley tech giants and   have signed on to participate in a new initiative, "Take Off Election Day,"  —   including Autodesk, Spotify, SurveyMonkey and Square.
