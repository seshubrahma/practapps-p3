Beck, who in his days as Fox News host was among the leading voices of the   right, invested heavily to parlay that influence into a   media enterprise including not just a syndicated radio show, but also his own television network, news website, movie studio, book publishing imprint and clothing line. And now a lawsuit claims that perhaps Beck’s biggest bet of all  —   his endorsement of Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign  —   further undermined his appeal. People who previously worked with Beck described his decision to devote himself to electing Cruz  —   for whom he hit the campaign trail and turned his shows into de facto infomercials only months after renouncing politics and the GOP  —   as a   bid for renewed relevance. But as Cruz started falling behind eventual nominee Donald Trump, Beck grew increasingly strident, calling Trump a "narcissistic psychopath" who would lead the country into civil war, and picking fights with big name Trump supporters on the populist right.
