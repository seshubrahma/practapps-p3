It is as much about accomplishing strategic goals like destabilizing Europe and NATO, or forcing the European Union to rescind the sanctions it applied after his forays into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.

Spencer, who runs the website AlternativeRight. com and directs the National Policy Institute, an   group based in Montana, from hailing Mr. Putin as a protector of the white race.
