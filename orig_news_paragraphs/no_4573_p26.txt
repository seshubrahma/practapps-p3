However, the study, titled "Criminal Immigrants: Their Numbers, Demographics, and Countries of Origin," relies on extrapolations from the American Community Survey, not on actual data from the Department of Justice. That lack of DOJ data skews the CATO report because it cannot measure how many migrants were sent home before they could   like many American criminals who stay in the country to commit more crimes. That immigrant vs. American comparison problem might be reduced if the federal government released data showing the share of   criminals in jail under   offenses.
