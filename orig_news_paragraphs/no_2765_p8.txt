The mayor of Laredo, Pete Saenz, said in an interview that officials from the Border Patrolâ€™s Laredo sector had approached the city manager last week with plans for removing vegetation and installing additional fencing, lighting, roads, surveillance equipment and other security measures along portions of the border. The plan did not mention a wall, said Mr. Saenz, a Democrat, which he said was "frankly, a big relief. " But he said it included details about fencing that would be placed for short distances along key parts of the city on the border, including a water plant.
