The officer was charged with   murder, and there was a public outcry that McCarthy resign. McCarthy admitted it was a "bad shooting" and that the officer in that incident should be punished, but also said that this   brutality sentiment is "hamstringing" law enforcement. McCarthy said that he is "hopeful" that    Donald Trumpâ€™s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, will do more for police than the justice department under President Obama.
