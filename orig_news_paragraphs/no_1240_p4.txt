" I went on a grueling patrol in March with the   unit, which has the decidedly unglamorous name of Grupo Especializado de Fiscalização, or Specialized Inspection Group. The squad, better known by its Portuguese acronym, GEF (pronounced  ) operates in some of the most lawless swaths of the Amazon River basin  —   places so remote that it takes days to reach them by riverboat or truck from the nearest settlement. Facing such logistical obstacles, GEF, which operates as part of Ibama, Brazil’s environmental protection agency, usually patrols in helicopters, using satellite images and intelligence gathered through Ibama’s regional offices, to detect deforestation and signs of illegal mining.
