The week after Mr. Trump met with the construction trades unions about infrastructure, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that "the president believes in right to work," which would allow workers to opt out of paying union dues or fees. A national    law would thrill congressional Republicans but provoke   opposition from labor. So would a bill recently introduced by Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, that would suspend the   Act, which requires the government to pay construction contractors prevailing local wages, specifically on federal highway projects. For that matter, Mr. Trump’s own coalition is hardly a model of cohesion.
