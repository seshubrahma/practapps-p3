Beyoncé also earned a Record of the Year nod for "Formation," the upbeat anthem the singer performed at the Super Bowl halftime show, and the song’s video  —   which featured controversial imagery including the singer sitting on a sinking police car   —   also earned recognition for Video of the Year.    sensations Rihanna, Drake, and Kanye West wound up just behind Beyoncé, racking up eight Grammy nominations apiece. Beyoncé has 62 Grammy nominations across her   music career, including 20 wins, but has never won the coveted Album of the Year award.
