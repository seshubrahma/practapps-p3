The picture in Illinois is fuzzier because of its elaborate system for awarding delegates, but a healthy portion of Rubio’s 8. 7 percent added to Cruz’s impressive 30. 3 percent sure would have helped, especially if they were divided between tight districts in just the right way.

The outcome on Tuesday night hewed very closely to the nightmare scenario envisioned by Trump opponents who urged Rubio to drop out weeks ago, when it was already   his Titanic of a campaign would meet its iceberg in Florida.
