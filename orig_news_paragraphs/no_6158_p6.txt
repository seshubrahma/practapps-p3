In their book "Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign," authors  Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes quote Clinton insiders explaining how immediately after the election Clinton’s team sought to place the blame for her loss on the narrative of Russian interference. " She wants to make sure all these narratives get spun the right way," one longtime Clinton confidant was quoted in the book as saying. According to the book, "within   hours" after Clinton conceded, senior campaign staffers John Podesta and Robby Mook hatched the plan to blame alleged Russian hacking as well as the news media’s focus on the failed candidate’s private email server.
