One missile aborted after launch and fell into the Mediterranean. But a spokesman for the Russian military, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, called the effectiveness of the American airstrikes "extremely low," asserting that just 23 had hit their targets. The American missiles, according to the Russian military, destroyed a warehouse of mat√©riel and technical property, a training building, a canteen, six   aircraft in repair hangars, and a radar station.
