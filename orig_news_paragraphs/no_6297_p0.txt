Brian Fallon, national press secretary for the failed Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, told audiences at Yale University Wednesday that what he called the "Breitbart effect" was a "profound" obstacle his team did not see coming. ["One of the realities that I don’t think was truly appreciated by our campaign was just how profound the Breitbart effect was in cultivating a standalone ecosystem in conservative media that very aggressively and successfully promoted certain stories and narratives we had a   for during the campaign," Fallon said.   Fallon offered Breitbart News a grudging respect as he expressed his disappointment that his campaign’s attacks on Trump did not have the devastating effect he might have hoped for in another era.
