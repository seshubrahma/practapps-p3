As Breitbart News reported, the executive order issued by President Obama is part of a series of actions taken by this administration to ratchet up tensions with Russia, including sending tanks and troops to Europe and putting a provision in the defense authorization bill that would allow Syrian   fighters to have access to    missiles. The order comes after months of unproven claims by the Obama administration that Russian intelligence agencies influenced the U. S. election by releasing emails through Wikileaks that proved embarrassing to Democrats. The releases include such details as the fact that Hillary Clinton was given debate questions ahead of time, which were dismissed by Democrats because they supposedly came from Russia. The accusations of Russian involvement from Democrats and the media intensified after Donald Trumpâ€™s landslide victory in November.
