Mayor Garcetti and other big city Democrat mayors have defiantly said after Trumpâ€™s election that despite the federal government providing an average of 25 percent of state and local government general revenues, they still will not comply with ICE holds. The reason local government can afford to flout the incoming Trump administration without much fear, is that 95 percent of the $620 billion in federal intergovernmental transfers are   directly to states, who then make transfers to their cities and counties. Direct federal block grants to local government amount to only about $30 billion, and half of that is untouchable as public health and Homeland Security funds. But there are four   "Sanctuary States" that are also defying federal law by refusing to honor ICE detainer requests for immigration holds.
