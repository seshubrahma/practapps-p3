The GOP could rectify that in part by undoing the   rules, but since some ISPs like AT&T and Verizon offer mobile telephone services in addition to broadband, they would still be considered "common carriers," and thus could still be exempt from FTC oversight per the appeals court ruling. ’ ’ This could make legally requiring certain ISPs to obtain either   or   consent for any sensitive information tricky. (ISPs such Charter and Comcast that do not provide phone services would be more affected.)
