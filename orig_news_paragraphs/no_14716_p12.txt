"  Music to the ears of Vladimir Putin, Xi Xinping and authoritarian leaders, Trump’s   approach to people caught beneath the yoke of repressive societies contrasts even more sharply with John F. Kennedy’s appeal in his inaugural address: "To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required    not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.
