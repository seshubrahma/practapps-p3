When   Trump claimed on Twitter that he was losing the popular vote because of massive voter fraud by millions of voters, one of the states he pointed to was California, where the latest voting returns showed Hillary Clinton crushing Mr. Trump. Now the state’s top election official, Alex Padilla, has responded. Mr. Padilla asserted that there was no evidence for the  ’s claim, and he denounced Mr. Trump for what he said was unpresidential behavior. This state has historically been slow to count ballots, a reflection of its size and the inefficiencies of many county voting operations.
