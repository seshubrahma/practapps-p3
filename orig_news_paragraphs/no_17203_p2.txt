Green Party officials filed for a recount in Wisconsin Friday after some limited reports of possible voting discrepancies in areas that used paper ballots versus those where electronic voting took place.   Stein has raised more than $5 million online for the recount in the state, which state officials estimate will cost about $3. 5 million. How will recounts work in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania? Steinâ€™s campaign plans to request a recount in Michigan by Wednesday, and is working to organize the hundreds of petitions needed to get one started in Pennsylvania.
