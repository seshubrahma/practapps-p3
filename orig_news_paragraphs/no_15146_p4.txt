Those federal funds, called Title X, are competitive grants that go to affordable family planning providers. The initiative started in 1970 and is the only federal grant program dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services. Federal law does not allow the money to pay for abortions, although it is not legal for a state to withhold funds from a provider applying for a grant solely because abortion is one of the services it offers. Not all Planned Parenthood facilities or health clinics take Title X money, but some agencies use it to offset the cost of providing free or   services to patients who would not otherwise be able to afford such care.
