Sources told CNN that Gen. John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, actually signed off on the use of the bomb and that the White House was informed before the bomb was rolled out of a   aircraft high over Afghanistan. But that distinction is unimportant for political purposes, as the White House seeks to position Trump as a strong commander in chief to satisfy the yearnings of supporters who viewed the Obama administration’s public arguments and self examinations over the use of force as effete. A sense that Trump is an activist President keen to deploy military force could alter the calculations of other great powers    for instance China, as it works out how to respond to Trump’s demands to do more to rein in its ally North Korea.
