On Sunday morning, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a former GOP presidential primary rival of Trump’s, expressed concern about a Tillerson pick without naming the oil executive. " Being a ’friend of Vladimir’ is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState   MR," Rubio tweeted. Sen. John McCain told CNN on Saturday that he had concerns about Tillerson’s relationship to Russia and wants to hear his answers to such during his   hearing before making up his mind.
