At Valencia College, more than   of the   student body is nonwhite. On Wednesday, black and Latino students with the school’s   Alliance  —   including Jorge Lanza, 23, a son of immigrants from Honduras who goes by George   —   gave out free hugs and candy near the library seven of the people killed at Pulse were current or former Valencia students. Most of them had not been here for long, which is typical.
