BRUSSELS   —    The European Union and Canada signed a   trade agreement on Sunday that commits them to opening their markets to greater competition, after overcoming a   political obstacle that reflected the growing skepticism toward globalization in much of the developed world. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had been forced to call off an earlier trip to sign the deal after Wallonia, the   region of Belgium, used its veto to withhold Belgium’s approval of the deal.
