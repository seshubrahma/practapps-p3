Trump Tower is the Republican nomineeâ€™s grandest and   property, and where his campaign is headquartered. It was from Trump Tower that the real estate mogul and TV reality star launched his presidential campaign last year. It was home to the famous "Apprentice" boardroom. The real estate mogul was not in the building at the time of the climb, but on the campaign trail.
