The cross tabs released do include the full data on the registered voters question, and break down how Trump gets to 37 percent in that sample, and so on. The last time the Los Angeles Times did a poll of the California GOP presidential primary was back between August 29 and September 8, and that poll was done among registered GOP voters —  and no effort was made to clarify any difference between "registered" and "likely" voters. Back then, Trump was still in front —  but with only 24 percent as compared to 37 percent now —   and Cruz was down at just six percent.
