Lewandowski and Manafort were considered part of two rival powercenters in the campaign during the time they overlapped. Manafort took operational control of Trump’s campaign after Lewandowski’s dismissal only to resign two months later, in part due to stories about his political activities in Ukraine.   Manafort is one of the Trump campaign figures under investigation for alleged communications with the Russians during the period in which the Kremlin was said to be interfering in the US election, several current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials have told CNN.   Manafort emphatically denied that he was in contact with Russians known to US intelligence.
