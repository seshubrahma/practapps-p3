CNN reported on the supplement to Comey’s testimony:   The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the "hundreds of thousands of emails" that Comey said were "forwarded" from Abedin to her husband’s email "included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding. "   …      While some of those emails may have been sent directly from Huma in order to be printed, officials told CNN, the number was far fewer than the amount Comey described. The FBI confirmed the distinction in its letter Tuesday, which read: "Although we do not know the exact numbers, based on its investigation, the FBI believes it is reasonable to conclude that most of the emails found on Mr. Weiner’s laptop computer related to the Clinton investigation occurred as a result of a backup of personal electronic devices, with a small number a result of manual forwarding by Ms. Abedin to Mr. Weiner.
