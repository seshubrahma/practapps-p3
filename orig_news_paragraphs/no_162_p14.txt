Mr. Wilkinson said he was on a   trip to the United States in 2005 when the two met, and he made his pitch to Mr. Collins, who was then a businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies. Mr. Collins decided to invest in the company, eventually joining its board. In 2007, Mr. Collins was elected county executive of Erie County, which includes Buffalo, and in 2012, he won election to Congress. He remained on Innateâ€™s board, and Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Quinn said his new political career has had little impact.
