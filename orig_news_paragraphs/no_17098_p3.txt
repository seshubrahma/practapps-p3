Jared Kushner regularly visited his father during the year he served behind bars    and years later, reportedly helped kill Christie’s chances of becoming Trump’s   running mate. With no love lost between the men, it looks like Kushner came out on top again, showing a flair for the   political infighting that is a staple of life in the jungle warfare of Washington. It’s not clear what formal role Kushner will play after Inauguration Day. During Trump’s first   visit to the White House, cameras caught Kushner walking and talking with President Obama’s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, setting off rumors that Kushner might occupy the same position in the Trump White House.
