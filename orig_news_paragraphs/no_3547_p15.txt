" The reduction of the dividend payments for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will ensure the American taxpayers remain on the hook for the bailout of these two failed institutions," Congressman Scott Garrett ( ) the chairman of the House Financial Service Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Entities, said in a statement.

Garrett said. This prompted an email, made public in one of the shareholder lawsuits, from an Obama administration official named Jim Parrott to complain that the net worth sweep had been misunderstood.
