During the first three months of the fiscal year beginning October 1, the last full quarter of the Obama Administration, CBP officials reported a 109 percent increase in total apprehensions. A total of 136, 670 migrants were apprehended during that period. With the January 20 inauguration of the new president approaching, preliminary numbers for January indicated a drop in apprehensions along the border. CNN reported the decline could possibly be attributed to the "expected tough plans" of President Trump to deal with border security and illegal immigration.
