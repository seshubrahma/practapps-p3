The Boeing, which has Mr. Trumpâ€™s surname emblazoned in big letters on the outside and   fixtures inside, has been used as a backdrop at a number of his rallies. But the aircraft weighs more than 100, 000 pounds, and that creates limitations: It cannot land at many smaller airports. As a result, Mr. Trump often presses the 1997 Cessna 750 Citation X, which was designed to seat eight people, into action. It has made hundreds of flights since he announced his plan to seek the Republican nomination in June 2015, according to F. A. A. records reviewed by The New York Times.
