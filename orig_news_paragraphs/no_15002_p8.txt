After initially cutting off certain arms sales to the country as punishment for Sisi’s crackdowns, Obama relented and approved the sale of fighter jets, tanks and missiles to Egypt. But he avoided engaging Sisi, wary of giving the military leader any show of public partnership. Trump has adopted a different approach. He met with Sisi during last September’s United Nations General Assembly, during the final stretch of the presidential campaign, and Sisi was the first foreign leader Trump spoke with by phone following his victory in November.
