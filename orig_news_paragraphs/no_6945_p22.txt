Comey’s "one significant item" seems to be a clear reference to the issue of a reported document allegedly indicating Lynch would interfere in the email probe to ensure it didn’t go too far. Meanwhile, Comey’s admission that Lynch "told me to call it matter "  —   a directive that "confused" and "concerned" him  —   serves as a significant public accusation against Lynch, possibly highlighting her intentions in the email probe. It is instrumental to recall that at the time, Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign not only referred to the criminal email probe as a "matter," Clinton’s official campaign website claimed the investigation was not a criminal inquiry.
