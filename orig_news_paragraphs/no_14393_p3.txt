In many ways, the decision was a reminder of the principle first articulated by Chief Justice John Marshall in the case of Marbury v. Madison that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of Constitutional interpretation in the American democratic system of government. The real threat implicit in the court ’s reference to the relevance of the President’s "numerous statements" that he would impose a "Muslim Ban" will likely subject Mr. Trump to subpoena and questioning under oath about conversations with campaign staff, his family and even supporters such as former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani and NJ Governor Chris Christie. The potential for embarrassing revelations is so substantial that the court’s decision may compel a total rewrite of the Executive Order to render the suit moot.
