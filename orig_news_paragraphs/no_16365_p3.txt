Currently,   taxpayers pay a 39. 6% tax rate on income over $415, 000 for a single individual. If a   executive or Wall Street trader makes $2. 4 million a year (roughly the average for the richest 1%) they would save $120, 000 from their tax bill just on the reduction in the top tax bracket. For the richest 0. 1% the savings would average almost $700, 000 a year. Trump also called for large cuts in the corporate tax rate.
