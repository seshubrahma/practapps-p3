Around 60 protestors gathered outside the U. S. Embassy in London last night to lodge their objection to the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America. [Chanting "black lives matter" "refugees are welcome here" and "Donald Trump has got to go" the small crowd waved placards showing Trump sporting a Hitler moustache and swastika, and gave short speeches.     One white male protestor laid the blame for Trump’s presidency on "old white people" who are "deciding the future" even though they "haven’t got a lot of future left. " Claiming to speak "on behalf of all angry millennials" he added: "[Trump] may have been elected [  …    ] that does not mean we have to make it easy for him. "
