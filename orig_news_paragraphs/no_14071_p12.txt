Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met Jordanian King Abdullah II in Amman on Sunday to coordinate moves against the possible relocation of the embassy.    In the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trumpâ€™s advisers had floated the possibility of initially having the US ambassador to Israel work and live in the US consulate in Jerusalem, while the American Embassy remains in Tel Aviv. Diplomatic sources said such a plan could be a compromise    that allows Trump to move on fulfilling his pledge on Jerusalem    which Israel and the Palestinians both claim as their capital    without starting his term with a firestorm a formal relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv would almost certainly bring.   Trump has named New York lawyer David Friedman as his ambassador to Israel, pending Senate confirmation.
