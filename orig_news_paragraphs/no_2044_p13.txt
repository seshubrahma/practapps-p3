A short walk away in the museum ’s Medieval Hall is one that conveys the opposite impression. Isolated in an inconspicuous spot near a door, and indifferently lighted, it’s a sculpture of the Virgin Enthroned from   Scandinavia. Just under three feet tall, cut from a piece of poplar, she has the recessive,   posture of a shy adolescent and the   face of a dove.
