It is unclear whether the vacancies are the result of the Trump administration ’s overall slowness in hiring or a signal that the president places less importance on science and technology than Mr. Obama did. A White House official who asked not to be identified cast the issue as one of timing: Mr. Trump, the official said, is still reviewing candidates to be his chief science adviser, considers the science and technology office important and will soon have a new staff for it. But critics see the empty offices as part of a devaluation of science throughout the Trump administration, including the reversal of Mr. Obama’s climate change policies and proposals to sharply reduce spending for research on climate change, science and health.
