Earlier on Saturday, the President tweeted from Italy that he would make his final decision next week as to whether the U. S. will remain in the Paris Accord. He was in Italy for the G7 summit at the end of his first overseas trip, which was preceded by visits to Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican, and Brussels. I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!   â€”   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)
