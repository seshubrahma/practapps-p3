While Puzder told CNBC in May that increasing minimum wage to $9   per hour would have a "minimal impact" on companies’’ bottom   lines, the CEO has a history of opposing laws that would raise   workers’’ pay. Puzder’’s critics  —   including groups that have years   of experience working to raise minimum wages across the US   —     cited this history again and again in argument as to why Puzder   wasn’’t fit for the role of labor secretary.   ’ ’   Puzder, meanwhile, argues regulation that would increase minimum   wage would simply result in workers being replaced with   automation.
