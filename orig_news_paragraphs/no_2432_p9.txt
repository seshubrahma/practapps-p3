The effort might also include tougher regulation of heavy trucks, Mr. Foxx said. A second, related effort would focus on setting   goals and speeding the introduction of   technologies that many safety experts say have the potential to prevent accidents by removing distracted humans from the driving equation. One concern so far, though, is that current generations of automated   systems, like the Autopilot feature offered by Tesla Motors, may be lulling some drivers into a false sense of security that can contribute to distracted driving. Whether highway safety officials in the Trump administration will have the same priorities, though, is too soon to say.
