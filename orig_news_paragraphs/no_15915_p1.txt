" Along with changing programmatic priorities, these proposed cuts would result in a dangerous reduction of civil rights enforcement across the country, leaving communities of color, LGBT people, older people, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups exposed to greater risk of discrimination," the commission wrote in a statement announcing the investigation. The commission cited proposed staff decreases in several departments and agencies as well as the actions of the Justice Department and the Education secretary in its reasons for taking the assessment. The administration’s budget would reduce money for civil   offices in several agencies, making cuts of 15% and 23% in some cases, and would eliminate the EPA’s Environmental Justice program and the nonprofit Legal Services Corp. which supports civil legal aid for   Americans, the commission said.
