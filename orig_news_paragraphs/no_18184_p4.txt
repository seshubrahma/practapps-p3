The meeting was "100% focused" on pushing the   president’’s agenda forward, a source told Axios. ’ ’    And though Bannon, a hardline isolationist, had argued against US   intervention in Syria, his allies said on Saturday that incoming   domestic policies would be more aligned with his views.    Conversely, allies of Kushner and Cohn have said that the   president will put forth an agenda that favors more centrist   policies on key issues.
