When a Cruz supporter (Cruz’s foreign policy adviser should better know the positions of his opponents) claimed that Trump said the U. S. should get out of NATO, Blitzer, who is a foreign policy expert, immediately corrected him and said that is not what Trump said. Blitzer said Trump never said the U. S. should pull out of NATO.
