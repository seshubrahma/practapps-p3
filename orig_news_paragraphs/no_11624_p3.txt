The 11 state parties participating in the joint fundraising effort are Arkansas, Connecticut, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. As a result, $110, 000 of any contribution to the joint fundraising effort would be split among the state parties. Only one of these states, Virginia, is a battleground state in the Presidential contest in November. State parties, however, can transfer unlimited amounts to other state party campaign efforts.
