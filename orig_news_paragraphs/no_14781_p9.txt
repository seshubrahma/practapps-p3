Fueling the fear and anger is the fact that the Trump administrationâ€™s new enforcement priorities could be applied to virtually every undocumented immigrant in the United States    whereas the Obama administration had focused on serious and violent criminals.   While the new administration has said criminals are a priority, Trump has expanded enforcement powers to potentially deport undocumented immigrants who have lived in their communities for years    and may have family members who are legal US residents or citizens. Increased action by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents last month netted nearly 700 arrests nationwide, amplifying anxiety in longtime immigrant enclaves. Earlier this month, immigration agents detained Daniela Vargas, 22, after she publicly criticized the recent spate of federal raids during a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi.
