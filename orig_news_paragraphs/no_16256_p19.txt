So, violent crime was already on a downward trend before Holder or Obama took office. It’s not fair to credit this administration for any increases or decreases in those rates without noting that larger trend. Also, the federal and state prison populations have been on a significant rise for the past 40 years. While the 2014 decrease is notable, it doesn’t come close to reversing that larger trend (there were more than 214, 000 inmates in federal prisons in 2014, 769% more than the 25, 000 federal inmates in 1980).
