DiCaprio has previously said that climate change "deniers" should be barred from holding public office. But the   star and environmental warrior has also come under fire for his apparent affinity for private air travel. In April 2015, leaked emails taken from Sony Pictures revealed that DiCaprio used a private jet six times over a   period the previous year to travel between New York and Los Angeles for filmmakerâ€™s meetings in May, the star reportedly flew 8, 000 miles between Cannes, France and New York City on a private jet to collect an environmental activism award. DiCaprio also hosts his annual Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation climate change gala in St. Tropez, France, which requires its   guests to travel thousands of miles by air to attend.
