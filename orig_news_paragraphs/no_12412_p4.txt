Another question dealt with Clinton’s extension of the president’s refugee programs: Hillary Clinton’s supporters at the Refugee Council want to increase the number of refugees coming into the United States in 2017 even more, to 200, 000, and Hillary wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees in that total from 10, 000 in 2016 to 65, 000 in 2017. Do you approve or disapprove of this increase? In this question, 30 percent of Oregon voters approve, 60 percent disapprove, and 10 percent were unsure.
