Reports note that the gang rape might never have come to light if one of Burrows’ fellow gang members hadn’t bragged about the rape to his   and showed him the "funny" video recording of the rape, which he had saved on his cellphone. The Washington Post reports that on the   audio recording of the rape, Burrows can be heard "like a coach" giving instructions to the men on how to rape the girl. " The victim could be heard screaming and saying in slurred speech to stop," the Post writes.
