The law enforcement official says the current plans for security at Trump Tower would differ if the future first family were living at the White House full time and Trumpâ€™s wife Melania and their son Barron were not staying behind in New York City through the Spring. Once the Trumps live at the White House full time the USSS will have to reassess what kind of a security presence will be needed at Trump Tower, depending on how often Trump and his family return to New York City. The official says this kind of planning is typical for the Secret Service after every election but "what is unordinary is that the President Elect lives on 5th Avenue. "
