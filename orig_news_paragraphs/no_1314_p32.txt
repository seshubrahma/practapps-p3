He worked with a marine biologist named Anthony D’Agostino, and using a process he flamboyantly called superhomeogenation, they created a hybrid brine shrimp that could more easily survive the United States Postal Service and be more likely to flourish after reanimation. They worked with the   species artemia salina, and because they made their breakthrough at Montauk’s NYOSL, the New York Ocean Science Laboratory they called their new hybrid artemia "nyos. " (I contacted D’Agostino at his home, but his wife said he was seriously ill and couldn’t come to the phone.)
