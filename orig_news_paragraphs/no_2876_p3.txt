In a statement on Tuesday, Wells Fargo said it believed it had already addressed the areas with which regulators had found fault. " We will continue to work closely with the agencies to better understand their concerns so that we can bring our resolution process in line with their expectations," the bank said. Regulators said the issue with Wells Fargoâ€™s plan was not related to its huge sham accounts fraud, which has plunged the bank into turmoil since September.
