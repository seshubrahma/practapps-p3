Other outside Democratic groups are also intensifying their efforts for the final weeks before the election, focusing on   outreach rather than television advertising. Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist, said in an interview on Tuesday that he was pouring another $15 million into For Our Future, a joint super PAC he is running with several labor unions. The group is spending money in seven swing states, chiefly on field organizing and voter mobilization. It aims to knock on eight million doors between now and the election.
