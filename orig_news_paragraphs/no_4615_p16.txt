At the time, I applauded Pruitt for saying what needed to be said. It was certainly an improvement on his disappointing performance at CPAC a few weeks before when he’d bounded around Tiggerishly repeating his favourite meaningless catchphrase "the future ain’t what it used to be" but proved himself quite incapable of answering a straightforward question about whether he believed in   climate change. But I gather from my sources that there was blowback from the White House (why, it is not clear).
