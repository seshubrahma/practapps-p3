Although Stephen Colbert made a name for himself mocking Fox News on his   Comedy Central show "The Colbert Report," for his big   Bowl "Late Show," the   comedian has invited Fox News’s Megyn Kelly to appear. Her ongoing feud with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump combined with her Michael Moore   appear to have put Kelly’s celebrity on the rise.   In the   department, Kelly and Colbert should have much to talk about: Trump, meanwhile, is one of Colbert’s favorite topics, and there’s almost no   subject he cannot segue into a Trump gag.
