Republicans in Congress passed a bill in       early 2016 that did just that, which President Obama promptly       vetoed. Once President Trump takes the reins, the thinking       goes, Republicans can get a big win under their belts,       establish their conservative bona fides, and then press ahead       with slashing taxes and regulations.      ’ ’       Repeal and delay wouldn’t cut off the flow of Obamacare funds       immediately. It would give Republicans in Congress until 2019       or 2020 to come up with a viable replacement.
