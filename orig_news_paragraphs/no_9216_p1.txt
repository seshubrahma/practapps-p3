The government doesn’t pay net refunds when business owners lose money, but it lets taxpayers use those losses to smooth their tax payments as they make money. That reflects the fact that "the natural business cycle of a taxpayer may exceed 12 months," according to a congressional report. Typically, for federal returns, such net operating losses can be carried backward for two years to offset past income and then kept on a taxpayer’s books for 20 years, though Mr. Trump’s losses could only qualify for a   carryforward under the law at the time. The Clinton campaign has hammered Trump on his unreleased tax returns.
