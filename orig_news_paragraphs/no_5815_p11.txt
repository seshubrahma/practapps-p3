One possible element of any new comprehensive bill is GOP Sen. Ron Johnsonâ€™s unpopular proposal to invite additional 500, 000 guest workers, plus their families, to take jobs from U. S. workers every year. The federal government already allows companies to import almost 1 million temporary "contract workers" each year, even though four million Americans turn 18 and begin looking for jobs each year. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin is also pushing a "BRIDGE Act" that would provide amnesty to several hundred thousand illegals who were brought to the United States as children by their parents. Once the beneficiaries receive the amnesty and then citizenship, they can also put their   parents on track to get residency, citizenship, Medicare and Social Security payments.
