CBS SF Bay Area reported that a police officer was also "assaulted" at the San Jose rally. Breitbart News previously reported that Ohio Governor John Kasich rejected a Cleveland Police Union request that he suspend the stateâ€™s open carry laws during the Republican National Convention. Press secretary Emmalee Kalmbach made clear that Ohio governors lack the authority to suspend a law that is constitutionally protected at the state or federal level. Photo:
