Following my previous article on a "Satanist"   planned by leftists at California Polytechnic to protest MILO’s upcoming visit to campus, The Satanic Temple have reached out to clarify that they have nothing to do with the event, and defend MILO’s right to free speech. [In response to my previous article, entitled "Cal Poly Leftists Plan Satanist   Against MILO," Lucien Greaves, the   of The Satanic Temple (TST) immediately reached out to distance the group from the   event at California Polytechnic State University.   " The Satanic Temple was not in any way involved in this, nor would we be," said Greaves.
