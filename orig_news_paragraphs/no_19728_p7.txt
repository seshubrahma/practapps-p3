By many measures, outlying provinces are dramatically   by Argentina’s central government than is Buenos Aires, which contains around 40 percent of the country’s population. " Lots of studies show these [outlying] provinces get more infrastructure and [state] employment," said Maria Victoria Murillo, a political science professor at Columbia. This contributes to Buenos Aires’s mounting struggles to provide affordable housing and   infrastructure for its ballooning population, as well as the province’s disproportionately high unemployment rate compared with the rest of the country.
