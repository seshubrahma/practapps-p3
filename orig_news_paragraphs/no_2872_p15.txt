Further production and export expansion, however, will require more foreign investment. The new wave of agreements with Iran, most of which remain provisional, began on Nov. 8, the day of Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory, when Total, a French company, became the first Western energy company to negotiate a deal to develop and produce natural gas from a section of a giant Persian Gulf gas field. Total leads a consortium that includes the China National Petroleum Corporation and Petropars, a subsidiary of the Iranian   oil company, in the $4. 8 billion project. The provisional agreement is expected to be completed early next year.
