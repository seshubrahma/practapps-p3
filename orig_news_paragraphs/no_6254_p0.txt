TEL AVIV  —    The U. S. Israel and Saudi Arabia should not "get themselves into serious trouble" by taking military action against Iran, the Islamic Republic’s top diplomat said in a BBC interview on Monday. ["First of all, we’re not talking about the law of the jungle," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told BBC’s Lyse Doucet.   Referring to a proposal by the U. S. Israel and Saudi Arabia to renew sanctions on Tehran after the country conducted ballistic missile tests, Zarif said, "We’re talking about the international law, and according to international law, those options are a violation of international law.
