"President Trump, in a reckless and dangerous manner, has   revealed highly classified information to the Russians at a   meeting in the Oval Office, information that could expose   extremely important sources and methods of intelligence gathering   in the fight against ISIS," Sanders said in the statement. ’ ’    "Protecting our national security is one of the most important   tasks a president has, and Trump is failing at it. " ’ "   Sanders then referenced Trump’s surprise firing of FBI   Director James Comey last week, a move Trump said he made in part   because of Comey’s handling of an investigation into Trump’s ties   to Russia.
