The   U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said Monday that President Donald Trump’s March 9 executive immigration order on refugees is unconstitutionally vague. [The   decision declared that President Trump must justify his policies in court by citing agency recommendations and that he cannot unilaterally curb the annual inflow of refugees from 100, 000 to 50, 000 even though prior presidents have raised and lowered the annual inflow of refugees without interference from the judges.   "Immigration, even for the President, is not a   show," the judges declared in their   decision, tiled  continuing: The President’s authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints. We conclude that the President, in issuing the Executive Order, exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress.
