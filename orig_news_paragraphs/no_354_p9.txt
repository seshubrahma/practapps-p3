Steve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s cascade of falsehoods was "a direct assault on the very idea of representative democracy" in the United States. Mr. Schmidt said that when he heard Mr. Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway defend the Trump administration’s "alternative facts" on NBC’s "Meet the Press" last Sunday, he thought of George Orwell’s "1984," in which the Ministry of Truth is emblazoned with three slogans: "War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. "
