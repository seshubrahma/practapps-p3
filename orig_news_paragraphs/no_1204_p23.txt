Matthew Kraft, 30, a financial analyst who works in Manhattan, said he went to Hoboken Terminal on Tuesday morning to avoid Penn Station and found it overrun with commuters. " I had never seen that before, where the crowd is literally pouring out of the station," he said. Mr. Kraft said Tuesdayâ€™s   commute was probably one of roughly a dozen times in the last year where he has had a delay of more than an hour.
