Washington (CNN) A local DC restaurant is taking President Donald Trump and his luxury hotel in Washington to court in the first lawsuit alleging unfair business competition since Inauguration Day. The lawsuit was filed in DC superior court by a married couple that owns Cork Wine Bar in northwest DC, located approximately 1. 5 miles from the Trump hotel. They claim they can’t compete with the President because he has a "big leg up" with foreign dignitaries and business leaders who want to patronize Trump’s hotel to curry favor with him.
