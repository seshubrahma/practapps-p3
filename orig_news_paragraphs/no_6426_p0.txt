Fox Sports 1 "Undisputed"   Shannon Sharpe compared the "different standard" for New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski seen by some NFL players to that of former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump.   Gronkowski only played eight games in 2016 before he had to have   back surgery. The criticism on the tight end comes after he participated in WrestleMania 33 and stole quarterback Tom Bradyâ€™s jersey before a Red Sox game this week while recovering from the surgery. According to Sharpe, Gronkowski gets away with more off the field than black stars like New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant, much like Trump has gotten away with more than Obama, although he did not offer up any examples.
