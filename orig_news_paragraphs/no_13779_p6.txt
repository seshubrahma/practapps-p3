Christie also criticized Marco Rubio as a freshman member of the DC establishment who wouldn’t be able to fix Washington D. C. "Time to turn away from the amateur acts from Washington D. C. and turn to a professional strong leader. That’s who this man is," Christie said. Christie said he sat down with his wife and children to discuss the endorsement and said that they supported his decision. He said he ultimately chose Trump because he was a friend of the family and was best suited to keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House.
