His desire to silence comic dissent raises the more sinister reason Trump is refusing to attend the WHCD. Trump, like dictators in the Middle East where I’ve performed comedy countless times, don’t want to be publicly ridiculed.   The leaders there prefer being revered    or even    but can’t endure being mocked, because they believe it will undermine their power. Given that Trump seems to be following a "Dictator for Dummies" playbook with his attempts to   our media, intelligence agencies and even our judiciary, this is plausible.
