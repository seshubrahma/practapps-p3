All diesel vehicles cause particular problems because the pollution from these is the most damaging to human health. That is why, with the mayor of Mexico City, we announced that we will ban all diesel vehicles from our cities by 2025. All cars entering Paris must display a colored sticker called Crit’Air, indicating the age of the vehicle, engine size and emissions. In order to provide alternatives to private car use, since I became mayor we have expanded the Vélib’ bike hire system to more than 14, 000 bikes.
