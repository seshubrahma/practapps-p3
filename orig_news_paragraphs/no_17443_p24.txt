Trump is someone who does not mind being provocative and has made some extremely hawkish statements about how he plans to take on threats like ISIS, although at times he has sounded an isolationist theme and spoken out against  .    Within a few days of winning office, he took a call from the leader of Taiwan, a clear blow to the "one China" policy that the US has followed since the 1970s, and Trump continued the theme with blistering tweets about the last remaining communist superpower.   He is supportive of a Russian government that can easily create explosive situations around the globe. There are also many people who have his ear, such as National Security Adviser Mike Flynn and possible Deputy Secretary of State John Bolton, who may be willing to use military force as a first resort.
