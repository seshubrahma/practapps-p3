After Morsyâ€™s overthrow in 2013, Saudi Arabia returned its support to new president Abdel Fattah  .   After many years of strained relations, Saudi Arabia began constructing a fortified fence along its   border with Yemen in 2003. This is in response to the ongoing unrest in Yemen due to Shiite Houthi rebels and terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.   It has also started work on a   barrier along the border with Iraq, to prevent border incursions by the terrorist group ISIS.
