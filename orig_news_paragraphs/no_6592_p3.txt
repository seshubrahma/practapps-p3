Even Thomas Jefferson, the same Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Declaration of Independence and who, ten years after that, wrote, "Our liberty depends on freedom of the press"  â€”   even Thomas Jefferson, when he was a few years into his own presidency, was so upset about what was being written about his administration that he flatly declared, "Nothing can now be believed that is seen in a newspaper. " Teddy Roosevelt, who now is next to Jefferson on Mt. Rushmore, once wrote, "To announce there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand with the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the American public.
