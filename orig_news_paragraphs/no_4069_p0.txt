Megyn Kelly has come under fire for a planned Father’s Day interview with InfoWars founder Alex Jones on her new Sunday night NBC News program, with social media users calling for a boycott of the program ’s advertisers and urging others to tune out the show when it airs later this month. [Kelly shared a preview clip of the interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday.   In the clip, Jones defends against being called "the most paranoid man in the world," calls the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U. S. an "inside job," and attempts to deflect criticism for his assertion that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.
