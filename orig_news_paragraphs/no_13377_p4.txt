If anyone can come up with a good reason why we need to allow people from those areas to come here please share it with us. Since I think I just heard someone answer "we canâ€™t just shut down immigration for entire countries," allow me to retort. Oh yes we can, actually we can shut down immigration from any country, of any group at any time if the President decides it is necessary.
