In contrast to Trump, Marco Rubio has previously endorsed the TPP on multiple occasions —  going so far as to describe the deal as a "pillar" of his   Presidency. Now, however, Rubio says he will not tell voters how he will vote on the deal until at least May 18th —  once most of the primaries are over. The CBS moderators, however, did not ask Rubio about his longstanding support for Obama’s trade agenda in tonight’s debate. Similarly, while Ted Cruz now says he will not support the TPP "in its current form," Cruz had previously supported Obama’s trade agenda.
