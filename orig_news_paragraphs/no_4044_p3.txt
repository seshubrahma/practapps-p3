The network has undergone significant changes in recent weeks following the departure of longtime star anchor Bill O’Reilly, whose O’Reilly Factor was the   cable news program for more than a decade. O’Reilly left the network this year after the New York Times reported that he had paid millions of dollars to settle multiple sexual harassment claims. In his place, Fox News brought on former Crossfire host Tucker Carlson to anchor the 8 p. m. hour and moved its panel show The Five into the 9 p. m. slot. Sean Hannity remained on at 10 p. m.
