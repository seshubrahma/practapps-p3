I have been thinking about what happened on June 16 way back in 1858. Newly nominated U. S. Senatorial candidate Abraham Lincoln warned his fellow citizens that America was becoming a "house divided," and that any house divided could not stand. Less than three years later, the country was plunged into the Civil War. The American house has become divided again, but I’m comforted by the fact that no matter how divided we are, there are leaders and ideals that can unify us.
