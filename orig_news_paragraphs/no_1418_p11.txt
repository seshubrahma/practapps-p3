Mr. Obama also praised Mr. Sanders for what he called an "incredible campaign. " He said the Vermont senatorâ€™s emphasis on addressing income inequality, reducing the influence of money in politics and bringing young people into the political process would strengthen the party. In their Oval Office meeting, White House officials said, Mr. Obama told Mr. Sanders that he could play a valuable role in   the party by supporting Democrats in races across the country this year, and use the influence he has amassed in his campaign to press his agenda forward in the Senate.
