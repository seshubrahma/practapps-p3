 (CNN) David McCormick, president of hedge fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, is the leading contender to be deputy secretary of defense, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the deliberations. McCormick, a former Army Ranger and West Point graduate, has now met with   Donald Trump twice and had a "very positive" meeting with James Mattis, the retired Marine general Trump selected to run the Pentagon, the sources said. A final selection has not been made and there are other candidates who have met with Mattis in recent days, one source cautioned.
