The war in Afghanistan is a topic the president has rarely discussed. " Hardly a word was mentioned by Trump about Afghanistan during the campaign, yet it remains one of the U. S.â€™s largest security expenditures," said Daniel Feldman, who served as the senior envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan during the Obama administration. Mr. Feldman said that a broad assessment was needed of the terrorist threat, the role of international partners and how to pursue reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
