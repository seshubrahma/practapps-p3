Mr. Kerry argued that Israel, with a growing Arab population, could not survive as both a Jewish state and a democratic state unless it embraced the   approach that a succession of American presidents have endorsed. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, responded to Mr. Kerryâ€™s speech by calling on Israel to freeze housing construction in order to restart negotiations. " The minute the Israeli government agrees to cease all settlement activities, including in and around occupied East Jerusalem, and agree to implement the signed agreements on the basis of mutual reciprocity, the Palestinian leadership stands ready to resume permanent status negotiations," he said.
