Trump has 1, 542 delegates, which gives him 305 more delegates than the majority threshold of 1, 237, which he battled to cross during the primaries in order to stave off a Ted Cruz plot to wrest the nomination away from Trump on the second ballot. 95 of Trump’s delegates are already unbound, giving him 1, 447 pledged delegates   —   210 above the majority threshold. If enough delegates defect to keep Trump at 1, 236 or below, most pledged delegates are freed by state laws on the second ballot.
