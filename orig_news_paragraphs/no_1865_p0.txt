Hillary Clinton on Saturday cast blame for her surprise election loss on the announcement by the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, days before the election that he had revived the inquiry into her use of a private email server. In her most extensive remarks since she conceded the race to Donald J. Trump early Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton told donors on a   conference call that Mr. Comeyâ€™s decision to send a letter to Congress about the inquiry 11 days before Election Day had thrust the controversy back into the news and had prevented her from ending the campaign with an optimistic closing argument. " There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful," Mrs. Clinton said, according to a donor who relayed the remarks.
