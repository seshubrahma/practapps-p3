Of course the Kremlin, with its stranglehold on Russian TV, can be even more inventive.     Dmitry Kiselev, for example, regularly conjures tales of bizarre conspiracies, and damns Putin’s enemies as traitors and fascists.   The White House is making a spirited challenge for Kiselev’s crown: from tales that Trump drew "the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration" right through to the recent claims of Trump Tower wiretapping.   That a free press exercising its freedom in ways inconvenient to the administration is seen as a sign of dishonesty and disloyalty is truly chilling.
