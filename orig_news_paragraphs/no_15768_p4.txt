If continued negotiations between the Gulf Cooperation Council    an alliance designed to counter Iranian influence in the region    and Iran were imminent, it would make sense to allow Qatar to remain   (it’s in the GCC after all, so it isn’t actually neutral). If there were to be negotiations between Hamas and Israel, between Egypt and the Muslim Brotherhood, or between the United States and the Taliban, it would also make sense to allow Qatar to remain a sort of safe haven.   And Qatar is uniquely positioned to play this negotiating role. Qatar has forged a unique personal brand of nonjudgment, if not neutrality, and acts as a   for regional actors of all stripes.
