Though Clinton would ultimately be described as one of the most hawkish voices on Libya in the Obama administration, senior U. S.  officials say that Clinton was initially skeptical of U. S. involvement in this international coalition. Obama at first tried a less interventionist approach, signing an executive order freezing Gadhafiâ€™s assets, and then backing a UN Security Council resolution to impose sanctions. Days later, France and Britain pushed the UN Security Council for a quick resolution that would authorize a   zone, but Clinton, still reluctant, chose instead to work with Susan Rice, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, to buy time in which to build broader international support for the move. But by   as intelligence warned of an imminent humanitarian crisis if government forces took on   Benghazi, aides say Clinton shifted and became convinced that an immediate   zone was necessary.
