The effort began Monday when NBC dropped a "new scene" from its beloved late   2000s sitcom Will and Grace. The showâ€™s core four cast members had teased a reunion on social media all week, with a final video teaser promising "Will   Grace is back" sending fans of the show into a frenzy.   The   scene, released online, is heavy on zingers directed toward Trump as Karen (Mullally) a Trump supporter, tries to convince the undecided Jack (Hayes) to vote for the Republican candidate.
