And the violent crime rate is indeed rising, as Breitbart News has extensively covered: Voters’ support for law and order is growing as the death toll from the   murder spike nears 1, 500. The murder toll is highlighted in a new survey published by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) which reveals that 2, 308 murders have been committed in their cities during the first half of 2016, versus 2, 001 in the first half of 2015. That’s a huge 15 percent increase, coming after a roughly 17 percent rise in the nation’s major cities during 2015.
