Mr. Berger, who joined Mrs. Clinton last month at a donor event in Miami Beach, said many of the individual conversations before and after she speaks at the gatherings are centered more on grandchildren than weighty policy matters. But when she has had a    this summer about issues, Mrs. Clinton, who has promised to "reshuffle the deck" in favor of the middle class and portrayed Mr. Trump as an    billionaire, has almost exclusively been fielding the concerns of the wealthiest Americans. To businessmen who complain to Mrs. Clinton that President Obama has been unfriendly to their interests, she says she would approach business leaders more like Mr. Clinton did during his administration, which was widely considered amicable to the private sector. When financiers complain about the regulations implemented by the   financial overhaul, Mrs. Clinton reaffirms her support for strong Wall Street regulation, but adds that she is open to listening to anyoneâ€™s ideas and at times notes that she represented the banking industry as a senator.
