The White House did not respond to a request for comment on its pace of appointments, and the data reviewed by CNN did not include federal judges. The vacancies examined by CNN included direct presidential appointments as well as what are known as "Schedule C" appointments    a class of political appointees the government describes as "making or approving substantive policy recommendations" and jobs that "can be performed successfully only by someone with a thorough knowledge of and sympathy with the goals, priorities, and preferences" of the administration.   Those appointments are generally chosen by a presidentâ€™s aides or Cabinet officials. They do not require Senate approval.
