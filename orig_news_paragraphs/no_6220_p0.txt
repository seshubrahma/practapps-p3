The Republican National Committee took a shot at MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" Wednesday, calling it the "leader of the pack for the worst case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. " ["Once a respected forum for intelligent discourse, the program has turned into 3 hours of   hysteria, filled with more faux scandal and innuendo than a bad episode of Gossip Girl," the email released by the RNC Wednesday said.   The show, hosted by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, refused Wednesday to discuss the controversy surrounding Kathy Griffin’s photo shoot involving a mock beheading of President Trump.
