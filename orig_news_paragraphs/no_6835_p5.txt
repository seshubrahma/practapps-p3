They are close to trading cornerback Malcolm Butler to New Orleans for a first round pick, perhaps the one they just traded for Cooks. New England also acquired a terrific tight end, sending a 2017   pick to Indianapolis for Dwayne Allen. Allen is a very good   tight end, equally proficient at blocking as receiving. And by trading for Allen, they let Martellus Bennett walk in free agency.
