The financial magazine went on to warn that Hillary’s new idea could "force sales of family companies, and sales of family farms and ranches" if it ever became law. Meaning a person who worked his whole life to build a business or toiled to create a farm won’t be able to leave it to his family without them having to sell it off to pay Hillary’s steep taxes. Whatever the demerits of Hillary’s plan, it is a major departure from her husband’s tax ideas when he was president in the mid 1990s. After his party was wiped out in the 1994 midterm elections, President Bill Clinton insisted that even he felt he raised taxes too much.
