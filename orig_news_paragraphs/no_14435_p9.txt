" So this mission isn’t just about helping Dilbireen it’s about highlighting the plight of his people." Dilbireen’s ’remarkable spirit’ Becker and LaStaiti were able to secure treatment for Dilbireen and a few other children at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Boston, with help from Sameer Sabir, a   entrepreneur in the field of wound healing and burn treatment. Sabir and LaStaiti met through Greg Bailey, a business partner of LaStaiti’s who has also been instrumental in helping Dilbireen.
