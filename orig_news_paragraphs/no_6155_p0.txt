[Debbie Dooley,   of the Patriots and also a founding Tea Party activist, said at the rally that Trump supporters need to show the country that they are "just as motivated and passionate" about the president as those who oppose him.   "Expect that we are peaceful and   citizens," Dooley said. Bikers for Trump 2020 also showed up to support the fake news protest.
