n’t think Trump should be President. The media give Trump airtime because he is "gripping" and when viewers tune in, they hear him correct the record and get his message out. Traditional consultants and those in the Never Trump movement don’t seem to get this.    David Gergen just seems perplexed that Trump isn’t giving a Council on Foreign   Institute of   speech where people just sound smart without saying anything of substance.
