President Barack Obama rejects Donald Trump’s view of America, arguing that things aren’t so bad under his administration. ["This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn’t really jive with the experience of most people," he said.   The president assured reporters that most people probably still woke up in an America that wasn’t as frighting as Trump had indicated.
