I met up with my cousin Adrienne, a fashion designer who grew up in the area. We headed to the downtown tasting room of Stone Brewing, an Escondido brewery that may not have invented the craft IPA, but has done has much as anyone to promulgate the bitter,   West Coast style. We shared a flight of four beers at $3 apiece the Tangerine Express IPA was particularly good. We walked up through the Gaslamp Quarter, a popular nightlife district
