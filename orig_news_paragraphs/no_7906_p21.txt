About nine out of every ten new immigrants brought into the country on green cards are from   countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia, or the Middle East. Yet Clinton has pledged to increase this historic rate of immigration. She has said she will expand President Obamaâ€™s unconstitutional executive amnesties, freeze deportations for aliens who have not yet been convicted of a crime, and dramatically expand U. S. refugee resettlement. Clinton has also rejected vetting processes that would prevent migrants who hold views that are antithetical to liberal Western values from entering the country.
