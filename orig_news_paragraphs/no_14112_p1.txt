On one side of the city’s main thoroughfare, the Rixos President Hotel bustles with shabby journalists, dapper diplomats and wealthy patrons in mink coats.   Across the street stands the Kazmedia center, a large, glass open space intended to showcase the city’s open approach to the world.   A block white sculpture reads #kazmedia. Large screens show glossy advertisements for the country’s attractions.
