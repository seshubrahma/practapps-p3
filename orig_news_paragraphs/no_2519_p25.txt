Strong rainfall in Northern California over the last few months has helped lift water levels above historical averages at several reservoirs, including Lake Don Pedro, Lake Shasta and Folsom Lake. " We’ve had some nice rain," said Doug Carlson, information officer for the California Department of Water Resources.
