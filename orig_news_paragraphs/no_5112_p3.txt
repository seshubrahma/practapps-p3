O’Donnell’s   public feud with Trump reached a new low after the election when the former View host shared a video on social media that questioned whether or not Trump’s youngest son, Barron, was autistic. While O’Donnell eventually apologized to Melania Trump for attacking her    the   comedienne ratcheted up her criticism of Trump’s administration. O’Donnell’s participation in the   rally comes on the heels of her failed bid to play Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon on Saturday Night Live.   Among the list of   organizations participating in Tuesday’s protest outside the White House in Washington’s Lafayette Park are the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and   websites DailyKos and MoveOn. org.
