Now, I am well aware that some people reading this dislike Donald Trump. I myself have called out Trump for his attempt to temporarily ban Muslims and his unacceptable comments about Mexican immigrants, among other areas of disagreement. I have also called on Trump to utterly disavow and condemn the white supremacist nutjobs who support him. But if weâ€™re going to challenge Trump for smears, we must hold Wasserman Schultz to the same standard.
