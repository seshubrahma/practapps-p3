In the document, a blend of religious teachings and acute social commentary, "Pope Francis delineates the path of the future life of the church so that it can always be an instrument of mercy toward everyone, without ever excluding anyone," Archbishop Fisichella said. The archbishop said that the apostolic letter offered guidelines to priests who were called on to exercise forgiveness, referring to an April proclamation on family life that, among other things, created a path for divorced and remarried Catholics to receive holy communion. Francisâ€™ letter also noted that the church would celebrate a World Day of the Poor every November "to help communities and each of the baptized to reflect on how poverty is at the very heart of the Gospel.
