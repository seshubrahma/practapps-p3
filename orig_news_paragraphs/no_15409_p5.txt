That’s quite a concession by Clapper, but one he wanted to make clear:  essentially, he was out of the loop.   He told the subcommittee that he always deferred to the FBI on whether the intelligence community ought to be notified of a law enforcement action he also made clear under Sen. Lindsey Graham’s skeptical questioning that the FBI’s proof of collusion may not have, at that time, risen to the level for notification of the intelligence community.    But the point was clear: Clapper no longer believes he can speak authoritatively about evidence of collusion.   He has taken a major defense away from the White House.
