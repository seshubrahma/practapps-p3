At noon on Saturday, a Meriden Lieutenant was parked on Hanover Street where he saw a man standing on the traffic island at Hanover and Colony Streets waving a Donald Trump sign and an American flag. Police say a silver car stopped at the island, two men got out and began punching and kicking the man, knocking him into the street. The Lieutenant intervened and arrested the two men. The victim told police that the two men gave him the finger, he responded "same to you" and then the assault started.
