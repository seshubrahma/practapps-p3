The Republicans featured Pat Smith, who lost a son in the Benghazi raids. Her speech, like the Khans’ was highly personal and damning of the opposing nominee    and both were exploitations of grief by political parties that ought, frankly, to be ashamed of themselves for using other people’s suffering to get votes.

That’s partly because of the way Trump chose to answer Khizr Khan’s criticisms: a) to suggest that he, too, had sacrificed a lot and b) to imply that Ghazala Khan might have been silent out of submission to her Islamic faith.
