Chosen to lead Mr. Trump’s transition efforts, Mr. Christie has taken a role that some of his allies liken to that of a White House chief of staff, soliciting views on what a potential administration should look like. Mr. Christie has taken the transition process firmly in hand, according to people familiar with his activities. He has enlisted his former top aide in Trenton, Richard H. Bagger, to help manage the transition team. On a conference call with several dozen of Mr. Christie’s political allies on Thursday afternoon, he and Mr. Bagger said they aimed to have a long list of possible appointees drawn up for Mr. Trump by the time of the election.
