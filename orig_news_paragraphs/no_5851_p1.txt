Nunes temporarily stepped aside from leading a   probe into Russiaâ€™s involvement into the U. S. presidential elections while the Office of Congressional Ethics is looking into whether any rules were broken. Judicial Watch noted this   in its request: If the standard for filing a complaint or opening an ethics investigation is that a member has commented publicly on matters that touch on classified information, but the member does not reveal the source of his or her information, then the complaints against Chairman Nunes are incomplete insofar as they target only Nunes. At least two other members of the House Intelligence Committee have made comments about classified material that raise more directly the very same concerns raised against Chairman Nunes because they appear to confirm classified information contained in leaked intelligence community intercepts.
