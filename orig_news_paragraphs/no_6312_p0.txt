Actress America Ferrera and singer Katy Perry will be honored at the Human Rights Campaign’s annual gala dinner in Los Angeles this month for their support for the LGBT community, with Ferrera set to receive her Ally for Equality award from fellow actress and feminist Lena Dunham. ["America Ferrera has shown an unwavering commitment to advancing equality for all people and sets a stirring example for others to follow," HRC president Chad Griffin said in a statement announcing this year’s honorees. " As we continue the fight for full equality during this very uncertain time for our country, we are constantly inspired by America and our friend, Lena Dunham —  both fierce and outspoken champions of equality.
