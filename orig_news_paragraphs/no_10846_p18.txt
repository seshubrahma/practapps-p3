Eleven days after criticizing Sessions, Cruz then flipped and announced he would no longer support Obamatrade â€”  citing two technicalities for reversing his position. Cruz explained that although, "as a general matter," he supports the ideology underlying globalist trade deals, he was concerned that the deal could bring about changes to U. S. immigration law as well as provisions regarding the   bank. Interestingly, Rupert Murdoch has been effusive in expressing his affection for Paul Ryan with whom Cruz penned his original April   in favor of Obamatrade. Paul Ryan has been one of the biggest champions of open borders trade and immigration policies in Congress.
