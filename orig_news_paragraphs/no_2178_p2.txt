The release of the documents on Tuesday, under court order, was the latest turn in a federal lawsuit, filed in California by dissatisfied former Trump University students, that has bedeviled the businessman since 2010 and could trail him into the White House if he is elected president. Mr. Trump, who started the university in 2005, owned 93 percent of the   company. From the start, he acted as its chief promoter, rather than    manager, selling it as a tool of financial empowerment that would improve life for thousands of ordinary Americans. It would, he said, "teach you better than the best business school," according to the transcript of a Web video.
