In private, there is a growing concern about what Trump may say or do. Initially hailed as hero by Israelâ€™s right wing, Trump campaigned on a promise of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing a united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moves that were certain to anger the Palestinians and the wider Arab world. But upon taking office, Trump walked back his promise to move the embassy almost immediately, saying it was still under consideration. On Wednesday evening, less than a week before Trump arrived in Israel, administration officials confirmed to CNN that the embassy would stay where it is    at least for now    as Trump pursued a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians.
