Schlafly went on to write 26 other books   —   many of which she had to write after 10pm when her children were asleep. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Schlafly began the formation of her "Eagle" brand  —   devoted to inspiring conservatives across the nation to get involved and fight for conservative principles. Today, her organization touts more than 25, 000 members.
