That’s been one of our   most important strategic priorities and we’re already making   great progress   —   both in partnership with our distributors, and   on our own by connecting directly with consumers.   Joining   forces with AT&T will allow us to innovate even more quickly   and create more value for consumers along with all our   distribution and marketing partners, and allow us to build on a   track record of creative and financial excellence that is second   to none in our industry. In fact, when we announce our 3Q   earnings, we will report revenue and operating income growth at   each of our divisions, as well as   earnings   growth.
