Why was Bill Clinton in Phoenix the day he met with Lynch? Forced to defend the meeting Friday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Lynch said she "certainly wouldn’t do it again, because I think it has cast a shadow over what it should not, over what it will not touch," Lynch said.   She emphasized that the meeting with Bill Clinton "does not have a bearing on how this matter will be reviewed and resolved" and said she would accept the determinations and findings of the FBI in their probe of Clinton’s email use.   ’Would not do it again’
