Lesbianism and witchcraft go together like Donald Trump and winning. Of course, under normal circumstances I’d be open to allegations of hypocrisy complaining about a same     megalomaniac with entitlement issues surrounded by sycophants and with atrocious dress sense, but this is the presidency we’re talking about.

They had pollsters putting out drastically skewed numbers, and a media completely beholden to her campaign.
