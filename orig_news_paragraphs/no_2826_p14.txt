And many of the biggest demographic shifts occurred in the Sun Belt states where Democrats talked about being competitive, like Georgia and Arizona, even Texas, but really werenâ€™t. Demographic shifts in these areas were often canceled out by considerable losses among white voters over the same period. My view is that this is somewhat coincidental. Many of the red states with growing nonwhite populations also have the sort of older, Southern, less educated and more religious white populations that have trended toward the Republicans, even in states with far less demographic change and far fewer nonwhite voters (Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Missouri).
