Shakespeare in the Park began its summer season in New York City’s Central Park last month with a "contemporary" take on the playwright’s Julius Caesar, in which the title character bears a    resemblance to President Donald Trump. [In an interview with Mediaite, Laura Shaeffer  —   who saw a recent performance of the play, which opened May 23   —   said that the character of Julius Caesar in the Public Theater adaptation wears a business suit and has his hair styled in a manner similar to Trump’s.   Sheaffer added that the character of Calpurnia, Caesar’s wife, speaks with a "Slavic accent" similar to that of First Lady Melania Trump.
