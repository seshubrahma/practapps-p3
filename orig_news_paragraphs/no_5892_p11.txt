According to de Blasio’s new protocol, ICE agents will not be allowed to enter a school unless they provide a warrant and wait outside the school until school employees consult with the Department of Education attorney. If the ICE agent appears without a warrant, de Blasio is instructing the school to call the NYPD.   " This adds another layer of defense so that it’s quite clear if an agent shows up, the default position is they’re not coming in the building," de Blasio said.
