 (CNN) The shocking decision by press secretary Sean Spicer to bar CNN, The New York Times, Buzzfeed, Politico and the Los Angeles Times from a news briefing Friday signals that, for all its bluster and bravado, the Trump White House is an administration under siege.    In the face of the President’s many public misstatements, obvious financial conflicts of interest and troubling ties to Russia, the White House has decided to launch an   attack on the news organizations that reliably report on the administration’s fables and foibles.   Expect to see the media close ranks and fight for the public’s right to observe and report on government without fear of official retaliation.
