About Breitbart: Founded in 2005 by conservative icon Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart News Network, with its 180 million page views and 29 million unique visitors per month, is the biggest source of breaking news and analysis,   commentary, and original reporting curated and written specifically for the new generation of independent and conservative thinkers. About Milo Yiannopoulos: Milo is Breitbartâ€™s Tech and Social Justice Editor, as well as a prominent columnist and one of the most   commentators on internet culture. He has been on the vanguard of the brewing culture war between the LGBT community and Islam in the west, including delivering a speech at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, seen by millions. Milo was permanently banned from Twitter during an LGBT conservative party at the Republican National Convention, resulting in a doubling of Google searches on his name.
