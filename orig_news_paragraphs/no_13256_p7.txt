Clinton’s support for increasing refugees, contrasted with Donald Trump’s opposition to such increases, appears to be hurting her in key battleground states, and even some states, like Michigan, that are traditionally solidly Democratic. In Michigan, which has seen a significant increase in refugees overall and Syrian refugees in particular, for instance, a recent poll found that Clinton leads Trump by only three points, within the margin of error. That same poll shows that 53 percent of Michigan residents oppose increasing the number of refugees coming to the state. Local resettlement agencies, whose plans are almost always   by the Obama administration, have recently submitted plans to the Department of State that indicate they want to increase the number of refugees resettled in the state in FY 2017 by 38 percent, to 5, 600, up from 4, 000 in FY 2016.
