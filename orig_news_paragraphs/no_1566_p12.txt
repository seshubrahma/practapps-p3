In an effort to bolster security in Rio during the Games, the federal government is deploying thousands of troops to patrol the   city. But critics say that bringing in soldiers from   cities in northeast Brazil could embolden gang activity there and in other parts of the country. Mindful of the dilemma, the Brazilian authorities shifted their plans this week and sent more than 1, 000 troops to the state of Rio Grande do Norte in the country â€™s northeast, hoping to quell attacks by a   gang on public buildings and buses.
