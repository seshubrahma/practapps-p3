Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn originally issued a stay of removal on Jan. 28 just before 9 p. m. At the time, she also ordered the government to provide a list of those people detained as a result of the executive order. The case was later assigned to Judge Amon. On Tuesday, she clarified in an order that a "snapshot" to measure how many people had been detained should include those held immediately after Judge Donnellyâ€™s ruling, from 9:37 p. m. on Jan. 28 until 11:59 p. m. on Jan. 29.
