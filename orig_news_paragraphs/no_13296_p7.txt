Heye, as he had previously on the CNN panel, directly misquoted Miller, who had argued that while the political class in Washington D. C. "feigned indignation" over Trump retweets, they ignored the effects of open borders on U. S. women. Miller cited several examples, including illegal immigration violence, diminished economic prospects, as well as the violent oppression of women by   migrants. It is unclear why Heye thinks Trumpâ€™s retweet is a more important issue for the quality of life of women in the United States than whether or not we have an open border, or whether or not we import migrants from countries that violently oppress and subjugate women. Polling shows Republican voters overwhelmingly want to pause Muslim migration.
