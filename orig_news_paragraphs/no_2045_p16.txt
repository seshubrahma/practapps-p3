Konstantin Rubakhin, an environmental activist who lives in exile in Lithuania, also got a visit from police officers looking for child pornography. Mr. Rubakhin speculated that that raid, in June last year, may have been part of an effort to derail his application for political asylum or his work for the   Civil Society Forum, a research group that investigates corruption. In the end, the Lithuanian police dropped the case. Getting someone labeled a suspected pedophile has the added benefit of fitting "perfectly with the Kremlinâ€™s line that human rights activists are all just degenerates," said Vytis Jurkonis, a Lithuanian human rights activist who works with Russian exiles.
