U. S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw a Â£700 million investment due to be made in two golf courses he owns in Scotland if British Members of Parliament vote to ban him from the country. [A spokesman for Mr Trump said a ban would send a message to the world that the UK opposes free speech, as it emerged that Muslim, Labour Members of Parliament were leading the charge to have Mr. Trump banned.   On Tuesday a House of Commons committee announced that Parliament will debate later this month a petition calling for Mr Trump to be barred entry to the UK. The petition was launched by a     activist in Scotland following remarks made by Mr Trump in which he called for a moratorium on Muslims entering the U. S. until the threat of Islamic extremism is better understood, The Telegraph has reported.
