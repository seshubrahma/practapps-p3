Given variations in each trip, estimating the security costs around a presidential trip is difficult. But a 2016 Government Accountability Office report about a   trip Obama took to Florida in 2013    one similar to Trumpâ€™s trips    found the total cost to the Secret Service and Coast Guard was $3. 6 million. To date, Trump has spent six weekends    and a total of 21 days    at    his private Palm Beach club. The total estimated costs for those trips are around $21.
