But Fox has now opted against running, two GOP sources familiar with his decision said Friday.   The reason: Gianforte was initially expected to run for governor in 2020    but now, Republicans expect the fallout from his body slam of Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of the special election in which Montana elected him to the House to linger, damaging Gianforte  .   That, one source said, could clear the 2020 governorâ€™s race for Fox. The seat will be open because Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock is      likely making it more appealing than an expensive race against a   Democratic incumbent in Tester.
