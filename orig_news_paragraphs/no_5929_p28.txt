As mentioned above, the Sudanese government is a corrupt disaster. The country actually split in half in 2011. Over 1. 5 million people have been killed in the Sudanese civil war, while 2 million refugees have been displaced from the Darfur region. The president of the Republic of Sudan is an   Islamist dictator named Omar Hassan   who has been in power for over 25 years, after seizing power in a 1989 coup that came after two decades of civil war.
