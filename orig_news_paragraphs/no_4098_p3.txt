My worry now is that many people are talking about a partial repeal of Obamacare.   If you only repeal part of it and you leave some sort of Obamacare light, which some are talking about, my fear is the situation actually gets worse. The problem is that if you get it done, you own the entire system of American medicine.  . . .
