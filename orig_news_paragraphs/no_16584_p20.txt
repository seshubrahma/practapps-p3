Since North Korea first conducted a nuclear test in 2006, international sanctions have focused largely on its weapons. In March, the United Nations passed the first set of sanctions that went further, banning all weapons trade requiring the inspection of all cargo leaving and entering the country expanding the number of individuals being sanctioned requiring countries to expel North Korean diplomats accused of illicit activities, and prohibiting the import of luxury goods such as Jet Skis and watches. Thereâ€™s still room to pressure North Korea further, as Clinton, along with Republicans such as California Rep. Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, suggest. An act passed by Congress gives the administration the power to sanction   Korean entities acting as an agent for the country    in other words, Chinese companies and financial institutions.
