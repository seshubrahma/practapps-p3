You can make of that connection with John McCain what you will maybe the guy just needed a job. But as for myself, I would worry if my candidate were endorsed by the Juan Hernandez characters of the world, and I am delighted that Se√±or Juan Hernandez is apoplectic over the plans announced by President Trump.   What lies ahead for U. S.  relations? Your guess is as good as mine, but if Trump persists in his plans, Mexican bluster and outrage will be replaced by a more pragmatic accommodation.
