" Flynn has "registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530, 000 worth of lobbying work before Election Day that may have aided the Turkish government," according to Fox News. The White House has said President Trump was not aware Flynn was working for the Turks. Fortune describes the precise allegations Flynn may end up facing over Turkey: On March 7, after being fired as National Security Adviser, Flynn belatedly filed a FARA disclosure that revealed that, through his firm, Flynn Intel Group, he had worked in 2016 on behalf of Inovo BV, a firm based in Netherlands and owned by a Turkish businessman with links to the Turkish government.
