Trump was the only Republican I voted for this election. The rest of my votes went to state Democrats.   I am a bit concerned that he has a Republican House and Senate, which makes it a lot easier for Republicans to push some radical conservative agenda through. And Trump may be pressured to help them with that since he ran under their party.
