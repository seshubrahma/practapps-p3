Craig, who was Mr. Obama’s first White House counsel and participated in early policy deliberations about what to do about   policies, said that in 2009, the president "was not thinking about 10 years out, but about 10 days out. " And he especially did not want to send signals to Republicans that he was a zealot or out for revenge, Mr. Craig said.
