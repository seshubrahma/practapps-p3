Trump says if he wants a   wall, he will negotiate it down to 48 feet to appease more people. When asked about establishment Republicans trying to throw monkey wrenches into the delegate selection process, Trump says he has "millions and millions of people" who are providing tremendous energy for Republicans. Trump says it would be undemocratic if GOP   (and desperate professional pundits who so desperately want to be "influencers" on the right) try to steal the nomination from him at the convention. Trump says "nobody is going to beat us" after GOP is unified.
