WASHINGTON, D. C.  —    In a stunning rebuke to House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Appropriations Committee chairman Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( ) announced his public opposition to Obamacare 2. 0 on Friday morning. ["Seven years after enactment of Obamacare, I wanted to support legislation that made positive changes to rescue healthcare in America," Frelinhguysen, who has been lauded as the Garden State’s most powerful congressman, wrote in a Facebook post.   Unfortunately, the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey.
