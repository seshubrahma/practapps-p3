While our main interests in Syria lie in stabilization and protecting its civilian population, the vast majority of whom are Sunni Muslim , we are hampered by Assad, of the minority Alawite Muslim sect, and his cronies in Tehran, who are Shiite Muslims. It was the large Sunni Syrian population that initially rose up against Assad due to his brutal reign, causing the dictator to put down those protests. While the U. S. initially saw its interests achieved only with the removal of Assad from power, American officials later said they would accept his leadership if elected.
