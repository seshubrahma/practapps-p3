Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump may propose slashing as much as a quarter of the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget, two sources tell CNN, a cut that one former EPA official said would be "devastating. " Trump and his aides announced a budget blueprint Monday that boosted defense spending by $54 billion while slashing   programs by the same amount. While details on how the cuts would be made were scarce, sources inside the administration made clear that the EPA’s budget would be a prime target.
