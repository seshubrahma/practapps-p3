Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday will fly into Nashville to rally thousands of supporters for the second time in his    presidency. But unlike the events his predecessors held to build support for their agenda, Trumpâ€™s rally is being organized and funded by his presidential reelection campaign rather than the White House    a move that is raising eyebrows among campaign finance experts, veteran political operatives and officials from the last three administrations. Presidents typically rely on federal funds when they head out to sell their agenda and turn up the political pressure on members of Congress.
