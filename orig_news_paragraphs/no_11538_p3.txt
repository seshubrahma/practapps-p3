The establishment class seemed like they were desperately trying to create a "moment"  like the one that benefited Newt Gingrich during CNN’s South Carolina debate before the 2012 South Carolina primary to help Rubio.

The cheers today after mundane Rubio responses came off as inorganic and made the audience looked like they were trying a bit too hard to help "their" candidate. Don’t think viewers will be swayed like they were in 2012.
