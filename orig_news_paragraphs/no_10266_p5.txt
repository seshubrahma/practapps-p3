Bolton did this by calling out major violators of treaties to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction like the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Biological Weapons Convention. Bolton also negotiated the creation of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) a global effort now composed of 103 countries to stop and interdict shipments of WMD technology to rogue states. PSIâ€™s most important success occurred in September 2003 when it led to the inspection of a ship transporting nuclear technology to Libya. This interdiction was a major reason why Libyan leader Muammar Qadaffi decided to give up his WMD programs.
