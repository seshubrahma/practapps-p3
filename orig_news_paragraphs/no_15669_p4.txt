A probable cause document says Kaine, who lives in Minneapolis, ran from a police officer, who caught him and knocked him down. It took several officers to detain Kaine after he scuffled with officers, the document says. It was unclear whether Kaine has an attorney.   Seven others charged, two face felonies, Ramsey County declined to press felony charges against Kaine and five others, but St. Paul City Attorney Samuel Clark did further investigation and brought the charges against Kaine.
