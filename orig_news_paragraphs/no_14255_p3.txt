Invoking the nuclear option, as it is called on Capitol Hill, would end the need for Supreme Court nominees to receive 60 votes to break a filibuster and proceed to an    vote on the nomination that only requires a majority to confirm. Both Republicans and Democrats have long resisted doing so as it would change the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees in the future as well. However, Senate Democrats under President Barack Obama moved to eliminate the filibuster for Cabinet nominations and lower court judges, something Trump noted. They did not include Supreme Court nominations as part of that action.
