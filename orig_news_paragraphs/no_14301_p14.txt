An intense firefight broke out that killed Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens and wounded three additional SEALs.   During the gun battle, which featured small arms fire, hand grenades and close air support strikes from US aircraft, al Qaeda fighters    including some female combatants    took up firing positions on the roof of a nearby building. As the US troops came under fire, they called in an airstrike against the building, which likely led to civilian casualties, military officials said. The group is thought to be the most capable of al Qaedaâ€™s franchises.
