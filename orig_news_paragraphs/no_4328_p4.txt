In Manhattan in December, a Muslim woman claimed a trio of white drunks assaulted her on a crowded subway train and pulled on her hijab while chanting   slogans and issuing   taunts. Earlier in Mississippi, news reports indicated a hate crime when "Vote Trump" appeared   on a   black church. Police later arrested an   parishioner for the crime. Whereas the Muslim college   allegedly made up the story to avoid the wrath of her father after breaking curfew, the culprit in the Charlotte attack appears to have harbored no motive save for embarrassing white Trump supporters.
