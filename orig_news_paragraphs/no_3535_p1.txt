On Thursday morning, inside a   apartment a block from Main Street,    Bedel Kayd and his    brother Saadiq sat quietly while finishing a bag of cheese puffs. With Abdullahi acting as translator, their mother, Mun Omer  —   a Somalian who arrived in the United States in October   —   said she initially thought President Trump’s executive order banning immigrants or visa holders from seven countries  —   Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria and Yemen  —   for 90 days and refugees for 120 days meant refugees like her would have to return to their home countries.
