The concert I attended at Villain in Williamsburg, which had the spacey   Morgan Delt as headliner, cost $10. The acoustics in the cavernous space werenâ€™t great, but at least the drinks were moderately priced: A beer and shot cost me an additional $10. The Villain event was just one of dozens that night in Brooklyn the borough is so busy it can be tough to keep track.
