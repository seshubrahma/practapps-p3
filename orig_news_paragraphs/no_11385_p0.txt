Since former Green Party candidate Jill Stein started her election recount effort, the same big three TV networks that essentially ignored her presidential campaign have discovered she is worth reporting on. [Indeed the Nets have given her twelve times more coverage in the last five days than they gave her entire nearly   bid for the White House.   A survey of coverage of Stein’s Green Party bid for the White House finds that ABC, CBS, and NBC gave Stein’s campaign a scant 36 seconds of coverage combined across all three networks during the entire time she was running for president. But since she announced her recount effort late last week, the Nets have suddenly given Stein a full seven minutes and 26 seconds of coverage, according to the Media Research Center.
