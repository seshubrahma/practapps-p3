They say that the top donor to Correctiv is the Brost Foundation, set up by the former head of the publishing company FUNKE Media Group, Erich Brost. The foundation has given €925, 000 to get Correctiv off the ground. Mr. Brost is also the former employer of Collectiv’s CEO, David Schraven, who worked as a leading researcher for Funke group until 2014 and previously worked at the   paper Die Tageszeitung or TAZ. The chief editor of Correctiv, Markus Grill, meanwhile has worked for both the   magazine Stern, which last April associated   migration Alternative for Germany supporters with Nazis, and magazine Der Spiegel which has run a series of covers and articles directed against U. S. President Donald Trump.
