[Planned Parenthood awarded the former Democratic Party presidential nominee its "champion of the century" award in New York City Tuesday evening as the organization held yet another celebration of its centennial anniversary.   The Hollywood Reporter noted that, in her remarks at the event, Clinton cited Margaret Atwood’s 1985 dystopian feminist novel, The Handmaid’s Tale. A new television production of the novel  —   about a totalitarian theocracy that forces women to procreate   —   can be seen courtesy of Hulu.
