Basically, what happened is, in order to have a spectacle on the floor of the convention where it looks like there was a battle inside the party, Lee and Cuccinelli turned down two packages that had almost everything they wanted in them. The first was last week, during Rules Committee negotiations when the "Never Trump" movement was soundly defeated there. That package would have changed the amount of delegates that are offered to states with closed primaries, giving them "bonus" delegates at a rate of 15 percent per the number of   delegates in a delegation. So if a state with a closed primary had 20   delegates, they would have gotten 3 extra delegates.
