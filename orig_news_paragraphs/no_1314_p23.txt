We met at Timmons’s office and then walked down to the Aegean Cafe ("Steaks Seafood Pasta") on Main Street for a luncheon. Von Braunhut is a very good looking woman whose age I was just too chicken to ask. But if she was 18, as she told me, when she started her film career in 1966, then she’s about 70 now. She is trim and   looking in skintight jeans and an equally engaged   top, reminiscent of the ageless Sophia Loren or Raquel Welch.
