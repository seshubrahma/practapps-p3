Milo Yiannopoulos is an editor for Breitbart. He is a tool of a government that accuses the press of being "fake news" when they deviate from or criticize the Trump lies that has already begun criminalizing protest, demonizing dissent, and attacking science. Trump has advocated severe penalties for flag burning, which is protected speech. What Milo is working for is not free speech, but to normalize, legitimize, and help consolidate the   regime  â€”   which is already marching down the path of crushing all dissent and all ideas that oppose it.
