An Obama spokesman tells CNN that the former president is now a private citizen and his schedule, therefore, is also private. Whether or not life after the White House includes an island respite, it also likely now includes writing a book. Penguin Random House last month announced it had won the bidding for memoirs from both Barack and Michelle Obama, a deal that could net the former first couple tens of millions of dollars.   The announcement also indicated the Obamas would donate a "significant portion" of that money to charities, including the Obama Foundation.
