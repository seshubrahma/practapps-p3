Before the birth of Sham, my worries were how would I support my family, without any work in Jordan and without money," Mr. Aldaher said. " After she was born, we forgot about food, our problems, ourselves and even our other children to start our new journey of suffering for Sham, to see how we could possibly care for this child. " Shamâ€™s family received assistance from different nongovernmental organizations, including Doctors Without Borders.
