General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U. S. car   free across border," he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. "Make in U. S. A. or pay big border tax!" General Motors announced in 2015 that it would make the Cruze in Coahuila, Mexico. American manufacturers are moving   production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand.
