Despite 30 states and Washington, D. C. already paying higher minimum wages than what is required under federal law, both California Gov. Jerry Brown and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed bills in April 2016 to raise the minimum wage in steps to $15 dollars an hour for the first time in any state. Over the     year battle, the SEIU was reported to have spent over $30 million in support of "Fight for $15" and to unionize   workers during the campaign. After gaining the endorsement and donations of the SEIU, Democrat Hillary Clinton in August 2015 committed to signing a $15 minimum wage if elected president. Given the reported polling by the media, SEIU thought they had accomplished their national goal.
