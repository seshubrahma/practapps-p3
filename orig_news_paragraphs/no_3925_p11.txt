Wang and others at the march took the opportunity to not only support the president and his immigration policies, but to exercise their constitutional right to carry arms. The march in Dallas followed protests at schools in the city, and in Austin, Texas, and the #DayWithoutImmigrants.   Thereâ€™s a #protest at #Dallas #TX in my school. #AntiTrump pic.
