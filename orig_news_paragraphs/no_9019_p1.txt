Businesses hired aggressively in November and there is little evidence that the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election dampened hiring," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, the organisation that analyses the ADP’s figures. " In addition, because of the tightening labor market, retailers may be accelerating seasonal hiring to secure an adequate workforce to meet holiday demand, although total expected seasonal hiring may be no higher than last year’s," he continued. In October, during the run up to the presidential election, recruitment figures were below expectations, with 119, 000 new jobs introduced, despite a forecast of 147, 000.
