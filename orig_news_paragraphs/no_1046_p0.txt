WASHINGTON   â€”    In an interview with Time magazine on Wednesday, President Trump cited The New York Times as evidence of his claim, made in a series of Twitter posts on March 4, that President Barack Obama had wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign. The F. B. I. director, other top intelligence officials and numerous Republicans have rejected this claim.
