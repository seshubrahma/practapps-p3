The legal case against ExxonMobil would be based on the one used so successfully against Big Tobacco. (One of the key figures in the campaign against Big Tobacco, Stanton Glantz, was present to advise at the La Jolla meeting). Never mind that there were actually no serious similarities: the Big Tobacco companies clearly knew that cigarettes caused cancer there was no similar knowledge that ExxonMobil possessed about "global warming" that it culpably withheld from its customers. The case, had it gone to court, would have been a nonsense.
