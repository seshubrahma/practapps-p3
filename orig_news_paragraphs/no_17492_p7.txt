While he didn’t disavow those positions, Santorum began to focus more on economic populism in 2012    a theme he will revive again in 2016. But while he aimed many of his policies toward small business owners last cycle, Santorum 2. 0 will train his sights on employees and the value they can add to American businesses. That effort will kick off Thursday as Santorum heads to Davenport, Iowa for his first   event where he’ll meet employees of a   grocery store, an   company. He will then swing to South Carolina this weekend, where two of his sons attend The Citadel military college, giving Santorum an opportunity to pitch the next focus of his 2016 campaign: a tough foreign policy, which could appeal to many Republicans at a time of global turmoil.
