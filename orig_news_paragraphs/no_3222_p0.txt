The Palestinian leadership is "disappointed" by the feckless Arab reactions to reports the United States may relocate its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a former Fatah official told Breitbart Jerusalem. ["Trump is unpredictable and Arab leaders don’t want to get on his bad side so soon," Dimitri Diliani, a former member of Fatah’s Revolutionary Council, said, adding that "Arab leaders are waiting to see what will happen eventually and how exactly the embassy will be moved. "   " It’s impossible to foresee the reaction of the Palestinians on the street, but I expect it will be harsh," he said.
