America’s intelligence agencies have assessed with "high confidence" that Russia’s government was behind the hack, and private security companies have identified two Russian teams of hackers that were inside D. N. C. computers. One team is called Cozy Bear and is linked to the F. S. B. the successor to the K. G. B. and another is called Fancy Bear and is linked to the G. R. U. or Russian military intelligence. Cyber experts are very familiar with both Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. The next question is whether Russia was also behind the release of the stolen emails to WikiLeaks.
