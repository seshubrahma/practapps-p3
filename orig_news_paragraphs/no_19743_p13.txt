Particularly since his return to the Russian presidency in 2012, Putin has portrayed himself as a defender of traditional social values, especially in opposition to gay rights, and as a religiously devout alternative to Western countries that he has said "are denying moral principles and all traditional identities: national, cultural, religious, and even sexual. " While the idea of Putin lecturing the world on "moral principles" grates on mainstream ears, that stance has also drawn praise, not only from conservative populists in Europe, but also   American activists, like columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, whose 1996 bid for the GOP presidential nomination presaged many of Trump’s insular themes. Against these shared priorities, the European populist parties almost universally downplay Putin’s destabilizing moves, including those in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, as, at most, a   concern.
