Hezbollah is not Iran’s only option. Breitbart Jerusalem has been reporting on the formation of a "Golan Liberation Brigade," which was announced last month by the   of the Iraqi Harakat al Nujaba Shiite militia and is reportedly being trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.   The   militia is another Iranian front that could be used to target Israel’s Golan Heights at the behest of Tehran. The next few days and weeks will be critical in determining Iran and Russia’s resolve in the face of an awakened America that has returned from its   slumber.
