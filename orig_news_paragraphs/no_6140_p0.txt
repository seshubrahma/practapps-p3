One California State Senator has amended a bill to discriminate against any contractor who works on President Trump’s border wall —  by banning them for life from being awarded any contracts with the state of California. [San Diego Tribune reports that State Sen. Ricardo Lara,   Gardens has amended Senate Bill 30 —  initially a bill requiring state voter approval of any   infrastructure project built along " California’s southern border" —  which will now prohibit the state from contracting with any person or organization that provides any goods or services for the wall.   " It’s clear that President Trump intends to stick taxpayers with the cost of a border wall that will hurt California’s economy, environment and people," Lara said in a statement according to the Tribune.
