A staff member said the PGA Tour, which has held an annual tournament at Doral for more than half a century (the Trumps bought the property in 2012) was planning to move it   —   to Mexico. Mr. Trump, who last year had choice words for Mexican immigrants, broke the news on May 31 that the Tour is moving: "They’re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance," he told Fox News. The PGA Tour commissioner said the move was  not a political statement.
