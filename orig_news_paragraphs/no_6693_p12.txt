America, Contrary to those who suggest a Trump administration in Syria would be the first major commitment of American troops in the country, the United States has been involved in the Syrian Civil War for years. Reports suggest that the CIA had begun sending weapons to   rebels as early as 2012, even as Hillary Clinton referred to Assad as a "reformer" a year prior. Most Obama administration involvement in Syria was on the part of the Free Syrian Army (see below) attempting to "vet"   rebels to ensure that no American weapons fell in the hands of jihadists. Obamaâ€™s vetting program resulted in Free Syrian Army defectors abandoning the group en masse, feeling too small and vulnerable to fight alone, for groups such as   and the Nusra Front.
