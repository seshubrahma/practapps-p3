Paul Fisher first created the pressured ink cartridge in 1966.   The next year, NASA purchased 400 of them for $6 a pop.   More than 60 years later, Fisher Space Pens are used on the International Space Station.    Your other pens might run out of ink pretty quickly, but this one should last to you about 100 years.
