The First Lady is friends with Stefabo Gabbana, who has previously praised Melania for her elegant style. In a visit to meet Pope Francis, Melania worked with Dolce   Gabbana, again, on a stunning   black   that showed off a beautiful round collar, framing the First Ladyâ€™s face. The look was paired with a black lace Mantilla and black Manolo Blahnik stilettos, sticking to the Vatican dress code.
