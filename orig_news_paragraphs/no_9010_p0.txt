NEW YORK CITY, New York   —    Members of the Egyptian delegation to the United Nations blasted Hillary Clinton just a day after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   met with both Clinton and Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. They also had high praise for Trump —  and while not an official endorsement, it is a positive outcome for Trump’s first and only meeting with Muslim world leaders thus far.
