Yet, the bill proposed on Monday night certainly does not represent a full repeal of Obamacare. It has been called by conservative critics Obamacare 2. 0 because the bill keeps in place the Obamacare requirements that insurers allow for coverage of   conditions and allows children to stay on their parents’ health care until they’re   . It shifts the individual mandate from being a tax paid to the government to a penalty paid to insurance companies, does not even address the Medicaid issue in states effectively, helps illegal aliens access healthcare in the system, and it does not allow for purchasing of insurance across state lines as Republicans have promised for years —  among many, many other problems.
