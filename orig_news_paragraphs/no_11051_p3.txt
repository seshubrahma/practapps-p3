The poll also found that 50. 6 percent thought Hillary won the first debate while 40. 5 percent thought Trump did. But this perception clearly didnâ€™t affect the votes of too many Trump supporters. The poll was taken between Sept. 28 and Sept. 29 and has a 4 percent margin of error. The poll was somewhat small, with 223 Republicans and 229 Democrats participating alongside 167 independents.
