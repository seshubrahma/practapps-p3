[Vice President Mike Pence has been making trips to Capitol Hill this week for discussions on healthcare and the repeal of Obamacare with members of Congress, including the Freedom Caucus. In a Monday evening meeting the Vice President presented a plan that would allow states to opt out of Obamacare mandated provisions including "essential" health benefits, community rating, and guaranteed issue.   Shortly after the Monday meeting, Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows spoke positively of the discussion with hopes to see text of the agreement within 24 hours. A source close to the talks indicated that as of Wednesday morning the Freedom Caucus was still waiting for that text.
