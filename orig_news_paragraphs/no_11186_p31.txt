It’s a group of folks who underwrite the expenses of the inaugural committee and the parade and the stands and the security and the fencing and renting the ballrooms and these people allow it so we can keep prices free or cheap. I wouldn’t say that’s unique to ours but people kind of think the inauguration itself is kind of exclusive. But the inauguration is for the people and that’s something this president especially has given the charge to this committee to make sure. The tickets along the parade route, the majority of the parade route is open to the public.
