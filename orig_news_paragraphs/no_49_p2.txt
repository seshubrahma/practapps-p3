" The police said the victim was an    man from suburban Chicago who had "mental health challenges" and who had been reported missing. Officers spotted him on Tuesday in a violent neighborhood on Chicagoâ€™s West Side and recognized that he was in distress, the police said. They sought treatment for him at a hospital and connected the beating to four people who were taken into custody later that day near where the bloodied man had been found.
