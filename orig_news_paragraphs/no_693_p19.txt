In a statement released through his agent, Mr. Yiannopoulos said: "The people whose views, concerns and fears I am articulating do not sip white wine and munch canap√©s in gilded salons. And they will not be defeated by the cocktail set running New York publishing. Nor will I. " The decision is likely to be a costly one for Simon  Schuster, which may not be able to recover the portion of the reported $250, 000 advance it had already paid to Mr. Yiannopoulos. "
