The Buffalo Bills fans had their replies ready.   Before the anthem, the crowd chanted "USA! USA!" When Kaepernick jogged onto New Era Field in Orchard Park, New York, for his first snap, the crowd greeted him with boos    and not just because he played for the Billsâ€™ opponent. Such is the life of a lightning rod.
