WASHINGTON   —      Donald J. Trump is moving to repudiate vast parts of President Obama’s domestic agenda as he fills his cabinet with conservatives who have long records opposing the current administration on social programs, wages, public lands, veterans and the environment. Mr. Trump’s selections to lead the Departments of Education, Commerce, Justice, and Health and Human Services, and the names under consideration for other federal agencies with broad authority over the lives of Americans, have cheered Republicans in Washington, who have spent eight years battling Mr. Obama’s administration.
