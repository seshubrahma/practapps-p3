Mr. Trump’s aides have been eager for his wife to make a public show of support for him, especially after the "Access Hollywood" recording dominated several media cycles and drove some Republican elected officials to abandon his candidacy. A week ago, Mr. Trump’s adult children, along with aides to his campaign, urged Ms. Trump to agree to a   interview with her husband, an echo of the "60 Minutes" interview that Bill and Hillary Clinton did in 1992 after sexual infidelity allegations arose against Mr. Clinton. That appearance helped stabilize Mr. Clinton’s presidential campaign. But Ms. Trump had little interest in it, and the idea died.
