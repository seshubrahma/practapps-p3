Wilders has made headlines and drawn condemnation for more than a decade for his   rhetoric, which has included comparing the Quran with Adolf Hitlerâ€™s "Mein Kampf" and calling for a tax on the veils some Muslim women wear. At the same time, support for his party has grown in fits and starts, mirroring what he calls a "Patriotic Spring" sweeping Europe. Despite slipping in the polls recently, the Party for Freedom remains on track to become one of the biggest parties in the   lower house. He also is regularly compared to President Donald Trump, for his policies and also his penchant for communicating via Twitter.
