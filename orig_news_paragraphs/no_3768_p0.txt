CNN chief Jeff Zucker blamed President Donald Trump for endangering reporters in the legacy media.   According to an Associated Press report, Zucker said "the level of threats faced by his journalists is more serious than people realize," and "he lays the blame squarely at the feet of" Trump and "other politicians he says try to delegitimize the press. " Zucker reportedly spoke about the   chants at Trumpâ€™s rallies and a Guardian reporter being   by   Montana House candidate Greg Gianforte, who won his race a day after   the   reporter.
