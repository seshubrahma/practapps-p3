Trump states: It is my great honor to help raise money for the Republican Party to ensure Hillary Clinton is defeated in November and Republican candidates maintain the majority in the House and Senate. This is an impressive leadership team comprised of talented individuals working together to unite the party and win what will be the most important election of our lifetime. The money raised is an investment in the Republican Party and the future of our country, which, as President, I am going to make better and stronger than ever before.
