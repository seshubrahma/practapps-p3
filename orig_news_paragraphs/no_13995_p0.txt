 (CNN) Protesters flooded Washington and gathered in many other cities Saturday to take a stand on   Donald Trump’s inauguration. The protesters hoped to send a strong message to the world that they oppose this   . They want to make it clear that Trump does not have a mandate to take America in a new direction and that he doesn’t represent the values of the nation.
