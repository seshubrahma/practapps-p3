Iranâ€™s national airline, Iran Air, said that it had signed an agreement with Boeing, an American manufacturer, to purchase the aircraft, at a total cost of $16. 6 billion. In September, the Treasury Department gave approval for Boeing and its European competitor, Airbus, to sell planes to Iran. Boeing confirmed the deal, saying that the contract was reached within the terms of the government license that the department had issued. The sale includes 50     737 planes and 30     777 aircraft.
