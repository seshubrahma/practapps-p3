The   Bank, the federal government’s export credit agency, has been targeted by groups like the Heritage Foundation and some   conservatives in the past    who argue it’s a form of corporate welfare that unduly benefits major companies, such as Boeing and Caterpillar.    the bank became a campaign issue during the 2014 midterm election and remained an issue of debate in Congress afterward. Opponents, such as   banking chairman Richard Shelby,   have tried to hobble it by not confirming nominees to its board. The bank has lacked full power in recent years because of those vacant seats, which means it can’t approve transactions over $10 million.
