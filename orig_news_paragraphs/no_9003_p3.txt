Trump has proven extremely sensitive to the concerns of the   Cuban exile community and its allies in the United States. Despite his dealings in the hotel industry, Trump has not brought his real estate business to Cuba and has repeatedly vowed as a candidate to undo President Obama’s "normalization" process, which has resulted in an unprecedented wave of Cuban refugees taking to the high seas to reach the United States and a new wave of violent repression of Cuban dissidents. As   Trump responded to the death of dictator Fidel Castro by calling him a "brutal dictator" and has filled his transition team with prominent members of the Cuban exile community in the United States, as both transition officials and advisers. The letter is the latest in a nascent campaign to urge Trump to reconsider on his     stance regarding Cuba’s government.
