Republicans have 52 senators, and need the support of eight Democrats to avoid a filibuster in the full Senate.   The Republican National Committee announced a   ad buy targeting 12 Democratic senators from mostly states that President Donald Trump won, in part urging voters to call their senators and demand an    vote for Gorsuch in the Senate.    Sen. Joe Manchin, one of those Democrats, stopped by the hearing Wednesday afternoon. The West Virginia senator said heâ€™s still keeping an open mind and requested a second meeting with Gorsuch next week.
