Over 700 former E. P. A. employees have signed a letter to senators opposing his confirmation. The Center for Media and Democracy, a   group, successfully sued the Oklahoma attorney general’s office to release about 3, 000 of Mr. Pruitt’s emails, which they say could reveal more about his ties to fossil fuel companies. An Oklahoma judge ruled Thursday that the emails must be released but gave the attorney general’s office until Tuesday to comply, long enough to avoid roiling the confirmation vote unless Democrats can persuade Senate Republicans to hold off. But former E. P. A. officials said the open rebellion by current employees was extraordinary, especially considering that their resistance could backfire once Mr. Pruitt arrives on the job.
