" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed to CNN that Melania Trump will indeed hold a news conference, but declined to provide additional specifics on the timing. Melania Trump told CNNâ€™s Anderson Cooper in February that she came to the US in 1996, but the nude photos were taken in New York in 1995. She also said in the interview that she "obeyed the law" and "flew to Slovenia every few months to stamp" her visa during her initial stays in the US, before she was able to obtain a green card.
