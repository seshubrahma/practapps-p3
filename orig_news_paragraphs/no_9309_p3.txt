As a true supporter of people I am saddened by Senator Sanders decision. To have people calling crying and feeling robbed breaks my heart. His decision has led me to make sure that moving forward the people have their own white house that is not owned by an the establishment. The masses will not vote for the Democratic Party because they are untrustworthy.
