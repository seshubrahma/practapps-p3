You won’’t find YayYo’’s name in the visitor’’s directory at 9665   Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills, but if you head down a drab   hallway on the eighth floor, you’’ll see a sign that says "YAY   YO. " ’ "   Walk right in (no one answers the door) and you’ll find four   people sitting around a long table. " ’
