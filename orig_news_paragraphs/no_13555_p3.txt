If the current level of refugee resettlement continues for the remaining nine months of FY 2017, more than 100, 000 refugees will be resettled, even though how the resettlement agencies would fund the additional 15, 000 refugees who are not in the interim budget remains unknown. If Trump follows through on his campaign promise, however, the number of refugees resettled in FY 2016 is likely to fall below 85, 000. The Obama administration continues to accelerate the resettlement of refugees from countries that the new administration is likely to place on the "pause" list: Syria and Somalia. Since October 1, 3, 542 refugees have been resettled in the United States from Syria, an annualized rate of more than 14, 000, an increase from the 12, 500 resettled in FY 2016.
