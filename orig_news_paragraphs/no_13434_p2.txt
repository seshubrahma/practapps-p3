The City’s sanctuary city policies forbid the NOPD from aiding ICE in any way with operations such as raids, whereas the law enforcement agency once helped with traffic control. NOPD recently changed course somewhat to cooperate with ICE detainers for illegal immigrants convicted on separate charges after pressure had been applied from the state attorney general’s public comments. Similar sanctuary cities, like Los Angeles, have recommitted to their sanctuary policies, telling the news media that they too do not plan on changing course on policies that have been criticized for keeping illegal criminals safe while putting Americans in harm’s way.
