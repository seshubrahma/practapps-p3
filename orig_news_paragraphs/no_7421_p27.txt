So I want to be honest, it is not as if it is just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have, too. Whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to, you know, tilt things in their direction. That is why we have got to have a, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is   and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud, is serious about making sure the people are not being discouraged to vote, That is why the voting rights legislation that was passed a couple years ago to help the county clerks to make sure that the machines are in place are important.
