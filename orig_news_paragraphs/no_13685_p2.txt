First Lady Michelle Obama joined Hillary Clinton for a rally in North Carolina. Throughout the campaign, Clinton has relied on more popular surrogates including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vice President Joe Biden, and former Vice President Al Gore, to try to energize Democratic voters. Her final rally, therefore, will be less about change, and more about continuing the same policies sought by the Obama administration and the first Clinton administration. It also suggests that the campaign sees Pennsylvania as the most important state to keep Democratic, as they face more difficult odds against Donald Trump in Florida and North Carolina.
