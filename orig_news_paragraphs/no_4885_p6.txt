The   New York Times piece from January 19 is a perfect example of this. It begins by    confirming the existence of the wiretaps everyone in Obamaworld is now swearing are a figment of Donald Trumpâ€™s imagination. Mountains of innuendo about connections between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence have been spun out of what these abruptly   intercepts contained, according to the anonymous leakers who currently drive almost 100 percent of mainstream media coverage.   But if you read that New York Times article carefully, it admits the communications intercepts may not exist, and if they do, no one can confirm what they actually say (emphasis added): American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of   Donald J. Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said.
