Cruz defends foreign policy adviser Frank Gaffney, and he praises Gaffney’s work fighting jihadism and potential EMP attacks. When Blitzer keeps pushing him on Gaffney’s past quotes, Cruz says he refuses to play the media’s "gotcha" game and wants to talk about issues Americans care about. He blasts Obama for sipping mojitos with Communist dictators in Cuba but not having the time to meet with dissidents. He blasts the left for glorifying "chic" dictators.
