Google Allo, Google’s new messaging app that leverages artificial intelligence, does not enable Signal’s    encryption in all its messages by default. Google offers full encrypted messaging only in   Incognito sessions, a private mode that must be turned on manually. When you’re not chatting in Incognito mode, Google stores your Allo messages on its server. Similarly, Facebook’s Messenger enables    encryption inside a private chat mode called Secret Conversations.
