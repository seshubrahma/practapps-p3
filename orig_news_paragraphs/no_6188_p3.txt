The MOAB is the U. S. militaryâ€™s largest   bomb, weighing in at over 25, 000 pounds. The Thursday deployment was the first time the bomb has ever been used in the field since its testing in 2013. The Afghan government worked closely with the Trump administration during the planning stages for dropping the bomb and gave use of the MOAB its approval.
