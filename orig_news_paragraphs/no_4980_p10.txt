The concept of "school choice" is very appealing, but the reality is that vouchers are a transfer of taxpayer funds from a public school to a private or religious participating school. If parents "choose" to send their children to a participating school, that school may have additional regulatory burdens placed upon it by the state in which it is located   —   in the name of "accountability "  —   in order to qualify for the school choice program.
