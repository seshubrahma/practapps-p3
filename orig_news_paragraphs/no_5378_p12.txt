Now, what the president did was inappropriate. But here is what is so frustrating for Republicans like me. You may be the first president in history to go down because you canâ€™t stop inappropriately talking about an investigation that, if you just were quiet, would clear you. It is frustrating for me to want to help a man who I think will do big things no other Republican will do, like immigration.
