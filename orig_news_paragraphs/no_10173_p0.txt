Donald Trump’s new pick to run the Department of Labor is being congratulated by defeated GOP establishment leaders Jeb Bush and Eric Cantor, both of whom get booted out of politics for their efforts to increase   immigration. [Andy Puzder, Trump’s   nominee to become the Secretary of Labor, promptly sent his very public thanks to the two defeated leaders for their support.   Thanks @JebBush for the kind words. I look forwarding to working with @realDonaldTrump to put American workers back to work.
