$75 a night for a private room on the top floor of a gorgeous townhouse. The owners, who work in the visual arts, were generous and accommodating. The neighborhood itself, a small sliver wedged between Park Slope and Crown Heights, ended up being an ideal location. Itâ€™s well served by the subway system (2, 3, B, Q) and was a great launching pad for getting into surrounding neighborhoods.
