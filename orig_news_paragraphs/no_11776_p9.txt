Itâ€™s something that every candidate on the stage needs to clear up in terms of their position. Manning, whose group launched the new polling data with Caddell and Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) at the National Press Club on Thursday morning, said the reason why he came out with this is because the media and the establishment has been misrepresenting the facts when arguing support for Obamatrade is a good thing for politicians. " We all got tired last of hearing what a good political deal it was for Republicans to support giving President Obama   and passing the Trans Pacific Partnership," Manning said.
