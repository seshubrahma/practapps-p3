White House national security spokesman Bernadette Meehan claimed in a January statement cited in Reuters: As a matter of   practice and principle, we do not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections, so as to avoid the appearance of influencing a democratic election in a foreign country. Accordingly, the president will not be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu because of the proximity to the Israeli election, which is just two weeks after his planned address to the U. S. Congress. Five of Obama’s campaign operatives did show up in Israel ahead of the country’s March 2015 election and just days after the Obama White House decried the Netanyahu visit on the basis of influencing Israel’s election.
