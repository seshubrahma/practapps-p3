The loss of Josh seemed like it would be catastrophic to us, but I thought it gave us a new lease on who Alicia was, with the underpinning of mourning. How does a [series] show the fact of someone dying, as opposed to a lot of these shows that kill off someone every week? Is there any merit to the rumblings of a feud between Julianna and Archie Panjabi [who played the private investigator Kalinda Sharma] that they didnâ€™t film their scenes together toward the end of her run on the show?
