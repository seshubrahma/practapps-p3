In particular, users of Windows XP, which Microsoft officially stopped supporting in 2014, were vulnerable to attack. The company provides very limited support to XP users who pay for special service, but no longer provides Windows XP patches to the general public.

Microsoft has said end users must take some responsibility for failing to install critical security patches.
