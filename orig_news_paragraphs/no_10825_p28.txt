So says Ed Rollins at Fox News in his "game over" post on Wednesday morning   —   incorrectly asserting that Trump won "the vast majority of delegates" on Super Tuesday, when he won less than half the total on offer, and less than 30 more than Cruz   —   but making a good case that the Trump movement is for real , he’s survived the hardest blows he’ll ever take, he’ll be more effective as a party "unifier" than his detractors assume, and suggesting that in the future it might be better to let Chris Christie exit the stage gracefully after he introduces Mr. Trump.
