" My hope is he does not simply take a real politic approach and suggest that, you know, if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable, or creates   problems in regions like Syria, that we just do whateverâ€™s convenient at the time," he said. He said that Russia and the United States have big differences when it came to principles of democracy, freedom of speech, rule of law, national sovereignty.
