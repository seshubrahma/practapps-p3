 (CNN) Former CIA Director James Woolsey told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that he believed it would be tough to find a "willing" candidate to replace fired FBI Director James Comey. " I find this whole thing, this whole week, to be very troubling for inchoate ways and inchoate reasons," he told Zakaria, referring to President Trump’s firing of Comey, who had been in the middle of investigating possible ties between Trump’s campaign and Russia’s interference in last year’s election.
