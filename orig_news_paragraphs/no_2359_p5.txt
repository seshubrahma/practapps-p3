Mr. Kaine mounted an insistent and prodding attack on Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence at the   debate, frequently interrupting Mr. Pence to demand that he defend Mr. Trump’s divisive statements. Mr. Pence remained unruffled as he sidestepped those demands, but on Wednesday he faced intense scrutiny  —   and a battery of attacks from Democrats  —   for evading questions about Mr. Trump’s record. Yet with Mr. Trump’s temperament and readiness for the presidency lingering as central concerns for voters, the hope among Trump allies is that Mr. Pence may have essentially reassured Americans, by proxy, that Mr. Trump is calm enough for the job. Democrats dismissed that possibility on Wednesday morning.
