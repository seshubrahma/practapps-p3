The crime, which took place some 20 miles from the White House in a school district where many members of Congress and federal officials live, comes amid heightened scrutiny of undocumented immigrants. Last month, President Donald Trump directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office tasked with focusing on crimes allegedly committed by undocumented immigrants.   Asked about the story at a Tuesday briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer called the crime "horrendous and horrible and disgusting." "I think part of the reason the president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this," he said.
