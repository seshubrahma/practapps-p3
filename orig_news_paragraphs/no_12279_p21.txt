In 2013, Obama also pushed a "Comprehensive Immigration Reform" that would have allowed an unlimited number of foreign graduates to get work permits in the United States by first paying tuition fees to U. S. universities. That "staple" plan was derailed in 2014 by voters eager to reduce annual immigration, and then blown up in 2014 by GOP primary votes in the Seventh District of Virginia, who ejected the GOPâ€™s Majority Leader, Rep. Eric Cantor. In the 2016 campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton supported a similar plan to "staple" work permits to postgraduate degrees.   So, far, however, Trump has not chosen a person to run the Departments of Labor or the Department of Homeland Security, which manage the   and other   programs.
