 (CNN) More than 450, 000 Americans had locked in their votes for president before Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump met on stage for a contentious debate Sunday night, and even before the revelation of a video where Trump can be heard making sexually aggressive and lewd remarks about women, according to early vote returns from across the United States. In 27 states where data have been made available so far, early votes have been cast or absentee ballots returned by at least 455, 878 people.
