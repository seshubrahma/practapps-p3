[The   sports media has been out for blood for the better part of a year because Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick, and team owner Robert Kraft all came out as unapologetic fans of President Trump. And, now that they’ve won the Super Bowl the left has turned apoplectic.   Since last night’s big game, liberals have flooded Twitter, Facebook, and other social media services with several versions of the hash tag after Trump pal Tom Brady led his team to yet another Super Bowl title. Along with #NotMySuperBowlChamps, users also employed #NotMySuperBowlChampions and #NotMySuperBowlTeam to attack the Patriots.
