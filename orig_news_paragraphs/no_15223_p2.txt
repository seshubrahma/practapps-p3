In recent weeks and months, the Secret Service has engendered a number of controversies and faced a series of security challenges. One of the most significant breaches under President Donald Trump occurred on March 10, when the Secret Service said a man breached the perimeter of the White House grounds after jumping several fences and went undetected for more than 16 minutes before being caught just steps from a main door to the executive mansion. President Trump was in the White House at the time. Two uniformed Secret Service officers were fired over their handling of the incident, and others involved are facing possible disciplinary action.
