If @RepMarkMeadows, @JimJordan and @RaulLabrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts  reform," Trump tweeted late on Thursday night. The tweet signaled the President is not just ready to target the House Freedom Caucus as a group but is equally ready to single out individual members, raising questions about whether he will support primary challenges against individual members ahead of the midterm elections in 2018. But the campaign also represents a risk for the President, who with approval ratings at less than 40% in many polls does not have the political weight that he might have if he was more popular. In many safe conservative districts, House Freedom Caucus members ran ahead of Trump’s numbers in their   races last year, raising doubts about the extent of the President’s leverage.
