In addition to the loans taken out on the Hamptons house, Mr. Manafort has recently obtained mortgages on another property. Those loans, totaling $6. 6 million, were obtained in January on a brownstone in Brooklyn and also came from Federal Savings Bank in Chicago. Mr. Manafort declined to explain the purpose of his loans. But a review of public records suggests at least some of them are connected to efforts to salvage investments he made with Jessica Manafortâ€™s husband, Jeffrey Yohai, whose real estate business filed for bankruptcy in December.
