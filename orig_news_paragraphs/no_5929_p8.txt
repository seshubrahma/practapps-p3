Shiite militia groups backed by Iran, some of which were murdering U. S. soldiers just a few years ago, are heavily involved in the fighting. There are concerns these emboldened,   heavily armed militias will move into Syria and cause a new sectarian crisis. Many of these groups are units of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, for all intents and purposes, and would become shock troops for Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as he finishes off the last elements of the rebellion against him. The Iraqi government, it must be said, does not have the most sterling record for honesty and efficiency.
