It is deplorable to rise to national political prominence on the bigotry that is "birtherism," even more deplorable to have neither the character nor the courage either publicly to renounce or repeat that assertion while touting your supposed toughness as a primary reason to vote for you.   It is deplorable that the list of deplorable things done and said by the Republican nominee for president is so long it’s hard and exhausting to try to remember them all. It is deplorable that a sizable percentage of his supporters love him because of those awful things    deplorable that they now feel it is OK to express those views in public. That is not excusable    no matter how much economic pain they’ve contended with these past few decades.
