The case was brought by an Egyptian immigrant cleric based in Hawaii, who claimed Trump’s policy could block his old    from moving to Hawaii. The claim was supported by the ACLU, Islamist groups, and many elite lawyers.   The decision by the California judges will either be approved or rejected by the Supreme Court, as soon as the fall. Much of the executive order was already blocked by another group of progressive judges in Virginia, who claimed that it is unconstitutional because of Trump’s   criticism of Islam.
