Washington (CNN) Donald Trump responded to Tuesday’s terror attack at a Turkish airport by calling for the U. S. to "fight fire with fire" when it comes to battling ISIS, including the use of waterboarding.   " You know, you have to fight fire with fire," Trump told an Ohio rally as he described ISIS’s brutal tactics, including decapitating and burning prisoners to death.
