They donâ€™t want to empower the thugs in Black Lives Matter. They live around, they ran away from them. Take it from someone who left a slum, nobody wants to be dragged back into the slum, or have   ruling over you, to make it very, very clear. The black middle class is never heard from by the Wolf Blitzers, and the Jake Tappers, and the George Slimeonallofus types.
