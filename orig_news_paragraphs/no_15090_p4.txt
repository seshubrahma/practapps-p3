Some of the carrier’s communications suites could be used to command an operation if it came to that, but contingency plans have generally focused on US and South Korean commanders running any operations from shore. It is the destroyers and cruisers, as well as a   submarine accompanying the carrier, that could be called into action if there was an operation against a North Korean ballistic missile launch. But officials emphasized the US and Japan always maintain some   capability in the western Pacific prepared to deal with North Korea. The strike group has been at sea since January and conducted military exercises with other nations in the western Pacific, including Japan and the Republic of Korea.
