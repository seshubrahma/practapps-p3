Lobbyists for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association have been more active and outspoken. They support changes to the health care law because, they say, premiums and deductibles are too high and commercial insurers have been dropping out of the public insurance marketplaces.   of counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage in the marketplace, they say, and in many cases, it is a Blue Cross plan.

Without these payments, Blue Cross wrote in a primer delivered to congressional offices, consumers will see "significant premium increases in 2018, making coverage even more unaffordable for millions of working Americans.
