The cutoff has been raised several times over the years. In 2004, the Bush administration also made it easier to exempt workers above the cutoff under the duties test. Proponents like Mr. Eisenbrey urged the administration to raise the cutoff to about $51, 000, which, in   dollars, is roughly where it stood in 1975, when the Ford administration undertook the last major expansion of overtime eligibility. In addition to increasing the basic ceiling, which will be set to match the pay of   salaried workers earning at the 40th percentile of salaries in the countryâ€™s   region, currently the South, the new regulation will be updated every three years to keep pace with changes in pay.
