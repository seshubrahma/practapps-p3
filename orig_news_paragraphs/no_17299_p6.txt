How Trump ended Democrats’   winning streak in one county, "I thought Mitt went over the line" with the things he said about Trump during the campaign, Giuliani said last week on Fox News.   Trump’s former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich, three longtime Trump supporters, have publicly complained about Romney as a candidate for leading the State Department. Specifically, Conway told CNN’s Dana Bash on "State of the Union" that Trump’s loyal supporters across the country feel "betrayed" that he is considering Romney, who was one of his most vicious critics during the election. Trump has hired Priebus and former campaign executive Steve Bannon as "equal partners"    with the former Breitbart chief as a senior adviser.
