Senate Republicans must show that they are more loyal to the nation than their party. Democrats, who have little love for Comey after his pronouncements about Clinton before the election, need to show that they can work with the GOP on this issue to make sure someone strong takes over the job. Better yet would be to take up Senator Chuck Schumerâ€™s plan to appoint a special prosecutor, which is now the only way to move forward with a serious investigation. Without such action, the legitimacy of the 2016 election and the legitimacy of this President will remain a question.
