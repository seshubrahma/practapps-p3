Republicans have resisted Democratic efforts to spend big on the nation ’s roads, bridges, tunnels and rail lines use the federal government’s power to bargain for lower prescription drug prices block trade agreements and limit foreign interventions. Republican leaders have sought a   approach on immigration laws, offering a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and tried to restrain popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. If the president is able to blur party lines on such issues and harness an ascendant   coalition to win that clash, he will have untethered conservatism from the Republican Party and shifted the party away from the   approach that has been its hallmark since Ronald Reagan stood 36 years ago in the same position on the Capitol steps as Mr. Trump.
