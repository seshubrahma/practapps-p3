Took off my belt and myself and another congressman, I don’t remember who, applied a tourniquet to try to slow down the bleeding.    In the meantime, towards the right field side of the dugout, and there is gunfire about five or six, seven feet to my head.   I look up and there’s a guy with a gun blasting away. Fortunately it was one of the good guys, one of our security detail who was shooting back.
