Sources say Trump insisted it was a very bad deal for the US to take 2, 000 refugees and that one of them was going to be the next Boston bomber. Turnbull told Trump several times the agreement was for 1, 250 refugees, not 2, 000. He also said Australia was asking to submit them to the US for refugee screening, and if the refugees did not pass the US screening process, they would not come. Trump expressed concern as to how this agreement from President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration would go forward given his executive order the day before temporarily suspending the US refugee program.
