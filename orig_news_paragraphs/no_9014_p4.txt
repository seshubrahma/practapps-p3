Some 39 percent of likely voters supported Clinton in the   poll, compared with 36 percent for Trump, 7 percent for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 3 percent for Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Both polls were conducted online in English in all 50 states. They included 1, 154 likely voters and have a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. Other possible reasons given for the shift are Trumpâ€™s aggressive outreach to   voters, and his willingness to show flexibility on deportation.
