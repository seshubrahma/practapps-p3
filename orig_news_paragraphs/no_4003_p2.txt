President Trump’s first executive order on immigration and the draft enforcement memos signed by Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly promise to similarly tarnish our nation’s character. The memos call for expanding the nation’s deportation forces by 15, 000 to round up, detain and deport the undocumented immigrants living among us. Instead of focusing on criminals, they make all undocumented people priorities for enforcement, and through a process called "expedited removal," they severely reduce due process protections. Murguía says Trump’s immigration orders through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are based entirely "on falsehoods" about illegal aliens, arguing that illegal immigration is down and it does not pose as much of a threat as the Trump Administration purports.
