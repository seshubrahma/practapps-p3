Witnesses described a harrowing scene that started with screeching tires and ended with screams, panic and a fiery crash at one of the worldâ€™s most visited sites.     " A woman in front on the sidewalk was hit and tossed before then car reached 44th st, continued plowing people down at full speed up to 45th street, where it was stopped after crashing into more people and the light post," posted Instagram user Ed G Val, who from across the street "saw the car speeding north on the west sidewalk of southbound 7th Ave. "
