The two newly created funds, Trump Victory and Trump Make America Great Again Committee, are joint efforts between the Trump campaign, the RNC and 11 state Republican party committees. These partners will share the funds donated to the new committees. The Trump campaign will collect the first $5, 400 from each donation, half of which is earmarked to pay the campaignâ€™s primary election costs.
