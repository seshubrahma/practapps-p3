Donald Trump said he’s done being a nice guy and is "taking the gloves off" for the general election. ["I’m running against a crooked person," Trump told an   crowd that gathered to see him in Colorado Springs, Colorado Friday afternoon. He also drew more than 6, 000 people during his evening campaign rally in Denver a few hours later.   So @TheNewsan says doors shut at #TrumpInDenver Capacity is 6, 500, accd @DenverFireDept Certainly a big crowd.
