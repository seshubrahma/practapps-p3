Caruso has banned other stars from the Grove in the past, including Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao this past March over comments he made about gay people. It  was the second time Pacquaio was barred from The Grove. The first time was in 2012, when the official Grove Twitter account announced that the boxer was "not welcome" there after he quoted a Bible verse about homosexuality in an interview. However, it was later discovered that Pacquiao was misquoted in the interview, and the ban was later lifted.
