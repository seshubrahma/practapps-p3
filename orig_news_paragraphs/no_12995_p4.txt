Marion became the youngest French Member of Parliament in modern history aged just 22 in 2012, while studying law in Paris, and remains one of the party’s only two members of parliament. She is unapologetic about her strong Catholic faith and defence of traditional values, and recently called for Christians to stand up for their values in the wake of the Islamic State attack in Nice   —   where a priest was beheaded as he gave mass in a church. She tweeted: "In the West as in the East, Christians must stand up to resist Islam!"
