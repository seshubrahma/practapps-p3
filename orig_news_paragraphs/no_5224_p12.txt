Senator Patty Murray (@PattyMurray) January 20, 2017,   Despite its message of unity among all the left’s political identity groups, the Times previously reported the "Women’s March" has been anything but unified from its inception: On the march group’s Facebook page, it is easy to see how complicated the idea of the "women’s vote," an already mythological concept, has become, and how difficult it might be for organizers to fulfill their aim of gathering women who remain fiercely divided on reproductive rights, gun control,   marriage and immigration, among other issues. Not everyone on the page believes, for instance, that Hillary Clinton would have made a good president, or that Stephen K. Bannon, a chief strategist under Mr. Trump, holds divisive views about minorities. Debates over both have sprung up in recent days.
