Jack Moore wrote on Wednesday: Metro is now selling   versions of its SmarTrip payment cards to commemorate the upcoming presidential inauguration. The cards, which sell for $10 and provide unlimited Metro access the day of the inauguration, feature an image of the White House against a     flag backdrop. Notably absent? Any reference to the    45th president of the United States: Donald Trump.
