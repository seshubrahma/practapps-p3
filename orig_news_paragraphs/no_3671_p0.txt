Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh warned President Donald Trump of "playing the swamp’s game" in governing.   According to Limbaugh, Trump was elected to "drain the swamp," but has been bogged down in taking on the Justice Department’s investigation of his alleged ties to Russia and how that investigation had taken on other aspects. Limbaugh argued although he was playing "the swamp’s game," he had other tools at his disposal that he has yet to use. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com)
