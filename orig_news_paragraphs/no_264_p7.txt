The revenue totals, and estimates of expected revenue, were released as the four House Democrats pressed the General Services Administration to explain how it would respond to the apparent breach that has taken place in the lease Mr. Trump has with the agency, given that it contains a clause that appears to prohibit federal elected officials from benefiting from the lease. The Trump Hotel, which opened in September, had estimated that it would generate $6. 4 million in revenue in its first two months, but it collected just $4. 1 million, according to the letter, citing information that Mr. Trump’s company provided to the agency as part of the lease agreement. The hotel had expected about $397, 000 in income through the end of October  —   revenue minus expenses   —   but actually had $1. 16 million in losses.
