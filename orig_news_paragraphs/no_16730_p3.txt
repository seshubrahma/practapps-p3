A yearly survey conducted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault and   shootings increased by about 2% in 65 major jurisdictions.   (The chiefs’ association list includes large counties such as Los Angeles County and Prince Georges County, Maryland    outside Washington    as well as cities such as Pittsburgh, Newark, New Jersey, and Cincinnati that are not among the nation’s 50 largest.) But if Trump’s claim is that the number of homicides in 2015 was 17% larger than the number of murders in 2014, he is closer to the mark. The major chiefs association survey showed that murders did increase by nearly 16% among its members.
