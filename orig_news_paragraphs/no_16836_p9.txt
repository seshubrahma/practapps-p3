We can be confident that Trump would not respond with the cool detachment of Obama to a tirade of slurs thrown in his direction, especially given Trump’s skepticism of the value of existing alliances which he perceives as not working in the US interest.   Two   are not good news for stable diplomatic relations, and it is unlikely that Trump would accept that the strategic benefit of a   close relationship between Washington and Manila outweigh the   costs of Duterte’s diplomatic affronts. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would provide a far more traditional take on the   relationship. Her victory would likely see a continued effort from Washington to emphasize, as Obama has, the   alignment of shared interests and the deep and warm relationship between the two countries that go beyond the personalities in power.
