A win in Florida would probably allow Mrs. Clinton to survive losses in both Michigan and Pennsylvania, where sheâ€™s favored but vulnerable enough to merit late campaign stops. A North Carolina win would let Mrs. Clinton survive the loss of one but probably not both. The polls show a tight race in Florida and North Carolina, as they have for most of the year. The two states are deeply polarized along racial lines, and the result will hinge as much on turnout as on anything else.
