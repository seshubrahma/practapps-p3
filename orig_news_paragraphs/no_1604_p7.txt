Calling this provision "the Trump loophole," Mrs. Clinton asserted on Wednesday that it would allow Mr. Trump and business owners like him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from their own companies. Even some Republicans who support Mr. Trumpâ€™s promise to slash the tax rate on corporate profits to 15 percent, from the current 35 percent, have criticized the   provision. " While reducing corporate income rates is generally good, the   exemption is a bad policy," said Kyle E. Pomerleau, the director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank.
