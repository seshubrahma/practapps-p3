Cleveland (CNN) John Kasich may be the most intensely courted man in the Buckeye State. With just seven days until the GOP convention, the quest to convince Kasich to back Donald Trump    or even participate in the convention he campaigned to bring to Cleveland    has been quiet but feverish. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus has pressed Kasich allies, even promising that donors will spring to aid Kasichâ€™s future endeavors if he cooperates now.
