To be eligible for a US immigration visa, applicants usually must be sponsored by a US relative, an existing permanent resident or a potential employer. There are exceptions to the rules    for refugee asylum or   adoption, for example. There are also special categories that are largely   and extend to former US government workers such as Iraqi or Afghan translators or contractors. And then there are diversity visas, often referred to as the "green card lottery," which each year admit a limited number of people from countries "with historically low rates of immigration" to the US.
