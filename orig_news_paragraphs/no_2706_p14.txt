Polish officials have preferred to express confidence that, despite the troubling signs, the new president in the end will abide by America â€™s NATO and European Union commitments. " I think we can be confident that U. S. policy toward Poland and thus also our relations will not deteriorate, that at least they will not become weaker," Mr. Duda said after a brief phone conversation with Mr. Trump this past week.
