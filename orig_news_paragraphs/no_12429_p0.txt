The Trump campaign touted a successful meeting between the Republican presidential nominee and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Trump Tower, saying the two affirmed the "unbreakable bond between the two countries" while discussing Muslim terrorism and stability in the Middle East. ["Mr. Trump agreed that the military assistance provided to Israel and missile defense cooperation with Israel are an excellent investment for America. Mr. Trump said that under a Trump administration, there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries," the campaign said in a statement.
