Thursday on Fox News Channel’s special coverage of former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony, "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace said while Comey’s testimony was good news legally for President Donald Trump, "politically" he thought it was "very damaging. "  Wallace said "If I were Donald Trump’s lawyer I’d be pretty happy, because he repeatedly said up to the day he was fired, Comey said that there was no evidence that led to an investigation of Donald Trump   He was not under investigation and on the question of obstruction of justice, while he said that was an open question, that will have to be decided by the special counsel Robert Muller. He certainly didn’t indicate that he viewed it as obstruction of justice or at least a prosecutable case.
