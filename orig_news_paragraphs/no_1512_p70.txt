The     of Trump’s global vision  —   calls to "bomb the [expletive] out of ISIS" and to reintroduce waterboarding on the one hand, a general aversion to foreign intervention and historical alliances on the other  —   seems anathema to a    hawk like Ayotte. On these matters, her insistence to the contrary aside, the New Hampshire senator seems far more in sync with the former secretary of state than she does with the New York developer. Still, she has been willing to venture into Trump’s   zone on occasion, mocking Obama for "being politically correct about how we define our enemies" and describing his military strategy against ISIS as an electoral stunt. Ultimately, the Ayotte campaign’s objective is to avoid a   referendum altogether by advertising her practical skills as a bipartisan senator.
