Trump was heralded by flood victims in the state, with many shouting "We love you Mr. Trump" as he visited their flooded homes and schools, as Breitbart Texas reported. Clinton has yet to set a date to visit the area, saying she did not want to "disrupt" flood victims. " I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild," Clinton said.
