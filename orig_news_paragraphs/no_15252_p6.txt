The statement from the commission follows similar requests from officials around the country. California Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani   also wrote a letter to Sessions and Kelly expressing similar concerns, asking them to top making such arrests in California courthouses.   The Cabinet officials wrote back, saying they would continue to make such arrests and blaming sanctuary citiesâ€™ lack of cooperation with federal law enforcement for needing to make such arrests in public. They wrote that officials unhappy with the arrests should revoke   sanctuary policies, and they have continued to defend arrests at courthouses as safer than trying to apprehend people in environments without the security of courthouses.
