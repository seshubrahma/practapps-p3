Commentary from Timothy Stanley, I’d guess Trump started the debate intending to deflect away from discussion of the "locker room" tape     on economics. But when the moderators pushed and Hillary hit him on it, he finally lost his patience and decided to get personal. He called Bill Clinton an abuser of women and threatened to put Hillary in jail. That’s thin skinned.
