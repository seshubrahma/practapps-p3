The chief editor of Correctiv, Markus Grill, meanwhile has worked for both the   magazine Stern, which last April associated   migration Alternative for Germany supporters with Nazis, and magazine Der Spiegel which has run a series of covers and articles directed against U. S. President Donald Trump. €114, 000 has been donated by the Dutch organization The Adessium Foundation which works on climate change and environmental issues and is openly funded by George Soro’s Open Society Foundation. Soro’s Open Society Foundation has also given €26, 884 directly to Correctiv. George Soros and the Open Society foundation have been linked to the funding of   campaigns to promote Somali migrants in the past, and have spent money on trying to influence the elections of various European Union countries in favour of   open borders parties, with the aim of destroying populism.
