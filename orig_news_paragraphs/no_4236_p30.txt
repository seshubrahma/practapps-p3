Anyone who speaks out in praise of American values or suggests American values may be in danger of eclipse from massive immigration without cultural assimilation â€”   that person and those ideas must be rejected, then marginalized, and then destroyed. I am proud to call Congressman Steve King my friend. Americans who care about constitutional liberty and the independence of the American homeland should care equally about preserving the unique culture that undergirds those liberties and our national sovereignty.
