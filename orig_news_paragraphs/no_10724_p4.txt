For example, Facebook claims that their news curators accepted trending topics regarding IRS official Lois Lerner on "at least 15 occasions," links from The Drudge Report on "at least 11 occasions," and "  topics" related to the late Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle. Facebook says that news about Republican political candidates also trended on the site, although, interestingly, they did not provide a specific figure for the number of times Donald Trump had trended on the platform. Ted Cruz was accepted as a trending topic more than 160 times Rand Paul was accepted on 50 occasions Mitt Romney was accepted more than 40 times and Scott Walker was accepted as a trending topic nearly three dozen times. In fact, the two most frequently accepted topics since early 2015 are presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and #GOPDebate.
