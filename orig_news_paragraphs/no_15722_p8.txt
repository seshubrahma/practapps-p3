Sessions is just the latest in a growing list of current and former Trump associates who have come under fire for being less than forthcoming about their past links to Russia.   Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn continues to make headlines despite saying he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights rather than comply with a subpoena and disclose records about his meetings with Russian officials. The House Intelligence Committee has issued subpoenas to Flynn and Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen    seeking their testimony, as well as documents from their businesses. The leaders of the Senate’s Russia investigation said they will continue to pursue critical documents from Flynn, issuing two additional subpoenas to a pair of businesses Flynn ran.
