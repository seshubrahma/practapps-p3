The main criticism of Trump is his personality, not his temperament. Trump’s personality and tone do offend some people however, after knocking out 16 competitors, perhaps these critics might have been better served analysing his successes rather than judging his behavior. So, for those who want to understand Trump’s temperament, they would be best served by comparing him to   former presidents, such as: Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Ronald Reagan. For each and every President, it was their temperament that led to their success.
