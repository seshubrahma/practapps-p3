Agents, editors and publishers have been snapping up everything from campaign trail memoirs to   books with images from the women’s march to titles that sound suspiciously like   books (Gene Stone’s "The Trump Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living Through What You Hoped Would Never Happen"). Allan J. Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington has already written "The Case for Impeachment," which will be published in April. Reporters who were on the Trump beat in 2016 will also offer inside looks at the campaign.
