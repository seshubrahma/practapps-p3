I think in terms of the media that drives coverage on the right, Breitbart matters a lot. Being in a fight with Breitbart is no good for Donald Trump. I will say also, it goes back to our previous topic  —   not just in the sense we’re roughhousing or not roughhousing, but roughness, undue roughness going on. But it talks about the other things in the rally that we see is their attitude how they treat the press, is again, not something you normally see in presidential campaign rallies and the way they treat the press has not been appropriate for a long time.
