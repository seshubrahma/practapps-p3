 (CNN) A Democrat on the House intelligence committee said Tuesday she wants the panel’s chairman, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, to resign his chairmanship over his handling of the investigation into alleged ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Nunes infuriated Democrats last week when he told the press and the White House    before informing his Democratic colleagues on the panel    that he saw evidence that President Donald Trump’s advisers may have been swept up in surveillance of other foreign nationals. He then revealed Monday that he visited the White House grounds to view sensitive information the day before going to the President with the evidence.
