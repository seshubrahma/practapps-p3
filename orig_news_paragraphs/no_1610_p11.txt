The scope of any Democratic victory is crucial. It is one thing if Democrats are able to muster a    majority or even a    Senate with a Vice President Tim Kaine constantly on hand to break ties after relinquishing his own Senate seat. Every additional Democrat would make it that much easier to move forward with a Clinton administration legislative agenda and make it that much harder for Republicans to reclaim the majority in 2018, when the numbers would be more in their favor. Still, not even the most optimistic Democrats believe they have a chance of reaching 60, the number needed to overcome a filibuster.
