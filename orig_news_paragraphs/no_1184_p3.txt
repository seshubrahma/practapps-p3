Of nearly 2, 000 rural counties in the United States, about 60 percent added jobs last year, while 40 percent contracted, according to federal figures. In such a brutal calculus, economists and local politicians said, little things add up fast: like being close enough to a big city, but not so close as to be crushed by the competition having good access by air and highway for passengers and freight and then having enough trained workers if and when new companies knock on the door. When those gears all mesh, the sweet spot can be sweet indeed.
