Many doctors are not willing to take that chance. More than 750 people who identify themselves as members of the A. M. A. signed a letter to the associationâ€™s board objecting to the endorsement. The "unqualified support" for Mr. Price is inappropriate, the letter says, because he has been "a strong opponent of so much of our clearly delineated A. M. A. policy" on issues like the Affordable Care Act, contraception and gay rights. Some doctors also said patients could be hurt by major changes in Medicare and Medicaid that Mr. Price, along with other House Republicans, has advocated.
