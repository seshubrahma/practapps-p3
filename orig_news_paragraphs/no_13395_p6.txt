Elsewhere, hundreds of protesters marched in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday night. " The crowd halted traffic and was mostly peaceful, but some vandalized property with graffiti, hurled bottles and launched fireworks," the Los Angeles Times reports. The Modesto Bee reports that about 100 demonstrators gathered downtown on Thursday night, chanting, "Not my president" and holding "fuck Trump" signs.
