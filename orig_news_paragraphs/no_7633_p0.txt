Following Donald Trump’s election to the U. S. presidency, a video has resurfaced of comedian and talk show host Seth Meyers mocking Trump at a White House Correspondents dinner over a possible presidential run. [In the video, Meyers jokes that "Donald Trump has been saying he’ll run for president as a Republican, which is surprising as I just assumed he was running as a joke. "  Meyers also made fun of Trump’s hairstyle, comparing it to a fox, and said that Gary Busey, who said that Trump would make a great president, said "the same thing about an old rusty birdy cage he found. "
