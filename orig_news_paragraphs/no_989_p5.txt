Guidelines from the Office of Government Ethics bar federal employees from engaging in decisions directly affecting a company in which they have any financial interest. Even former employees without direct financial ties are subject to impartiality rules when they join the government. They are supposed to avoid doing anything that  —   in the eyes of a "reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts "  —   creates "the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards set forth," and are advised to bring any potential conflicts to the agency’s ethics officer.
