On the one hand, yes, itâ€™s theoretically possible that a group of rogue civil servants, probably concentrated in the intelligence community, have conspired to leak sensitive information to oust Flynn     a man not terribly popular when he was a leader at the Defense Intelligence Agency.    Perhaps these rogues will continue to undermine Trump further whenever they disagree with him, say, for example, on Russia policy    or, more importantly, on the question of whether the Trump campaign had contact with the Russian government prior to the election. The administration could be thwarted at every turn from those in Deep Government, and something would have to be done.
