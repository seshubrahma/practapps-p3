But the truth is, we often work closely with one another, often behind the scenes, on issues important to our constituents. I consider many of my Republican colleagues, including John, good friends.

When Kathy Griffin holds up violent images of the president and Eric Trump says Democrats are "not even people," we must acknowledge that the tone of our rhetoric has risen far outside the norm.
