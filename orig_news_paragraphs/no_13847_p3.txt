That historic delay arose from some particularly bad blood between President John Tyler and a vengeful   Senate that had previously expelled Tyler from its membership ranks. The Whigs rejected all Tylerâ€™s nominees and the open seat was only filled after President James Polk took office in 1845. Such a lengthy delay occurred during an age that makes   senatorial rhetoric appear tepid. (In 1856, for example, an enraged member of the House of Representatives entered the Senate Chamber and proceeded to bludgeon Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner into a state of unconsciousness with a   cane).
