David M. Drucker (@DavidMDrucker) June 21, 2017,  UPDATE 8:15 P. M. The race is, as expected, tightening a bit as well. With a little more than 126, 000 votes in, Handel still leads with 50. 4 percent of the vote to Ossoff’s 49. 6 percent. Our Democrat friend who’s supporting Ossoff tells us that the the person who did the best outreach to seniors likely will win.
