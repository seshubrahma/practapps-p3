The revocations, which were not publicly announced but were revealed during court proceedings, meant that anyone who lost their visa would be unable to   the United States if they left. In the Virginia courtroom, spectators gasped when a lawyer for the government told Judge Brinkema, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, that more than 100, 000 visas had been revoked as part of Mr. Trump’s order. A State Department official later contradicted that number, saying that it mistakenly included diplomatic visas that were untouched by the ban as well as expired visas. The true figure was "fewer than 60, 000," said William Cocks, a spokesman for the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs.
