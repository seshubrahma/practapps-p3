Quanell X, leader of the New Black Panther Party in Houston, Texas, said this week on a local news program that black Americans should "truly examine" Donald Trump’s outreach to the black community and "reexamine the relationship" that black voters have with the Democratic Party.    Read the transcript of Quanell X’s remarks: Donald Trump last week went to Milwaukee because of the rioting behind the police shooting of a young   male by a black officer and the city was being burned down in certain parts of the black community by protesters so Donald Trump decided to go to Milwaukee and speak about the conditions of America and why he felt black people should vote for him. He even went on to lay out reasons why he felt we should. Let me say this to the brothers and sisters who listened and watched that speech.
