Merkley said he was disappointed with Tillerson’s answers to questions about Russia and his time as CEO of ExxonMobil.   " Obviously, sanctions are a big concern    as leader of Exxon, Tillerson proceeded to utilize a subsidiary to bypass American sanctions on Iran. His company lobbied extensively to get rid of the sanctions and certainly not to extend them," Merkley said, referring to charges that during Tillerson’s term as CEO, ExxonMobil skirted US sanctions in international business dealings.
