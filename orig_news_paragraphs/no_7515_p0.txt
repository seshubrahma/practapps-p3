Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is speaking out against a deadlocked Supreme Court decision that blocks President Barack Obama’s executive amnesty program. ["Today’s deadlocked decision from the Supreme Court is unacceptable, and show us all just how high the stakes are in this election," Clinton said in a statement that was released in both English and Spanish.   The divided Supreme Court decision means that a lower court ruling blocking the program remains in place. Clinton dismissed the ruling as "purely procedural" and reasserted her belief that Obama acted within his legal authority.
