Anybody but Trumpâ€™ drive, But some Republican delegates are still supporting anybody but the presumptive Republican nominee. Some are pushing for a "conscience clause" that would allow delegates to vote against the presumptive nominee. Kendal Unruh, a Colorado delegate, organized a call with dozens of other delegates Thursday night to discuss ways to block Trump at the convention. The group, Unruh said, marks the coalescing of disparate "pockets of resistance"    including backers of Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich    which had been opposing Trump with little success.
