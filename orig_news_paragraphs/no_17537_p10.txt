The Des Moines Register said Friday that its journalists had been denied credentials to Trump’s Saturday rally because the paper’s editorial board penned a scathing piece calling Trump a "feckless blowhard" candidate asking that he drop his White House bid.   Trump mocked the paper on Twitter, writing: "The the ultra liberal and seriously failing Des Moines Register is BEGGING my team for press credentials to my event in Iowa   they lie! "
