Free association is an official affiliation with the United States where Puerto Rico would still receive military assistance and funding.   Four plebiscites, or popular votes, have been held to decide the commonwealth’s status in relation to America. Three of four times, Puerto Rico residents voted against statehood (in 1967, 1993 and 1998).   In a 2012 referendum the majority of voters for the first time chose statehood, but it didn’t go anywhere.
