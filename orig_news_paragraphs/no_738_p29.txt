The companies say that while they must make a profit for their shareholders, they are also committed to the area’s social development so people who live in Rosengard will have jobs, better houses and more places to meet and things to do in their free time. " We’re aiming for the long term," said Birgitta Bengtson, a representative of Trianon, one of the developers.
