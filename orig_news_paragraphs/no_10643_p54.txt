I have consumed many   efforts about erroneous or questionable statements he has made, about how much Medicare spends on prescription drugs, or having watched reports of thousands of Muslims celebrating on   in New Jersey. I have read or seen a long line of commentators accusing Trump of being racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, of being ignorant on policy, of encouraging violence. And yet he keeps winning primaries. The negative media attention and   attempts bounce off him like rubber arrows.
