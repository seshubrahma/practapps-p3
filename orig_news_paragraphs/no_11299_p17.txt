Back in May 1994, writing about the 1978 Hillary Clinton cattle deals, the Washington Postâ€™s Charles Babcock detailed exactly how suspect the deals were. " Hillary Rodham Clinton was allowed to order 10 cattle futures contracts, normally a $12, 000 investment, in her first commodity trade in 1978 although she had only $1, 000 in her account at the time, according to trade records the White House released yesterday," Babcock wrote in the Post on May 27, 1994.   The computerized records of her trades, which the White House obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, show for the first time how she was able to turn her initial investment into $6, 300 overnight.
