Mr. Kushner, 35, who married Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka in 2009, is closer to Mr. Trump than any other adviser, a steady and stabilizing presence inside an often chaotic transition team who has provided input on most of his   ’s most consequential hiring and firing decisions. Mr. Trump described Mr. Kushner as "a tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition" in a statement issued early Monday evening announcing an appointment that perhaps more than any other defines the way the incoming president will govern. Mr. Kushner plans to sell some of his real estate holdings and other assets, his lawyer said. Some ethics experts have questioned whether the appointment will be legal under federal   laws designed to prevent family ties from influencing the functioning of the United States government.
