A. programs, including the   Clean Power Program, climate partnership programs with local governments, Energy Star grants to encourage efficiency research in consumer products and   research. Those would be part of a broader budget submission that would cut the E. P. A. ’s funding by 25 percent, to around $6. 1 billion from $8. 2 billion, and its staff by 20 percent. " If the goal is to fulfill the president’s campaign promises and implement his agenda, there is no value in staying in Paris," said Thomas J. Pyle, an adviser to the Trump transition and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have worked for years to undermine   policies.
