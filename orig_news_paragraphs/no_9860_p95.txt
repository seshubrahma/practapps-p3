Claims that German police are n’t sure they arrested the right suspect, German media sources reported this morning police had arrested a    Pakistani male and were treating him as their prime suspect. Now Germany’s Welt reports there is some doubt they have the right man, citing unnamed "high ranking security" sources. This source told the paper: "We have the wrong man  …     the real culprit is still armed and at large, and can cause more damage".
