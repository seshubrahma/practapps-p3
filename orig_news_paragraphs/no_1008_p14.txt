While traveling back to Iran is costly, many Iranians in the United States consider themselves obligated to do so, not only to visit relatives but also to keep their children connected to Persian culture.

He is a green card holder and had planned to go back this week to try to sell his house and to celebrate the holiday with his sisters.
