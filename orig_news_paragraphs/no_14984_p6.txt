Law enforcement officials told CNN Friday there is no indication the FBI is interested in talking to Flynn again or giving him any kind of immunity. The FBI has already talked to him and nothing at this point to indicate anything has changed or that they reached out to talk to him again. Any decision to offer Flynn immunity would come from US Attorneys and Department of Justice, not the FBI, officials explained. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Friday that Trump believes Flynn should testify before lawmakers and "get the story out" about his ties to Russia.
