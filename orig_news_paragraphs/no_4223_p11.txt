Lighthizer expressed gratitude that he had been chosen to serve the president on the important issue of international trade. He added: I further believe that when my grandchildren, who are here today, talk to their grandchildren, they will say that President Trump permanently reversed the dangerous trajectory of American trade, put America first, made our farmers, ranchers, and workers richer and the country safer. And I hope I can make some small contribution to that accomplishment. Several members of Lighthizerâ€™s family were in attendance for the ceremony, including children and grandchildren.
