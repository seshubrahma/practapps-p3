a second hearing before the Finance Committee, which will formally vote to send his nomination to the floor, is not a scheduled yet.   Other nominees who have been criticized by Democrats but who seem to have safe GOP support are Treasury Department nominee Steve Mnuchin and Environmental Protection Agency pick Scott Pruitt. They both have hearings scheduled this week.   Even if their respective committees clear them right away, Democrats are likely to object to voting on confirmation Friday.
