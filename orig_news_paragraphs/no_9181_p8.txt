While Romney campaigned with Kasich in Ohio, he did not endorse him, and it is unclear if he will choose to strategically campaign with Cruz, who was leading both Trump and Kasich in a February poll taken there prior to Sen. Marco Rubioâ€™s withdrawal from the race. Presumably, Cruz is the favorite to win more than a majority of the votes in the Utah caucus, a form of delegate selection where he has historically performed better than Trump. Note, for instance, the recent huge Cruz victories in two caucus states, Kansas and Wyoming. But Ohio Governor John Kasich, the third candidate remaining in the race, has made it clear he intends to compete in Utah, with several town halls already scheduled there for March 18.
