A sour article in the New York Times Tuesday described the minority leader as "a symbol of what went wrong" with the Democratic Party. As a wealthy San Francisco septuagenarian, Pelosi has become a lightning rod in a Party that "failed to offer a compelling,   economic message to the   voters in the Midwest and South," the Times reported. " If you were a big company and you were posting loss after loss after loss, the head of that company is not going to stay around too long," said Pelosiâ€™s fellow Democratic Representative Kathleen Rice of New York.
