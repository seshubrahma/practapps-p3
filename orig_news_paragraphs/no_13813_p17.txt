What’s especially unfair about this is the federal tax code does not account for cost of living, which is highest in the elite coastal cities.    Someone making $90, 000 in Houston would have to pull in $162, 000 to live as well in San Francisco, according to BankRate’s calculator.   Yet, all else being equal, the San Franciscan pays far more taxes to the federal government than the Houstonian. There’s no reason why   states can’t get together and solve problems, including local challenges and international ones like climate change.
