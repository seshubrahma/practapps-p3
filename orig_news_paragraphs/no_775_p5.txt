Viewpoint discrimination by the government in a public forum is almost always unconstitutional. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Friday barred journalists from The New York Times, BuzzFeed News, CNN, The Los Angeles Times, Politico, the BBC and The Huffington Post from a daily briefing. Aides to Mr. Spicer admitted only reporters from a group of news organizations that, the White House said, had been previously confirmed. After the session, Mr. Spicer’s deputy said all White House journalists were represented by the small, rotating press pool that covers the president’s daily movements and shares its reporting with the rest of the press corps, and that Mr. Spicer had merely opted to add a few other organizations to that group.
