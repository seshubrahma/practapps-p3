As Breitbart Texas reported, Los Zetas went on to become an independent cartel responsible for mass exterminations and running clandestine crematoriums in the Mexican state of Coahuila. Hundreds of innocent victims were kidnapped, tortured, murdered and incinerated.   It wasnâ€™t until 2006 when a new president, Felipe Calderon, took office that drug cartels became a priority. Because of the high levels of corruption in Mexican law enforcement, Calderon was forced to use the Mexican Navy to spearhead his campaign against drug cartels.
