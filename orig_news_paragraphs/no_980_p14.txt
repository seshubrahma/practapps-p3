The two main floors of the show, five and six, each begin with a large figurative painting. On the fifth floor, Dana Schutzâ€™s "Elevator," commissioned by the museum, is a weak, scattered reprise of a smaller, better painting in her last gallery show. Two smaller Schutz works here are stronger: "Shame," a study in contorted female   and especially "Open Casket," based on a famous photograph of Emmett Till, young, murdered and disfigured, in his coffin.
