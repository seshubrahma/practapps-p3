 (CNN) 2016 was supposed to be the presidential election where big money didn’t matter.   After all, the    campaign of Jeb Bush’s Super PAC, with its   budget, was far less than awesome.   Bernie Sanders raised tens of millions of dollars in very small donations (recall his constant refrain that the average donation he received was $27).   And Donald Trump’s major selling point was that he was   his campaign (which was not really true) and too rich to be bought anyway, leaving big donors on the sidelines.
