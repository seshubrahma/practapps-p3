According to Beijing Foreign Studies University’s Professor of International News Zhan Jiang, "The government is still working out how to react to him, which is why in this case they are taking very close control of the media for this event. " He also called the new President "unpredictable," and said that he has a "less friendly attitude" than former President Barack Obama. The one thing that China’s   media did choose to emphasize was the cost of the inauguration event, at about $100 million.
