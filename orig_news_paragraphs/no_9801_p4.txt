Kasich brushed off the endorsement, telling reporters Friday in Orem that Romney is entitled to his opinion that voting for Cruz could deny Trump the GOP nomination. But the Ohio governor said the election "is not a parlor game," and he contends that he is the Republican best suited to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in November. Romney, who has made Utah his adopted home, said Friday that he plans to vote for Cruz in the stateâ€™s Tuesday caucuses. He made the announcement on his official Facebook page as Kasich was speaking to about 600 people during a town hall at Utah Valley University.
