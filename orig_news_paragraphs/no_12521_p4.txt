I’m talking about the rising tide of Islamic immigration. This is a difficult subject, and one that many Europeans don’t want to talk or think about, for fear of being branded racist or bigoted. But, to my mind, it’s the most important dimension of the referendum, easily eclipsing questions about GDP, import tariffs and even national sovereignty. Europe has bent over backwards to accommodate Muslims, hoping with every placation that Muslims will integrate with their host cultures.
