—   economics and technological advances are bound to shape the country’s energy landscape despite Mr. Trump’s very different blueprint. Nothing has changed that landscape more than cheap natural gas, and improved drilling techniques in shale fields from Pennsylvania to Texas are driving down production costs to the point where gas supplies are growing and prices continue to slump. " If the Clean Power Plan is reneged upon, I don’t think you will see utilities going back to investing in coal because they have already reduced their infrastructure and they already have commitments geared toward natural gas," said Tamar Essner, an energy analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services.
