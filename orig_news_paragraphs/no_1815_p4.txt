If Mrs. Clinton has aimed to stifle interest in her emails, Mr. Trump has seized on Mr. Comeyâ€™s announcement with exuberant glee. At a rally on Sunday in Colorado, Mr. Trump called the disclosure a "big bombshell" and predicted it would lift him in the polls. Having spent months criticizing both Mr. Comey and the Department of Justice for deciding not to press charges against Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server, Mr. Trump redirected his attack on Sunday, going after Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Mr. Trump accused Ms. Lynch of corruption for failing to indict Mrs. Clinton, claiming without evidence that Ms. Lynch had likely interfered with an investigation in the hope of retaining her job in a Clinton administration.
