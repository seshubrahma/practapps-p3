The election committee is tasked with choosing the next chief executive.   It’s been described as being broadly representative, but it is dominated by   interest.    The vote is set to take place on March 26th, and if no single candidate emerges with 600 votes in round one, it then moves to round two, a runoff vote between the top two candidates.   That’s widely expected to be Lam and John Tsang, the former financial secretary of Hong Kong.
