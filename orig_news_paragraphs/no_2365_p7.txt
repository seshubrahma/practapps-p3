The 168 committee members representing state delegations would have to hold a vote and, as Mr. Trump did at the convention in Cleveland, the new nominee would need to win at least 1, 237 delegates to become the party’s  . Mr. Trump and the   nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, are already on the ballots across the country, and Mr. Ginsberg said that swapping the nominee would require a dizzying amount of litigation to try to get states to add someone else’s name and reprint their ballots. Adding to the complexity is the fact that early and absentee voting has started in many places and, presumably, many ballots have been cast for Mr. Trump. Mr. Ginsberg says that the laws are murky here, with voters technically picking "electors" who are bound in some states to whoever is the nominee and in other states to the specific candidates.
