The situation these officers were confronted with was critical, a matter of life and death. Three armed men, wearing what appeared to be suicide belts, had already attacked and killed members of the public and had to be stopped immediately," he said. Rowley paid tribute to a transport police officer who ran toward the assailants armed only with his baton. He also confirmed that a member of the public suffered a gunshot wound during the shooting.
