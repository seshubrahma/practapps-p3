Not surprising. But at least one of this yearâ€™s moderators, Chris Wallace of Fox News, said the same thing, as have some     graybeards like the former PBS anchor Jim Lehrer, once a regular debate moderator himself. That treats falsehood like a hockey puck being moved up and down the ice, and forces each candidate into goalie pads. What this political season really needs is a confident and credible referee, or a few thousand.
