, Faye Dunaway mistakenly named "La La Land" best picture at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday night, but in reality "Moonlight" won the top prize. The producers of "La La Land" were still thanking their families and fellow artists when the interjection came that "Moonlight" had in fact won, as everyone wondered if that was a joke. But it wasnâ€™t, and the "La La Land" people quickly exited the stage as producers and stars of "Moonlight," just as stunned as everyone else, walked on. Warren Beatty and Ms. Dunaway had presented the best picture award.
