Fordham University law professor Thomas H. Lee told Breitbart News on Monday that Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) is "probably" eligible to run for president â€”  but not because his mother was a U. S. citizen.   According to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution, Lee argues, and existing British common law at the time of the Constitution, Cruz would need to have inherited U. S. citizenship from his father to qualify as "natural born" after being born abroad. Lee published an   in the Los Angeles Times on Sunday arguing that Cruz would be eligible under liberal theories of interpretation of the Constitution, but not under the originalist theory to which he [Cruz] himself subscribes. That conclusion is at odds with what most originalists have argued, citing the definition of "natural born citizen" used by the First Congress.
