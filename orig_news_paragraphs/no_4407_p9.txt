Then there is the huge public health impact of refugees, again particularly from these six countries in the Middle East. Breitbart News has reported, for instance, that the number of cases of active TB from refugees during the four year period from 2012 to 2015 exceeded 1, 500: The increase in the number of refugees diagnosed with active TB from 358 in 2012 to 409 in 2015 was partially responsible for the increase in the total number of   cases of active TB increased from 6, 274 to 6, 350 during those four years. Other categories of   cases of TB that increased included those who arrived under regular immigrant visas, which increased from 1, 437 in 2012 to 1, 670 in 2015,  those who arrived in the "other" category, which includes illegal immigrants (called "undocumented immigrants" in the CDC reports) which increased from 1, 312 in 2012 to 1, 408 in 2015, and those who arrived under student visas, which increased from 158 in 2012 to 191 in 2015.    TB cases as a percentage of all TB cases diagnosed in the United States increased from 63. 1 percent in 2012 to 66.
