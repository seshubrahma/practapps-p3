Curiously, much of the protest in New York this afternoon revolved around a soccer team, with many of the organisers wearing "New York Cosmos" apparel and waving "AntiFa" ( ) banners. The early crowds were very clearly mostly people of Latin American backgrounds, chanting in Spanish, a bunches of young women wearing hijabs. Then came the revolutionary socialists. One woman told me she would abolish the presidency and have the United States run as a Soviet,   country.
