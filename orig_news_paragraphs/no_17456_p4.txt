Since 2003, China has staged a spacewalk, landed a rover on the moon and launched a space lab that it hopes paves the way for a   space station. It has also sent five crews into space in the same span of time, making it only the third country in the world    after Russia and the United States    with such success. Moonshot, Wu told reporters China is still studying the possibility of sending a man to the moon, but focusing on robotic lunar missions for now, including making the first soft landing on the far side of the moon around 2018. He also emphasized Chinaâ€™s increasing cooperation with other international space agencies    with NASA being the exception.
