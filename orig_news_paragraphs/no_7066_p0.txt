For First Lady Melania Trump, summertime means bright, sophisticated ensembles fit for visits to a presidential retreat or for meetings with foreign leaders. [In her and President Donald Trumpâ€™s first trip to Camp David over the weekend, Melania opted for casual attire, pairing her famous tousled locks with a Gabriela Hearst   poplin dress.   In her   statement piece, Melania wrapped a brown leather belt around the dress and added dark shades and pointed brown leather flats.   Returning back from their Camp David weekend, Melania showed off her fashion muscles, as she clutched a $3, 400 Celine bag paired with $795 Manolo Blahnik Lauratopri stilettos.
