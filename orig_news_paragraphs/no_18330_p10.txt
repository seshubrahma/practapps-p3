Yates met with McGahn again on January 27, during which McGahn   asked her why the DOJ cared if "one White House official lied to   another. " He also wanted to know if the Department of Justice was   pursuing a criminal case against Flynn, and expressed concern   that firing Flynn could "interfere with the FBI taking action   against" him. McGahn also asked Yates to see the DOJ’’s evidence   of Flynn’’s conversations with Kislyak.
