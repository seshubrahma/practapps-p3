[The Hampton University Center for Public Policy (CPP) poll out on Wednesday afternoon shows that Trump has taken a   lead over Clinton in the Old Dominion, inside the poll’s margin of error of 4. 57 percent. The survey of 802 Virginians, taken from Oct. 26 through Oct. 30 —  meaning it was conducted both before and after the FBI announced its reopening of the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s illicit home brew email server —  found Trump at 44 percent and Clinton at 41 percent.
