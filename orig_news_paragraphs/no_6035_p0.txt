Wednesday on ESPN Radio’s "The Dan Le Batard Show," host Dan Le Batard addressed the accusations that his employer has a liberal bias after the show interviewed 2017 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner host and "The Daily Show" correspondent Hasan Minhaj.   Le Batard responded to the complaints, saying people are "bothered" by ESPN having minorities with strong voices like Stephen A. Smith, Jemele Hill and Bomani Jones because they come with different voices and opinions. " Many of you are inevitably complaining that we talked to a ‘Daily Show’ correspondent and we talked politics, allegedly," Le Batard said.
