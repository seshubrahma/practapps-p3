So when we say that we think Mrs. Clinton has a 14 percent chance of winning North Dakota, we mean that, judging from how the polling averages have moved in previous election cycles, candidates in Mrs. Clintonâ€™s position have won in one in seven similar situations in past elections. Of course, there is no guarantee that this election will turn out the way that elections have in the past, a flaw that is common to any forecasting model. These numbers are our best guesses using the information we have. Expect shifts.
