We can write laws. But at the end of the   day, I actually wonder what the board was doing. What had the   board been doing when they see these things happening. I mean,   you can write a law that says you cannot provide incentives for   the openings of accounts, but I think it gets to be a deeper   issue of the value structure of any organization and the value of   its leaders.
