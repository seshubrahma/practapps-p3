The following morning, Johnson sought to deflect the moment with a piece of good news. The Detroit News officially issued its presidential endorsement, backing Johnson over Trump or Hillary Clinton. This was the first time the paper’s   editorial board had not endorsed the Republican candidate for president since the paper’s founding in 1873. The Detroit News wrote its endorsement before Johnson’s MSNBC appearance, but representatives for the paper appeared on CNN Thursday and said they stood by their endorsement regardless.
