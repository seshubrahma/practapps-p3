As the US prepared for the possibility of war against France, President John Adams and the   Congress enacted a series of laws that tightened citizenship restriction laws for immigrants and empowered the government to imprison and detain citizens who were seen as dangerous. The target of the laws was the opposition party, then called the   Party, as much as any real or external threat. During the Civil War, one of President Lincolnâ€™s most controversial decisions was to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, which allowed for the indefinite detention of "disloyal persons" without any trial, in response to unrest in the border states.   During World War I, the federal government and citizen vigilante groups rounded up German immigrants who had come from a country which was then fighting against the United States.
