Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley announced he expects the committee will vote on Gorsuch’s nomination April 3. The nominee himself    who remained steadfastly polite throughout the hearings    interrupted the final round of questions to ask if he could say his "thank yous" before any senators had to leave early. Gorsuch recalled individual meetings he held with 72 senators over the past six weeks and thanked the lawmakers for their "courtesies." "I wish the American people could see what I’ve seen," he said.
