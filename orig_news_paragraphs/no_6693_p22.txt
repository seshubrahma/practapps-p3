ISIS remains the primary target of U. S. and Kurdish military activity in the region. The group has committed acts of genocide against Shiites, Christians, and Yezidis destroyed museums full of priceless ancient artifacts as a protest against "idolatry" forced an untold number of girls and women into sex slavery and slave marriages and crucified, tortured, and brainwashed Sunnis, adults and children alike, as a mode of imposing its interpretation of Sharia law. The Islamic State still controls Raqqa, Syria and Mosul, Iraq, but has lost much of its territory in the region. Meanwhile, it has expanded its reach into Libya, Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Europe.
