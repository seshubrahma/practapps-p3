Even at the height of Holocaust, as millions of Jews, homosexuals, political dissidents and others were exterminated, the US kept its doors shut.   The Refugee Convention of 1951 arose from the ashes of the Holocaust to ensure that never again would the world turn refugees over to their executioners. How ironically tragic that Trump has chosen to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day by once again derailing America’s commitment to refugee protection.   Trump’s decision to pause an already secure program in the name of security is simply playing on public fear, vilifying refugees as dangerous just like America did in the 1930s and 1940s, when Jews from Germany and Austria were deemed as "security threats."
