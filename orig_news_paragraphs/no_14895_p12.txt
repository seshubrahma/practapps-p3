The Musudan is a   ballistic missile with a range of 2, 500 to 4, 000 kilometers (1, 500 to 2, 500 miles) far enough to reach Japan or Guam.   Two missiles, thought to be Musudans, failed to launch successfully within one week in October.   The previous June, of two missiles launched, one didnâ€™t make it further than 150 kilometers (93 miles). The other flew 400 kilometers (250 miles) before falling into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, which North Korea claimed was a success.
