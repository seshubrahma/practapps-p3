Our movement desperately needs a new generation of fighters and activists to come forward now and develop as independent political leaders for the movement. By learning from struggle, drawing political lessons from history, and utilizing the method and tactics that assert our collective power, a new generation of leaders can ensure our movementâ€™s victory. The fascists exploit the discontent and economic hardship experienced by white, downwardly mobile   and   youth. They offer fake, radical sounding solutions to the growing problems of unemployment, poverty and economic insecurity in the U. S. today.
