As Newsweek reported in February of 2015, immigration is "the sole factor for the rise in numbers": More than half a million women and girls in the U. S. are at risk of undergoing FGM in the U. S. or abroad, or have already undergone the procedure, including 166, 173 under the age of 18, according to the Population Reference Bureau (PRB). Immigration to the U. S. from African and Middle Eastern countries —  where the practice of FGM is a deeply entrenched cultural tradition —   is the sole factor for the rise in numbers, says Mark Mather, a demographer at PRB who led the data analysis. There has not been an increase in the practice happening in the U. S. itself, he says  …     African immigration to the U. S. has doubled every decade since 1970, with more than 1. 8 million   people now living in the U. S. according to Census data.
