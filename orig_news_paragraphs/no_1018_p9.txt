Dina Powell, Mr. Trump’s senior counselor for economic initiatives, has been named the deputy national security adviser for strategy to spearhead the preparation of policy options and oversee their execution once Mr. Trump decides on them. Nadia Schadlow, a former Pentagon official and the author of a recent book that examined cases in which the United States Army intervened abroad, was hired to draft a security strategy. In the past, that document has often been little more than a rehash of the White House’s policies, but for a Trump administration struggling to translate its promise to "make America great again" into a coherent foreign and economic agenda, it might emerge as an important statement. How General McMaster will navigate rival centers of power within the White House that have their own   views on security policy remains to be seen.
