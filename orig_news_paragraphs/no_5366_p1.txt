As participants follow in the footsteps of our new president and vice president down Pennsylvania Avenue, they will be adding their names to the long list of Americans who have honored our country by marching in the inaugural parade," Armstrong said. In addition to the Border Patrol Pipes and Drums Corps, parade participants include high school and university marching bands, equestrian corps, first responders, and veterans groups, she said. Trump and Pence will be sworn in on the West Front of the United States Capitol. Joining them will be their families, members of Congress, the U. S. Supreme Court, Diplomatic Corps and other distinguished invited guests.
