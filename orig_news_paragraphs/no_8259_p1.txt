The "strong" numbers are especially important, because they suggest how many people will make up their mind based on that issue. That’s to Trump’s advantages, because his "strong" numbers are 38 percent support to 15 percent strong opposition. Among actual immigrants, his strong numbers are above     —   or 31 percent strong support to 12 percent strong opposition. So he’s got 61 strong or "somewhat" support from actual immigrants, compared to just 29 percent strong and somewhat opposition.
