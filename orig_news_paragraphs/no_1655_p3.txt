Mr. Johnson said his speech was part of a sustained outreach effort that has taken him from the suburbs of Washington to Minneapolis to Los Angeles, where he has met with community leaders and visited mosques, while fielding questions about racial profiling and   speech on the presidential campaign trail. In his address, Mr. Johnson told the audience that their lives were "the quintessential American story. " He listed the contributions of   American Muslims, such as the boxer Muhammad Ali and Dalilah Muhammad, who won a gold medal in the   hurdles last month at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and said they were not just Muslim heroes, but American heroes.
