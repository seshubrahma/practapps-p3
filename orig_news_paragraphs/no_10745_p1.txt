The victim told police that a man in a compact car first began yelling at him from the street and then began to follow him in the vehicle. Soon, the suspect stopped his car, jumped out, and began to harass the man as he continued toward the restaurant. " The motorist inquired why (the man) was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him," Bloomfield Police spokesman Ralph Marotti told the media.
