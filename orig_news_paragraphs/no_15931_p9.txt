Leon Panetta, who served as Secretary of Defense under President Obama between 2011 and 2013, noted that "we have sanctions in place," adding that "they could be enforced in a more vigorous way by ourselves as well as the Chinese."   Panetta said that in the wake of Warmbier’s death, the Trump administration’s options include demanding an explanation from China, diplomatic protests, and increased sanctions. " This is not acceptable and the Chinese government needs to find out what happened," Panetta told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.
