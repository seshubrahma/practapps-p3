The special counsel investigating possible ties   between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia’s government   has taken over a separate criminal probe involving former Trump   campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and may expand his inquiry to   investigate the roles of the attorney general and deputy attorney   general in the firing of FBI Director James Comey, The Associated   Press has learned. " "   The Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Manafort,   who was forced to resign as Trump campaign chairman in August   amid questions over his business dealings years ago in Ukraine,   predated the 2016 election and the counterintelligence probe that   in July began investigating possible collusion between Moscow and   associates of Trump. " "    The move to consolidate the matters, involving allegations of   kleptocracy of Ukrainian government funds, indicates that Special   Counsel Robert Mueller is assuming a broad mandate in his new   role running the sensational investigation.
