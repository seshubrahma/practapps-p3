10 a. m. Wednesday Thursday before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (delayed by one day after originally being scheduled for Wednesday) Tillerson won’t be the only nominee whose hearing will be dominated by Russia. Kansas GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo, Trump’s pick to lead the CIA, will also face questions about Trump’s relationship with the intelligence community in the wake of his public criticism of its conclusions on Russia’s hacking of the US election.   Expect Democrats to open fronts on torture, transparency, surveillance and unfiltered,   assessments.
