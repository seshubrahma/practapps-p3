Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump privately told congressional leaders Monday he wants to move forward with an ambitious agenda, including to repeal and replace Obamacare and to pass legislation bolstering the country’s infrastructure. But he also brought up two past grievances    mentioning his inauguration crowd size and reiterating an unsubstantiated claim that   million illegal votes cost him the popular vote, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. The meeting    with the top eight House and Senate leaders from both parties    was mostly social, barely touched on the issues and didn’t go into much detail about Trump’s policy preferences, Democratic Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer told CNN’s Erin Burnett on "OutFront" shortly after the meeting.
