Although portrayed by the Soviets as an "independent"   "think tank," the Institute of the USA and Canada has been widely identified as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy influence. Located in Moscow, the IUSAC is nominally under the direction of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In practice, however, it operates under the direction of the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee. According to the testimony of John McMahon, then deputy director of Central Intelligence (during the House Selected Committee on Intelligence Hearings on Soviet Active Measures in 1982) the International Department "directs Western dialogue activities of Soviet organizations such as the   Institute" with a view toward influencing Western perceptions of peace and disarmament.
