Saturday on MSNBCâ€™s "AM Joy," MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance argued that President Donald Trump "never promised democracy" in the election, and instead "always promised autocracy. "   " Vladimir Putin views Donald Trump as an ally because he intends to establish a series of global autocracies and link the world through autocracy, not through the old communism that he was brought up with, " Nance said to host Joy Reid.
