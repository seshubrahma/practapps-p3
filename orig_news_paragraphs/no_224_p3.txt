The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson," opening on Friday at the Morgan Library  Museum. The show is one of the largest gatherings ever of prime Dickinson relics, and it comes with an aura the size of a city block. It instantly turns the Morgan into a pilgrimage site, a literary Lourdes, a place to come in contact with one aspect of American culture that truly can claim greatness, which we sure can use in an   political moment. The show has a mission: To give   audiences a fresh take on Dickinson.
