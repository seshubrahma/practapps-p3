I didn’t consider myself that much of a "party decides" disciple at the beginning of the race, but I was sure of one thing: It would be extraordinarily hard to win if a candidate were deemed unacceptable by the party’s elected officials, donors and operatives. Such a candidate would lack the resources and staff to run an effective campaign. He or she would face both a chorus of vocal opposition from credible leaders and a   fight to the end. In the end, Mr. Trump didn’t face many of the challenges that outsiders usually do.
