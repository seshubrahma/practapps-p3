Presumed Republican nominee Donald Trump responded to Sen. Lindsey Graham’s ( ) earlier statement on Friday that he wouldn’t support Trump in the general election. ["I fully understand why Lindsey Graham cannot support me. If I got beaten as badly as I beat him, and all the other candidates he endorsed, I would not be able to give my support either," Trump stated.   Every time I see Lindsey Graham spew hate during interviews I ask why the media never questions how I single handily destroyed his hapless run for President.
