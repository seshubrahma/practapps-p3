Before he became a national political figure, most Americans were unaware of the fact that Trumpâ€™s businesses had lost at least $1 billion and perhaps as much as $6 billion during a business career he claimed was a brilliant success. The money was supplied by investors and, since it was filtered through corporation, Trump was never held personally accountable. He has avoided acknowledging the pain he inflicted on people he bullied in real estate deals or cheated with exploits like the   Trump University.
