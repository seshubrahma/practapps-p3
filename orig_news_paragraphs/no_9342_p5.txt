Romney stumped for both Rubio and Kasich ahead of the March 15 Florida and Ohio primaries with robocalls for each and an   appearance for Kasich. Rubio suffered a crushing loss in his home state of Florida while Kasich secured his first and only win in his home state of Ohio. Despite Romney’s highly publicized speech urging American voters to support the candidate that "has the best chance to beat Mr. Trump in any given state" he backed Kasich and Rubio before Trump’s consistently closest competitor Cruz. Cruz did not appear to utilize the 2012 nominee in campaigning ahead of the March 15 pivotal primary contests.
