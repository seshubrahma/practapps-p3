In Iowa, where early voting began September 29, more than twice as many registered Democrats have cast votes so far as Republicans, even though Republicans have a slight edge in party registration overall in the state. But the Democrats edge in returned ballots is not quite as large as it was at this point in the campaign in 2012, when votes cast by registered Democrats outweighed Republicans by a nearly    margin. But the partisan pattern is not the same in every battleground state. In North Carolina, where about 22, 000 votes have been cast, those from registered Democrats only narrowly outpace those from registered Republicans, though Democrats have a nearly    advantage in party registration overall.
