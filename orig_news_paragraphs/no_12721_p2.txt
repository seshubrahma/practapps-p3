On Feb. 27 the group released a communiqué that committed the group to go beyond their own   monetary policies to pursue "enhanced structural reforms" to "foster confidence and preserve and strengthen the recovery the global economy. " "Enhanced structural reforms" are code words for central bankers demanding that governments restructure their economies to cut subsidies and curtail deficit spending. The joint communiqué also repeated the G20 participants’ repeated pledges to not engage in competitive currency devaluations, and promised to "consult closely" on currency exchange rate markets. The issue has become politicized after U. S. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump called for up to 45 percent tariffs on Chinese goods if China does not stop allowing its yuan currency to devalue.
