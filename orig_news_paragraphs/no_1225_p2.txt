How did you get interested in environment and climate change issues? Air pollution was the issue that first alerted me to the importance of taking bold action to protect Parisians. Pollution created by heavy traffic has always been a challenge for big cities like Paris. When I was a deputy mayor between 2001 and 2008, Paris made a lot of progress by creating the Vélib’ bike sharing system, one of the first in any major city in the world, and the Autolib’ electric car hire system.
