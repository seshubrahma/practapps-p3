Hours after the call with Xi, Trump wrapped Abe in a hug and shook his hand for a full 19 seconds in the Oval Office. He renewed US security guarantees to Japan and stressed the importance of stationing American troops in the East Asian country, despite saying during his campaign that Tokyo should pay more for US protection and perhaps get its own nuclear weapons. " It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities," Trump said alongside Abe at a White House news conference Friday.
