The United States faces a similarly complex set of overlapping conflicts in Syria, where a brutal civil war opened up opportunities for Al Qaeda to infiltrate the rebels seeking to topple the government while the Islamic State seized an area of territory that extended over the border into Iraq. While intervening covertly to support the rebels, the United States has ordered airstrikes on the jihadists  â€”   alone in the case of Al Qaeda and as part of a coalition against the Islamic State. It has also built ties with the Iraqi security forces, and with Kurdish and Arab fighters in Syria to battle the jihadists on the ground. But recently, a string of airstrikes have exposed the United States to allegations of killing large numbers of civilians.
