Early this month, a new report from the U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) component of DHS revealed that border apprehensions had plummeted by more than 60 percent since Trump took office. Breitbart Texas reported: Border apprehensions steadily increased in the nine months leading up to the presidential election in November, reaching a peak of 66, 710 in October 2016. Since President Trumpâ€™s election on November 8, each month shows a decline in apprehension. The two full months following the inauguration show a dramatic drop to levels not seen in the past five years.
