 (CNN) Ohio Gov. John Kasich is tentatively slated to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, three sources familiar with the plan told CNN Monday.   A Kasich adviser said the White House didnâ€™t offer an explicit agenda for the meeting. A senior administration official said the meeting is still tentative but is likely to be a private sitdown between Kasich, the President and possibly Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.
