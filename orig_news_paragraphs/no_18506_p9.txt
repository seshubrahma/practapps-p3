Trump   seemed to blame the DOJ for the "politically correct" revised   version of the order, which Trump himself signed, posting that   the Justice Department "should have stayed with the original   Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version   they submitted" to the Supreme Court. ’ ’    The Times reported that Trump "has intermittently fumed for   months over" Sessions’’ recusal from all Russia matters, citing   individuals close to the president. That recusal is connected "in   some way" to "much of the past two months of discomfort and     pain for Trump," the Times wrote.
