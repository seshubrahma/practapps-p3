Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said Tuesday that it would be an "enormous mistake" if Republicans elect Donald Trump as their nominee. ["For any candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning who has not won any states, for any candidate who wakes up tomorrow morning who has a negligible number of delegates, I think itâ€™s time to start thinking about coming together and unifying and presenting a clear choice," he said. " I believe it would be an enormous mistake to nominate Donald Trump, so I speak to unity for Republicans. "
