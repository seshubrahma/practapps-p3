The numbers that are top of mind   for me: There were about 1. 2 billion international trips last   year. We think that will grow to 2 billion in the next decade or   so. Our estimates are that a job will be created for every 30   trips. Thatâ€™s 25 to 30 million new jobs in the travel growth   space alone.
