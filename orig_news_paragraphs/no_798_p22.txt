Mr. Fillon said angrily that the presidential election was being "assassinated," and he announced his determination to stay in it, because "only the voters can decide who will be president. " The judicial screws have been steadily tightening on Mr. Fillon since newspaper reports in January  —   especially those in the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaîné  —   said that for years he and his deputy had paid his wife hundreds of thousands of euros in state funds for a possible   job, and that his children had also benefited from the largess of Mr. Fillon, a former prime minister. In addition, Mr. Fillon is being scrutinized on suspicion of trafficking a high civilian honor, while prime minister, in exchange for money to his wife from a wealthy publisher friend.
