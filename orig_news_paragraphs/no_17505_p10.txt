Of her declared challengers so far, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont appears to pose the greatest challenge, gaining momentum in polls as a liberal challenger. But when he’s included in surveys, Biden still holds a consistent second place to Clinton, even as other candidates join the race. A   survey from late May put Biden at 14% among Democrats    well behind Clinton at 60% but ahead of declared candidates Sanders, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. In the poll, Biden also ranked as the top second choice for Democrats    33% said he was their No. 2 option, ahead of Clinton, Sanders and Webb.
