Washington (CNN) Thousands rallied in Washington Saturday less than a week before   Donald Trump takes office to make clear their opposition to his policies on immigration and social justice. The demonstrations came at two separate events. At Washington’s historic Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, protesters made clear their objections to Trump’s immigration policies, vowing to mobilize the Latino vote in upcoming elections.
