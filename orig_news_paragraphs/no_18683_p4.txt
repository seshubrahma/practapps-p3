John Kasich   —   are hoping to get enough delegates to stop Trump from securing the 1, 237 delegates that he needs to lock up the nomination and avoid a fight at the convention. ’ ’Rubio and Kasich, whose campaigns have lagged in recent contests, are hoping to turn around their campaigns by winning their home states next week. Florida and Ohio are    states, giving the winner of either contest a significant bump in the delegate race.
