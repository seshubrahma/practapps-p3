And, if you support President Donald J. Trump and the State of Israel, do you sign New England Patriots    free agent tight end Martellus Bennett? Not only is Bennett blowing off the Patriots’ White House visit honoring their Super Bowl win, he backed out of a recent NFL goodwill trip to Israel, in part due to pressure from   activists Harry Belafonte, Danny Glover and Angela Davis. The      Bennett is likely headed to his fifth team in 10 years, so clearly there are NFL coaches wary of his locker room lawyer nature. Joining Bennett’s boycott of the Israel trip is Miami Dolphins free agent wide receiver Kenny Stills.
