In many safe conservative districts, House Freedom Caucus members ran ahead of Trump’s numbers in their   races last year, raising doubts about the extent of the President’s leverage. A prominent member of the House Freedom Caucus warned Trump to be careful. " I hope the President will bear in mind that the freedom caucus is going to provide the bulwark of the support the President needs on things like border security, trade agreements and making sure that the   Partnership does not resurface in a different shape or fashion," Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks told CNN.
