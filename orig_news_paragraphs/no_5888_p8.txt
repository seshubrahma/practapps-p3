Congressional Review Act. Trump used a    law, passed by President Bill Clinton but rarely used since, that allows Congress to repeal regulations within a   window. Because many of the Obama administrationâ€™s regulations had not been reported to Congress, the   window had not begun for them, and so Congress could repeal them. Trump signed repeal bills for 13 regulations issued under Obama, rolling back the administrative state.
