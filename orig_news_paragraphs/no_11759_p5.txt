Some of the world’s leading publications  —   including The New York Times  —   extolled the virtues of the Iran deal even though it never even punished the Iranian regime for being in constant violation of the 1948 UN   Convention which expressly forbids genocidal incitement. Even the ADL opposed the Iran deal and Breitbart stood with the   community in making the argument against an agreement that legally gives Iran nuclear weapons in little over a decade. Breitbart also defends Israel constantly against the   BDS movement whose goal is the economic destruction of the State of Israel.
