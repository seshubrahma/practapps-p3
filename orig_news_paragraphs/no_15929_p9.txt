For example, New York City, which now sees about two days per year that cross the threshold, rises to about 50 days per year by 2100. The results paint a grim picture, where entire summers exceed the threshold in warmer and more humid cities like Orlando and Houston. Currently, about 30% of the worldâ€™s population (and about 13% of the land area) experiences at least 20 days per year on which the deadly threshold is reached. By 2100, this percentage jumps to 74% of the population (47% of the land area) if emissions continue unchecked.
