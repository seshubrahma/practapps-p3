Fiorina has been a Cruz supporter for some time, and she recently   her super PAC in an apparent bid to campaign for the vice presidency. Trump and Fiorina rarely got along during the Republican primaries, with Fiorina hitting Trump in a debate for allegedly making sexist remarks about her face. Such a move  —   picking a running mate during the primary  —   has not been seen since Ronald Reagan’s disastrous pick of Pennsylvania senator Richard Schweicker in his failed 1976 attempt to defeat Gerald Ford. Cruz and Fiorina are currently campaigning in Indiana, while Trump tours the state with legendary coach Bobby Knight.
