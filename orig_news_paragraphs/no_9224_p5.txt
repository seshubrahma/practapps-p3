Speaking to Hungarian radio on Friday, Mr. Orban blasted: "Hungarians and Polish people rightfully expect more respect from the actual and the former leaders of the United States. I like what the president of the Polish governing party said, although it is harsh, but his reference to the [Clintonâ€™s] need for medical help made many Hungarian hearts beat [in agreement]. "
