Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Unionâ€™s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, has argued that prosecuting Assange could set a dangerous precedent, "Never in the history of this country has a publisher been prosecuted for presenting truthful information to the public," Wizner told CNN. " Any prosecution of WikiLeaks for publishing government secrets would set a dangerous precedent that the Trump administration would surely use to target other news organizations. "
