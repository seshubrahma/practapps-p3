The original executive order was swiftly blocked nationwide by a federal judge in Seattle, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it, and then the administration spent over a month rewriting it, exempting several categories of foreign travelers and taking care to make no express mention of religion    all in the hopes of avoiding legal scrutiny for a second time around. Yet statements from Trump and his advisers, especially when combined with his continued inclusion of a   ban on foreign nationals from six   countries in the revised executive order, have proved    at least for now    insurmountable in court. The suit in front of the 4th Circuit on Monday was brought by several refugee rights organizations, along with individual plaintiffs who claim the executive order, if allowed to go into effect, would separate them from loved ones abroad. They also claim that the "  animus" underlying the second executive order is readily apparent from the litany of public statements Trump made before and after the presidential campaign.
