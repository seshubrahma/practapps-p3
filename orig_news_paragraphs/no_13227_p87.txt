: On MSNBC, Kevin Cate tells Joy Reid that some voters may just vote for Jeb Bush to spite Rubio on Tuesday. Seems to be a lot of bad blood still between the two camps. Give Joy Reid, who knows Florida’s politics well, for asking Cate if the "first paragraph" in Rubio’s political obituary will be about "immigration" and his support of the Gang of Eight’s amnesty bill. You rarely hear people on   News pointing to immigration as the primary reason that Rubio’s campaign could not get out of the starting gate.
