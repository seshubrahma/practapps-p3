A New York Times article pointed out that an alleged rape in Maryland went "virtually uncovered" on CNN, MSNBC, and most other networks, while Fox News devoted a considerable amount of time covering the incident. [The two alleged rapists, ages 17 and 18, enrolled as freshmen at a public high school in Rockville, Maryland, after federal immigration authorities detained and later released them even though they were in the country illegally, the Baltimore Sun reported.   The suspects allegedly forced a girl to perform oral sex on them in a bathroom stall while they raped and sodomized her, despite her crying out in pain, begging them to stop, police said. Police investigating the incident found blood and DNA at the scene of the crime, Fox DC reported.
