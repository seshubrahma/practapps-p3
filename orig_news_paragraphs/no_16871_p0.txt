Washington (CNN) Actor Robert De Niro, who once portrayed a middleweight champ, is so infuriated by the 2016 Republican presidential candidate that he’d "like to punch Donald Trump in the face."   " It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo, has wound up where he has," said the    who won a best actor Oscar for his role as boxer Jake LaMotta in 1980’s "Raging Bull."
