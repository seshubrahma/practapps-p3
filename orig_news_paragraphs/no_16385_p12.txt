A strategy that exploits their doubts about Trump on economic, cultural and security grounds, combined with solid support from minorities and young voters, could open a broad road to a Democratic victory this fall. A   populism, on the other hand, would put Democrats on a narrower path to the White House, with a slimmer margin of error. Given Trump’s tumble in recent polls, Clinton could conceivably win either way (though no one is counting him out just yet). But she’s not the only Democrat on the ballot this fall.
