Criticized for concealing Mrs. Clinton’s illness, her aides apologized on Monday and promised to release more information about her medical history. Mrs. Clinton canceled trips to California and Nevada this week to rest, but she planned to return to the campaign trail on Thursday. Dr. Bardack’s letter also cast some new light on the persistent cough that Mrs. Clinton complained of before she was found to have pneumonia. Dr. Bardack said she had examined Mrs. Clinton on Sept. 2, a week before the pneumonia diagnosis, after Mrs. Clinton experienced a   fever, congestion and fatigue.
