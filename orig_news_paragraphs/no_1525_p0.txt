CLEVELAND   —   Donald J. Trump’s coronation as the Republican nominee for president Tuesday night was a signal accomplishment not only for the candidate, but also for the man who commands the most important control room in American politics: the Fox News chairman Roger Ailes. Mr. Trump’s convention has been a triumph for Mr. Ailes’s brand of   and "politically incorrect" politics  —   with speakers, themes, rhetoric and, ultimately, a nominee who is far more at home on the set of Fox News than in the establishment halls of Congress, the Republican National Committee or The Weekly Standard. It is, in a way, the most Fox   convention in the network’s history.
