" Milo" became the number one trending topic on Twitter in the U. S. on Thursday, following MILO’s announcement of the book, with its publisher Simon and Schuster reaching the third most trending topic. Since the announcement of Dangerous by MILO, The Chicago Review of Books have also announced that they would boycott every book from publisher Simon and Schuster in 2017 as a protest against the book being published.
