Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who was in Baton Rouge, La. on Friday, also welcomed the decision, saying the law "sent a message that contradicted some of the most basic principles of our democracy. " The ability of Americans to have a voice in the direction of their country  —   to have a fair and free opportunity to help write the story of this nation   —   is fundamental to who we are," she said.
