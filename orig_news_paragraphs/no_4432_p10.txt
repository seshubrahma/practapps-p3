Yes, the National Review writer is right.   We had no confidence that Barack Obama was going to rein in the size and cost of government we would have proudly stood with Jeb Bush if he had a   cabinet.   We would have given a lot of room to a President who had appointed Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, or Scott Pruitt to the EPA or Tom Price to head up HHS. Furthermore, both authors oddly marginalized the Presidentâ€™s   agenda, which includes historic tax cuts, massive regulatory reform, and bold education changes that will affect millions of children across the nation.
