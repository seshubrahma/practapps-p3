" Trump’s taunting of Warren as an Indian comes after Warren ran against Scott Brown in 2012 "when the Boston Herald unearthed that Harvard Law School held up Warren’s ‘Native American background’ as evidence of a diverse hiring pool during her tenure there in the 1990s," Fusion explains. What followed was a   attempt on Warren’s part to creatively have it both ways: while she admitted to listing herself as a minority in a law school directory in order to connect with "people like me" and that being descendant of Native Americans is an "important" part of her heritage, she also claimed to not have used her background for personal gain. And she denied knowing Harvard ever touted her as a minority.
