Washington (CNN) One of   Donald Trump’s top advisers said Sunday that his loyal supporters across the country feel "betrayed" that he is considering one of his most vicious critics, Mitt Romney, for secretary of state.   " I’m all for party unity, but I’m not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position," Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, told CNN’s Dana Bash on "State of the Union."
