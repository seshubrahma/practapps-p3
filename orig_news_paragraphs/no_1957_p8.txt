Prosecutors said Ms. Park was an accomplice in the scheme, directing her aides to help Ms. Choi shake down major corporations like Samsung and Hyundai. But it is Ms. Park’s   relationship with Ms. Choi, who has been described as a "shaman fortuneteller" by opposition politicians, that has enthralled  South Koreans. Ms. Choi’s father, Choi   the founder of the Church of Eternal Life and a   messiah, had been a mentor to Ms. Park. According to a report by the Korean intelligence agency, he approached her after her mother was assassinated in 1974, telling her that her dead mother had spoken to him in his dreams.
