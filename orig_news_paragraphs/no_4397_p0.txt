On Wednesdayâ€™s Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked guest Frank Gaffney about a post he wrote on the Center for Security Policy blog, in which he endorsed a call by Jeanine Pirro of Fox News for House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign following the failure of the House Obamacare replacement bill. [As he wrote in the post, Gaffney stipulated that "health care is not my field, by any means," so he did not mean to criticize the substance of the   House bill.    "I think what is of concern is that this was a doomed approach," he said.
