Conservatives, for far too long, have seen environmentalism as a fringe issue, of little concern to them because it doesn’t impact too obviously on their key area of concern, the economy. They couldn’t be more wrong, as the American example shows: Consider the following ongoing policy battles: the Clean Power Plan, methane regulations, fracking bans, ozone regulations, pipeline blocking, new pipeline regulations, new train regulations, renewable fuel standards, wind production tax credit, solar subsidies, CAFE standards, green building standards, energy efficiency mandates, "green jobs" schemes. All of these policy initiatives were initiated by Democrats, and Democrats are winning on most of them. Even when they "lose," it doesn’t change the trajectory Democrats have an unlimited supply of new     initiatives to propose if the old ones fail.
