Trump needs to get 1, 237 delegates during primary season, which he thinks he can do "fairly easily," in order to win the Republican nomination on the first ballot. If he doesn’t win on the first ballot, then many state delegates on later ballots can be freed from voting with their state and can form alliances to elect an Establishment candidate. John Boehner already said that he would support House Speaker Paul Ryan on a later ballot, and Ryan did not conclusively rule out the idea of accepting a brokered nomination. Trump supporter Chris Christie, who leads the Republican Governors Association, said recently that "I do not want to go back to the days of the 1800s and 1700s  …     where a bunch of, you know, legislators, no offense, pick the United States Senator or pick, you know, who is going to be the Presidential electors.
