Departing occupants of the White House rarely hand off an improving economy to a successor from the opposing party. When Barack Obama was waiting in the wings after the 2008 presidential election, for example, the economy was in a severe downward spiral: Employers reported cutting 533, 000 jobs that November, the biggest monthly loss in a generation. But according to the governmentâ€™s report on Friday, Donald J. Trump can expect to inherit an economy that has added private sector jobs for 80 months, put another 178, 000 people on payrolls last month and pushed the unemployment rate down to 4 . 6 percent today from 4. 9 percent the previous month.
