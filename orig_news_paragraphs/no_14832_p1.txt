Though some national security experts speculated that McFarland would leave following Michael Flynn’s ouster as national security adviser earlier this year, a senior administration official said that she will remain. Politico first reported Powell’s move. The     Powell first came on board Trump’s team after advising his daughter, Ivanka, on women’s empowerment issues, helping her foster relationships with business executives over multiple dinner parties focused on women in the workplace during the presidential transition and after the inauguration.   At 29, Powell was the   assistant to the president for presidential personnel, heading up all of the George W. Bush White House’s decisions on appointments.
