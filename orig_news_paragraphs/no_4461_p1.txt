Despite Sen. Michael Bennet ( ) who told the Colorado Independent that he will not filibuster his fellow Coloradan Gorsuch, and three Democrats who have said they will support Gorsuch, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) now appears to have the votes needed to prevent a vote for cloture and a full Senate vote on Gorsuch’s confirmation under current rules. Senate Democrats changed Senate rules in 2013 to allow a simple majority to trigger a full Senate vote on   Court nominees. Increasing numbers of Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) appear poised to use the same "Constitutional Option" for Supreme Court nominees in order to ensure Gorsuch’s confirmation. During Monday’s final Judiciary Committee meeting on Gorsuch, Sen. Lindsay Graham ( ) reiterated Republican willingness to revert to the constitutional option.
