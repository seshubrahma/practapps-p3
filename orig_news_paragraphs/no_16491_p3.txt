@CNN, she forgot how she said a KKK member was her mentor," Trump tweeted Saturday. Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson    better known as Diamond and Silk, two   sisters supporting Trump who frequently speak at his rallies    confirmed to CNN that the tweet referred to the late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, a former KKK member whom Clinton mourned in 2010 as "a true American original, my friend and mentor." "Donald J. Trump can’t help who embraces his campaign but Hillary Clinton could’ve helped who she embraced," the duo said in a statement to CNN.
