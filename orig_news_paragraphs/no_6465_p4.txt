According to the statement, In 2015, after previously announcing that the statutory cap had been reached, [the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency] determined that more than 5, 000 unused visas were available. Soon thereafter, the agency began accepting applications from businesses still hoping to hire workers through the program. With that in mind, we respectfully request that your office conduct an immediate audit of the number of unused visas from the first half of the fiscal year and project the likely usage rate for the second half of the fiscal year   â€¦      As with prior practice, any unused visas should be provided to eligible businesses that have been unable to secure an adequate number of workers due to the cap.
