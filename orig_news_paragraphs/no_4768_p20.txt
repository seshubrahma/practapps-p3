The Navy did send the USS Carl Vinson to the region for "routine" operations, a move the Chinese government condemned. While the United States has not actively challenged China in the region, Trumpâ€™s ascent has apparently emboldened at least one party to the dispute: the Philippines. Under President Obama, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte insisted he would not challenge China in the region, claiming any military dispute between China and the Philippines would end in disaster for his country. Since Obama, who Duterte referred to as a "son of a whore" on multiple occasions, left office, Duterte has become more of a hawk, urging the United States to participate in   operations in his country and demanding the military build "structures" in the South China Sea to keep China from claiming the territory.
