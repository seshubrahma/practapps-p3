" The genesis of Thursday night’s protest through social media suggests that tensions accompanying Mr. Trump’s rallies are likely to continue. Michael Joseph, 27, a community organizer, learned from his Facebook news feed that   protests were planned for Thursday’s rally. A Native American who supports the Democratic campaign of Mr. Sanders and loathes what Mr. Trump has said about both women and immigrants, Mr. Joseph said he was appalled by the violence that he saw against supporters of Mr. Trump and did his best to break up the melee.
