Other cities that had large increases in murders in 2015  —   including Baltimore, where they rose to 344 from 211 in 2014, and Milwaukee, where they increased to 145 from 90  —   have seen murders drop this year. " There are four or five cities that are big enough to drive a significant portion of the increase," said Ronal Serpas, a former police chief in Nashville and New Orleans, who is now a criminal justice professor at Loyola University New Orleans. But homicides have increased during the first nine months of this year in several other cities, including Charlotte, N. C. where Keith Lamont Scott, a black man, was fatally shot by the police last week.
