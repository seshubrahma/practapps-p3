Earlier Friday, a senior White House adviser told CNN that Vice President Mike Pence did not know that Flynn may have discussed sanctions in the December conversation and believes "itâ€™s a problem. " Three administration officials said Pence only knew what Flynn told him    that he had not talked about sanctions    before Pence stood before cameras last month and vouched for Flynn. One official said Pence was trying to "get to the bottom of it," and two senior administration officials said Pence was "very intentional" in asking Flynn about his communication with the Russians before speaking to the media.
