My family is an immigrant family I have relatives and ties all over the world. My parents chose America because they wanted to raise children in a free country, where people of different races were treated equally before the law. I grew up in a diverse town and believe America should remain open to the world. Those who attack "globalists" seem to have something else in mind.
