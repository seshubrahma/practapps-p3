Fox News Channelâ€™s "Fox  Friends"   Elizabeth Hasselbeck asked why the group had not been so designated right after Harris County Deputy Darren Goforth was executed in Houston in August 2015. Deputy Goforth was shot 15 times approximately six weeks after PVAMU graduate Sandra Bland committed suicide in the Waller County Jail near Houston. His murder also followed several protests in Waller County where Black Lives Matter activists and members of the New Black Panther Party called for the killing of whites and white police officers.
