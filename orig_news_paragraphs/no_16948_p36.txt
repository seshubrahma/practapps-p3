Trump claimed Clinton was "upset" by the D. C. v. Heller decision, which reinforced the right for individuals to own firearms but included the caveat that gun rights aren’t absolute. Clinton responded that she was upset about one portion of the   ruling, which overturned Washington’s handgun ban and its safe storage law, requiring firearms to be kept in safes or locked boxes to prevent accidents. " I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case," said Clinton.
