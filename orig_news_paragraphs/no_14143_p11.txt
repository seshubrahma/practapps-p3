Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto had been scheduled to visit President Trump at the White House next Tuesday.   But Mr. Trump’s moving forward with plans to build a wall on the U. S. Mexico border.   He wants Mexico to pay for it and that’s something Mr. Pena Nieto has repeatedly said Mexico would not do. On Thursday, President Trump said if President Pena Nieto continued to refuse to finance the wall, it would be better for him to skip the meeting.
