The San Francisco Police Department went so far as to cut ties with an FBI   task force in order to prevent officers from being involved in action that targeted illegals. And California’s highest law enforcement agent, Attorney General Xavier Becerra, has been very open about his determination to fight Trump’s policies as part of the larger effort to retain sanctuary policies that harbor illegal aliens in the state. But Gov. Brown would like some federal funds to help out in the short term, so he is asking the Trump administration for help. Notably, Gov. Brown also used his "State of the State" address earlier this year to welcome Trump’s commitment to infrastructure spending.
