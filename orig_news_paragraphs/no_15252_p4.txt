"Determinations about where and how ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) personnel carry out arrests are made on a    basis, taking into account all aspects of the situation, including the target’s criminal history safety considerations the viability of the leads on the individual’s whereabouts and any sensitivities involving the prospective arrest location," spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said. " In that vein, ICE officers are not ’stationed’ at courthouses. Rather, courthouse arrests occur when investigating officers have exhausted all other options of possible apprehension.
