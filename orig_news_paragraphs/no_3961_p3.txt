Trump’s skillful courting of the conservative media, like The Daily Caller, Breitbart News, WND. com, and InfoWars, made Trump the first presidential candidate to reach these disaffected and highly motivated Americans effectively. At the same time, Trump’s relentless attacks on the media as "unfair" and "dishonest" came right out of the Nixon playbook, where both Nixon and Trump exploited the resentment of the biased media, so hated by their supporters. Trump’s willingness to challenge openly the media outlets that went after him kept them somewhat honest in their coverage of his campaign but the relentless cable news networks’ attacks on him were unlike any thing I have seen in the nine presidential campaigns in which I worked. The media dropped all pretext of objectivity.
