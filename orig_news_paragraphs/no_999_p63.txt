Mr. Trump was also interviewed on a radio show hosted by James Edwards, who has described himself as a "  advocate" and whom some have called a white supremacist. Mr. Trump was criticized, too, for earning an estimated $50, 000 for delivering a speech at an October event at the Ritz Paris hosted by the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs, a French think tank whose organizers have promoted Russian interests in Syria and elsewhere. He declined to comment on his speech. On Twitter he has reposted false reports and passed along memes favored by white nationalists.
