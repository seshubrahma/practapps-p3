Sanctuary cities, Trumpâ€™s "interior" security order takes aim at   sanctuary jurisdictions    cities, states and other entities that through a range of policies shield undocumented immigrants from federal law enforcement.   The order will "strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants," according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer in his daily briefing.   What are sanctuary cities and can they be defunded?   The order declares that entities labeled "sanctuary jurisdictions" by the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security will be "not eligible" for federal grants, and it directs the Office of Management and Budget to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions.
