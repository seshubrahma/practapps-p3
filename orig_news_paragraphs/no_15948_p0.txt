 (CNN) President Barack Obama on Thursday traveled to the scene of the largest terror attack on U. S. soil since   buffeted by criticism that he doesn’t understand the threat posed by radical Islam and hasn’t done enough to protect the homeland. When terrorists have struck during his presidency, Obama has typically reacted cerebrally, trying to ensure that reason triumphs over the fear and emotion of the moment even as critics such as Donald Trump assail it. On Thursday in Orlando, Obama had to yet again console Americans grieving from a mass shooting    and on this occasion he had to also reassure Americans reeling from the dawn of a new era of mass casualty, lone wolf, homegrown terrorism that authorities have long feared.
