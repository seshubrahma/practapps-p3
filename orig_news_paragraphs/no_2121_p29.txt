Tim Boyle, who took over Bayonne’s utilities authority after Mr. Smith was voted out of office, said that various regulations required the city to use that money for property tax relief rather than to stabilize rates. He also blamed the previous administration for guaranteeing too much revenue to K. K. R. ’s team in the early part of the deal, calling those figures "wildly optimistic. " Bayonne officials also stress the deal’s benefits, including the   payment that let Bayonne pay off more than $100 million in old debts.
