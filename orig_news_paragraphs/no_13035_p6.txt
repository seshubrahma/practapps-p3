Rob learned about many cultures, realizing how grateful he was for being an American and why our individual rights must be protected. Rob made the decision as a 17 year old high school senior to enlist in the Air Force and serve in uniform as the country faced multiple crises around the world. Having worked his way up from the enlisted ranks to full colonel, he retired from active duty in 2011, ending his military service of more than 32 years. Rob and Candy came back to Louisiana to continue raising their family, where he had spent much of his military career.
