The campaign source told CNN he would make a stop after his visit to Ground Zero but did not provide details. Hillary Clinton is also expected to visit Ground Zero on Sunday. She wonâ€™t speak and will not attend in a campaign capacity but to instead pay her respects, a campaign aide told CNN Friday. Clinton will be at Ground Zero for the annual moment of silence at 8:46 a. m. ET, marking the moment when the first plane hit the north tower of the World Trade Center.
