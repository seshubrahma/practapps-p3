Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump met Tuesday with Virginia father Ray Tranchant, whose child was killed as a result of lax immigration enforcement policies during   Tim Kaine’s administration. [Tranchant’s sixteen year old daughter, Tessa, was murdered in 2007 by an illegal alien drunk driver, Alfredo Ramos.   On two separate occasions, Ramos had been arrested and released under   Kaine’s administration before Ramos eventually went on to murder Tranchant’s daughter. Tessa and her best friend,    Allison Kunhardt, were stopped at a stoplight and were wearing their seatbelts when Ramos crashed into the back of their vehicle at over 70 mph.
