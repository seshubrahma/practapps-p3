Reps. John Conyers and Elijah Cummings, both Democrats, on Friday requested copies of any such recordings from the White House counsel. If there wasn’t any taping device, Buchanan said, that was a mistake on the part of the White House, which hasn’t been home to a covert recording system since Nixon moved out. " The President of the United States needs a taping device in the Oval Office," Buchanan said.
