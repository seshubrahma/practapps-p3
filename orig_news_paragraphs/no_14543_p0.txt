Washington (CNN) The White House kitchen can produce most anything, but it looks like President Donald Trump keeps running back to an old favorite: meatloaf. Tom Barrack, a longtime confidant of Trump, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on "OutFront" Tuesday that he ate meatloaf with the President, days after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he had to do the same. Barrack met with Trump at the White House earlier in the day and said the President loves the White House kitchen’s meatloaf, a dish whose ingredients could be prepared into any number of things that are not a rectangular slab of fully baked ground meat.
