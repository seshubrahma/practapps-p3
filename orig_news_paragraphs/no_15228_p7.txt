Trump administration full of mixed messages ahead of shutdown fight, "The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)!   If the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be!" Trump wrote Monday on Twitter. A senior Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations complained that the two sides on Capitol Hill continue to make progress, but Trump administration officials are the ones interjecting and holding things up, refusing to respond to an offer from Democrats on Capitol Hill to accept a package that includes more money for border security efforts, but does not include any resources to construct a wall.
