A new question in the exit polls provides perhaps the most fascinating glimpse of the Republican electorate. More than a third of Republican voters, 37 percent, say they would vote for a third party candidate in November if the nominees were Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. In battleground states like Missouri and Ohio, that number jumps to over 40 percent of Republicans. Just slightly more than half of Republicans across all five states say they would "definitely" vote for Trump if he were the GOP nominee.
