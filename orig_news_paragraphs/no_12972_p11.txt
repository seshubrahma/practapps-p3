Australian Border Force Commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg said ships had been positioned to turn boats back to Indonesia if asylum seekers attempt to reach Australia in the hope of being sent to the U. S. No people smuggling operation has successfully delivered asylum seekers to Australia by boat since July 2014. Turnbull announced at Obama’s Leaders’ Summit on Refugees in September that Australia would participate in the U. S.  program to resettle Central American refugees from a camp in Costa Rica. Australia would also increase its refugee intake by 5, 000 to 18, 750 a year.
