The one issue where Peña Nieto might have some influence over Trump is on any negotiations on the North American Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, especially once Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is included in discussions.

But one lesson that can be taken from Hillary Clinton’s loss is that there is an underlying, and extraordinarily strong, rejection of trade agreements among many Americans. Indeed, Clinton’s stance on NAFTA (although timid compared with Bill Clinton when he was in office) may have contributed to losses in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
