AZUZ:   When I was founded in 1997, No Limits theater group, like its name suggests, wasnâ€™t limited to people simply performing in plays.   The actors were all students with hearing loss.   And since then, the No Limits group has produced 100 plays in 13 states and includes three education centers.
