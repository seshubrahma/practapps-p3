FAIRVIEW, Tenn.   —    Representative Marsha Blackburn may have expected to draw a friendly crowd by scheduling a town   meeting in a Tennessee community that had voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, but she instead faced a   blast of disapproval on Tuesday. Ms. Blackburn, an   Republican, was sharply questioned about a wide range of issues that have unsettled Mr. Trump’s first month in office, including health care, the environment, education and the president’s links to Russia.
