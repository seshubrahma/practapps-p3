The same is even more true when it comes to counterterrorism. Terrorism may be the ultimate form of illegitimate violence, and its impermissibility is now well enshrined in international norms.   Getting counterterrorism right means not just using our own violence to eliminate bad actors, as important as that can be. Convincing local populations and the international community that our actions are legitimate whereas terroristsâ€™ actions are not is at the very heart of effective counterterrorism it is integral to sound policy, not simply a way of talking about it.
