That was singularly important because the president would have absolute authority over the military as   . As Chief Justice John Jay —  the first Chief Justice of the United States, appointed by President George Washington in 1789 —  explained, the Founding Fathers did not want any question: whether it would not be wise  seasonable to provide a   …     strong check to the admission of Foreigners into the administration of our National Government and to declare expressly that the Command[er] in chief of the [A]merican army shall not be given to, nor devolve on, any but a natural born citizen. The Natural Born Clause seeks to ensure that since American diplomacy and the American military are under the control of the president, that he would not have any conflicting loyalties, especially in the event of conflict. For example, if America went to war again with Great Britain (which many of the Framers considered likely) they did not want an American president who had grown up in Great Britain and might secretly sympathize with the British government and British people, and who might as a consequence not vigorously prosecute the war effort.
