For example, in 2016, a company named Urban Seed began building a new   greenhouse in Las Vegas where workers can quickly grow stacked layers of fresh herbs and   crops for nearby restaurants and shops. According to an NPR report: In a    area, Wenman projects that Urban Seed will be able to grow more than 500 heads of lettuce in 30 days, compared with roughly 50 lettuce heads that might grow during that time on a traditional outdoor farm. That number might sound hyperbolic, but itâ€™s actually pretty conservative when you compare it to estimates for vertical indoor farms currently getting lots of buzz. In Newark, for example, AeroFarms claims    yields that are 130 times those of field farms.
