Like General Mattis, General Patton, who led American troops into Nazi Germany during World War II, was a colorful,   advocate of aggressive offensive action. But officials who know General Mattis caution that he views a tough American posture overseas as something to deter war with potential foes like Iran, not to start one. And although he was so hawkish on Iran as head of United States Central Command from 2010 to 2013 that the Obama administration cut short his tour, General Mattis has since said that tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, as Mr. Trump has vowed to do, would hurt the United States. General Mattis now favors working closely with allies to strictly enforce the deal.
