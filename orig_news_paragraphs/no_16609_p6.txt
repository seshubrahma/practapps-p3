Clinton had a cough last week, and chalked it up to allergies    joking at an event that she was allergic to Trump. She said Monday night she’d thought at the time it was allergies, because she experienced a similar cough in the spring and fall due to seasonal allergies. " What happened this time, though, was it didn’t dissipate, and that’s why when I got off the road on Friday, I did go to see my doctor, and that’s when I was diagnosed with pneumonia," Clinton said.
