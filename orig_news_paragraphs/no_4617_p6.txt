The OMB document states that total welfare reforms in the budget proposal will save $274 billion over 10 years. The tax reform element of the budget assumes several reforms laid out in the Trump Administrationâ€™s recently released tax reform outline. This includes paring down tax brackets from 7 categories to three, cutting the business tax rate to 15 percent and making many small businesses eligible for the 15 percent rate. A third document "A New Foundation for a Secure Nation" laid out an increase in defense spending and spending on border security immigration enforcement.
