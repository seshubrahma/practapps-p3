Although Mr. Trump has a sizable delegate lead in the Republican presidential primary race, his campaign has often had organizational issues, at times losing ground against better organized opponents, chiefly Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, as Mr. Trump has struggled to master the complicated rules governing the selection of delegates. Mr. Trump can still fly most candidates typically charter a private plane. He also has four other registered aircraft: a Boeing 757 and three Sikorsky helicopters, a fleet that has become a critical part of the billionaire’s image he has sought to project on the campaign trail. The Boeing, which has Mr. Trump’s surname emblazoned in big letters on the outside and   fixtures inside, has been used as a backdrop at a number of his rallies.
