A moral statement should be judged on its merits. Everyone who agrees that Trump is a bully, and that bullying should not stand without being called out, should applaud at least that part of Streep’s remarks, regardless of what cultural tribe they belong to, their opinion of Hollywood’s general morals, or their deep grievances about the film industry’s Roman Polanski apologia. In doing otherwise, cultural conservatives are letting their tribal dislike of Hollywood supersede moral truths that are urgently before them right now. Moral failings perpetrated by other ideological tribes will always be easy to identify.
