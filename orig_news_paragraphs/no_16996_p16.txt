To support his position, many of us, including me, agreed to play nice at the convention and beyond, because we felt that Donald Trump was a unique threat to the nation. On the night Tim Kaine spoke to the convention, many Sanders delegates like me wanted to express respectful opposition to President Obamaâ€™s   Partnership trade agreement by holding signs. But, our signs were confiscated, and, when we made some homemade versions on the back of the   Kaine signs, we were told to cease and desist or our credentials would be revoked. So much for democracy.
