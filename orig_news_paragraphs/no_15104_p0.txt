Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that unnamed forces inside Syria are plotting to carry out chemical attacks and frame the regime of Syrian President Bashar   for them. Putin’s comments come during a major diplomatic rift with the United States over a gas attack last week that killed 89 people in Syria’s Idlib province. The White House has accused Syria and Russia, Assad’s most powerful ally, of launching a confusion campaign over who was responsible for the attack, in order to protect Assad’s regime.
