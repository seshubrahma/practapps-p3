Rubioâ€™s standing in this poll represents a 3 point decline from the   poll in December.   The   poll was conducted Sunday, after the Republican debate last week in Charleston. Nearly 70 percent of those interviewed for the poll reported watching the GOP debate. Opinions of who won the debate closely match the    results.
