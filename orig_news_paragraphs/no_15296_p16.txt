The last time Trump attended the dinner was in 2011, when he was a New York real estate mogul and   star who had just jumped into politics by getting involved in the "birther" movement, calling for President Barack Obama to release his birth certificate.

Trump reminded those who sent him to the White House that he has indeed kept his   promises, despite evidence to the contrary.
