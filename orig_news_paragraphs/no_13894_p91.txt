Obama might have salvaged his foreign policy legacy were it not for Syria, which history will judge his and the worldâ€™s greatest failure. If the US had given strong support to   forces early in the conflict, the history of the last few years would have been completely different.   Assad might have negotiated his resignation millions of refugees might not have flooded out and destabilized the Middle East and even Europe ISIS might not have created havoc, and hundreds of thousands of Syrians who died in the war might be alive today.   His foreign policy legacy is one good intentions and disappointing results.
