Mr. Flake: One of the most outspoken Trump foes in the Senate, he took Mr. Trump on directly at a private party meeting. Both in the House and the Senate, Mr. Flake has challenged his leadership, and in some cases has won, notably on his crusade against the   projects known as earmarks. A champion of immigration reform, he is up for   in 2018 and is likely to be hit from right and left. Mr. Paul: He has already threatened to filibuster Mr. Trumpâ€™s cabinet picks, and he previously raised the alarm about the reach of government surveillance programs, which could put him at odds with the new administration.
