At this point in the last two presidential elections, the N. R. A. had not spent a single dollar on commercials backing the Republican nominees, John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar  . In 2004, the rifle association spent just $61, 000 aiding President George W. Bush’s   bid, and only in Washington. Rebuilding America Now, a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump’s candidacy, also appears to be ramping up its activities, with roughly $1 million added to its advertising plans for the next six days in four battleground states.
