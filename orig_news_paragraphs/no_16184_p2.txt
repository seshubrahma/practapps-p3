It was a remarkable moment to watch, with the head of CNN’s Ankara bureau, Hande Firat, holding a lapel mic up to an iPhone. Erdogan managed to appear at once presidential and intimate, striking a balance between his assured rhetoric and the tenuousness of his connection to the media universe. At one point, the video cut out while someone else tried to call the phone, underlining the leader’s luck at managing to get on air from (we presume) his vacation in the beach town of Marmaris in the midst of an extremely chaotic night. Perhaps realizing their mistake, the junta took over the CNN Turk studios three hours later, emptying the facility even as the staff continued to broadcast.
