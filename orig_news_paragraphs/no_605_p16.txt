" Mr. Flynn told the same thing to Mr. Pence and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, who were scheduled to go on the Sunday talk shows and expected that they would be asked about the matter, according to the two men. On Jan. 15, Mr. Pence went on "Face the Nation" on CBS and on "Fox News Sunday" and repeated that sanctions had not been discussed, while Mr. Priebus said much the same on "Meet the Press" on NBC. The topic came up again after Mr. Trump and his team moved into the White House.
