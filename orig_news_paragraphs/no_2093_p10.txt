There are now 13 open   investigations under the law, though a spokesman for the department declined to say how many of those involved mosques. Ross K. Baker, a distinguished professor of political science at Rutgers who has studied the federal law, said it was "entirely possible" Mr. Sessions could choose to dial back on the investigations. " It is within the province of the attorney   to decide whether to proceed with a lawsuit," he said.
