During the primary race earlier this year, when it seemed California might be the decisive contest, 100, 000 Trump volunteers signed up statewide, the Times reports. Early last week, Trump made quiet visits to Los Angeles and the Central Valley en route to a rally in Washington State. His private fundraiser in Tulare may have set a new record for a campaign event in the agricultural region, netting an estimated $1. 3 million at one stop. In June, Trumpâ€™s speech in San Jose was greeted by violence and riots, with supporters beaten and harassed outside the arena in full view of the national media.
