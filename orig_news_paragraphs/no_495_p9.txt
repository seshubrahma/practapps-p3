A relative newcomer to fashion, Willy Chavarria presented a sublimely deadpan collection on Thursday that he titled "Brown Power" and showed on a group of   models that included a young trans woman and a Honduran food deliveryman. The clothes were inspired, Mr. Chavarria said, by Chicano youths in California towns like the one in the San Joaquin Valley where he was raised, a son of Mexican immigrants who worked in the agricultural fields. " The political moment is hard," Mr. Chavarria said, over the   din of recorded   at his presentation.
