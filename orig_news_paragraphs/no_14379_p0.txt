 (CNN) Rafael Shimunov was at home in Queens on January 28, when he got word that the protests outside the international arrivals terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport had begun to swell. " I rushed out, didnâ€™t have any of my equipment, just my cell phone, and was there," he said 48 hours after his livestream of the demonstrations    which eventually drew thousands and set off a taxi strike    had been viewed 15 million times on Facebook.
