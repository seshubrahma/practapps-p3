Yeah and people still drive Volkswagens, heaven forbid," the Breitbart London editor responded mockingly, referring to the fact the car giant was set up in 1937 by Germany’s National Socialist government. Kassam hit back at presenter Tim Franks’ insistence that ‘lugenpresse’ is a "Nazi term of abuse" by pointing out that the word appears regularly in the German media today and is also used by left wingers in the country. Franks erroneously asserted that the term, which translates to "lying press," was "coined in Nazi Germany," when the word appeared in the title of a book as early as 1914, but is known to have been used for decades before this, even going back as far as the 1840s. Speaking on the Breitbart News Daily radio show this morning, Kassam said that the term stretches back to the 19th Century, and has been used by Nazis, Communists, Marxists, revolutionaries,   liberals, and more.
