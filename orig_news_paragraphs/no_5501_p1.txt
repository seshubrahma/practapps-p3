The professor in question, Olga Perez   declined the award for an unspecified reason, according to Doug Bennet, executive director of college advancement at OCC. Even though Cox turned down the award, some people at the school think the faculty’s decision to nominate her was wrong in the first place, given what she said last semester. " The fact that the faculty chose professor Cox for the faculty member of the year award speaks volumes to how blind they are about what she did last semester," said Joshua     of OCC’s College Republicans group.
