Obama ran on a pledge to end the Iraq War and vowed to reduce the number of US forces there during his first term. When the agreement neared its expiration, the Obama administration worked to secure a new plan that would have left a residual force of 000 troops in the country (down from more than 150, 000 troops when Obama took office). In negotiations with   Prime Minister Nouri   the US insisted that its troops would be shielded from prosecution in Iraq. Iraqi lawmakers balked, and the two sides couldnâ€™t agree on a pact that would allow US troops to remain.
