GETTYSBURG, Pa.   —    Donald J. Trump came to this historic battlefield town Saturday to offer his vision for America’s future, saying he hoped to "heal the divisions" of the country as President Lincoln tried to do here seven score and 13 years ago. Yet in his own Gettysburg address, Mr. Trump, who has been sliding in the polls less than three weeks before Election Day, did not offer much in the way of   oratory and did not seem to embrace Lincoln’s unifying ambition.
