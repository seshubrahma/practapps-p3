The SEAL team was detected by AQAP fighters prior to reaching its objective leading to the intense firefight. Following news of the raid, the military had said the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on AQAP. On Friday, the Pentagon released clips from an al Qaeda training video seized during the raid, but later pulled those clips back because they were years old.   Government officials had previously told CNN plans for the raid had been in the works for months and that Trump greenlit the mission shortly after his inauguration.
