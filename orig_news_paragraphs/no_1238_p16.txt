In recent months, news outlets and activists have discovered prominent companies inadvertently financing a wide range of objectionable material online through automated ad placement, including sites that traffic in fake news and racist and   videos on YouTube. The pressure represents some whiplash for an industry that had broadly moved away from relying on content as a rough proxy for groups of people, focusing instead on targeting online ads, and to a lesser extent, television ads, by audience size, browsing habits and other user characteristics. Orkin, a   company that removed its ads from "The O’Reilly Factor," does not buy ads on specific shows but instead purchases "broad day parts on networks that reach our target audience," Martha Craft, a spokeswoman, said. The company added Mr. O’Reilly’s show to a "Do Not Buy" list after learning of the allegations against him, she said.
