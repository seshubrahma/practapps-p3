ZOA says Greenblatt "wrongly blamed ‘both sides’ for acts that are the sole responsibility of Palestinian Arabs and their leaders. " This was a response to Greenblatt’s statements: "We must be on guard for those  …     who place blame on one side instead of putting forward solutions that acknowledge the role and responsibility of both sides" and "both sides need more investment and less intifada, more business and less boycott, more help and less hate. "
