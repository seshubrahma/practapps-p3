Though some AIPAC activists boycotted, the speech was received politely.   AIPAC has a policy of bipartisanship, though many of its leaders and donors are Democrats, and the organization took a leftward turn after Barack Obama’s election in the hope of maintaining influence with a president with past   associations and in an administration staffed with known   policymakers. Its gamble failed when Obama ignored AIPAC’s pleas against the Iran deal. Still, the organization remains influential, especially in a year when both parties’  likely candidates have some amends to make with   voters.
