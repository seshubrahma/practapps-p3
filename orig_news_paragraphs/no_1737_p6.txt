The money followed a legal but circuitous route turbocharged by the 2014 ruling in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, which struck down   limits on the combined amount one person could donate to all federal candidates and parties in an election cycle. Like other candidates for federal office this year, Mrs. Clinton can accept only up to $5, 400 from any one donor over the course of her campaign. But after the McCutcheon decision, Mrs. Clinton established an agreement last year with the Democratic Party under which she asked her wealthiest patrons to write checks in excess of $300, 000, more than double the old limit, to the Hillary Victory Fund, an account made up of the national and state parties and the Clinton campaign. That amount is a lump sum equal to the total contributions each donor is allowed to give to her campaign and the Democratic National Committee, along with $10, 000 to each of the 38 state party organizations now participating in the arrangements.
