DC Police Chief Peter Newsham strongly refuted the allegations Thursday, "thereâ€™s no indication at all that the protesters were a terrorist group. " State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert would not say whether the United States plans to seek the extradition of the security officials, who returned to Turkey prior to the completion of the investigation, avoiding arrest. However, she did note that their diplomatic immunity lapsed when they left the country, and they would be subject to arrest if they returned to the United States.
