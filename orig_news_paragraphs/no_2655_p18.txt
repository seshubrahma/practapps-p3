Longtime Cruz supporters could be forgiven for experiencing whiplash. On Friday, Mr. Cruz cheered Mr. Trump’s vow to nominate justices "in the mold" of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. In the primaries, he regularly disparaged Mr. Trump’s judgment on judicial matters, holding forth on a "radical   extremist" federal judge who happens to be Mr. Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry. On Friday, Mr. Cruz named Mr. Trump’s immigration policy as a bright spot.
