The former Republican Governor and Senator for Florida, Charlie Crist defected to the Democratic Party in 2012, after he endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency. Standing as a Democrat, Crist ousted the incumbent Republican David Jolly by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent in his House race. However, he has since said he supports some of Donald Trump’s trade policies, particularly that of charging 35 percent tariffs on companies who move their workforce overseas.
