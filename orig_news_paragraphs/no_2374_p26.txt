■ Pay attention to sample size. If a poll has a small sample  —   less than 800 people or so   —   be aware that sampling error will play a bigger role than usual. The gains from big samples are smaller than you might think, so don’t give a lot of extra credit for a poll that goes much higher than 1, 200.
