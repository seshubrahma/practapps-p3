When asked if it is legal or illegal to store classified information on an unsecured server, Lynch says she would refer Chaffetz to the requisite statute. She says she doesnâ€™t have a hypothetical re: being legal to store classified emails on an unsecured classified server. She tells Chaffetz she will not give "blanket answers" to his hypotheticals. Chaffetz says Lynch is sending a "terrible message" to the world with all of her dodging and "gyrations" when asked simple questions about the law.
