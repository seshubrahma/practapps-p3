Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied   —   and every politician who has denied them  …     to listen very closely to the words I am about to say : On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.
