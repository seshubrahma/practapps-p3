The Duke University Student Senate has unanimously passed a resolution demanding "sanctuary campus" policies which would create a "safe space" for illegal immigrants, shielding them from federal immigration law. [Following the election of   Donald Trump who has proposed strict immigration laws and tough border security,   universities around the country have demanded such action, with Duke being the latest to follow, according to the Duke Chronicle.   The sanctuary campus policy, pushed by Duke student Elizabeth Barahon, will withhold illegal immigrant studentsâ€™ status from federal immigration officials unless they have a court subpoena. The policy will also mandate that officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) be barred from the Duke University campus unless a warrant is given.
