Earlier this week, singers Katy Perry and Cher and actresses Scarlett Johansson, Zendaya, Debra Messing, and Julianne Moore were announced as being expected to participate in the January 21 event. Ugly Betty actress America Ferrera, chair of the organizationâ€™s "artist table," said the march is about standing up to the incoming administration. " Since the election, so many fear that their voices will go unheard," Ferrera said in a statement.
