America has a few ways it could respond.   It could launch a preemptive strike on North Korea, which carries a lot of risks.   It can work with other countries to try to pressure North Korea to stop, which the U. S. is doing now.   It can also refine and test its own defense technology, like a $40 billion missile defense system.
