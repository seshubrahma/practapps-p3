Research has shown that the company of animals can do wonders for people in ill health. With that in mind, the San Diego Zoo has been partnering with children’s hospitals across the country to show programming of its animals on televisions in patients’ rooms. The television channel, known as San Diego Zoo Kids, features footage from the zoo’s live cameras as well as hosts who tell stories about the animals. Since the initiative’s debut in 2013 at Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, it has spread to nearly 80 children’s hospitals and Ronald McDonald Houses, a charity for sick children, across 26 states and three countries.
