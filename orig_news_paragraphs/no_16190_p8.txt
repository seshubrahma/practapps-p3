The truth, as any journalist or speechwriter will tell you, is that writing is hard. The person who actually comes up with the fresh, clever, quotable turn of phrase, the one that captures a moment or a feeling in a way that you recognize as different and original  â€”   that person deserves a salute. There may be no legal sanction to seek in this instance, since public oratory is rarely protected by copyright.
