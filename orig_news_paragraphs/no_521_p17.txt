What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election  —   about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet  —   wrongly so far   —   that the stock market would fall he lost about $1 billion.
