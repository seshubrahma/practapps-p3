Now, I wasn’t smart enough or fit enough or talented enough to attend one of our service academies. But I have attended plenty of commencements at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, at West Point and at the Air Force Academy, watching as good friends    and their sons and daughters    threw those caps into the air.   I even wrote a speech or two for my bosses to give at some of those ceremonies. It’s unlike any other type of college graduation, because, well, it isn’t just a college graduation.
