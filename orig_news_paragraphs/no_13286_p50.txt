later, May is talking that same Disraelite language. Earlier this month, after repeating, once again, her resolve to move ahead on Brexit, she called for a unifying economic agenda: We need a proper industrial strategy that focuses on improving productivity, rewarding   people with higher wages and creating more opportunities for young people so that, whatever their background, they go as far as their talents will take them. We also need a plan to drive growth up and down the country —  from rural areas to our great cities. To be sure, the words "industrial strategy" will rankle some on the right, because they sound like "industrial policy," and that’s anathema to   purists.
