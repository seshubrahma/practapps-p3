In a piece published at Breitbart News and titled, "Donâ€™t Believe the Lies that Ted Cruz Hates Homeschool Freedom," Homeschool Legal Defense attorneys Will Estrada and Mike Donnelly share their opinion on the growing confusion surrounding Ted Cruz and his education policy. [The premise for their article is a "little known blogger" who apparently created a social media tsunami so strong the attorneys felt the need to provide emergency relief to the Cruz campaign. They are both supporters of Senator Cruz and that is part of their role.    Estrada and Donnelly characterize the blogger as a "YUUUUGE" Donald Trump fan.
