There were some detailed analyses of why we should never go into the Mideast, saying that we have tried in the past and never accomplished anything, and one person saying that we should let them kill each other so that they wonâ€™t try to kill us. However, in the mainstream media, in the US, Europe and the Mideast, comments by world leaders have been extremely supportive, almost verging on euphoria that the US is showing leadership once more. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, both the controversy and the euphoria are to be expected at a military attack that could begin an   war. Any military attack is going to be controversial, but the population can also easily become heavily invested and become euphoric.
