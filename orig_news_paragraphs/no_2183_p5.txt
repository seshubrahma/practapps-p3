The weakness in last monthâ€™s job totals was somewhat exaggerated because the estimate reflected the Labor Department classification of more than 35, 000 striking Verizon workers as unemployed. With those people now back on the job, the missing strikers should be added back in the June report. Even apart from that distortion, the average monthly job gains so far in 2016 have fallen far shy of the nearly 240, 000 average of the last two years, a pace that has helped buoy the economy and cut the jobless figure in half since the depths of the recession. Given the uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve is now likely to put off any decision to raise interest rates at its next meeting in   and probably avoid lifting rates at its July meeting as well.
