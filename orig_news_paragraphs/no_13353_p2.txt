Virginia lawmakers sued, and the Virginia Supreme Court held in Howell v. McAuliffe that the Clinton ally’s political move was an unprecedented power grab that previous governors of both parties had acknowledged was illegal. Among other things, Virginia Chief Justice Donald Lemons wrote that "power could be exercised only in particular cases to named individuals for whom a specific grant of executive clemency is sought," and only after an individualized assessment of the felon’s case and character. In response to this stinging rebuke by his state’s highest court, McAuliffe granted 13, 000 restorations anyway, claiming he had somehow examined all of those cases in just a few days, and promised to restore as many as possible before Election Day. He also sent voter registration information to each of these criminals accompanying their letter of pardon.
