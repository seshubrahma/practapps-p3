Apparently referring to Mr. Sechinâ€™s reputation, Alexander N. Shokhin, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, told the website Gazeta. ru that anyone who tried to shake down Rosneft for money should be the subject of a psychiatric investigation rather than a police investigation. " If Alexei Ulyukayev had been accused of running over an old lady while driving a Gelandewagen at high speed through Moscow late at night, even that would look more probable," Mr. Shokhin said.
