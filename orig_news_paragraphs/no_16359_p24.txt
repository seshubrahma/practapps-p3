Her involvement in the campaign provided her a rare chance to interact with people of diverse communities at the campaign’s watch parties. For the first time, she started working closely with Jews and other groups. The exchange between Sanders    who responded to her question by noting that he is Jewish and his father’s family died in Nazi concentration camps    and Abdelgader went viral with more than 130, 000 views. She believes the exchange also underlines symbolic unity of Muslims and Jews and the need to build bridges to eradicate racism.
