That is who we are, that is what we stand for as individuals and as a band," the statement continued. " There are a lot of unknowns on the horizon and many things out of our control, but we remain resolute in our commitment to creating music and maintaining a community around our band that embodies compassion, understanding, kindness and safety. Be kind to one another, stand up for one another and take care of one another.
