The departure of science and technology experts from the White House means dozens of science and technology programs begun under Mr. Obama have gone untended in the weeks since Inauguration Day. " The O. S. T. P. is the conduit for scientific perspective and scrutiny to the president and is a priority in White House decision making," said Danny Weitzner, a former deputy chief technology officer in the Obama administration and now the director of internet policy research at M. I. T. Under Mr. Obama, the science and technology office included 19 policy advisers in the environment and energy division, 14 in the national security and international affairs division, nine in the science division and 20 in the technology and innovation division.
