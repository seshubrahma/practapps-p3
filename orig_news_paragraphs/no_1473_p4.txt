He has made only modest headway in the last few months: Mr. Trump has struggled badly with   and Mr. Christie has pleaded with donors in personal phone calls and at   events to give him a second look. At a breakfast   in Manhattan last week, Mr. Christie cajoled reluctant donors to back Mr. Trump, arguing that giving anything less than enthusiastic support would be a de facto vote for Hillary Clinton. And he has prodded Mr. Trump, too, to shift direction at key moments: Mr. Christie was among the senior Republicans who privately urged Mr. Trump to dismiss his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was widely distrusted by national party leaders and other members of the Trump inner circle. Mr. Christieâ€™s new role is a stark transformation from a boastfully independent   politician determined to win over female, Hispanic and Asian voters, to the   man of the most culturally polarizing presidential candidate in a generation.
