Charges that Russia may be trying to influence the U. S. election are certainly consistent with a growing list of allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin is actively working to weaken the West    including NATO and the European Union    through a variety of means. Britainâ€™s Sunday Telegraph, for example, said its reporters saw dossiers of a U. S. intelligence investigation labeled "Russian influence activity," containing material about Kremlin actions in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, France and the Netherlands. The file is reportedly part of an investigation led by the U. S. director of National Intelligence into how the Kremlin is infiltrating political parties in Europe.   In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel has reportedly ordered her intelligence agencies to investigate a possible   campaign to destabilize and weaken her government, focusing mostly on a media disinformation campaign.
