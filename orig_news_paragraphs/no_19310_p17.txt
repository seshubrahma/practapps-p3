In Moscow, the realization is growing that a few months of   schadenfreude during the U. S. presidential campaign are not going   to be worth the likely fallout. The   elite fear   that Washington is preparing to call Moscowâ€™s bluffs in the   Middle East and Europe and also push harder on a wavering   European Union to maintain and even step up pressure on Russia.    The political and business elite are concerned that even if the   United States does not actively push for regime change, it will   clamp down all the more tightly on their opportunities to travel   abroad and invest. One senior parliamentary aide recently   expressed to me the worry that "Russia is becoming the new South   Africa," referring to the   era of boycotts and sanctions   that isolated that country when it was still   and   characterized by apartheid.
