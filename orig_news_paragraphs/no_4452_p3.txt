While Maddow did not directly link the protests to the donation, the only thing close to an explanation for the protests she gave was that "the sanctions that the U. S. put on Venezuela were put there in 2014, after 43 people got killed while participating in   protests. " Nowhere in the segment are socialist policies or   political oppression, including the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, mentioned, nor does she mention that the victims in the 2014 protests were largely killed by state police, national guard, or socialist gangs. There is no evidence suggesting the reason behind the civil unrest was the donation.
