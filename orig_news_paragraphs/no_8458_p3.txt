Clinton made her remarks during a speech to union workers today at The United Food and Commercial Workers Union in Las Vegas. She reminded the audience about Trump calling illegal immigrants "rapists," asserting that his was a "wrong and dangerous vision" for the United States. " We have to stand up for hard working American families and that includes hard working immigrant families," she said as the crowd cheered.
