The New York Daily News cited police sources on Friday to report that a laptop was stolen from a Secret Service agent in Brooklyn on Thursday. The computer reportedly contains "floor plans for Trump Tower, information about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and other national security information. " [The NYDN describes authorities as "frantic" and "scrambling like mad" to recover the laptop. Other items stolen from the agent have been recovered, including a bag emblazoned with the Secret Service logo, which would suggest the thief knows he is holding a very important piece of hardware.
