The host asked soft   questions that invited the candidate to answer with word clouds. Mr. Lauer prefaced one question by saying that "nobody would expect you" to have read deeply into foreign policy before running for president. He asked Mr. Trump if he would be "prepared on Day 1," a    question that will elicit only one answer from any candidate not about to drop out. Most egregiously, Mr. Lauer allowed Mr. Trump to repeat, unchallenged, the false claim that he had opposed the war in Iraq when, as reported by BuzzFeed, he supported the invasion on record in 2002.
