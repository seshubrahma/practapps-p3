Obama himself gave a short speech that afternoon, while Aleena, her mother and a family friend stood yards away, straining for a closer look among the 400 guests and the smartphones craned upward to record the moment. As he had in his visit to the mosque in Baltimore, Obama praised American Muslims, calling them an "essential part of the fabric of our country."

He said he had a special message for the young people in the room: "We see you, we believe in you."
