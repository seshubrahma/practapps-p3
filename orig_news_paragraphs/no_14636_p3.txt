" The President is focused on having the Senate confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch for the only open seat on the Supreme Court," a White House spokesperson said when asked about the proposal. The idea closely follows a plot line from an episode of "The West Wing" television show. In season 5, episode 17, "The Supremes," a spot on the Supreme Court opens up and the White House works out a deal with another justice to retire so they can replace him with both a liberal justice while Republicans can get their pick of a more conservative justice.
