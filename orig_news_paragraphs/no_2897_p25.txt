Differences between a candidate’s views and what is written in the platform are nothing new, of course. Bob Dole admitted he had not read the entire document when he was the Republican nominee in 1996. And he publicly repudiated parts of it that called for a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants. It is not clear Mr. Trump would ever go that far, given how little attention he has paid to the party’s traditions and sacraments.
