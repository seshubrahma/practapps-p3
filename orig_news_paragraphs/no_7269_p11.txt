Trump is right to focus a huge spotlight on the $25 billion in remittances to Mexico as a potential source of funding for border control projects. When you add to that the need to halt remittances going to terrorists in over a dozen countries, it is obvious that bringing the flow of remittances under control ought to be a top national security priority of the next President. Somehow, I doubt the project would make Hillary Clintonâ€™s top ten list.
