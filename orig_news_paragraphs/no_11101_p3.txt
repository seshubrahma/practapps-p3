NFL ratings did not surge after Tom Brady’s suspension concluded in October. So pinning the NFL’s viewership woes on that, makes no sense. In regards to Manning, remember that Peyton Manning got benched last season for Brock Osweiler, the worst quarterback in the world. More to the point, at no time did NFL ratings plummet during the seven weeks where Osweiler started in place of Manning, which if you follow Moonves’ logic should have happened.
