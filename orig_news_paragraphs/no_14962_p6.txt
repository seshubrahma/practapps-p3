For Trump to ignore this fact is inexcusable and irresponsible. He’s actually hurting the people he claims to help by refusing to invest in opportunities for more jobs in the booming clean energy sector. By the way, if Trump really cares about those coal miners he invited to  the signing ceremony, he should be doing something about the 20, 000 who are sick, retired, and within weeks of losing their health benefits if Congress doesn’t act. When will Trump call a press conference about them?
