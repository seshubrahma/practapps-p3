The type of disaffected voter that Trump has attracted hates both political parties because they believe Republican and Democrats are playing for the same team. They think Trump is someone who is from outside of the political system and beholden to nobody. He is essentially the jackass who will fight for Americans that the media looks down up and the both political parties ignore in favor of whatever the   interests that Trump is not beholden to want. These voters, once activated and   on a candidate, are not going to decided not to vote because of a "savagely negative campaign.
