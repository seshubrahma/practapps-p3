And courageous Afghan soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the Taliban, and others, in the fight for their country. As we deny terrorist organizations control of territory and populations, we must also strip them of their access to funds. We must cut off the financial channels that let ISIS sell oil, let extremists pay their fighters, and help terrorists smuggle their reinforcements. I am proud to announce that the nations here today will be signing an agreement to prevent the financing of terrorism, called the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center  â€”     by the United States and Saudi Arabia, and joined by every member of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
