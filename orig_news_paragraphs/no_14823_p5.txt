Overall, the public is torn over health care legislation:   percent think the Affordable Care Act should not be repealed, but 45% think it should.   Among those favoring repeal, 24% want Congress to come up with a plan to replace it before they act to change it, but 19% want an immediate vote like House Speaker Paul Ryan argues is necessary. Coverage of   conditions, which would not change under the proposed GOP legislation, is also on Americansâ€™ minds. Most people think coverage will stay the same (45%) but 32% still think fewer people with   conditions will be covered than now, and 15% think more people with   conditions will have increased protections.
