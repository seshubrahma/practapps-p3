Mr. Schumer has already alarmed some progressives in Washington with his talk of trying to cut deals with the new president on issues where their interests align. But he said on Friday that Democrats in the Senate would not hesitate to confront Mr. Trump. " When he takes a divisive, nasty turn, when he just sides with special interests and gets   by the Republican right, we will oppose him tooth and nail," Mr. Schumer said in an interview.
