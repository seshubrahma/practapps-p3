Thank you.   â€”    Kasim Reed (@KasimReed) July 9, 2016,  UPDATE 10:46 P. M. ET, Reports are surfacing that local organizers in Atlanta have lost control. Apparently the local NAACP chapter has asked the protesters to disperse, as the official protest ended two hours ago, but they are not going home.
