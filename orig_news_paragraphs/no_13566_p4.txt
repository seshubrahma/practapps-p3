org is being used as the platform for the petition by author Thomas Reich, and the group’s main petition website prominently features the petition. The petition comes as the latest tallies seem to show Hillary Clinton winning 200, 000 more in the national popular vote, while Trump is the clear Electoral College winner. The move follows another petition launched on MoveOn’s website after Tuesday’s vote, also authored by Reich, that called for the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton despite Trump’s Electoral College majority. That petition has since been removed from the   group’s website.
