KISS frontman Gene Simmons scolded politically outspoken celebrities in a recent television interview and suggested that they keep their political opinions to themselves. ["I think celebrities should basically shut their pie holes and do what they do best   â€”   act, sing, tap dance, juggle balls, and all that kind of stuff," Simmons said in an interview with Fox Business this week.   The rock star said those "uninformed" Americans protesting the election results should understand that the "electoral college has spoken. "
