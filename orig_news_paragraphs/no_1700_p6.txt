Mr. Obama arrived in New York a day earlier than usual so he could attend a   in Manhattan for his preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Obama’s motorcade crossed Manhattan on 23rd Street, the site of Saturday’s explosion, though several blocks to the east, before arriving at Gramercy Park. Mr. Obama spoke to 65 people at the apartment of the restaurateur Danny Meyer. The guests paid $25, 000 each to attend, while the chairmen raised or contributed $250, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint organization of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee that raises money for Democrats up and down the ballot.
