I really don’t worry about cultural cohesion because here in the United States we have such strong nationalism. Here you can’t turn your head left or right without seeing an American flag [and] in the United States we have a constitution that supersedes any attempt to impose an order not founded in natural law or civil liberties. So nationalism is a good thing? Finally, some right wing red meat.
