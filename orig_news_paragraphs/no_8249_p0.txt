  Donald Trump has delivered his first Thanksgiving message, in which he urged the nation to work together after a bruising election campaign. [    We are very blessed to call this nation our home and that’s what America is it is our home. It’s where we raise our families, care for a loved ones, look out for our neighbors and live out our dreams. It’s my prayer that on this Thanksgiving we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country, strengthened by shared purpose and very very common resolve.
