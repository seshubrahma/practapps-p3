In the Maryland case, Judge Chuang, who was also appointed by Mr. Obama, declined to block the entire executive order from going into effect, but ruled that the most important section  —   banning travel from half a dozen countries   —   could not be enforced. His decision cited Mr. Trump’s public comments to conclude that there were "strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban," and that Mr. Trump may have intended to violate the constitutional prohibition on religious preferences. In addition to the Hawaii and Maryland suits, a federal judge in Washington State heard arguments Wednesday in cases challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s order, including one brought by a coalition of Democratic attorneys general, and another by nonprofit groups.
