Chief Justice Roberts has used his power vigorously and strategically. He has kept major opinions for himself, partly to shape and hone them and partly because it seems fitting for the chief justice to speak for the court in big cases. He has assigned other important majority opinions to trusted allies, notably Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. If the chief justice is in the minority, the assignment power shifts to the senior justice in the majority, meaning the one with the longest tenure.
