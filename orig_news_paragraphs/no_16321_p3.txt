" The meeting was organized by Karen Vaughn, the mother of a fallen U. S. Navy SEAL who supports Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention, and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a Trump supporter and adviser, also attended, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed. " It was really a chance to tell our stories, but also talk about problems with the rules of engagement (for troops in war zones) and the failed policies of the current administration," Vaughn told Military Times.
