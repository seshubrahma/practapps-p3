The commissioner, Ann M. Ravel, said during an interview that she would send Mr. Trump her letter of resignation this week. She pointed to a series of deadlocked votes between the panelâ€™s three Democrats and three Republicans that she said left her little hope the group would ever be able to rein in campaign finance abuses. " The ability of the commission to perform its role has deteriorated significantly," said Ms. Ravel, who has sparred bitterly with the Republican election commissioners during her three years on the panel.
