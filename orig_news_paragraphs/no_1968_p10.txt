The 1989   case was also decided by a vote of 5 to 4. It centered on a protester who had burned a flag outside the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas as part of a political demonstration against Reagan administration policies. The protester, Gregory Johnson, was charged under a state law that criminalized desecrating the flag and appealed his conviction. The majority ruled that Mr. Johnsonâ€™s act was symbolic speech protected by the Constitution, effectively striking down state laws against flag desecration across the country.
