The Establishment clearly intends to seek changes in the convention rules at the last minute to enable them to circumvent the votes of millions of people and the vast majority of Trump and Cruz delegates at the Convention to slip in a nominee who does not reflect the   appeal of the two leading candidates," former Nashville talk show host Steve Gill, a Ted Cruz delegate in Tennessee, tells Breitbart News. " This Convention should set the rules for the NEXT campaign, not change the rules in the middle of the game because the Establishment is losing badly to two candidates who reflect the dissatisfaction and outright anger of millions of Republican voters who are fed up with the insider games played in Washington that never produce the results promised at election time," Gill says. Gill has an interesting take on the suggested alliance between Cruz and Trump delegates.
