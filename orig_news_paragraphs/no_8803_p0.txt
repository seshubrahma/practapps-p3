U. S. universities are rapidly increasing the number of   foreign students who are being   into the professional jobs sought by American graduates. [In 2009, the universities helped 67, 804 foreign graduates get   jobs under the   Optional Practical Training program, which allows foreigners to get   jobs inside the United States for at least three years.   By 2016, the universities worked with companies to get at least 147, 498 foreign student customers into the   jobs, according to the Institute of International Education, a New   group run by trustees from industry, education and Wall Street. The OPT outsourcing program is great for the foreign students because it gets them a U. S. job for three years, and puts them on a track to win extremely valuable Green Cards and citizenship.
