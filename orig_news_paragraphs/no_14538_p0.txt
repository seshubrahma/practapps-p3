Washington (CNN) The Trump administration is planning to roll out as early as this week a revised executive order on immigration that the President says will "protect our people" while at the same time pass muster with courts that halted an earlier version. Sources said the new order will clarify a point that caused confusion the first time around: The executive order will not impact green card holders.    "The President is contemplating releasing a tighter, more streamlined version of the first executive order," Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend.
