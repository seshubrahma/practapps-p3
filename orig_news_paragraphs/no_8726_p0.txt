From Philip Rucker writing at The Washington Post:  West Virginia looks perfect for Donald Trump: a struggling   state filled with the types of voters who have backed him elsewhere and could deliver one of his biggest victories. But a sweep there might not matter. That’s because as many as 34 delegates  —   the entire contingent   —   may be free to back whomever they want at the Republican National Convention.
