And the latest average tallied by RealClearPolitics has Kasich at 1. 5% nationwide, and in 12th place, just behind former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former U. S. Sen. Rick Santorum.   His candidacy offers mainstream Republicans another option alongside former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. As he looks to differentiate himself, his calling card may end up being his blunt and sometimes prickly style    which could be spun to present a   candidate, ready to break out of typical molds. Kasich previously sought the presidency 16 years ago, but withdrew from the race in July 1999 and endorsed George W. Bush.
