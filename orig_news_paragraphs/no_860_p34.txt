Since 2003, the country has required that at least 30 percent of representatives be female. Next: Bolivia, where a 2009 measure requires women to occupy at least 50 percent of elected positions. Women now hold 69 of the 130 seats in the lower house (53 percent) and 17 of 36 in the upper house (47 percent). Cuba, in third, uses "positive discrimination," putting women in almost half the seats in the National Assembly.
