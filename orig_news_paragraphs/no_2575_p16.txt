After delivering a conventionally   victory speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump returned to Twitter the next morning to attack the hosts of MSNBCâ€™s "Morning Joe" for covering him unfavorably. Hours later, an aide to Mr. Trump called for barring a conservative radio host, Hugh Hewitt, from the Republican convention because of his criticism of Mr. Trump. And even as his   efforts have intensified, Mr. Trump has resisted making phone calls to donors to solicit funds. Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the New York Republican Party, said the party was grappling with unprecedented circumstances, brought about by the elevation of an untrained outsider unlike any presidential nominee in memory.
