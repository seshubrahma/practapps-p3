Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama have not spoken since the inauguration, but their respective advisers have. Two people familiar with the matter say Trump’s White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Obama’s former White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, have spoken since Trump claimed, without evidence, that Obama had him wiretapped. There have also been conversations between other former Obama officials and Trump officials since Saturday.
