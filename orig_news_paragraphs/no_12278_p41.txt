That story has been well documented because of this reporter’s, and this news organization’s, belief in openness and transparency. Breitbart News as a news organization embraces its point of view, and makes no false claims to the silly mainstream media notions of "objectivity" —  in large part because there is no such thing as pure objectivity.   Breitbart does, however, believe in truth and quality reporting, which is why Dayspring has not responded to a series of   questions on whether or not his comparison of Politico to Breitbart News means the organization has changed its editorial policies and now believes in openness and transparency among its reporters and editors, just like Breitbart News.
