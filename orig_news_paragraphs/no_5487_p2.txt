Democrats in this list who vote against a Gorsuch confirmation will not only find themselves campaigning against a Republican challenger but against the NRA as well. The Washington Examiner quoted a letter from   executive director Chris Cox, in which he wrote, "The NRA has every confidence that Judge Gorsuch will protect the Second Amendment rights of law abiding gun owners and will faithfully apply the Constitution in the cases that come before him. He has our strongest support for confirmation. "
