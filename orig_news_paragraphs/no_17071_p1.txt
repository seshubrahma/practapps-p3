The split has put traditional Republican operatives such as Reince Priebus    named Trump’s chief of staff Sunday    against more   influences such as Steve Bannon    the   leader of Breitbart News    who will be Trump’s chief strategist. A particular challenge is lack of clarity about the division of power among Priebus, Bannon and Trump’s     Jared Kushner, who also has a key role in transition decisions. Another source tied to the transition described the resulting confusion as "buffoonery."
