Germany     Nic Robertson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel took heat from Donald Trump even before he was sworn in as president. He accused her of making a "catastrophic mistake" on migrants, only being as trustworthy as Vladimir Putin, and intentionally trying to take business from the US. For Europeans, Trump’s attitude to Merkel is symptomatic of wider issues: his like of Brexit and his dislike of the EU’s single market and liberal trade values.   At the EU leaders summit in Malta this February, both French and German leaders said openly that Trump’s attitude was uniting Europe to stand on its own feet.
