The raid resulted in the death of US Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday, "It’s hard to ever call something a complete success, when you have the loss of life or people injured," but concluded, "It is a successful operation by all standards. "    Three US service members were also wounded and a $70 million Osprey helicopter that took a "hard landing" was destroyed.
