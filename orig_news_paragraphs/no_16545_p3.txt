don’t need us to remind them about God’s grace, an unearned, unqualified favor available to everyone. It’s in line with the families of Dylann Roof’s victims forgiving the young white supremacist who perpetrated a massacre in a Charleston, South Carolina, church last summer. That’s why Marion Barry could be caught on FBI video smoking crack with a prostitute and regain stature in his community, and why the most hardened young black men who’ve committed horrific crimes will be offered refuge. The black church, at its best, opens its doors to all no matter what they’ve done.
