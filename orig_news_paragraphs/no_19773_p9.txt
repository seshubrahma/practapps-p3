Does this mean the GOPâ€™s longstanding drive to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act is in jeopardy? Not necessarily. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to press ahead with the procedural and budget votes to set up repeal, and thus far no Republicans have vowed to withhold their votes for that effort. While Democrats have warned about the   consequences of immediate repeal, Republicans are equally insistent that Obamacare is failing as it is, and they have argued they must act immediately to provide "relief" to Americans suffering from higher premiums and fewer insurance choices under the law.
