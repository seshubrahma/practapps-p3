Beyond its derrières and dragons, "Thrones" has been an astute study of power politics and flexible alliances. (Give Littlefinger 30 minutes on the convention floor in Cleveland and he’d be picking out the White House drapes.) A story line from last season feels especially prescient today. (HBO has kept the new episodes locked in its own Iron Bank.)
