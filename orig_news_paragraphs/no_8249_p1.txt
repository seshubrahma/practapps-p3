It’s my prayer that on this Thanksgiving we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country, strengthened by shared purpose and very very common resolve. In declaring this national holiday, President Lincoln called upon Americans to speak with one voice and one heart. That’s just what we have to do. We’ve just finished a long and bruising political campaign.
