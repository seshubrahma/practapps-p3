Gibbons explained that a millennial focus group member, viewing the showâ€™s pilot episode, was turned off by the portrayal of millennials as needing to be treated with kid gloves because of their thin skin. Gibbons said the woman running the focus group responded to the criticism by saying, "So, you were offended by millennials being portrayed as too sensitive? " Then, according to Deadline, a "Millennial Media Member" interrupted the focus group and grilled the panel of actors and creators, asking why the majority of the jokes maligned millennials.
