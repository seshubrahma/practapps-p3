Such protestations have not prevented previous strikes. Another potential explanation for the cessation is that the United States is running out of targets in Pakistan. At the peak of the drone war in Pakistan, the United States had around 100, 000 soldiers in Afghanistan, while today the United States has fewer than 10, 000 soldiers there, reducing the need to conduct "force protection" strikes. The rise and fall in drone strikes in Pakistan closely mirrors the rise and fall of American troop numbers in Afghanistan.
