Last December, after Mr. Garten dangled the possibility of legal action against a "super PAC" promoting Jeb Bush and sent a    letter to an   group that ran $1 million in ads against Mr. Trump, supporters of Mr. Bush complained to the Federal Election Commission that the Trump Organization was illegally acting as an agent for the Trump campaign. " Trump and his agents have explicitly directed his corporate attorneys at the Organization to do the dirty work for the campaign," a lawyer wrote in the complaint, which is pending. Six months later, Mr. Garten began to appear in the campaignâ€™s financial reports.
