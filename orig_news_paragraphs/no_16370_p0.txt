Detroit (CNN) More than a dozen protesters on Monday interrupted Donald Trump’s speech laying out his economic proposals in what he had hoped would be a tame and scripted affair before a receptive audience. Thirteen women stood and protested Trump’s speech before the Detroit Economic Club, foiling his attempt to offer a contrast with his raucous rallies. The women, affiliated with a progressive group called the "Michigan People’s Campaign," said they were protesting his recent comments about sexual harassment in the workplace as well as his economic proposals.
