If I saw anyone I perceived as a Latino man in public, and I was alone, I would feel myself become anxious. How could facts in a moment of fear for a    girl make any difference? It would be equivalent to telling someone who is afraid of flying that more deaths occur by car than plane. But what did change the story for me was moving to Southern California.
