Klingner pointed in particular to the Trump administration ’s failure so far to apply "secondary sanctions" on Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, particularly the companies involved in the country’s development of nuclear and ballistic missile technology.   The administration has imposed penalties on a "limited tranche of North Korea violators and continues to not impose secondary sanctions on Chinese violators given a naïve belief that President Xi will do more than China has in the past," Klingner said.
