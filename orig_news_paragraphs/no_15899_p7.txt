Instead of wearing hats representing their home teams, as is the normal tradition, players on both teams wore Louisiana State University hats in honor of Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, for part of the game. Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who was at Wednesday’s practice and gave medical help after the shooting, said it would have "been awful" if the game had been canceled, and said Scalise would want it to go on. " I hope he’s in good enough shape to watch, because he’ll certainly feel good about what he sees," Flake said.
