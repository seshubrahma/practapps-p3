Here are a few more    some novel, others now familiar    to get fired (or forced to "resign") by the president of the United States of America and his staff.    Mock the White House and complain about war strategy in a magazine profile, Not everyone who is sacked by the commander in chief actually gets the news    and their marching orders    directly from the Oval Office. In that way, Gen. Stanley McChrystal was different.   He was removed from his post as the top US commander in Afghanistan in 2010 after publicly mocking civilian leaders in a now famous Rolling Stone article.
