—   used to go after Mr. Trump seemed to perfectly capture what a surreal turn American politics took in 2016. Senior national security officials for President Obama are hosting their counterparts on   Trump’s team on Friday for a   exercise at the White House intended to practice the response to a major domestic or international emergency. The session, similar to one that George W. Bush’s staff held in the restricted Situation Room for Mr. Obama’s team just days before he was inaugurated in 2009, aims to familiarize the incoming president’s team with the protocols and practices the federal government uses in a crisis. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said it would simulate what happens during "major domestic incidents," including natural disasters.
