The talk is that if socialist Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump win their respective nominations, billionaire Michael Bloomberg would feel the need to save America and jump into the presidential campaign as a   Independent.   According to a Wall Street   News poll, such a move would not only result in a humiliating loss for Bloomberg, he would help hand the country over to the socialist:   Michael Bloomberg would win only 16% of the vote in a   presidential race among the former New York mayor, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, according to a new Wall Street   News poll. In the hypothetical   Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator running as a Democrat, would win 43% while Mr. Trump, a Republican, would win 33%.
