DNC Vice Chair Donna Brazile will serve as Interim Chair through the election #DNCinPHL,  —   Luis Miranda (@LuisMiranda) July 24, 2016,  Miranda, like Brazile, was among those who joined Wasserman Schultz in mocking Sanders. The Intercept has a decent article with clips of Miranda’s emails, in which he was personally involved in the whole scandal. Again, no consequences for anyone as Wasserman Schultz gets promoted in Clinton’s campaign and nobody at the DNC faces any real resignations or firings.
