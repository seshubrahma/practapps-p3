The major chiefs association survey showed that murders did increase by nearly 16% among its members. And a survey of the country’s 30 largest cities done by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice indicated an increase in homicides of 14%. But these numbers do not represent an    increase in homicides for major jurisdictions, nor that an unprecedented wave of killings is hitting virtually all big cities.   In fact, only three cities    Baltimore, Chicago and Washington    account for more than half of the national increase in murders, according to the Brennan Center survey.
