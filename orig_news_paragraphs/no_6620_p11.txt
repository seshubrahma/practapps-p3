The group is now believed to be run by Labour Party consort Raza Nadim, who has defended Al Qaeda terrorists and lashed out at "Uncle Toms" in Muslim communities. The group’s website even hosts a post claiming that the "Uncle Tom" racial slur is perfectly acceptable for those who challenge Islam and Islamism. The link in MPACUK’s tweet takes readers to a LaunchGood crowdfunding page, where they claim to be seeking 20, 000 GBP ($25, 000 USD) in order to build an "  Nerve Centre". The website quotes Sulaiman Ghani, a preacher who backs the idea of an Islamic caliphate, and has previously targeted Ahmadiyya Muslims who are routinely oppressed by Sunnis in the United Kingdom and abroad.
