That fits neatly with   sanctuary city policies: local authorities in these   places focus on routine   matters    burglaries, muggings, traffic violations and the like    without taking the additional step of tracing the immigration status of the vast tide of suspects, victims and witnesses they come across.   Staying out of the   business, say many local officials, is necessary so that   immigrants donâ€™t flee or shun local police for fear of being caught and deported.
