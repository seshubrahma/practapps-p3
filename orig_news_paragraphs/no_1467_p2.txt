For Ms. Warren, the joint event with Mrs. Clinton here on Monday, the first time the two Democrats campaigned onstage together, was a moment for her to elevate her profile as the liberal voice of the party and a favorite to be vice president. For Mrs. Clinton, it was a chance to woo the partyâ€™s liberal wing and convince economically   voters that she, too, is a populist champion running for president to improve their lives. " I got into this race because I wanted to even the odds for people who have the odds stacked against them," Mrs. Clinton told the crowd.
