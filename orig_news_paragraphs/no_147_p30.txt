Many minorities of a certain age and place, kids who grew up before the possibility of a black president, were bused up Route 295 to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore on   field trips, treated to speeches by a renowned neurosurgeon and taught that if they went to class, kept their heads in books and got good grades, they, too, could one day be like Ben Carson. I was one of those kids. This winter, while home for the holidays, I searched for his autobiography "Gifted Hands," and found it resting on a shelf in my childhood bedroom "The Big Picture," another of his books, was propped next to it, with my little brotherâ€™s name scrawled inside. A unique sort of sadness stirs within me when I watch Carson now.
