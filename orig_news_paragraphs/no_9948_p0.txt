Another exciting week in the 2016 Trump Presidential Spectacular and another week of political obituaries predicting Donald Trumpâ€™s imminent demise.   Serious question: How many political obituaries have these people written about Mr. Trump since he descended into the fetid American political swamp on a glass escalator last summer? But this time they really mean it! Yeah, these people are about as credible and reliable as President Obama drawing red lines in Iran or Syria.
