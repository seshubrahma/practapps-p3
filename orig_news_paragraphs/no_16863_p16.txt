: This Republican,     is not even about white women as people deserving respect and human dignity. If it were, they would have bolted when they first heard women’s accounts of his sexually abusive behavior    heard about Jill Harth’s sexual assault allegations or read David Cay Johnston’s chapter "Imaginary Lovers" in his book, "The Making of Donald Trump" or recently learned that more than 20 people from "The Apprentice" cast and crew were interviewed and described Trump’s lewd behavior.   Why Republicans’ outrage now? This is not about believing women, this is instead about a video, offering proof    in Trump’s own voice    of his sexual abuses and his debasement of women.
