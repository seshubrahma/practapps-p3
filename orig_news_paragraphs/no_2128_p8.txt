President Obama has vowed to deal the Islamic State crippling blows in Mosul and Raqqa before he leaves office. This month, he ordered 200 more American Special Operations forces to Syria to help local fighters advancing on Raqqa, nearly doubling the Pentagonâ€™s boots on the ground there. Commanders are uncertain, however, about the level of support   Donald J. Trump will maintain for rebel groups in Syria combating the Islamic State. The military march on Raqqa is complicated by the predominant role played by Kurdish militia members, who make up a majority of the 45, 000 fighters bearing down on the city.
