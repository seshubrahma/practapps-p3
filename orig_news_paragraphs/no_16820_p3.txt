" People shouldn’t be afraid of bring up issues of bias in law enforcement," responded Kaine who used the story of Philando Castile’s shooting by police officers in St. Paul, Minnesota days before the Dallas tragedy, as an example of racial bias in policing. Castile, who neighbors called "Mr. Rogers with dreadlocks" had been "stopped by police forty or fifty times" suggesting a pattern of racial profiling. Kaine poignantly describe Castile’s death as having occurred "for no apparent reason," an assertion that Governor Pence did not dispute.
