The Earth has warmed so much in recent decades, however, that 1941 now ranks as only the   year on record. The modern era of global warming began around 1970, after a long stretch of relatively flat temperatures, and the past three years mark the first time in that period that three records were set in a row. Of the 17 hottest years on record, 16 have now occurred since 2000. Two of the agencies that issued Wednesdayâ€™s figures, NOAA and NASA, will soon report to cabinet secretaries appointed by   Donald J. Trump, who has expressed doubt about the findings of climate science.
