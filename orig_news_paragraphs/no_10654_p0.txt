A bipartisan group of senators are calling for a probe into whether Russia influenced the presidential election after claims that the country illegally tried to swing the result in favor of Donald Trump. [The group, which includes former Republican presidential nominee John McCain, claims that "recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American," and has called for a full investigation into the conclusions of various intelligence personnel.   Other members of the group include McCain’s fellow Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, and Sen. Jack Reed, the highest sitting Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. "
