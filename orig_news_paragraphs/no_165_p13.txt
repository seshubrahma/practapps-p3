When it appeared that Yasmín Barrios, the judge presiding over the trial of Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, Guatemala’s former dictator, might convict him of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013, a campaign of coordinated leaks and rumors portrayed her as a corrupt agent of foreign governments, willing to discredit her country in exchange for personal gain. Leaks and rumors attacked Judge Barrios personally, but by extension, they also undermined the credibility of the justice system in which she worked. For example, the news media reported that the judge had been seen dining with "foreign women" at a restaurant in Guatemala City, and suggested that this was evidence of foreign influence on her rulings. In fact, the "foreigners" were Judge Barrios’s Guatemalan mother, her neighbor, and a nun who was a friend of the family.
