Some recent polling explains why. A solid majority of Americans, 54% now think the countryâ€™s economic and political systems are "stacked against them," and that number has been climbing over the past five years, according to a Wall Street   survey. In the same study, nearly seven in 10 Americans describe themselves as angry that government "seems only to be working for those with money and power, like those in Washington or on Wall Street," rather than everyday people. The public is so cynical about elected officials, 55% believe "ordinary Americans" would do a better job solving big problems, a Pew Research Center poll found.
