The result is a far harsher tone in the Democratic campaign and a transformed Senator Sanders, who is now making the kinds of   attacks that some of his advisers regretted he did not deploy sooner. But his aggressiveness also worries some supporters who were powerfully drawn to his positive persona that forswore politics as usual. The senator’s assertiveness was on vivid display in Thursday’s debate with Mrs. Clinton ahead of the   New York primary on Tuesday, which Mr. Sanders must win big to dent Mrs. Clinton’s strong lead in the delegates needed for the nomination. But he is also seeking to match the vigorous jabs from her aides and allies, who ignored Mr. Sanders for much of last year and are now assailing his policy ideas and leadership abilities on a   basis.
