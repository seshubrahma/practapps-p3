Obama will therefore become the only president in America’s history to never produce a single year of 3 percent or higher GDP. Even Herbert Hoover outperformed Obama! The longest previous streak of under 3 percent GDP in the history of America was four years (1930 to 1933) during the depths of the Great Depression. From 1790 to 2000, America’s economy averaged GDP growth of 3. 79 percent.
