Trump had several opportunities in news conferences last week to speak out against threats that are causing deep anxiety within Jewish communities and failed to do so. Moreover, he brusquely shut down an Orthodox Jewish journalist on the issue in one of the most jarring encounters of his presidency. That confrontation, the new spate of threats against JCCs, the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis and growing political pressure for Trump to speak out    including from his defeated presidential rival Hillary Clinton    help explain the timing of his remarks. It was fast becoming politically damaging for Trump not to adopt a stern, public line against the incidents.
