The 11 percent gap between Republicans compared to either Democrats or independents might skew the polling data towards those who might want to retain, rather than reform, Obamacare. Tim Malloy, the pollâ€™s assistant director, said in a press release, "Republicans gave up on their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare when a March 23 Quinnipiac University poll showed 17 percent of American voters supported their bill. " " The second attempt wins the support of 21 percent of voters," Malloy added.
