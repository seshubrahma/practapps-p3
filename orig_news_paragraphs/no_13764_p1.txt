["Those who say that Donald Trump could not possibly become the next president of the United States are the same ones who thought that Brexit would never be voted in," Hollande said, referring to last week’s British referendum which backed withdrawal from the European Union.   Trump was running on the kind of slogans peddled by the extreme right in France and elsewhere in Europe fear of the wave of migration, stigmatisation of Islam, questioning representative democracy, denouncing elites, the French leader said in an interview to be published Thursday in the French financial daily Les Echos. When asked whether a Trump presidency would be a dangerous thing he answered "yes". Trump’s presence in the White House "would complicate relations between Europe and the United States," Hollande added.
