Under cover of darkness, a woman vandalized a mosque in Davis early Sunday. Caught on surveillance video, she draped bacon on a door handle and broke half a dozen window panes at the Islamic Center of Davis. Pork is forbidden under Islamic dietary laws. A hate crime inquiry was opened by the authorities in Davis, a college town known more for its   culture and farmersâ€™ markets.
