 (CNN) Turkey’s top electoral board overwhelmingly rejected objections to the way the country’s referendum was run,   Anadolu news agency reported Wednesday. A narrow majority of voters in Sunday’s referendum backed the   constitutional reform package, which will transform the country’s parliamentary system into a powerful executive presidency. The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) along with individuals and civil society groups, challenged the result amid concerns over unstamped ballots and called for it to be annulled.
