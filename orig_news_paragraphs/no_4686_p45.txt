However, the second wave does not seem as bad as the   scenarios, at least not yet. The simple explanation would be that MalwareTech’s kill switch was even more effective than he originally thought, vulnerable systems are receiving vital security patches at a good pace, and the initial burst of "WannaCry 2. 1" modified versions aren’t as powerful as the original.   Bossert stressed that "we’re not yet out of the woods," and pessimistic analysts warn it might simply be taking a few days for cybercriminals to create a   new version of WannaCry that ignores the kill switch. On Sunday, a firm called Heimdal Security reported discovering a ransomware variant called Uiwix that "can be worse than Wannacry," because it spreads just as quickly but lacks the kill switch code.
