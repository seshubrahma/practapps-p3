Groups that sponsored the march  —   including the official twitter account of Woman’s March, Human Rights Watch, Black Lives Matter, Amnesty International, and the Southern Poverty Law Center   —   have launched a full scale defense of Sarsour. The hashtag #IMarchWithLinda trended on Twitter. Cable news personality Sally Kohn issued several tweets defending Sarsour, including calls for people to donate to the AAANY.
