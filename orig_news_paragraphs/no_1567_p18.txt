Proponents of a new conservative agenda have critics in both parties. Democrats dismiss their ideas as repackaging a familiar   agenda. Some Republicans and conservative media figures like Rush Limbaugh condemn their cause as a return of moderate Republicanism or a capitulation to liberalism. Michael A. Needham, the chief executive of Heritage Action for America, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, said reform conservatives and Tea   organizations like his are allies in their desire to rewrite a "stale" economic agenda tilted to Republican donors.
