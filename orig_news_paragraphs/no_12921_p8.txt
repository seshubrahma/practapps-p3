Only around 40 percent of the respondents in that poll, however, described themselves as evangelicals. At the actual caucus, over 60 percent of the total number of voters described themselves as evangelicals. If the Register poll had weighted its sample to include more evangelicals in its poll, the final outcome would not have been as shocking. The Register itself actually ran a model of its poll with a larger number of evangelicals that showed a   race between Trump and Cruz.
