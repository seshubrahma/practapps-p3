As a result of that change, today 9 in 10 green cards go to countries outside the western world that share no common history with America. The U. S. for instance, admits more immigrants every year on green cards from the Muslim world than from Europe. For instance, in 2013, we added nearly three times more immigrants on green cards from Iran (12, 863) than France (4, 425). We added more than four times more immigrants on green cards from Pakistan (13, 251) than Italy (2, 960).
