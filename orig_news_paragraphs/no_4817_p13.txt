We believe that the Air Force likely did something that had MOOG get replaced with L3," the aide said. The aide said it doesnâ€™t make sense, especially since IOMAX first began producing the weaponized planes in 2009 and has dropped more than 2, 000 bombs on   already. IOMAX had used the Air Tractor airframe in its earlier versions, but switched to Thrush, based in Albany, Georgia. It currently has almost 50 of the planes in service, including in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Jordan, the aide said.
