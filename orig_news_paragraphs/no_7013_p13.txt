Hubbach is far from the only "sports writer" who used his platform to attack half the country who voted for Donald Trump. In another of just a very few examples, this week USA Today sports writer Nancy Armour used her column to attack Trump and his voters in general and New England Patriots star Tom Brady in particular for support of Donald Trump. In a column filled with what should be seen as lies, Armour claimed that the whole country "boiled over in rage" at Donald Trumpâ€™s temporary moratorium on travel from a small list of   countries. She went on to proclaim that Trump is a racist, bigot and misogynist, and that Tom Brady is so stupid that Trump "duped" him into becoming a friend.
