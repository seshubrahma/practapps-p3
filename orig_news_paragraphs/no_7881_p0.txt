Michelle Fields suggests Dave Aronberg, the prosecutor who dropped battery charges against Corey Lewandowski, may have a conflict of interest that, if she were in his shoes, would have led to recusal from the case. [From the Daily Beast:  Fields suggested that Palm Beach County District Attorney Dave Aronberg’s decision not to prosecute Lewandowski after police charged and arrested him was unethical and motivated by personal concerns. This is because Aronberg and his wife Lynn, a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader who owns a public relations firm, have been frequent visitors to Trump’s private club,    and that Lynn Aronberg has posted numerous photos of herself posing with Donald and Melania Trump on her Facebook page and company web site.
