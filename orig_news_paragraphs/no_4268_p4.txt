If Americans are caught up in surveillance of a foreign target, their identities are supposed to be "masked," or concealed. However, U. S. officials can request to have their names unmasked if it is necessary to understanding the context of the communications, with the approval of the agency conducting the surveillance. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper revealed that last year, 1, 934 Americans’ names were unmasked. Last month it was reported that Susan Rice had unmasked Trump campaign officials  —   which she has not denied, but only claimed that it was not illegal.
