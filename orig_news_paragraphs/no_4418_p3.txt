One of the bullets hit McDonald in his neck, piercing through his spinal cord and ultimately paralyzing him.   McDonald was left quadriplegic, unable to breathe on his own, and would depend on a ventilator to breathe for the rest of his life. According to doctors, McDonald was given less than five years to live, but overcame all odds and survived for 30 years. Eight months after the shooting, McDonald publicly forgave Jones during his son Conorâ€™s christening.
