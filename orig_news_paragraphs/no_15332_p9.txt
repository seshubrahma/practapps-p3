Their nephew, John Gaspari, spoke with an employee and entered into a verbal agreement to transport Huskey’s body from the nursing home to the funeral home for cremation and related services. The day before his death on May 10, 2016, he called again to let them know Huskey would likely pass away within the next 24 hours. Again, the lawsuit claims, a representative assured him "all that was needed was a call from the nursing home when Bob passed away" and they would take care of everything.   After his uncle’s death, Gaspari said the nursing home contacted him and told him the funeral home "adamantly" refused to provide services after learning through the paperwork that Huskey’s spouse was male, according to the lawsuit.
