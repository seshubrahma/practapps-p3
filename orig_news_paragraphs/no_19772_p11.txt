But on Monday, USA Today reported that an ExxonMobil subsidiary conducted business with Iran, Syria, and Sudan in the early 2000s at a time when each country was under sanctions as a state sponsor of terrorism. According to filings with the Securities Exchange Commission, ExxonMobil conducted $53. 2 million in sales with Iran, $600, 000 to Sudan, and just over $1 million to Syria.   ExxonMobil told USA Today that its deals were legal because they were done through a   joint venture and did not involve U. S. employees.
