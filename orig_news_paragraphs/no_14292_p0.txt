 (CNN) An Iranian infant with a heart defect is entangled in President Trump’s immigration ban    and her extended family in Oregon is on an urgent mission to get her to the US for critical surgery.   Fatemeh’s parents were scheduled to meet with doctors in Portland on February 5, but were barred from traveling from Tehran to Portland, Fatemeh’s uncle, Samad Teghizadeh, told CNN Thursday. Several congressional Democrats released a letter Friday evening asking for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to grant a waiver for the child and her parents to come into the country for surgery.
