With a    prize of 57 delegates, Indiana offers a critical lifeline for the Cruz campaign and its strategy of blocking Trump from collecting the 1, 237 minimum he needs to secure a majority of pledged delegates. It Trump were to win Indiana, he would have a high probability of winning enough delegates to win the GOP nomination on the first ballot. Groups opposed to Trump’s candidacy, like the Club, are banking on Indiana to blunt the frontrunner’s momentum going into the final primary states. As it stands now, Trump needs to win just under 60 percent of the remaining pledged delegates to secure the nomination.
