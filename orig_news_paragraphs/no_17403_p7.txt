Collins, the moderate Maine Republican, added: "If we were to create a cyber select committee, it would be months before the committee could even begin its investigation," pointing to the need to hire staff who need to undergo extensive background checks to get security clearances.   " The Senate Intelligence Committee, however, is already staffed with experts and is continuing its investigation," she said. By keeping the investigations with those top secret committees, the party leaders will have greater control over the directions of the probes and the public release of findings.
