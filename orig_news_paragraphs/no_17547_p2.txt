Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s assertion that part of the Iran deal includes lifting sanctions against Qassem Suleimani, the Quds Force leader, is partially true. According to the White House, Soleimani    who was accused of involvement in the Shia insurgency against U. S. forces during the Iraq War    would not have United Nations sanctions lifted against him until eight years into a completed deal. Even then, U. S. sanctions will continue to be in place, according to the White House, and those sanctions are not connected to the Iran deal. There is another Soleimani who will have sanctions lifted sooner, but he’s not a part of the Quds Force.
