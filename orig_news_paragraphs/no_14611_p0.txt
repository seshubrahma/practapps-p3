Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) Iâ€™ve just returned from my tenth reporting trip to North Korea.   While the country remains closed to most of the outside world, during this trip we gained an unprecedented level of access to the lives of ordinary people.   These men and women were chosen by us     although our government guides often had to work hard to convince people to speak to a US network.
