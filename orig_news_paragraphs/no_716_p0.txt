I spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didnâ€™t read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president. What I missed, by many accounts, was one of the strangest and most unpredictable weeks of news in modern political history. Among other things, there was the resignation of the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and an "Oprah Winfrey Show" tape that led to the downfall of the nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew F. Puzder.
