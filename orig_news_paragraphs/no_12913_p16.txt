No one has been a greater advocate for giving border agents the resources they need to secure our border. Our Senate office  has no record of a request from NBPC to meet, but the Senator is happy to do so at their convenience to discuss their concerns. Sen. Cruz is well aware of the barriers that this administration has imposed on many of our agents to share opinions and do the job thatâ€™s necessary, which is exactly why he led the fight to stop the Gang of 8 legislation that would have made the problem even worse.
