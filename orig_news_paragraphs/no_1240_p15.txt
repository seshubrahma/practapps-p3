Either way, GEF’s fortunes shifted on the second day of their patrol. Homing in on indigenous lands where logging crews make forays to illegally extract coveted hardwoods, the squad spotted from the air a makeshift sawmill near the boundary of the Alto Turiaçu Indian Territory, home to the Ka’apor people. " I saw their helicopter land in a clearing, like a scene out of some Hollywood movie," said Francinaldo Martins Araújo, 43, who was arriving in his truck to buy scraps of discarded timber from the sawmill as the unit swooped down for its raid.
