This would be a huge turnaround from previous elections, where Democratic candidates enjoyed massive advantages with young voters. In 2008, for example, Barack Obama carried the millennial vote by 66 percent  â€”   the largest share of the youth vote since 1972.    polling suggests that Trump still has a steep hill to climb. A recent   survey put Trump in fourth place with young voters, behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson.
