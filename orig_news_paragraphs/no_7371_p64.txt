A return to freedom. On education, your freedom to choose your child’s education, even if you aren’t as rich as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. On healthcare, your freedom to choose your own doctor, without Obamacare. On taxes, your freedom to provide for your family without the IRS beating down your door.
