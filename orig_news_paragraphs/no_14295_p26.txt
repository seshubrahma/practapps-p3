Dilbireen and his family, who count as refugees, might be among those impacted. Ajeel and Flosa submitted new applications to the US consulate in Erbil, Iraq, but were  refused entry to the US consulate in Erbil on Sunday. Road to Peace and Scott LaStaiti, a Los   film producer and philanthropist, shared the cost of the applications, about $160 per applicant, each time a total of about $2, 000 for the family. Due to the travel ban, Ajeel and Flosaâ€™s applications could be rejected again.
