Sean P. Jackson, however, chairman of the Black Republican Caucus of Florida, said DeVos has been a champion for equal education for   and minority children. " The secretary says we should allow charter schools to come in and educate children if they are doing a better job than the public schools," Jackson said on Tuesday, according to Reuters. In her remarks to   graduates, DeVos said: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak with you, and particularly with those who have disagreed with the invitation for me to be here.
