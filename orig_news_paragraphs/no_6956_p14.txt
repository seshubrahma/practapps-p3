The   program is one of many   programs run by the federal government, which allow companies to annually hire roughly 1 million foreign   or   workers for   or seasonal jobs that can be filled by Americans. These programs include the   program, which has allowed companies to create a domestic population of almost 1 million foreign professionals, including doctors,   experts, designers, and accountants. The annual inflow of 1 million contract workers is in addition to the annual inflow of 1 million legal immigrants. Every year, these two million new arrivals compete with the 4 million young Americans who enter the workforce each year, forcing down wages, driving up unemployment and transferring roughly $500 billion from employees to employers and investors.
