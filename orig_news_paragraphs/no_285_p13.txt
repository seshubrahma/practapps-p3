I always really loved tap as an art form, and in this piece of music there was one section that is highly percussive and intricate. I felt the only way to express that through movement was using   techniques, and for me it was less about the sounds we were making and more about the physicality of the movement. It’s not on a lot of ballet dancers’ résumés to be able to tap in that way, and I knew Robbie had that ability as well. The duet also takes partial inspiration from when Robbie and I were roommates at the School of American Ballet.
