Saeb Erakat has said the PLO would consider revoking its recognition of Israel if the US embassy was moved to Jerusalem. DeSantis responded to the idea that moving the embassy could lead to an outbreak in violence by saying, "I can’t predict what will happen, so I wouldn’t want to make that prediction at all, but i think if you look at the benefits of moving it, they outweigh the risks. " Earlier, the Florida congressman toured what is believed to be the most likely site of any new embassy building in Jerusalem, in the neighborhood of Talpiot.
