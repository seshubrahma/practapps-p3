President Donald Trump reacted to the news that several Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cut ties with Qatar. ["Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!" Trump wrote enthusiastically on Twitter.   Trump referred to his trip to the Middle East in May, where he called for Middle Eastern countries to reject radical Islamic terrorism and stop funding the terrorists.
