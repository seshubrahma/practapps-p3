After all, during this campaign, Trump demonized us countless times, from lying that "thousands" of Muslims cheered in New Jersey on   to irresponsibly stating that "Islam hates us," to wrongfully claiming that Muslims are not informing law enforcement when we see suspicious activity in our community. But it would be a good start if he did. While most doubt Trump would follow either of these steps, most of us have been mistaken about Trump every step of the way.   Maybe, just maybe, Trump will actually earn our support.
