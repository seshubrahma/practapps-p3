Besides his family ties, Tony Podesta has been a major financial bundler for Clinton’s campaign, raising $268, 000 as of July. Tony’s wife, also a lobbyist, raised $407, 000 for the campaign. One major focus of Tony Podesta’s work has been Ukraine, a policy issue of enormous consequence to U. S. national security. On June 11, 2012, the Podesta Group registered to lobby for the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, which has been described in numerous major news media reports as an operation heavily tied to the   politician Viktor Yanukovych, who served as president of Ukraine from February 2010 until February 2014.
