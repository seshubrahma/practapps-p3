If your conservatism doesn’t actually "conserve" anything, what good is it to anyone? To continue with the football analogy, why do we have to have a touchdown? Why can’t we just get the ball and move it some in the right direction? It was fine to do it in the primaries, but by continuing to introduce "Trump, the man" as a legitimate argument against supporting the only candidate who gives conservatives a snowball’s chance in hell of getting ANYTHING we want, #NeverTrump folks are, purposefully or not, utilizing one of the classic logical fallacies and giving the Left the perfect opening to continue to "divide and conquer" us.
