Still, Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is broadly popular among conservatives. The question facing Democrats is whether to have a filibuster fight over Judge Gorsuch, highlighting what they consider the theft of a seat they believe Mr. Obama had a right to fill, or whether to save that   tactic for a hypothetical future vacancy if a more liberal justice dies or steps down and President Trump nominates a staunch conservative who would shift the court’s balance. " I don’t think we should move forward on the Gorsuch nomination until the nomination of Merrick Garland has been dealt with fairly," Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said on Thursday, signaling his support for a filibuster.
