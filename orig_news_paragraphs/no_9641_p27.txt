Bush’s plan was heavily hedged and safeguarded, and yet even so, the thought of messing with Social Security was anathema to most Americans, and so the bill never even came to a vote in either the   House or Senate. (Even so, in part because of the   Security backlash, the GOP lost control of both chambers in the 2006 midterms.) Thus we can see that the core of "freedom from want" is   —  protected by the impermeable carapace of staunch public support. So perhaps most of us can agree that all four of FDR’s four freedoms —  of speech, of worship, from fear, and yes, from want —  aren’t such a bad idea.
