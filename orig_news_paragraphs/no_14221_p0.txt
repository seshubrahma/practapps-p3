 (CNN) World leaders and prominent figures have blasted US President Donald Trumpâ€™s temporary ban on citizens from seven   countries from entering the United States as divisive, illegal, insulting and discriminatory. Trump signed an executive order Friday barring citizens from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan from entering the country for 90 days and suspended the admission of all refugees for 120 days. The order indefinitely bans entry of those fleeing from   Syria.
