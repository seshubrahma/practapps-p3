But while the issue is certainly worthy of serious debate, these appointments as a whole do not appear to pose a threat to the republic.

By and large, previous appointments drawn from the ranks of the military have been sound, if not excellent choices. Consider George Marshall as Harry Truman’s secretary of state and defense, Colin Powell as Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser and George W. Bush’s secretary of state, or Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser under George H. W. Bush.
