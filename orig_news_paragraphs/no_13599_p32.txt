Last year, scores of Rubio’s own constituents were laid off by Florida Disney and were forced to train their   foreign replacements brought in on   visas. Rather than reaching out to those workers, Rubio introduced an immigration bill in 2015 —  endorsed by Disney’s CEO Bob Iger —  which would triple the   program, but contained no additional protections for American workers. According to Open Secrets, the Walt Disney Corporation has been one of Rubio’s biggest financial boosters. Similarly, reports suggest that Rubio’s ties to the Fanjul family —  another Rubio donor with whom Rubio has close personal relations —   may have perhaps influenced some of Rubio’s votes.
