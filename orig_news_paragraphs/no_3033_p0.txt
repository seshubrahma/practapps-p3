Friday on "CBS This Morning,"   CBS News personality Bob Schieffer reacted President Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey earlier this week.   While many have made comparisons to Trump’s handling of Comey to Watergate, Schieffer said he saw "parallels" to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. " You know, there are many parallels Watergate," Schieffer explained.
