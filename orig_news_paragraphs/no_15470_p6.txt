Additionally, the Afghan government is an unwitting source of strength for the Taliban. The weak and dysfunctional administration in Kabul is hampered by corruption and personal animosities and is   to carry out even the most basic of tasks    much less craft a formal counterinsurgency policy. Meanwhile, the arrival of ISIS in Afghanistan has enabled the Taliban to project itself as a softer, more palatable alternative to the savagery of ISIS. All of this increases the Talibanâ€™s appeal and helps boost recruitment.
