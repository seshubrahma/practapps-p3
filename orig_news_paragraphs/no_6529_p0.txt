Thousands have gathered at a   "Stand Up to Trump, Stand Up to Racism" protest at the U. S. Embassy in London, with organisers promising to help Americans "overthrow" the new President and "send him back" to the U. S. if he comes to the UK. [Speaker at the demonstration organised by Stand up to Racism, a group linked to Britainâ€™s disgraced Socialist Workers Party (SWP) also called for "open borders" and for "  reactionaries" from around the world to be opposed.   Around 50 prominent Members of Parliament, the house of Lords, trade unionists supported the demonstration, and similar protests were  held in 20 towns and cities across Britain, including Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Manchester, and Southampton.
