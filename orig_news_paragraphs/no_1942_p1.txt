After choosing national security   for some of his earliest appointments, Mr. Trump is now turning to a group of ultrawealthy conservatives to help steer administration policy. In addition to Mr. Ross, a generous contributor to his campaign, Mr. Trump is likely to choose Todd Ricketts, a Republican megadonor who is an owner of the Chicago Cubs and whose father founded TD Ameritrade, to be the deputy commerce secretary, the officials said. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would name Betsy DeVos, a school choice activist and Republican   as his education secretary. Mr. Ross, 78, an economic adviser to Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be $2. 9 billion, is aligned with Mr. Trump on trade.
