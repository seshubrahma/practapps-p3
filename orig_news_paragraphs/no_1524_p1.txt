Just before 4 p. m. demonstrators spread word that someone would be burning a flag near the entrance to the Quicken Loans Arena, where the convention is being held. Soon after, a group of people, some claiming to be members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA. came to the area with a flag and someone began to light it on fire, several witnesses said. As the flagâ€™s edge began to singe, the police called out for assistance and officers swarmed through the area on foot, on bicycle and on horses. One officer clutched the flag while others began handcuffing demonstrators.
