Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) said at a Capitol Hill press conference on Tuesday that there’s a lot of "conservative wins" in the budget, and that includes no funding for Planned Parenthood. " Planned Parenthood is not funded," Ryan said, adding that the grants and reimbursements given to the nation’s largest abortion provider through the federal Title X Family Planning Program to the tune of millions of dollars annually will be up to Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price. " So we think there are some really good wins," Ryan said.
