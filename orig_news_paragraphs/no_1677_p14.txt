Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army officer who advises Mr. Trump, said there was optimism in the campaign that the momentum of the race had "totally shifted in Mr. Trumpâ€™s favor. " He predicted that voters would see a distinction between "a guy who made all kinds of comments as he was fighting to win the primaries" and the Donald Trump of the general election. Mr. Trump has taken other steps in recent days to steady his candidacy, moving to shore up his campaign in crucial swing states.
