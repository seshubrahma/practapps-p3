Narayana Kocherlakota, an economist at the University of Rochester and a former member of the Fed’s   committee, noted that strong economic growth continued to pull people into the job market while wage growth remained relatively weak. That suggests, he said, that the economy has not yet returned to full employment. " We should be seeing faster wage growth with this level of employment growth if we were close to full employment," Mr. Kocherlakota said on Twitter before the Fed’s decision.
