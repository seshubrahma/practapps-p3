The president’s other appointments for   health roles, such as Dr. Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have also come under fire for being too close to the businesses they regulate or for their investments in health care companies. Dr. Gottlieb’s newly disclosed financial forms are likely to draw similar criticism at his Senate confirmation hearing on April 5. One line of inquiry could include a thorny issue that arose on Wednesday: The generic drugmaker Mylan announced that the F. D. A. had rejected its application to make a generic copy of the inhaler Advair Diskus, a   product for GlaxoSmithKline. Dr. Gottlieb has called for making it easier to market generic versions of complex drugs like Advair to reduce prices, but he also received close to $90, 000 in fees in 2016 and the first two months of this year as a Glaxo consultant, according to financial disclosures.
