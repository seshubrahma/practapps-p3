The White House says it wants to revive coal, oil and natural gas production, all of which pollute the atmosphere, contributing to the likelihood of mass extinction, worsening droughts, deadlier heat waves, flooded coastal cities and other climate disasters. Because the Paris Agreement does not levy sanctions or fines against countries that fail to meet their   pledges, itâ€™s possible the Trump administration could choose to remain in the agreement while basically polluting as usual. Either tactic    defection or de facto not caring    could weaken the pact, potentially leading other nations to defect.
