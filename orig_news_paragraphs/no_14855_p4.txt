The House Committee is set to hold a hearing Monday with National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and FBI Director James Comey. The Senate Intelligence Committee announced Friday it would hold a hearing on Russiaâ€™s meddling into the US election on March 30.   Nunes released a statement Friday evening confirming receipt of the report from DOJ and part of the information it requested  from the NSA, which he said had committed to meet the full request by the end of next week. However, he added, "the committee still has not received information requested from the CIA and FBI in our March 15 letter that is necessary to determine whether information collected on US persons was mishandled and leaked."
