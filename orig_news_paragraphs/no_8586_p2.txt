Mahvi, who claims that he has ties to Iranian royalty and owns 70 percent of a resort in St. Lucia, estimates his worth at about $120 million. His $800, 000 home features five bedrooms and five bathrooms, an   swimming pool, a stable with horses, and sports cars parked in the   garage. Mahvi says he lives off loans from friends, which he argues is not considered income to qualify for food stamps. Flaiz says the investigation tells a different story.
