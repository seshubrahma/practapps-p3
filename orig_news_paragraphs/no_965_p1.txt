That is true of a show opening on March 17 at the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia and later this year at the American Jewish Historical Society in New York. Organized by the two institutions, which are collaborating on an exhibition for the first time, "1917: How One Year Changed the World" focuses on three historic events and their major impact on Jews around the world: Americaâ€™s entry into World War I, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the Balfour Declaration.
