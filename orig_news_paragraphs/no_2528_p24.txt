The group, which also included Mr. Soros and other investors, won the deal with a $1. 55 billion bid. One of the competing bids was put together by J. Tomilson Hill, head of the Blackstone Groupâ€™s hedge fund and asset management group, and Goldman. " As a deal person, I had nothing but admiration for how entrepreneurial he was and how quickly he adapted to the circumstances," Mr. Hill said in a recent interview.
