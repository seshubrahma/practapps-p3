The   program is managed collectively by the departments of Labor, State, and Homeland Security. Each agency collects data on different aspects of the program, including the number of requests for work visas, the number of visas that are approved, and the arrival or departure of contract workers.   Also, the regulatory details of the   program are complex.   The basic regulations say each   visa lasts for three years â€”  and can be automatically extended for another three years.
