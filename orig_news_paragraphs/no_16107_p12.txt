" Sen. John Cornyn, Cruz’s senior colleague from Texas, put out a statement Friday morning, saying, "To target those who serve and protect our community in such a senseless and vicious way is shocking and reprehensible."   " My condolences are with the families of the officers who lost their lives in last night’s horrific attack, and my thoughts continue to be with the injured and those in the Dallas area affected by this unspeakable tragedy," he said.
