One of those officials was Juan Hernandez, a dual citizen with a home in Texas, who at that time was the head of a cabinet department. That department had the name, Ministry for Mexicans Living Abroad, but it has since been reorganized and given a lower public profile as the Institute for Mexicans Abroad, a   division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I asked Se√±or Hernandez, what exactly do you do here? He was quite candid and informative and not the least bit apologetic.
