The timing of Mr. Manafort’s departure largely overshadowed the news Thursday night when the candidate, who has long spurned apologies, announced at a rally that he actually regretted some of the more offensive things he has said   —   though without specifying which. And on Friday, Mr. Trump toured   areas of Baton Rouge, La. even as his aides were confirming Mr. Manafort’s exit. Mr. Manafort, 67, who had managed national Republican conventions in the past, was hired in late March, as Mr. Trump was facing a pitched battle to amass the number of delegates needed to capture the party’s nomination.
