Sessions’ backing is the latest and   in a string of significant endorsements for Trump’s rebel campaign. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, after dropping out of the race himself despite landing significant blows on Rubio in the final debate before New Hampshire’s primaries, backed Trump this week, as did Maine Gov. Paul LePage and former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, as well as Reps. Duncan Hunter ( ) and Chris Collins ( ). But all those endorsements pale in comparison to Sessions’ backing of Trump, as the Alabamian senator is universally respected —  and feared —  inside the beltway in Washington. Sessions is known for his tough views on immigration and trade and has repeatedly aimed to push the Republican Party in a more populist, nationalist direction.
