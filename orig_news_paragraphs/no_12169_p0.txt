Billionaire Donald Trump praised Breitbart News’ Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle at a press conference in Hanahan, South Carolina on Monday. ["Very good reporter, very good reporter this guy," Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential frontrunner nationally and current polling leader in South Carolina by a wide margin after winning the New Hampshire primaries, said when Boyle asked him a question.   Boyle’s question centered on Trump’s longstanding feud with the Republican National Committee (RNC) which has reemerged in recent days after revelations the RNC and local and state party officials stacked the audience at the most recent debate in Greenville, South Carolina, with   activists who were also opposed to Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). The   and   activists placed throughout the debate hall, surprisingly enough, cheered loudly for the   Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and his mentor former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush when Rubio and Bush both repeatedly made the case to grant amnesty to illegal aliens.
