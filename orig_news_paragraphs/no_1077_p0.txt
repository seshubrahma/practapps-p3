WASHINGTON   —   Even on Fox News, Representative Devin Nunes, the beleaguered Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, could not escape the venom from his left. Mr. Nunes, the California lawmaker, stood inside the Capitol’s Statuary Hall on Thursday evening, assuming a familiar set of positions: in front of a camera, giving cover to President Trump and defending himself. The subject this time was his decision on Wednesday to brief Mr. Trump, whose campaign his committee is investigating, about possible "incidental" surveillance of the president or his associates.
