In several emails, Mr. Powell suggested that speaking out against Mr. Trump would only add to the attention the Republican nominee was getting from the news media. Responding to a reporter asking for comment, Mr. Powell wrote last month that Mr. Trump is "his own best enemy" and added: "I will speak out when I feel it appropriate and not after every idiot thing he says.
