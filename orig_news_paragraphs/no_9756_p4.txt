It’s likely a Clinton administration would also work with Republicans to increase already ahistorical and extreme levels of legal immigration. Refugee resettlement from   Islamic nations would also dramatically increase over the objections of American communities. Trump, however, announced in   speech that "anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation," while "criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges" and recent waves of illegal aliens welcomed into the U. S. by the Obama administration would be the first ones expelled from the U. S. He also declared his administration would build a wall on the U. S.  border illegal aliens caught crossing into U. S. territory will be detained and immediately deported sanctuary cities protecting criminal illegal aliens will be stripped of federal funding Obama’s executive amnesties for five million illegal aliens will be canceled immigration from   countries will be suspended a biometric   visa tracking system will be completed after years of false starts   will be implemented and Congress must revisit immigration laws periodically to determine they’re    and serving America’s best interests.
