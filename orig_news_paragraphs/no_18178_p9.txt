It remains to be seen whether this strike against Assad’’s   military represents a major shift in US policy toward Syria.    Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday that he "would not   in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy   or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today. " ’ ’   Fred Hof, the director of the Atlantic Council’’s Rafik Hariri   Center for the Middle East and former US special adviser on   Syria, told Business Insider that the strike would "either be a          retaliation for a heinous   chemical weapons assault on civilians, or it will serve as a   signal to the Assad regime and its allies that the free ride for   mass murder in Syria is now over. " ’ "   Assad’s atrocities against civilians aren’t new.
