Ms. Yellen said that the growth of the labor market had exceeded the Fedâ€™s expectations while inflation remained sluggish, suggesting the economy had room to grow. One sign of progress is the continuing rebound in the share of American adults in their prime working years, between the ages of 25 and 54, who are working or looking for work. " More people, presumably in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages, have started actively seeking and finding jobs," Ms. Yellen said.
