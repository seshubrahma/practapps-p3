 (CNN) Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois slammed Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday night, arguing his recusal from Trump campaign investigations is not enough, that he should "resign immediately" and suggested that Sessions should go to jail. Sessions made the recusal announcement less than 24 hours after he confirmed two meetings during the presidential campaign with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, meetings Sessions did not mention after a question at his confirmation hearing about contact between the Trump campaign and Russia.   Sessions said he answered the question honestly and correctly, because the meetings were part of his work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a Trump campaign surrogate.
