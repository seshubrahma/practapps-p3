the dopes marching in the streets demanding civility as they shout threats to grab Trump by his genitals. Or these thug criminals beating the tar out of a Trump voter at a street intersection. These snowflakes need to tread very, very carefully because these kinds of wild and violent and ugly demonstrations will only strengthen   Trump and his   majority. Anyway, these people have no one to blame but themselves and the outgoing current President, Barack Obama, who promised them the world and promised all of us a healed country.
