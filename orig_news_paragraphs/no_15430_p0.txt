 (CNN) Between 6:41 p. m. and 6:50 p. m. ET Monday night, President Donald Trump sent four tweets focused on the Senate subcommittee hearing on Russiaâ€™s meddling into the 2016 election that featured testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. The   barrage shows just how closely Trump is monitoring the ongoing congressional investigation into ties between members of his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian intelligence officials.
