It was the latest attempt by the White House to remove itself from under clouds of suspicion about links between the President and Moscow. This week, Trump’s    Jared Kushner    also one of Trump’s most trusted aides    offered to testify before Congress about his meetings with the leaders of a key Russian bank. Kushner is just one of several Trump allies    including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former national security adviser Michael Flynn    who have admitted to meetings with top Russian operatives during last year’s campaign. Through all those disclosures, the White House has insisted there’s no evidence suggesting the Trump campaign improperly communicated with Russia.
