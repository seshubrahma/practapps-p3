The IRS fined the Trump Foundation $2, 500 earlier this month for making a $25, 000 political donation to a group supporting the campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. At the time, Bondiâ€™s office was reviewing allegations into Trump University and considering opening an investigation. A formal investigation was never opened, and Trump and Bondi have both said there was no wrongdoing and said the donation was not tied to any favors.   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday sent a letter asking Attorney General Loretta Lynch to open an investigation into the Trump donation to Bondi.
