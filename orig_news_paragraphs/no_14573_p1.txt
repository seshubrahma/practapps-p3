This will restore (the Bureau of Prisonâ€™s) flexibility to manage the federal prison inmate population based on capacity needs," the Justice Department said in a statement.   In August,   Attorney General Sally Yates directed the Bureau of Prisons to reduce its use of private prison contracts. In the August memo, she said private prisons had been used to house a prison population that had grown 800% between 1980 and 2013.   But, she said, the population is now on the decline, from 220, 000 in 2013 to 195, 000 in 2016.
