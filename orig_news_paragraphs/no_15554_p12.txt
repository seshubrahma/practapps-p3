There is no hard evidence that   has become more of a problem in the US in recent years. Arrests of gang members by Homeland Security Investigations under ICE have fluctuated in recent years, but have shown no clear downward or upward trend. Anecdotally, some local law enforcement chiefs have noticed an increase in murders connected to the gang in some capacity in recent months.   Per the FBI’s most recent statistics, the roughly 10, 000   members are a fraction of the estimated 1. 4 million members of US gangs nationally, and made up less than 10% of the arrests in ICE’s gang crackdown announced last week.
