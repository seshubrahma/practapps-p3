As Breitbart Texas previously reported, Mexican news outlets and some politicians like former President Vicente Fox have vilified Trump over his public call to have Mexico pay for a wall between the two nations as well as his strong stance on illegal immigration. In Mexico City, the burning of Trump’s effigy took place in Merced Market in the city of Puebla’s Arista neighborhood in Monterrey’s  Obrerista, Trevino, and Sarabia’s neighborhoods, and in Ciudad Juarez’s various neighborhoods near the border fence.   On Sunday additional figures of Trump are expected to be burned in other cities. In the Mexican border city of Reynosa, Pinateria Ramirez has been advertising their Pinatas for the event.
