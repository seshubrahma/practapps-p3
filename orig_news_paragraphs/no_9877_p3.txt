In a statement accompanying the song posted on the band’s Facebook page, Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard said the new song "deals with a particularly tone deaf moment in Donald Trump’s ascent to the Republican nomination. " Gibbard wrote: While campaigning in New Hampshire last year he attempted to cast himself as a   man by claiming he built his fortune with just a "small loan of million dollars" from his father. Not only has this statement been proven to be wildly untrue, he was so flippant about it.
