As part of an agreement that calls for Volkswagen to pay $4. 3 billion in penalties and plead guilty to violations of the Clean Air Act, the company signed off on a detailed account of how the cheating software came into being, and how Volkswagen employees tried to cover it up after regulatorsâ€™ suspicions were aroused. The document portrays a broad conspiracy that included engine developers, software experts, quality control managers,   lawyers and people responsible for emissions compliance. The account of the wrongdoing reinforces the view that Volkswagen corporate culture was seriously awry. Employees who raised objections to the wrongdoing were overruled by those higher up.
