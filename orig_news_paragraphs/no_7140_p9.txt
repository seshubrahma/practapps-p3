Publishing parts of a document that you do not possess and cannot verify, and timing the release to cause maximum political damage (right after the president leaves the country) is not investigative journalism. It is political propaganda. It is the mirror image of what the Los Angeles Times did in April 2008, when it published a story referring to a speech   Senator Barack Obama gave at a farewell celebration for radical   academic Rashid Khalidi in 2003. The Times was given a video of the speech, but refused to publish the video.
