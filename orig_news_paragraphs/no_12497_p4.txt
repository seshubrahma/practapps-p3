There’s no question that I misspoke in saying it was the Klan. But one thing is abundantly clear is that the Klan will be voting for Trump and there’s so many different pieces that Republicans are not proud of that belong to the Democratic —   that belong to the Republican Party and let me make it abundantly clear, it wasn’t that long ago that Democrats the same way, felt the same way. we Democrats had the Ku Klux Klan, we had the Dixiecrats and we weren’t proud of it. And so they shifted now from the Democratic Party because of the voting rights act and they vote Republican.
