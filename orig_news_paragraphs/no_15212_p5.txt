At its best, our country’s decision to use violence against another state to uphold international norms barring the use of chemical weapons was a chance to show the world how violence can be used for the legitimate pursuit of political ends    and thus to draw a contrast with the Syrian regime’s illegitimate use of violence.   No reasonable observer doubts that the Syrian regime’s apparent deployment of chemical weapons against its own people was yet another illegitimate step in a dictator’s barbaric campaign to retain power at any cost. So, all that remained was to illustrate the contrast with our own actions: to show that, when the United States employs violence, it does so not to violate international norms but to vindicate them not to cause suffering but to minimize it. But the Trump administration provided virtually none of that.
