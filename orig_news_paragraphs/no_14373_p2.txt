A second executive order, aimed at combating transnational drug cartels, prescribes steps for various federal agencies to "increase intelligence" sharing among law enforcement partners. The order also instructs an existing   working group to submit a report to Trump within four months detailing the progress made in combating criminal organizations, "along with any recommended actions for dismantling them." "Iâ€™m directing Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security to undertake all necessary and lawful action to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth and other people," Trump said Thursday. Finally, Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to use existing federal law to prosecute those who commit crimes against law enforcement officers.
