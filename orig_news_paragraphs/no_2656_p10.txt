In the early ’90s, support from the business community and the financial sector was seen as an important credential for Democrats looking to shed the   label that Republicans had been hanging around their necks," said Howard Wolfson, a top strategist for Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. The Clintons’ relationships with Wall Street deepened in the 2000s, when Mr. Clinton set up his foundation in Harlem and Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York. That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York   —   and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton.
