Will Carr (@WillCarrFNC) September 29, 2016,  A longer video, shot from the victimâ€™s perspective, shows the man standing in the crowd then being hit from behind, running from an angry mob, and then being beaten on the ground simply for wearing his MAGA hat.   The vicious attack happened on the second night of protests in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, where Black Lives Matter protesters are angered about the police shooting death of Alfred Olango, 38. El Cajon police say they shot and killed Olango after responding to a call from his sister that he was acting erratically. Olango refused to comply with police orders, then "assumed a shooting stance" with what appeared to be a gun, but later turned out to be a vape cigarette electronic device.
