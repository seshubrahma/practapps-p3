According to a White House statement, President Trump spoke with Mr. Putin on Monday and condemned the "attack" in Russia. Over the years, most terrorist attacks against domestic targets in Russia have been the work of Islamic insurgents. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a bomb that brought down a Russian airliner in Egypt in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board. Many victims were from St. Petersburg.
