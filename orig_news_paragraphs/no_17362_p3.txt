Falwell, an early and vocal supporter of Trump during the campaign, also likened the  ’s Cabinet to the 1992 Dream Team, the legendary collection of NBA superstars that won Olympic gold, including Michael Jordan and Larry Bird.    He said "The American people said no more amateurs" and compared Trump’s selection process to 1989, when the rules were changed to allow professional basketball players to compete in the Olympics.   " The United States put together the best NBA players," he said.
