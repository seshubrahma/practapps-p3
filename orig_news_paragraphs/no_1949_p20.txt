__ 8. Israel has arrested 22 people over the wildfires that erupted on Tuesday throughout the country and that are still burning. While unusually dry conditions and strong winds helped fan the flames, almost half of the fires are suspected of being arson. After Israeli officials hinted that they suspected Palestinians were behind the arsons, Arab leaders urged caution against blaming their community without proof.
