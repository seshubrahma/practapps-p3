A statement from the police said: All hate crimes are reviewed by a Detective Inspector and the MPS has also increased specialist investigators within the 32 London borough community safety units by 30 per cent, with more than 900 specialist members of staff dedicated to investigating all hate crime and domestic abuse crimes. With the average salary of a police officer in London standing at around £38, 000, this means the force is dedicating around £35m of resources to hate crime policing. We will not tolerate hate crime in #London and we will continue to support victims. There is a difference between an opinion and abuse pic.
