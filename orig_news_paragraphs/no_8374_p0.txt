Over the past 30 years, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and several of his businesses have been involved in an estimated 3, 500 legal actions in both federal and state courts, according to an analysis by USA Today. ["They range from skirmishes with casino patrons to   real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits," USA Today notes, adding the number of lawsuits "is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. "   Just since he announced his candidacy a year ago, at least 70 new cases have been filed, about evenly divided between lawsuits filed by him and his companies and those filed against them. And the records review found at least 50 civil lawsuits remain open even as he moves toward claiming the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in seven weeks.
