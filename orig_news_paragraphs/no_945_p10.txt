In a statement, Mr. Cordish said his real estate experience had taught him how to successfully meld public and private interests. The president also recently hired Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a Trump family friend, to work in the White House Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs. Mr. Giuliani, 31, who made headlines after he sued Duke University for kicking him off the college golf team, previously worked in sales and marketing at a small suburban New York financial firm. Personal relationships with the president often bestow a power exceeding official West Wing job titles.
