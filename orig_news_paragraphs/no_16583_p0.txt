Washington (CNN) Donald Trump gave an interview Thursday that aired on a television station funded by the Kremlin, arguing that the Russian government was "probably" not meddling in the American presidential race. Speaking to Larry King on RT America, which is an arm of   news outlet Russia Today, Trump said it would "not be appropriate" if Russian forces were looking to influence the race, which is suspected by some investigators and has been fanned by Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign as recently as Thursday morning.   He also suggested that the allegation was politically motivated.
