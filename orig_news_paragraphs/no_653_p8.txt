Mr. Trump turned sober questions from journalists into, at times, mesmerizing television. He attempted to reassert his command of "dishonest" journalists at a time when the news media is questioning his capacity to lead. It all made the brooding boss feel better, people close to Mr. Trump said. The news conference, they said, was Mr. Trumpâ€™s best effort at spitting the bit out of his mouth and escaping the bridle of the West Wing, where he views his only way to communicate his side of any argument is his   limited Twitter feed.
