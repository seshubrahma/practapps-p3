Finally, in 1980, Ronald Reagan made the GOP what it is today (at least officially) —  a conservative party. He assembled a   coalition of economic conservatives,   conservatives, and social conservatives. This alliance of supporters of free markets, strong national defense, and religious liberty and traditional family values formed an electoral coalition that gave Reagan two presidential wins —  the second (1984) being one of the most overwhelming landslides in history —  and began an era where Republicans controlled the White House more often than not, and starting in 1994 controlled Congress most of the time as well.
