Trump said Thursday that "something should happen" with regard to Assad, after referring to the deadly attack as a "heinous" and "horrific" act against innocent people the previous day. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it appears that Assad should have "no role" in governing the Syrian people, and that "steps are under way" for the United States   along with an international coalition    to remove the dictator. " We are considering an appropriate response for this chemicals weapons attack," Tillerson said.
