In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Crutcherâ€™s father, the Rev. Joey Crutcher, said his son had marched in protest of earlier police killings and had thought about how to protect himself during interactions with police officers. They had planned to go to a church event aimed at teaching people how behave around the police and avoid becoming another hashtag shared on social media by Black Lives Matter protesters. " I never thought this would happen to my family," Mr. Crutcher said, adding that he had counseled his son all his life about how to behave around the police.
