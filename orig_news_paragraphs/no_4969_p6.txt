The announcement by Home Depot comes on the heels of a higher than expected jobs report as hiring across the country measures in at its highest level in three years. On Wednesday the federal government reported that the number of private payrolls increased by 298, 000 in February, well above the original forecast of 187, 000. January also saw levels of hiring revised upward to 261, 000 jobs created. The country has experienced higher growth since Trump took office.
