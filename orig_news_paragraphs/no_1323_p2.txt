The petition invokes Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act. The section was last invoked by President George W. Bush in 2001 to start a legal process that led to American tariffs on steel imports the following year. A Section 201 case covers essentially all imports of a product from all over the world. That makes it more substantial than   and   cases against imports from a single country.
