 (CNN) Donald Trump and his advisers are defending the presumptive Republican presidential nominee after one of his tweets came under fire for evoking   stereotypes with a graphic that included dollar bills and a   star. Trump on Saturday tweeted and then deleted a graphic that branded Hillary Clinton the "most corrupt candidate" alongside a   star evoking the Star of David. But the uproar only increased on Sunday when reports emerged that the graphic had first been posted on an Internet message board loaded with   conspiracy theories and   ideology.
