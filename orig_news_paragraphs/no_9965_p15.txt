Reports note that under the Obama administration, morale has plummeted as ICE officers have been "handcuffed" from doing their jobs and enforcing U. S. immigration law. As Sen. Jeff Sessions has documented, President Obama systematically dismantled U. S. immigration law during his two terms in office. Whereas Trump has pledged that "after my inauguration, for the first time in decades, Americans will wake up in a country where their immigration laws are enforced," Hillary Clinton is running on an immigration campaign platform that is more extreme than even President Obama’s. As Breitbart News has previously reported, Clinton’s stated immigration proposals and campaign promises, if implemented, would essentially bring about the dissolution of our nation’s borders.
