 (CNN) A    girl on her way to school wailed as immigration agents took her handcuffed father away in a black car.   US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulled Romulo  â€™s vehicle over Tuesday about a half mile from a school where the undocumented immigrant from Mexico had just dropped off one of his daughters. The dad, 48, was driving daughter Fatima Avelica to another school in the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood of Highland Park when ICE stopped them.
