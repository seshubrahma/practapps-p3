While Rubio has pushed legislation that would help companies like Disney to bring in more even more   foreign replacement, Trump has called on Disney to hire back all of its American employees. In October, Trump declared, "I am calling TODAY on Disney to hire back every one of the workers they replaced, and I am calling on Rubio to immediately rescind his sponsorship of the   bill and apologize to every Floridian for endorsing it. I am further calling on Rubio to return the money he has received from Silicon Valley CEOs and to donate the money to a charity helping unemployed Americans whose jobs Rubio has helped to destroy. "
