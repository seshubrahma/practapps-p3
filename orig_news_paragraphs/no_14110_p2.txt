It’s a $3. 7 billion project that would join oil rich areas of North Dakota to Illinois, where it can then be distributed to other parts of America.   Under the Obama administration, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers approved the plan to build it last summer. But the Standing Rock Sioux, a Native American tribe whose reservation is near a pipeline construction site sued the government.   They said that the pipelines being built on sacred ground, that it would destroy Native American burial sites and that if it ruptures underneath Lake Oahe, where part of the pipe would run, it could contaminate the tribe’s water supply.
