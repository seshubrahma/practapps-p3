President Trump’s foreign policy was tested over a weekend of golf diplomacy with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan when North Korea launched a ballistic missile. Mr. Trump reacted with surprising restraint, intent on showing that he would not be baited into a confrontation. The president’s   positions are proving less radical than forecast on China and other countries. He meets with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada today and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday.
