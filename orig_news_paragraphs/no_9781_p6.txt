Please hug me. I am upset because those that define themselves as being the most principled are in reality the most hypocritical and dishonest. I am upset that the last few years cries of racism and enforcement of political correctness have become strategies to tear us apart and staple our mouths shut. I am upset that the effeminization of men has led to the demonization of women.
