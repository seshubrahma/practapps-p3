Trump took to Twitter earlier this week to first respond to Obama’s comment that he would have won the election, saying, "NO WAY!" "I am confident in this vision because I’m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could’ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it," Obama previously stated during a CNN podcast to David Axelrod. Trump also sent out a tweet roughly 10 minutes later defending Israel following the UN Security Council’s recent vote. We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.
