Witnesses say the driver plowed into the crowded market around the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a partly destroyed church whose bombed out spire was left in ruins as a reminder of the devastation of war. At this writing there is no confirmation that the incident, which left at least 12 people dead and 48 injured, was a terrorist attack, but it has all the hallmarks of one, closely resembling the deadly attack in the French city of Nice last July, which left 87 dead.   The Islamic State claimed one of its  "soldiers" carried out that attack, but it is unclear to what extent, if any, the perpetrator and the organization had worked together. In fact, it really takes just one individual to inflict enormous damage.
