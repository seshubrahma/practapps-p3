This Father’s Day, fathers whose sons were murdered by illegal aliens are calling on House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign   —   describing his policies as "treasonous" and taking particular objection to Ryan’s recent attempts to undermine Donald Trump’s proposals to enforce U. S. immigration law. ["I would invite Speaker Ryan to forsake spending Father’s Day with his kids to come down here to Houston and visit the place I will spend every Father’s Day for the rest of my life —   my American son’s grave. This way Speaker Ryan can see first hand what pandering to the cheap illegal labor lobby means to Americans who can’t afford to put a security fence up around their house," said Dan Golvach.
