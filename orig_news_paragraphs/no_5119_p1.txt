[After months of campaigning by 13 different candidates, the Conservative Party of Canada has selected former youngest ever Speaker of the House Andrew Scheer as the leader of the Tories and the official opposition. Thousands gathered in Toronto to vote in a preferential ballot system that saw Scheer beat libertarian favourite Maxime Bernier.   The leadership conference began with a speech from interim leader Rona Ambrose who took over party leadership after the resignation of former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2015. Ambrose talked about her various battles with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in parliament and touted the partyâ€™s success in getting the Trudeau government to recognise the genocide against the Yazidi people by Islamic State.
