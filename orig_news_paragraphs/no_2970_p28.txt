The two conventions basically happen back to back. It’ll be hard to read too much into the polls for a few weeks with the conventions (unless Trump leads coming out of Clinton’s convention, which would obviously be a very strong sign for him). The good news, though, is that the polls start getting fairly accurate a few weeks after the conventions. So that’s something to look forward to.
