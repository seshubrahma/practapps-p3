In his new memoir, "Hillbilly Elegy," Vance chronicles his childhood in a poor Rust Belt town in eastern Ohio, and, in turn, documents a culture in crisis. From a grandmother who in her youth fell pregnant at the age of 14 to a mother struggling with addiction and a father who was often absent, "Hillbilly Elegy" is Vance’s personal story. But it’s also a haunting account of the unique struggles of America’s white working class     the kind of people for whom, Vance emphasizes, the fervor for Donald Trump is particularly strong.
