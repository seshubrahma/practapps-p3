On Friday, the chairman of NBC News, Andrew Lack, sent an upbeat memo to his staff that declared the forum a success, noting that the event had generated days of headlines about Mr. Trump’s praise of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and criticism of the American military leadership. " Matt did a tremendous job   —   driving one of the most serious discussions to date on these topics," wrote Mr. Lack, who is close with Mr. Lauer.
