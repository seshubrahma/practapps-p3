The same polls show Mrs. Clinton leading among   white voters by 47 percent to 42 percent. It’s a reversal from 2012, when Mr. Romney led that group by six points, 52 percent to 46 percent in the final polls. Even modest additional gains for Mrs. Clinton among   white voters or nonwhite voters would quickly start to make things very challenging for Mr. Trump. If Mr. Trump lost five points among   white voters and Hispanics, which is how he’s doing in current polls, his target for white   voters would quickly skyrocket.
