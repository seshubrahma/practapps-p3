Flake, who has slammed Trump for his positions on immigration and his racially charged criticism of a Latino judge, reminded Trump that he is not up for   until 2018, according to two sources familiar with what occurred. " It was a bit tense," Flake told CNN Thursday afternoon. " He started out saying that I’d been critical of him, and I have been, frankly, but I think if somebody makes the kind of statements that he’s made against the judge from Indiana    calling him a Mexican in a pejorative way    and said the things about John McCain that he said, criticizing him for being captured, you know, that’s just beyond the pale to diminish the record of John McCain who spent five years as a prisoner of war.
