" President Obama’s retaliation, including the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, comes just three weeks shy of   Donald Trump being sworn in as President. Media outlets like NBC News have reported that the "CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Donald Trump win, and NBC News has reported that intelligence officials believe ‘with a high level of confidence’ that Putin was personally involved," but neither the intelligence community nor the Obama administration has produced any substantive proof that clearly links the Russian government to the hacking.
