Mrs. Clinton’s campaign took in $70 million from Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, compared with $86 million for the Trump campaign, of which $10 million came from the candidate’s own pocket. In terms of spending, Mrs. Clinton relied on the war chest she had built up during the course of the campaign to spend almost $131 million, compared with $94 million by Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton closed the period with under $1 million dollars in the bank, much less than the $7 million remaining for the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump may have tossed in a few million in the final weeks of his campaign, but he also took a few, soliciting donations from supporters, then reimbursing himself for rent and his airplane.
