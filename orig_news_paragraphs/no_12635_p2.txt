It was absurdly easy for Trump to breeze into the Republican Primary, pick up the immigration issue, and become the instant   while the Establishment’s   evangelist Jeb Bush spent millions and went nowhere. To cite another Breitbart News Daily interview from last week, Trump senior policy advisor Stephen Miller was pretty hot under the collar about Ted Cruz trying to steal Trump’s trade issue (insincerely, in Miller’s view) but Cruz at least deserves credit from the Trump faithful for trying.   He understands them well enough to make the appeals Miller denounced.   That’s far more respect than Republican base voters usually get from their own Party establishment, which prides itself on refusing to acknowledge voter anxiety about border security, visa abuse, or the damage done to the American workforce by sloppy trade deals.
