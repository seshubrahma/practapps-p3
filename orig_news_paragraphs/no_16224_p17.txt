Separately, a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a possible successor to Wasserman Schultz at the DNC helm, among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned.   Chants of "Debbie is done!" and "Debbie resigned!" broke out at a   rally Sunday in Philadelphia after the news was announced.   Party officials decided Saturday that Wasserman Schultz would not have a major speaking role or preside over daily convention proceedings this week. The DNC Rules Committee has named Rep. Marcia Fudge,   as permanent chair of the convention, according to a DNC source.
