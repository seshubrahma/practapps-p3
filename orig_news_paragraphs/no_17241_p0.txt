 (CNN) Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Saturday sounded support for retired Gen. James Mattis,   Donald Trump’s choice to be his successor, but at the same time he slammed Russia and offered a robust endorsement of traditional US alliances that Trump has at times criticized. " I’m committed to overseeing  the orderly transfer to the next commander in chief," Carter said in a speech at the Reagan Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.
