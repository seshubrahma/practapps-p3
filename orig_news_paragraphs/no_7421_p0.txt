President Barack Obama accuses Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of "whining," after his repeated statements on the upcoming presidential election being "rigged. " [At a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Obama says:  The notion that somehow if Mr. Trump loses Florida, it’s because of those people that you have to watch out for, that is both irresponsible and, by the way, doesn’t really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want out of a president. If you start whining before the game’s even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose, you start blaming somebody else, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job because there are a lot of times when things don’t go our way or my way.
