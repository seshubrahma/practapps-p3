However, the Obama administration frequently has used Twitter to conduct foreign policy. For example, under Obama, the  State Department used a Twitter account, "Think Again Turn Away," to counter propaganda from the   Islamic State. The Obama administration also used Twitter hashtag campaigns, such as "#UnitedforUkraine" and "#BringBackOurGirls," to confront various foreign policy crises. To echo @BarackObama   to stand #UnitedForUkraine   World should stand together with one voice pic.
