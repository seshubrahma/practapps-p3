â€™ Mattis traveled to Afghanistan late last month to give the Afghan government his recommendations for US involvement moving forward. At the time he declined to share what those recommendations were. But he did say "we are under no illusions about the challenges associated with this mission," adding that "2017 is going to be another tough year for the valiant Afghan security forces and the international troops who have stood and who will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with Afghanistan against terrorism."   US troops have been fighting for nearly 16 years in Afghanistan, where the government and its coalition allies are battling a resilient Taliban as well as other terror groups, including ISIS.
