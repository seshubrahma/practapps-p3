Mr. Navarro, for example, complains that Germany uses unequal treatment of a tax rebate on its exports to disadvantage American exports. Mr. Bannon told a visiting German diplomat that the White House viewed the European Union as a "flawed construct" and preferred to negotiate with Germany and other European countries one on one. The problem is that Germany, as a member of the European Union, cannot legally negotiate its own trade agreements with the United States. On Friday, another senior administration official who did not want to be identified conceded that point, saying that any new trade deal with Germany would have to be negotiated with the European Union.
