All of Obama’s predecessors since John F. Kennedy, whose administration saw annual growth of real GDP peak "at 6. 1 percent in 1962," have seen far more robust economic growth. Even the relatively poor economies of the Jimmy Carter administration, which saw annual growth in real GDP peak "at 5. 6 percent in 1978," and George W. Bush’s administration, which saw annual growth in real GDP peak "at 3. 8 percent in 2004," did better.
