"Zeng: You show up in front of the factories and see a lot of people waiting in line with their luggage. Thereâ€™s two members of the staff sitting at a table with their computer. You just walk up to them and they ask you for your ID, they swipe it and record it in their computer, and then, later on, they ask for your hand. They look at your hands to see whether they are intact, and then they ask you to recite the English alphabet.
