The Bush family, McCain, and Romney are illustrative of Republican elites who have been out of touch not only with the conservative base but the   independent "Reagan Democrats" who have decided every election since 1980. George H. W. Bush, after winning Ronald Reagan â€™s third term, then showed his true establishment colors by turning his back on conservatives by breaking his promise not to raise taxes. He lost his reelection bid to Bill Clinton.
