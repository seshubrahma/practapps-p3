Of course, some might argue that the "Mickey Mouse" quote was just a poor choice of words by a professor, and not at all reflective of 21 CF thinking. Perhaps, although it’s worth noting that The Hill (as in DC’s Capitol Hill) isn’t just another    publication. In fact, it is owned by the Finkelstein family of New York City, members in good standing of the Manhattan plutocracy. Which is to say, the Finkelsteins travel in the same jetstream as the big cheeses at 21 CF.
