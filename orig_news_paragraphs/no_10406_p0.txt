  immigration reformers are cheering the decision by Donald Trump’s team to renew its "hire American" labor policies amid their anger over the nomination of amnesty supporter Andrew Puzder to run the Department of Labor. ["I’m just overjoyed to see" the renewed promise by Trump’s team to favor American workers, said Roy Beck, founder of the reform group, NumbersUSA.   The announcement "reassured an awful lot of our members that the people at the top  around Trump who believe in his commitment to American workers have a lot of sway," he said.    Beck says senators should now question Puzder in his nomination hearings about how he would help companies hire Americans workers at higher wages by raising the productivity of American workers.
