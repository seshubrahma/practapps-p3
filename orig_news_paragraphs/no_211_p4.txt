Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, pointedly asked Mr. Mnuchin if he was using Cayman Islands corporations to avoid taxation. He responded that he was working on behalf of his clients, in accordance with the law. " Let me just be clear again: I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself," Mr. Mnuchin said.
