[The details about how and when the additional funds were sent are relevant to determining whether President Obama needed to pay Iran on the same day the hostages were released and whether the payment needed to be made in cash because the two countries had no banking relationship, as the president has said.   If the additional $1. 3 billion were transferred around the time of the $400 million, it could raise questions as to why the $400 million needed to be sent separately. And if the $1. 3 billion was not delivered in cash, it could raise further questions about the need for a cash drop off a mere hours before the hostages were set free by Tehran. It has been widely reported that the $400 million was part of a dispute that arose after Iran in the late 1970s had purchased U. S. fighter jets while Tehran was still an American ally.
