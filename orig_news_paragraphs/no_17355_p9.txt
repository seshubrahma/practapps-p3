" Russia hopes to weaken support for US military basing and deployments, and to undermine public support in Japan for increasing military preparedness," he said. But Putin isn’t the only world leader wooing Japan    his rare visit comes less than a month after Abe became the first world leader to meet with US   Donald Trump.
