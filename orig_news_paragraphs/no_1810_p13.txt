In an October 2014 email, Mr. Mook asked whether Mrs. Clinton’s name would be used in connection with the foundation, which is formally known as the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. " It will invite press scrutiny and she’ll be held accountable for what happens there," he wrote. The next year, when Mrs. Clinton was on the verge of declaring her candidacy, Cheryl D. Mills, a lawyer and top aide, said she discussed with Mrs. Clinton various "steps" to take to adjust her relationship with the foundation, including her resignation from the foundation’s board.
