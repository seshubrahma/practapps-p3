Cruz says Trump just calls people "liars" when they bring up his past policy statements. He says Trump’s positions would fit well in the Democratic party but Hillary will win if he is the GOP nominee. When asked if he is worried that Trump’s "branding power" is tripping him up, Cruz says he will have a strong super Tuesday and Trump is attacking him because he is the only candidate who can beat Trump and is the only candidate who has beaten him. Cruz says Trump goes "nasty" because he can’t respond with substance.
