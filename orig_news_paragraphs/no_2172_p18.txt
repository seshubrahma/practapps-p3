A projection by the consulting firm Oxford Economics, prepared for the National Retail Federation, predicted that a "disproportionate number of workers" who became eligible for overtime and worked more than 40 hours would "see their hourly rates decreased by an equal amount, leaving their total annual earnings unchanged. " By contrast, Daniel Hamermesh, a labor economist at the Institute for the Study of Labor, predicted that base wages would fall somewhat over time, but that the higher overtime payments would more than offset any loss in regular salary levels. The regulation, which President Obama directed the Labor Department to work on in 2014 and which the department first proposed last July, provoked a deluge of comments from the public  â€”   nearly 300, 000 in all.
