" I reminded my colleagues that the release of these documents could be imminent and that we would be wise wait to vote on Mr. Pruitt’s nomination until we had the opportunity to review them   —   and shame on us if we didn’t," said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee.
