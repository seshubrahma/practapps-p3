September 2nd 2016 was a very special day.   It was the day that the movie For Here or To Go? had a special private screening at the Rayburn House   one of the Buildings where Congressmen have their offices. Fresh off the heels of the announcement of International Entrepreneur Rules, this movie screening was so timely. The private screening was attended by staffers, lawyers, lobbyists and other influencers.
