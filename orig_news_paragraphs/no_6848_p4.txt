Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall at DOJ also asked Chief Justice John Roberts (who supervises the Fourth Circuit) to stay the appellate court’s decision until the justices can decide the matter. On Friday, the Supreme Court rapidly expedited everything. The ACLU —  which represents the plaintiffs —  have been ordered to file their response by 3:00 p. m. on Monday, June 12. The ACLU lawyers must also respond to DOJ’s application for a stay by that time.
