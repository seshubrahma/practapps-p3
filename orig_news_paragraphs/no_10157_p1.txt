Although it has been the practice of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Robert P. Corker Jr. (R. .) with nominations from President Barack Obama to only move forward when the committee is unanimous, Coons said there is no way the committee will be unanimous in support of Tillerson. Coons said he would not be surprised if there are Republican votes against Tillerson in committee, as well. Presidential nominees need a simple majority in the Senate for confirmation, but with the Republicans sitting with 52 votes, plus incoming   Michael R. Pence to break a tie, three GOP defectors are enough to torpedo a nominee. The senator said he has never met Tillerson, and he is aware that members of the   national security establishment such as former secretary of state Condoleeza Rice and former Pentagon chief Robert M. Gates have praised the oil man.
