The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program   —   and a series of executive actions announced in 2014  —   are partly the result of Congressman Gutiérrez’s consistent and persistent advocacy in Washington. Gutierrez was scheduled to speak after a morning session entitled: And Justice For All: The State of Black Immigrants and the Movement for Black Lives. Last week, Gutierrez told CNN "he won’t be attending the inauguration of   Trump in January, because of his plan to boost enforcement of U. S. immigration laws," the Washington Examiner reported: "I’m not going to this inauguration, I can’t go to this inauguration, because he continues to spew hatred, bigotry and prejudice even after he said he was going to bring us all together," Gutierrez said on CNN.
