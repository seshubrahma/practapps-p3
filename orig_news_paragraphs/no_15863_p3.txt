Sessions defended his decision to participate in the firing of former FBI Director Comey, even though he had recused himself from the Russian matter and Trump later said that the probe was in his mind when he pushed the FBI chief overboard.   " I recused myself from any investigation into the campaign for president, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations," he said. But the attorney general left Democratic senators deeply frustrated when he declined to go into the reasons for Comey’s dismissal and wouldn’t say whether the President ordered him out of the Oval Office so he could talk privately with Comey on February 14, in an encounter the former FBI director said included a request for him to go easy on former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
