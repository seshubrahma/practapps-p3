Meanwhile, some Democrats said they may be ready to issue subpoenas for Trump’s tax returns in order to find more answers in their continuing investigations. Sources on the Senate Intelligence Committee said they want all the potential Trump associates who allegedly spoke with Russian officials to testify before the committee. This includes former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former adviser Carter Page. It’s unclear when they would come before the committee, but senators say they haven’t ruled out the prospect of subpoenas if those Trump associates don’t comply.
