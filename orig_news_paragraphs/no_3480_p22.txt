A February 2016 poll of Republicans in South Carolina showed that: When the poll asked "Would you support or oppose banning Muslims from entering the United States? " 60 percent of the state’s GOP voters said they would support a ban. But only 29 percent of respondents said they would "support   …     shutting down mosques" in the United States, and only 25 percent said the disliked Islamic doctrines [of sharia] should be illegal. In June 2016, a poll of 803 registered voters was conducted by OpinionSavvy, via telephone, using automated questions, and with a margin of error of 3. 5 percent.
