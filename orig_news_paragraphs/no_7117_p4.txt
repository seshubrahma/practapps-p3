This isn’t the first time that Representative Culberson has championed Savage’s return to the United Kingdom. In 2011, he joined Representative Allen West ( ) in writing letters to Hillary Clinton urging State Department intervention on Savage’s behalf. In that letter, Culberson asked Clinton to forcefully request that the U. K. government immediately issue a travel visa to Savage. West’s letter made a similar case to the recent petition.
