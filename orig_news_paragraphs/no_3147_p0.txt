Sixty percent of adults feel "hopeful and optimistic" about the future of the country, a Wall Street   News poll released Sunday shows, while President Trump’s net approval rating is negative —  for now. [When asked, "When you think about the future of the country, would you say that you are mainly hopeful and optimistic or mainly worried and pessimistic," sixty percent of 1, 000 adults surveyed from Feb. 18 t0 Feb. 22 said they were hopeful, not pessimistic. That’s a steady upward drift from 53 percent in August, and 56 percent in December. Pollsters note the margin of error is plus or minus 3. 1 percentage points.
