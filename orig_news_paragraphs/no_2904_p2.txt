Mr. Trump has been especially unforthcoming, even as he has sought to turn health into an issue in the presidential race, questioning Mrs. Clinton â€™s "physical and mental strength and stamina" as his allies push unfounded rumors that she is ill. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said Monday that he would have "no problem releasing additional records" about his health if Mrs. Clinton did the same. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton, who has released more details than Mr. Trump, said the onus was on him to match her disclosures.
