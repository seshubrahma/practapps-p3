Other U. S. Education Department staff who have worked for Bush at his foundation include Neil Ruddock, former regional advocacy director at FEE, and Josh Venable, who is now "senior advisor to the secretary" at USED. Bush lost the GOP primary in 2016, in part because of his vocal support for the Common Core standards.
