On some weeks, the mine has had to operate on a   schedule because of the low demand for thermal coal, which is used to produce electric power.

Still, Mr. Clarkeâ€™s company has shifted away from thermal coal and is hunting for mines that produce the much more valuable metallurgical coal used in steel production.
