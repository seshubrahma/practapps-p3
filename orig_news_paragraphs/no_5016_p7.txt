I have every confidence that the Federalist Society is helping President Trump fulfill his pledge to appoint   justices. Truth is the   movement’s strongest ally in our fight to change hearts and minds in the culture while also building protections for the unborn into our nation’s law.   The names being surfaced as finalists for President Trump’s Supreme Court pick provide an historic opportunity to fill the Supreme Court with strong Constitutionalists who would defend the right to life of Americans born and unborn.
