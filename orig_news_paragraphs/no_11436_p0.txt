Wednesday on Newsmax TV’s "Newsmax Prime," former senior adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan Pat Buchanan said Sens. John McCain ( ) Lindsey Graham ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) are motivated by "hostility" toward   Donald Trump from the 2016 Republican presidential primary to oppose the nomination of Trump’s secretary of state pick, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson.   Buchanan said "Tillerson to me represents the point of view of Trump, who wants to work out some deals with Russia just as Nixon wanted to work out deals with China. To do that you have got to have somebody who can speak to them. I think that Trump is entitled to have his secretary of state he wants and the adviser he wants.
