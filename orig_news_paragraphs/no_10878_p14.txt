Tehran ended up smashing the international sanctions regime and taking delivery of pallets full of cash from Obama. They don’t seem to have been much troubled by his accusations of hypocrisy. Of course, no one will ever forget Obama’s "red line" against Syrian chemical weapons, or the way he cravenly backed away when Assad called his bluff. Obama tried to make it seem ambiguous whether he had actually drawn a line Assad must not cross, but there was nothing ambiguous about the language employed by the President when the first intel reports that Damascus was preparing to unleash WMD came in.
