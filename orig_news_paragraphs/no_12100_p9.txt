Rick Manning, President of Americans for Limited Government, blasted GM’s decision in a statement to Breitbart News. When the Bush Administration bailed out GM there was an implicit agreement that they would build cars here.   GM’s decision to manufacture vehicles in China was an insult, but it takes real chutzpah to import those very cars to compete against American made autos that don’t necessarily have a US companies nameplate. This is an inexcusable slap in the face of American workers and taxpayers.
