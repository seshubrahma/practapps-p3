2004 controversy, Kushner is no stranger to controversy or the media glare. His life took dramatic turn in 2004 when his father Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and top Democratic campaign donor, was arrested and charged with federal crimes, including tax evasion, witness tampering and campaign finance violations. The elder Kushner would strike a plea deal and serve two years in prison, catapulting his son to the heights of power in the family’s   real estate development firm. Kushner’s father was prosecuted by   Attorney Chris Christie.
