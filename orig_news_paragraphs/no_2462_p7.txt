Federal officials, led by the Secret Service, are overseeing an array of security restrictions. The Federal Aviation Administration has limited pilots around Palm Beach, and the Coast Guard established three security zones for the Intracoastal Waterway and offshore areas near Palm Beach. " The security zone is necessary to protect the V. I. P. and accompanying official party, the public and the surrounding waterway from terrorist acts, sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents or other causes of a similar nature," the Coast Guard said in a statement.
