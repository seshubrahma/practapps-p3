Sammon’s daughter, Brooke Sammon, is Rubio’s national press secretary, and obviously both have a vested interest in the success of the Rubio campaign and the demise of the other campaigns. CNN’s Erin Burnett asked Lewandowski about Fox News’s controversial   statement from Tuesday evening —  and specifically the network’s claim that the top Trump aide had allegedly made threats against Fox News anchor and Thursday debate   Megyn Kelly —  when he responded by dropping the explosive revelation. Lewandowski revealed two things for the first time: that the executive he was discussing matters with was Bill Sammon, and that Sammon’s daughter Brooke Sammon works for Rubio’s campaign, giving the   Floridian Senator an obvious boost. That blatant conflict of interest has never before been disclosed to the viewers of Fox News by the network.
