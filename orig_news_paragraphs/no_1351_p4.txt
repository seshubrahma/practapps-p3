Before Mr. Trump’s crushing victory in Pennsylvania last week, Mr. Cruz’s campaign boasted that it had 69 people devoted to acquiring as many as possible of the state’s 54 unbound delegates  —   who are free to vote as they please on the first ballot, making them potentially decisive players in a contested convention.
