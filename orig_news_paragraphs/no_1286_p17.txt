The Tribune’s first article said that the university, owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, investigated students who reported sex crimes   —   and sometimes disciplined them for breaking rules on curfews and dress codes. The Tribune also found that the school’s Title IX office, to which students could report sexual assaults, regularly alerted the honor code office, which looked into the rule violations. In November, Brigham Young took steps to restructure the Title IX office.
