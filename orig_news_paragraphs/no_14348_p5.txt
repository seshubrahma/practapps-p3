Virginia GOP Rep. Dave Brat blamed professional advocates from outside his district for interfering with his office’s work.    "My constituents are trying to get in on Social Security and all kinds of other issues and they can’t get in because when you get 30, 000 hits by paid activists, from (George) Soros and indivisible and resistance, etc. I can sort it out. So it’s a real issue," he said.
