If youâ€™re planning to attend the inaugural festivities, bring your rain jacket or poncho, because you may need to leave your umbrellas at home. The National Park Service has revised its policy due to the rain forecast, and will allow small, collapsible "Totes" style umbrellas for the parade route and on the National Mall, but umbrellas are still prohibited for all ticketed areas on Capitol grounds (along with a bunch of other items you can see here).   Though the forecast looks wet, it could be worse. Temperatures will be above average, topping out in the upper 40s.
