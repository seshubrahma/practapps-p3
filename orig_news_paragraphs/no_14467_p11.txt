INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, An ongoing investigation into Russia’s activities in the US     following the country’s alleged interference in the 2016 US election    has opened up a Pandora’s box for the Trump administration.   Flynn’s resignation came after reports emerged that the Justice Department had told the White House about Flynn’s phone calls with the ambassador.   Just two days later, law enforcement, administration and intelligence officials told CNN that   advisers close to Trump were in constant communication with Russians known to US intelligence during the election campaign.
