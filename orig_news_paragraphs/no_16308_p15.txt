Barack Obama won Nebraska’s second district in 2008, the first time a Democrat had split Nebraska. While Obama lost the district in 2012, the city has grown more diverse and more educated since then, both demographics that Clinton does well with. What’s more, Democratic Rep. Brad Ashford won the district in 2014, defeating GOP Rep. Lee Terry, who had held the seat for 16 years. Buffett acknowledged this special status on Monday when he said he is launching a campaign to help people get to the polls.
