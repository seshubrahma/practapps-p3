A spokesperson for Kushner Companies said last week that the two entities had "mutually agreed" to end talks about such a deal.   It takes a good deal of chutzpah to court investment from a company with ties to the Chinese government when your    is one of two people competing to become President of the United States. It seems Kushner’s audacity rivals the nerve Trump himself has exhibited throughout his life. (Trump’s continuous claim to be an excellent businessman despite his four bankruptcies is Exhibit A of that attitude.)
