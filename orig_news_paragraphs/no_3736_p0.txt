The Tacoma Public School Superintendent is now demanding "safe zones" for migrant students after President Donald Trumpâ€™s immigration executive orders were signed earlier last week. [Superintendent Carla Santorno told parents of the Tacoma School District in a letter, that she would like to see safe zones for students so they can be hidden from federal immigration officials, should authorities show up to any schools looking to deport them.   " Our schools will be a safe zone for immigrant students to learn and thrive," Santorno wrote.
