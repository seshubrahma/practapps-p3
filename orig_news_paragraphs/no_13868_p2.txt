Melania Trump’s plagiarized convention speech. A (successful) effort to sneak Donald Trump’s second wife, Marla Maples, into the convention via a loading dock so she wouldn’t appear in the Trump family box but could still watch her daughter, Tiffany Trump, deliver a speech. And a very public feud between Trump’s   chairman, Paul Manafort, and his ousted campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Amid all the madness, delegates made it official Tuesday evening: Trump was the Republican nominee for president.
