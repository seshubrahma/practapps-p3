—   is that Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton, must make the next Supreme Court appointments. Yes, I know: There is no way to guarantee that Donald Trump will make the same appointments to the Supreme Court that Ted Cruz or Tom Tancredo would make.

But what is guaranteed is that Trump’s appointments to federal courts will be 1, 000 percent better than Hillary Clinton’s.
