Russia, which sent armed forces to Syria in 2015 to bolster Mr. Assad against insurgents, denied that his government was behind the chemical attack on Tuesday in Idlib Province that left more than 80 people dead, calling that a pretext. Instead, Moscow said a conventional strike had hit a chemical weapons warehouse controlled by insurgents, an explanation dismissed in the West. " The Syrian Army has no chemical weapons at its disposal," said Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, blaming "terrorists" for the attack.
