Let me say this about TPA. I believe that President Obama should have the negotiating authority to conclude a transpacific agreement that works for the American middle class and advances American leadership. But I don’t believe we should give an   fast track to the next president. I hope I’m the next president, and I think I should have to justify fast track to the new Congress.
