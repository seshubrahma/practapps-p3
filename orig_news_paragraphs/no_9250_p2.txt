The campaign also released her weekly podcast, with her daughter Chelsea Clinton as a featured guest. The Democratic nominee didnâ€™t even address the riots on Twitter or social media on Thursday. Clinton criticized the shooting during a rally on Wednesday, calling it an "unbearable" situation that "needs to become intolerable" but did not mention the rioting. Earlier in the week, Clinton vowed to Steve Harvey that she would be able to speak "directly to white people" to help stop racial police shootings.
