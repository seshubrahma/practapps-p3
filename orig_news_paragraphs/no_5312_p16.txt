The inflow of contract workers forces down wages paid to Americans and immigrants, partly because the inflow reduces wage pressure on   and   employers. Moreover, many of the contract workers rationally and decently will take jobs are low wages because their employers can promise to eventually reward them with the massively valuable deferred bonus of a green card and then U. S. citizenship. Each year, companies request and receive 140, 000 green cards for their   employees and their families, further boosting the supply of professionals in the   labor market. Employers say they need the foreign workers because they canâ€™t hire enough Americans for   jobs, even at wages of $12 per hour or higher.
