President Obama, with the help of Panetta and Clinton, prolonged the war in Afghanistan and started a new one in Iraq despite his campaign promises to end both conflicts. More U. S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan under Obama’s watch than under his predecessor. During his speech, Panetta condemned Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the comments he made about Russia earlier Wednesday. Panetta said: Donald Trump today once again took Russia’s side.
