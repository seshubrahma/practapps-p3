In a significant omission, the new administration early on did not ask cabinet nominees and top White House officials to fill out the "sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll" questionnaire that has become a routine part of the nomination process. The questionnaire was used by the past two administrations to help conduct the early vetting of potential cabinet nominees. In addition to trying to determine potential financial and professional conflicts of interest, the questions concern areas of potential blackmail, past criminal investigations, and whether taxes have been paid for nannies and hired help. The goal is to have the most serious issues facing a potential candidate figured out well before the F. B. I. conducts background checks and before financial disclosure statements are filed with the Office of Government Ethics.
