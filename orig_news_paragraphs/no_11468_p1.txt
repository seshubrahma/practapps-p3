Four presidential candidates registered support in the poll, with Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton at 44 percemt, Trump at 42 percent, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson at 5 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 1 percent.   The five previous polls of a   matchup in New Hampshire had shown Libertarian candidate Johnson with   support ranging from   percent. Trump was twice as likely to be named as the "second" choice for respondents supporting either Johnson or Stein. The Boston   University poll suggests that a series of embarrassing gaffes are taking a toll on Johnson in New Hampshire and that Trump is the primary beneficiary.
