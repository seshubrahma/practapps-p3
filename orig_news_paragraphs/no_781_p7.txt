Mr. Bush also urged tolerance when asked about Mr. Trump’s efforts to temporarily ban travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. As president, Mr. Bush made a point of visiting a mosque after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and regularly insisted that the United States was not at war with Islam. " It’s very important for all of us to recognize one of our great strengths is for people to worship the way they want to or not worship at all," Mr. Bush said.
