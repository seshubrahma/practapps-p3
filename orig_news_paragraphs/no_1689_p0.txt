Donald J. Trump said on Thursday that the pastor who interrupted his remarks at an   church in Flint, Mich. was "a nervous mess" when she introduced him and that he thought "something was up" with her. During his visit to Bethel United Methodist Church on Wednesday, Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, started to assail his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for being a failure. As he spoke, the Rev. Faith Green Timmons came over to him and said, "Mr. Trump, I invited you here to thank us," and added, "not make a political speech. "
