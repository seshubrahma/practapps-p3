This Russia scandal is   currently somewhere around a 5 or 6, in my opinion, but it is   cascading in intensity seemingly by the hour. And we may look   back and see, in the end, that it is at least as big as   Watergate. It may become the measure by which all future scandals   are judged. It has all the necessary ingredients, and that is   chilling.
