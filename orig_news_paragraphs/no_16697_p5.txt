Mr. Trump has in fact admitted that the payment to Attorney General Bondi was a mistake, and has repaid the foundation that amount, along with offering the IRS a payment to cover a potential penalty tax. So far, he and his campaign have flatly denied any wrongdoing with respect to the other transactions, including the payments to settle the legal claims brought against his businesses, however.    This is despite the fact that any use of a private foundationâ€™s assets by its insiders for their own benefit is clearly   which Congress prohibited for such foundations back in 1969.   The Clinton Foundation is actually subject to a   prohibition on providing private benefit to insiders or others, because despite its name under the law it is not a "private foundation" since it enjoys relatively   donor support.
