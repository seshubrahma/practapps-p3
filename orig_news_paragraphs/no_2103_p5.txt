If he goes for someone like Robert Pence, a Virginia developer who did not support Mr. Trumpâ€™s candidacy but who has been recommended by Vice   Mike Pence, it would fall more in line with his choice of Ms. Haley and of bringing outsiders into the fold.

The expectation is that Mr. Trump will begin by rewarding supporters with appointments to Western Europe or the Caribbean, as is often the case with new administrations. But they could also include donors to his campaign or transition, people he might need again in the future.
