Just this week, Putin told Russiaâ€™s intelligence service, the FSB, that NATO was "provoking us constantly and . .. trying to draw us into confrontation," with "continued attempts to interfere in our internal affairs in a bid to destabilize the social and political situation in Russia itself," according to Russia Today. Russia, he told the FSB, was the true victim of espionage and a growing tide of cyberattacks. " Many existing threats and challenges have only become more acute," Putin warned.
