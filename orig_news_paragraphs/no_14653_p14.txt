Hughes spent most of her adolescence hospitalized, as she became so sick that she could barely walk and suffered immense pain. Her body was evaluated, treated and studied at the National Institutes of Health in collaboration with her doctors from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.   Yet relief came in 2014, when Hughes received a   adult stem cell treatment that was not approved in the United States.   For the procedure, Hughes had her own healthy stem cells cultured at the   biotechnology company Celltex Therapeutics in Houston.
