Just days before the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Pope Francis has sent a message of support to the March for Life taking place in Paris, France, on Sunday. ["The Church must never tire of being an advocate for life and must not neglect to proclaim that human life is to be protected unconditionally from the moment of conception until natural death," the Pope’s message said.   Pope Francis has been a vocal critic of the abortion industry, comparing it to King Herod’s slaughter of the innocents at the time of Jesus, and accusing the abortion lobby of working with a   mentality that seeks to eliminate those who get in one’s way. In his message to   marchers, Francis expressed his solidarity with their efforts and urged them to continue to proclaim the value of human life.
