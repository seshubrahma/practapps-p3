In Austria’s national elections in December, Alexander Van der Bellen, the Green Party candidate, triumphed narrowly over Norbert Hofer of the   Freedom Party, after getting a majority in nine of Austria’s 10 largest cities the Freedom Party, by contrast, won most rural districts handily. In Britain, those who voted to leave the European Union were concentrated in rural areas. The same goes for the support base of France’s   leader Marine Le Pen. Donald Trump lost cities by historic margins but made up for that with his rural support base.
