Just a few weeks after the San Bernardino terrorist attack carried out by the child of Pakistani migrants and his jihadi bride who came to the country on a   "finance" visa, Ryan pushed to expand Muslim migration and fund visas for nearly 300, 000 (temporary and permanent) Muslim migrants for this year alone. In violation of a promise he had made to the Republican lawmakers in exchange for their support for him as House Speaker, Ryan also funded an expansion of the controversial   visa program for unskilled guest workers. At the time, one GOP aide told Breitbart News that Ryanâ€™s expansion to the   program "is a knife in the heart of the working class, and African Americans," who depend on the jobs now to be filled by   foreign workers.
