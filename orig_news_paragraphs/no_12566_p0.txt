This week on Boston’s AM680 WKRO’s "The Kuhner Report," Republican presidential   Donald Trump told host Jeff Kuhner he thought he can win the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and Massachusetts in the general presidential election against the Democratic   Hillary Clinton.   Trump said, "They say that if I run against Hillary it will be the single greatest turnout in our country for voting. A lot of those people are going to vote for me because they are tired of the system. That’s why they never voted before.
