The list is shortening for both sides. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign is considering a handful of prospective running mates, with Clinton privately signaling she is less concerned about choosing someone who fills a specific liberal or progressive void in favor of a partner who is fully prepared for the job and has a strong camaraderie with her. Clinton has not yet conducted formal interviews, but has devoted hours studying the records and backgrounds of several Democrats on a list that includes Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro of Texas.
