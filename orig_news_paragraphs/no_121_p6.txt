Part of the mission statement of the Women’s March calls on "immigrants of all statuses" to attend, but that event has a broader platform that includes issues of pay equity, reproductive rights and safety from domestic violence. Organizers of the immigrant rally said that their protest aims to highlight the disparate groups who make up their movement, and who represent the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the United States. " It’s of the immigrant community, of people of color, it’s broader than people who are first generation," said Muzna Ansari, 28, the immigrant policy manager for the New York Immigration Coalition.
