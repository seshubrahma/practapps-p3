Two families decided to withdraw their children from the JCC’s early childhood education program, Harlev said.   In Albany, Orlando and elsewhere, JCC staffers have tried to bolster security    and ease parents’ peace of mind    by closing entrances, blocking phone calls from unknown numbers and posting bollards to block vehicles from getting close to their buildings.   At least one family was satisfied by the changes.   For nearly four years, Melissa Braillard, a mother of two in Orlando, had sent her children to the JCC.
