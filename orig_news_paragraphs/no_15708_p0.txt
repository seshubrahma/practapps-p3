Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is expected to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, two senior US officials familiar with his plans told CNN Wednesday, a major break from international partners that would isolate the United States in global efforts to curb global warming. The decision would put the US at odds with nearly every other nation on earth. It would reflect a major reversal of the Obama administrationâ€™s efforts on climate change.
