The sources said that Green’s withdrawal is not finalized, but it’s unlikely he would go forward because "there are questions whether he has enough support from either side of the aisle" to get confirmed, according to one source. Darren Morris, a political adviser to Green, said the notion he was withdrawing was "completely, absolutely untrue," and that he’s prepping for the confirmation hearing this week in Washington. The Department of Defense referred CNN to the White House, which declined to comment. If Green were to withdraw, however, the Tennessee state senator would be the third military service secretary to drop out after being selected by Trump    and the second Army secretary nominee    adding to the Trump administration’s troubles appointing officials to key national security posts.
