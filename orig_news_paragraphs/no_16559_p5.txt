But late last month in Sioux City, Iowa, Grassley seemed to soften and suggested to a Rotary Club audience that his stance might change if a large number of senators strongly urged him to consider the nomination, the Globe Gazette reported.   Beth Levine, Grassley’s spokesperson, said later there had been no shift. She reiterated that Grassley believes a hearing should occur after a new president is sworn in. " Giving the people a voice is the position of 52 of 54 Republican senators and he doesn’t foresee any shift in that position," Levine said.
