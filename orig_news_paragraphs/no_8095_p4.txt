For those who wished to watch the lecture, but weren’t able to get a seat, a live video feed of the event was played in a nearby classroom.   Yiannopoulos spoke for approximately 25 minutes before turning to students for questions. Students asked about political correctness, feminism, and Donald Trump. Perhaps the most significant portion of Milo’s visit to Emory came after his lecture, when he lead students outside into the nearby Asbury Circle section of campus to chalk up the sidewalks.
