After the Trump casinos filed for bankruptcy protection in 2004 for the third time, state officials noticed the company had not been filling out the required schedule for the minimum tax assessment. The Trump casinos had reported losing money and paid a little more than $600, 000 in state income taxes in 2002, and only $1, 500 in 2003. State auditors determined that the Trump casinos should have paid $8. 8 million in alternative minimum taxes for those two years, according to court records.
