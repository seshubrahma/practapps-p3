Mr. Nierenberg is a bit of an eccentric, according to Oregon Live: Nierenberg also made a splash promoting interfaith relations in 2001 when several Republican legislators in Olympia blocked funding for buses to transport   students to see the Dalai Lama speak in Portland. Nierenberg helped pay the transportation costs, saying he didn’t want the kids to miss seeing the famous Tibetan leader. Nierenberg’s outgoing personality  —   and wealth   —   have made him a   figure in Clark County.
