In February, Mr. Olmert became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison. He is serving a   term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Mr. Netanyahu described Mr. Olmert in 2008 as a "prime minister up to his neck in investigations" and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests. Since the 1990s, Mr. Netanyahuâ€™s political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct, and that of people around him, though no charges have been filed against him.
