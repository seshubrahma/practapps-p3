The result was an electoral massacre of the Democrats, as Republicans solidified control of the U. S. House, U. S. Senate, and many state governments. But in 1932, President Franklin Roosevelt made the Democratic Party the party of the New Deal. Republicans fought the New Deal for five presidential elections, until in 1952 the GOP nominated Dwight Eisenhower, an unapologetic moderate. He remade the Republican Party into one that embraced the New Deal, and this bipartisan support guaranteed that FDRâ€™s signature programs would become a permanent feature of American life.
