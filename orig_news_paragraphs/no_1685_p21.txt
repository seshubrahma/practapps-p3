Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, also released a doctor’s letter Wednesday, saying he was in excellent health and worked out three times a week. Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician to Congress, said Mr. Kaine’s cholesterol and blood lipids were elevated, but made no mention of a statin drug. The upper chamber of the left side of Mr. Kaine’s heart is enlarged, but Dr. Monahan noted nothing else unusual about his heart or major arteries. Mrs. Clinton’s disclosures may help her campaign bat down rumors about her health that have been driven by conservative news outlets with Mr. Trump’s encouragement.
