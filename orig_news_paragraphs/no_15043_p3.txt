During the presidential campaign, few international relations issues were discussed. Trump did repeatedly speak about the threat of ISIS and its sister terror organization al Qaeda. There are US military forces in Iraq, Syria and Yemen (and many other places on the globe some Americans couldnâ€™t find on a map) actively conducting operations against these groups according to a plan that has not changed under Trump.   We also still have almost 10, 000 soldiers conducting operations to support the Afghan government, which is a fight against the Taliban, al Qaeda and several other organizations.
