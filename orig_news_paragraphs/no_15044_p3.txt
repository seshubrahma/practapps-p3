As president, Trump has not said whether he will go to Congress to ask for approval, should he want to authorize military action. Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill said Thursday they support Trump asking them for approval before moving on Assad.   As Trump has made clear, though, he would rather surprise Syria with action and not telegraph what he plans to do.   When Obama considered and eventually backed away from action, Trump knocked him for signaling his plans.
