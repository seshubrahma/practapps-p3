Bill Clinton negotiated a deal that permitted China to enter the WTO in 2001 and liberalized bilateral trade, but as implemented the arrangement is hardly fair or balanced. China’s average tariff on imports is 9. 6 percent, whereas the U. S. average levy is 3. 5 percent. Particularly important, foreign governments often push down the value of their currencies against the dollar to make their exports cheaper on American store shelves and U. S. products artificially more expensive in their markets. According to the World Bank, if China’s currency were trading at a rate that actually reflected the cost of buying goods and services in China, it would cost 3. 5 yuan to purchase 1 dollar but instead it costs about 6. 7.
