 (CNN) Ivanka Trump cut short an interview with Cosmopolitan published Wednesday after being asked about some of Donald Trump’s past comments about childcare and maternity leave.   Trump criticized the interviewer for having "a lot of negativity" in her questions. Trump had hoped to highlight the Republican presidential nominee’s new childcare policy, which she helped craft and introduce this week.
