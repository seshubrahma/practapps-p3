Those figures, and the exact number of this year’s projected increase, will be revealed in a budget that the government releases on Sunday, when the national legislature starts its annual full session. Before 2016, the military budget had received   increases for six years, a reflection of China’s   economy. Chinese experts said the new budget would keep military spending roughly in line with the government’s usual formula of G. D. P. growth plus inflation. As China’s economy continues to slow, annual growth in the gross domestic product is expected to be about 6. 5 percent.
