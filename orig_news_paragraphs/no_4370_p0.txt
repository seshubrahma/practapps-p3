James Rosen of Fox News reports that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee will be presented with "smoking gun" evidence that "the Obama administration, in its closing days, was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on   Trump. " [According to the source for Rosenâ€™s report, this evidence will come from the National Security Agency, which is supposed to produce documents for the House Intelligence Committee by Friday. It is expected to take a week or so for congressional investigators to assess these materials.   The NSA material is said to be even more compelling than the evidence that prompted committee chairman Devin Nunes ( ) to announce on Wednesday that "incidental" surveillance of the Trump transition team was conducted by the intelligence community.
