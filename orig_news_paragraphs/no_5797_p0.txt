President Donald Trump went    with the media in a lengthy press conference, accusing them of covering the first weeks of his administration unfairly. ["The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about [it] we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people," Trump said during his press conference in the East Room. " We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. "
