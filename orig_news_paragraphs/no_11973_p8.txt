In a newsmaking interview, conducted on Klein’s radio show Sunday night, Paula Jones, the former Arkansas state employee who notoriously sued President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment, warned about Hillary making it to the White House. During the interview, Jones demanded that Hillary Clinton personally apologize for "allowing" her husband to "abuse" and "sexually harass" women. Jones slammed Hillary as a " " "liar" who waged a war on women by trying to discredit "predator" Bill’s sexual accusers. She further accused the media of practicing a double standard by "protecting" the Clintons while deservedly scrutinizing Bill Cosby’s alleged sexual assaults.
