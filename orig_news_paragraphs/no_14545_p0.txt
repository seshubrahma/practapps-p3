Washington (CNN) In a town full of talkers, the silence is deafening.   For more than a month, as the US has tangled with China, floated new terms for Middle East peace, watched North Korea test a ballistic missile and proposed an overhaul of ties with Russia, the State Department has been quiet. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made his debut on the international stage over two days in Europe last week    and said less than 50 words in response to press questions, according to pool accounts.
