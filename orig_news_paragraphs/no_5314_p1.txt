The National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action ( ) today announced it is supporting, along with the California Rifle and Pistol Association (CRPA) an important Second Amendment lawsuit challenging Californiaâ€™s newly expanded Assault Weapons Control Act (AWCA). The suit, Rupp v. Becerra, seeks to have the courts declare the AWCA unconstitutional because the   law will do nothing to stop terrorists or violent criminals, and infringes on the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. The Los Angeles Times reports that the suit is the first in a "series" that the NRA plans to file, now that Gorsuch is on the bench. President Trump campaigned on using SCOTUS to save the Second Amendment.
