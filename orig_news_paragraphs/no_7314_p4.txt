Democrats from blue states, purple states and red states are going to link arm in arm to protect Medicare for our seniors and ensure Republicans don’t succeed in putting our seniors’ health care at risk. As we have said many times, there will be issues where we can work with the   and his party, but privatizing Medicare is not, certainly not, one of those issues. We’re going to fight tooth and nail any attempt to privatize, voucherize or any other ize you can think of, when it comes to Medicare. To Republicans considering going down this path, my advice is simple, turn back.
