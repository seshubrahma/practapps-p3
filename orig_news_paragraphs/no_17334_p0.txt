New York (CNN) The lobby of Trump Tower rolled out the figurative red carpet Tuesday as   Donald Trump welcomed a celebrity guest list for meetings as he prepares to take office.   The parade of big names past the assembled press, gawking   and tourists included rapper Kanye West, football legends Jim Brown and Ray Lewis, Trump backer and reality TV star Omarosa Manigault and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates.   Trump has been spending nearly all his days since the election in his upper floor office in Trump Tower holding meetings on his presidential transition.
