The roundabout marked by Mexico’s Angel of Independence was surrounded by protesters calling Trump a fascist, racist and xenophobe. Carrying signs that said "Make America human again" and "Love trumps hate," protesters chanted "Get out Trump." Juan Carlos Guerrero wore a souvenir   from Barack Obama’s first presidential inauguration and asked two things of Trump: respect and a change in tone on NAFTA, the   agreement Trump has threatened to eliminate to keep US jobs from moving to Mexico. Marquis Staples traveled to Mexico City from Wisconsin to make sure Mexicans know there is opposition to Trump in the United States.
