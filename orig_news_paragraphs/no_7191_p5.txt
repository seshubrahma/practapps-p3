This mural boasts of a community "protecting and defending your human rights," despite the country having a poor human rights record, particularly in terms of freedom of expression, as many opponents of the government have been jailed. Just this week, the government touted the release from jail of an opposition activist as a sign of progress he served two years for his role in organizing   protests.     propaganda is also rife, with the country’s socialist government regularly using ‘American Imperialism’ as an excuse for the country’s collapsing economy.    Venezuelans recently gave a vote of no confidence in the government as part of a recall referendum, which was consequently crushed by Hugo Chavez’s chosen successor, and now dictator Nicolas Maduro.
