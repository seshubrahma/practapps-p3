More than 900, 000 donors gave to Clinton’s campaign last month, bringing the total number of donors who have given to the campaign to around 2. 6 million. The average donation was about $56, the campaign said. " With Donald Trump promising to dump an additional $50 million of his own money into the campaign and   billionaires pledging millions more, we must continue to step up in order to have the resources we need to mobilize millions of voters across the country," said Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager.
