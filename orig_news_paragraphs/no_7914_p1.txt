I just think it just backfired on them," said Jerry Fawell Jr. an attorney, who succeeded his father at the helm of the Lynchburg, Virginia college.   On Monday, the Speaker told members of the Republican House Conference that he would not campaign with Trump, nor would he defend Trump, according to an NBC News report based on a background conversation with a Ryan spokesman. NBC was the owner of the Access Hollywo0d tape that The Washington Post released Friday revealing the GOP nominee using direct and foul language in reference to courtship and the way women interact with celebrities. Falwell told Cosby he was upset by the tape and how it was received by members of his family, but it did not shake his support for the New York City developer.
