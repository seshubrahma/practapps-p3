President Obama has done nothing in the Syrian conflict and little in the global war on Islamic State, which has resulted in over 400, 000 deaths in Syria alone and displacing millions under his Presidency. Prolonging the war costs lives and money. A   foreign policy as we have seen under President Obama and Hillaryâ€™s State Department is dangerous, not Donald Trump. Donald Trump would win and end the war against Islamic State, ultimately saving lives.
