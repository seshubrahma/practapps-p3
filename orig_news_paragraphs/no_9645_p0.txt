President Barack Obama ’s aggressive new federal transgender rules require 55 million   kids and teachers to speak in a new   dialect, to ignore what science says about sex, and to comply with   orders whenever even one teen in their school claims to have a "gender identity" problem. [Obama described the new federal agency directive and instructions, which were announced May 9, as "here’s how there are schools that have been wrestling with this problem, and have, we think, done a good job in accommodating them in a way that is good for everybody. "   The documents cite examples from     schools in New York, D. C. California and elsewhere, that Obama is now imposing on all 100, 000   schools and their 55 million American kids and teenagers.
