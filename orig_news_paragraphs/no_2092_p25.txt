The drone incident, according to a Pentagon account, began when a Chinese Navy vessel that was shadowing the Bowditch  —   a common practice in the South China Sea  —   pulled up not far from the ship. It then dispatched a small boat to seize the drone as the American crew was recovering it from the water. The Pentagon described the vehicle as an unclassified "ocean glider" system used to gather military oceanographic data such as salinity, water temperature and sound speed. An American naval expert did not disagree with Mr. Wu’s notion of what the Americans were probably doing.
