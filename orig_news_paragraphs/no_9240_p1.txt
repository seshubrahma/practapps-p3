This brings the total of   delegates from Colorado to 30 with an additional four unpledged delegates slated to vote for Cruz but not required to do so.   Upon announcement of the results, Cruz responded: Today was another resounding victory for conservatives, Republicans, and Americans who care about the future of our country. Utah, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and tonight’s incredible results in Colorado have proven this: Republicans are uniting behind our campaign because they want a leader with real solutions who will bring back jobs, freedom, and security.
