Mr. Comey also confirmed that, after his departure from the FBI, he provided at least some of these memoranda to a third party, Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman, for the purpose of leaking them to the press. Various media outlets now have reported that Professor Richman has provided these memoranda to the FBI. It is unclear whether he still retains copies of the memoranda. I am writing to you on behalf of Judicial Watch, Inc. a    educational organization that seeks to promote transparency, accountability, and integrity in government and fidelity to the rule of law.
