The classic story of gaining from free trade by removing trade barriers doesnâ€™t really apply to the TPP primarily because we have already removed most of the barriers between the countries in the pact. The United States has trade deals in place with six of the eleven countries in the TPP, so tariffs with these countries are already at or very near zero. Even with the other five countries, in most cases the formal trade barriers are already low, so pushing them to zero will not have much economic impact. In its analysis of the TPP, the   United States International Trade Commission (ITC) projected that the gains from the deal in 2032, when its effects will be mostly realized, will be 0.
