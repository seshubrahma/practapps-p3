The memo seems to direct officials to adopt a skeptical attitude towards claims of "credible fear," saying: The asylum officer shall make a positive credible fear finding only after the officer has considered all relevant evidence and determined, based on credible evidence, that the alien has a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum, or for withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, based on established legal authority. The new skepticism may stop the northward migration of Central Americans from Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The second memo also restarts the 287( g) program, which "led to the identification of more than 402, 000 removable aliens, primarily through encounters at local jails" from January 2006 through September 2015, according to the memo, which adds: Empowering state and local law enforcement agencies to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law is critical to an effective enforcement strategy. Aliens who engage in criminal conduct are priorities for arrest and removal and will often be encountered by state and local law enforcement officers during the course of their routine duties.
