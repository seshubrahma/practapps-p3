And, having written my fair share of speeches for Republican and Democratic secretaries of state on this issue, I would argue that there are four key questions that need to be asked to better understand how we got here    and where we might be going. Why John Kerry?   Clearly, a decision was made to make this a Kerry rather than a Barack Obama speech.
