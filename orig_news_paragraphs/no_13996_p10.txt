Trump, too, has a complicated legal history    and has demonstrated a similarly vindictive character.   So look forward to Trump administration efforts to tar individual judges who seem to block the fulfillment of GOP agendas or interfere with Trump’s personal interests. Remember the  ’s campaign to discredit Judge Gonzalo Curiel due to his Mexican heritage? We can expect more such accusations of bias, and rhetoric about "draining the swamp" of our legal system as well.
