Schaper and Harim Uziel, who can be heard on their own and other’s videos engaging the ANTIFA protestors in a war of words outside the event. The confrontation escalated as a Santa Ana Police Officer can be seen stepping between the clashing sides.   And then without warning, a Trump supporter in a red shirt can be seen grabbing a flag and running into the parking lot where he is struck by one ANTIFA protestor and then shoved to the pavement by another. Police swarm in and arrest the ANTIFA protestor, who can be seen using his flagpole as a weapon.
