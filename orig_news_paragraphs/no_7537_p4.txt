(Keller is also a former law clerk of Kennedy’s, and former general counsel to Senator Ted Cruz.) Conservative hopes that Hellerstedt would become a major   victory were dashed with the death of the iconic Scalia now   hope they can salvage anything from the case. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld this law, so in the event of a   tie, HB2 will survive, but without creating any national precedent. Unfortunately for abortion opponents, after Scalia’s death, it is likely that the only way Hellerstedt could now be a major case would be if Kennedy votes with the four liberal justices to hold that HB2 imposes an "undue burden" on women seeking an abortion, which would suggest that even modest abortion restrictions would face an uphill battle at the High Court.
