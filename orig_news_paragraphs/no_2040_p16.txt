Encouraged by the  â€™s possible   on deporting young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, two senators have crafted a bipartisan bill to help protect them. Known as the Bridge Act, the bill, sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, is intended to protect roughly 800, 000 young illegal immigrants from deportation should Mr. Trump make good on his campaign promise to end the protections issued by President Obama through an executive order. The Obama program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, granted deportation protection and work permits for two years to immigrants brought to the country as minors who have passed criminal background checks. The   measure, which also has at least one   from each party, would give current recipients a reprieve even if Mr. Trump undoes the order, and allow new applicants to apply.
