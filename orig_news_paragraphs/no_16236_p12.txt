While Sen. Kaine has been open about his personal reservations about abortion, he’s maintained a 100%   voting record in the US Senate," the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, another abortion rights group, said in a statement Friday. " When he was governor, Tim Kaine took positions we disagreed with and actively campaigned against. We’re pleased that since then, his votes and public statements have been consistently in favor of trusting women to make our own decisions."
