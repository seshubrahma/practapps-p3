When will Saul (Mandy Patinkin) stop doubting Carrie? In "Homeland" (as in "24," also from the executive producer Howard Gordon) we look forward to the questions almost as much as to the answers.

A. colleague Saul, have perfected their partnership: Their scenes together are little masterpieces of gamesmanship and exasperation.
