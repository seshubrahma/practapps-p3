Prominent Republicans say they’re open to supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton to keep GOP frontrunner Donald Trump from becoming President of the United States. ["Members of the GOP foreign policy establishment are open to supporting Ted Cruz or even Hillary Clinton for president," The Hill reports after interviewing Republicans "who signed a scathing open letter denouncing Trump. "  "What’s happening is you have a lot of people who are desperate to get anybody in there other than Trump.    …     People are going to go for Cruz, because at the end of the day they think he’s considerably less bad than Trump," said former advisor to Marco Rubio Eliot A. Cohen.
