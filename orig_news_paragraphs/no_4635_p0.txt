California Gov. Jerry Brown cited the disaster relief and infrastructure needs of his state as he told reporters on Monday in Washington, D. C. that there are areas where he is seeking to work with the Trump Administration. ["I find complexity and contradiction very congenial to my bent of mind," Brown said, in response to questions of whether he felt "conflicted and torn" under pressures to oppose or cooperate with the Trump administration.   Brown met with Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) Agency acting Administrator Bob Fenton on Monday, according to the Sacramento Bee which posted video of Brownâ€™s comments to reporters. Brown has estimated storm damage at over $500 million dollars.
