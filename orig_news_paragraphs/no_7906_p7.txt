As Schlafly has explained, the two most significant issues threatening national sovereignty today are the   Partnership (TPP) and our expansive immigration policy. Conservatives warn that entering the TPP agreement —   which has been championed by the globalist caucus in Washington including Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama —   will come at the expense of U. S. sovereignty. As Sessions has pointed out, Article 27. 1 of the TPP agreement will ensnare the U. S. in a global governing commission similar to a "nascent European Union" —   which had similarly begun as an economic agreement.
