While that did not happen, the results of the last two weeks make clear that the most reliable conservative with the best chance to win is Ted Cruz. He can win our party’s nomination and even more importantly, can beat Hillary Clinton in November. Therefore I have cast my ballot for Ted and am now honored to endorse his campaign, encouraging all who believe in strong families,   and the Constitution, to similarly rally to this effort and vote for Ted as the next President of the United States. In his statement of February 25  —   in which he urged a   combined presidential ticket, Franks said: Donald Trump in recent years has been a pointed critic of President Barack Obama and I embrace his strong words in support of American sovereignty and a secure border.
