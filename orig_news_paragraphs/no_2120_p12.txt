While polls show that public opinion in Hungary remains far more favorable to the West than to Russia, which crushed uprisings there in 1848 and 1956, Mr. Orban and the leader of Jobbik have both ditched their previous hostility toward Moscow and focused their fire on the West instead, particularly the European Union. The turnaround by Jobbik has been particularly spectacular and is linked to the role of Bela Kovacs, an enigmatic Hungarian businessman who worked for years in Russia. He joined the   party when it was still a struggling band of marginal nationalists in 2005 provided it with funds to stave off bankruptcy, ostensibly out of his own pocket and took charge of its foreign relations. Mr. Kovacs, now a member of the European Parliament, has been under investigation by Hungarian prosecutors since 2014 over suspicions that he and his   wife have been recruited as Russian agents.
