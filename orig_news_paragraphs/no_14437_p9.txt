Shirley Sherrod was an Agriculture Department employee in Georgia when, in 2010, she was pushed out by the Obama administration. The decision came down in response to a deceptively edited video that seemed to show Sherrod bragging that she, an   woman, had not used "the full force of what I could do" to aid a white farmer in distress.   The clip was posted online to a Breitbart website and quickly seized on by Fox Newsâ€™ evening roster. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack asked Sherrod to step down, and the NAACP denounced her remarks.
