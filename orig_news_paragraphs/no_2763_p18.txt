In 2007, Ms. Lagarde sent the dispute to a   private arbitration authority that awarded Mr. Tapie more than 400 million euros, or $420 million at current exchange rates, in damages and interest, to be paid by the state. The court did not fault Ms. Lagarde for approving the arbitration, but it ruled that she had been negligent for not appealing the decision. The court, noting that a judge had previously invalidated the payout in a 2015 ruling and that she had "national and international" stature, decided not to punish Ms. Lagarde and spared her a criminal record. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Ms. Lagardeâ€™s lawyer, Patrick Maisonneuve, said he had a "mixed" reaction to the verdict.
