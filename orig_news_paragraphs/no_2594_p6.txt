But the court ruled that the state had failed to show significant benefits for women’s health and safety and placed such onerous burdens on clinics that many would have to shut down. And so, the court held, in a    decision, that the state had placed an illegal "undue burden" on women’s basic right to abortion up to the point that the fetus is viable outside the womb. The ruling, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, has already led courts to block similar clinic and physician rules in other states and is expected to figure in lawsuits over other restrictions, like bans on remote prescribing of pills for   abortions, or   waiting periods that cause hardship for poor women who must travel to reach a clinic. But how broadly the ruling will apply to abortion laws that do not involve claims about clinic safety or women’s health will emerge from lower court decisions over a period of years, legal experts say.
