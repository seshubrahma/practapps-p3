In some cases, the Secret Service inspectors contacted witnesses directly and questioned them along with investigators from the DHS Inspector General’s Office headed by Roth, who is responsible for examining alleged wrongdoing across the breadth of Homeland Security. " In one instance, Roth’s agents and Secret Service inspectors jointly questioned an agent about Carol D. Leonnig, a reporter for The Washington Post who has uncovered security missteps by the service, according to the agent’s attorney. Investigators asked about stories related to Chaffetz and other subjects and confronted the agent with his personal cellphone records, showing alleged calls and texts with Leonnig, the lawyer said," the Post noted: The service’s involvement in investigating itself is problematic, experts say, because top officials at the agency had an incentive to embarrass Chaffetz.
