The observer who was not authorized to talk to the media told CNN that the individual was hit by a megaphone by   protesters and received 17 stitches to his head. They say that when DC Police refused to arrest that   protester, it angered the crowd. Hamparian tells CNN that injuries ranged from cuts and bruises, some of which required stiches.
