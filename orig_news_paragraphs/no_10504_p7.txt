Was it, perhaps, the   terrorist who killed a Polish truck driver, commandeered his vehicle, drove to a crowded Christmas market in the centre of Berlin, turned off the headlights and then accelerated into the crowd of men, women, and children, killing at least a dozen and maiming many more? Of course not! The very worst, most evil and culpable person in the world the day after the Berlin massacre was —  in the view of progressive types on Twitter and on the BBC and in the Guardian —   Nigel Farage.
