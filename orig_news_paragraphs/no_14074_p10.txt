But many    including myself    had hoped that Trump would be honest with us once he was sworn in as the 45th President. Apparently, we were being naive or expecting too much. Not accepting lies as "alternative facts" is an issue that truly must transcend partisan politics. If Trump and his administration are going to continue lying to us, how can we trust any information they release?
