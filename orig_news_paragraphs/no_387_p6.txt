The National Immigration Law Center, which joined the A. C. L. U. in a suit on behalf of two Iraqi refugees detained on Saturday, has raised $269, 000 since the Trump order was signed, its executive director, Marielena Hincapie, said. Ms. Hincapie said donations had increased "across the board" and were now larger, more frequent and coming from more individual donors than her group had ever seen. A surge of individual donations after the election in November also boosted the law centerâ€™s annual budget to $7. 5 million from $5. 5 million, she added.    for her organization was usually "slow and tedious work," but not anymore, she said.
