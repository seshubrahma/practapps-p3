The army’s recapture of Wadi Barada from rebels comes a month after Assad’s forces pushed the armed opposition out of east Aleppo, taking back control of the whole of the northern city. Syria’s rebels still hold to the northwestern province of Idlib, the Western Ghouta area outside the capital and areas in the south of the country. Syria’s conflict has killed more than 310, 000 people since it erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of   protests. The war has forced 4. 8 million people to flee Syria, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
