The trouble for President Trump, who made    of Obamacare one of his big campaign promises, is that he cannot fire anyone in Congress.   Indeed, only the voters can fire a member of the House of Representatives and if the latest polls are to be believed, very few of those voters liked Trumpcare. Perhaps it was the part of the bill that would push 24 million of them off the health insurance rolls that they did nâ€™t like.
