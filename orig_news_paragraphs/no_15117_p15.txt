Matt Rivers, CNN’s Beijing correspondent, says February’s coal ban, and subsequent return of   ships to North Korean shores, accomplishes two things for China. First, it allows China to show the international community that it is willing to comply with sanctions.   Secondly, it gives them a clear rebuttal to the Trump administration’s argument that China isn’t doing its part to rein in its unpredictable neighbor.    That could lead to greater leverage in future negotiations on other issues like trade    something that could be behind Trump’s decision not to follow through on a campaign trail threat to label China a  "currency manipulator."
