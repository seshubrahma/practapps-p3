Joe Lierz, Kellogg’s director of labor relations, told the StarTribune that the layoffs were "directly related" to the company’s   plan. He added that the Minnesota job loss "is one in a series" of layoff announcements coming across the country. The layoffs in Minnesota came on the heels of layoffs at Kellogg’s plants and distribution centers in New York, Michigan, and other states. The   plan was a result of the $53 million   loss reported by the cereal maker and is expected to include the closure of 39 distribution centers affecting roughly 1, 100 workers across the country.
