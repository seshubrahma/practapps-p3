President Trump used that term in a tweet about the scandal, and the Times is now using that to deny the story as a whole.   But the basic elements of the story remain the same, regardless of whether the surveillance targeted Trump’s "phones," a computer server at Trump Tower (the subject of speculation even during the campaign) or other communications. Whatever method used, under whatever justification (FISA court or otherwise) the fact remains   —   as reported repeatedly by the Times   —   that the last administration conducted surveillance on the Trump campaign, whose results were disseminated and leaked.
