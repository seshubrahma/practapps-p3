 (CNN) A longtime friend of President Donald Trump is defending former campaign chairman Paul Manafort in the wake of a report that his consulting firm received at least $1. 2 million in payments from a   political party in Ukraine. According to the Associated Press, financial records prove the payments, which were listed in a handwritten ledger, were made in 2007 and 2009    years before Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. Ukrainian investigators claimed the ledger proved the payments were made secretly.
