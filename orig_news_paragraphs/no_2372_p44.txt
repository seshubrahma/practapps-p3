It’s striking to me now that Clinton’s main interest in these new media technologies was not so much as a political tool but as a policy concern for the citizenry. Clinton described "the insidious, pernicious comparisons" that online communities can foster in young people, and the temptation to "put out an identity online before it’s ever formed" in real life. Thinking about this exchange 14 months later, after what feels like a generation’s worth of lines crossed and taboos shattered, her concern seems strangely prescient. Trump, of course, both shares and feeds his audience’s addiction to stimuli and entertainment.
