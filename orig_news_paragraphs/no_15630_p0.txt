Manchester, England (CNN) Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi likely received some ISIS training in Syria in the months before the attack, according to information gathered in the preliminary investigation, a US official told CNN on Thursday. The US believes ISIS, through that training, set the stage for the   old to carry out the deadly attack at the Manchester Arena on Monday night, which killed 22 people as they left a pop concert. Other members of Abediâ€™s family are believed to have been radicalized as well, the official said.
