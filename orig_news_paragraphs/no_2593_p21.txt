Hillary Clinton has spent the last 16 months looking into cameras deliberately lying to the American people," said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. The Democratic convention in Philadelphia this month will present Mrs. Clinton with her most significant opportunity to address her trustworthiness. Her campaign plans to release biographical videos showing how she has delivered on promises to help children and families throughout her career. And the party will lean on President Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren, among others, to vouch for her.
