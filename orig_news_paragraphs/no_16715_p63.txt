Sheikh Hamza Yusuf is   of Zaytuna College in California, the countryâ€™s first accredited Muslim college. Yusuf, who is white, converted to Islam in 1977 and soon thereafter left the United States to study with Islamic scholars in the Middle East and Africa. When he returned after a decade overseas, he felt lost, spiritually and emotionally.    "I had no context for being an American Muslim," he said.
