Khaled Khatib, a Syrian rescue worker who served as a cinematographer on the   documentary short "The White Helmets," has been barred by American officials from traveling to Los Angeles for Sundayâ€™s Academy Awards ceremony, according to the Associated Press. The AP reported that the Department of Homeland Security blocked Mr. Khatib after discovering "derogatory information" about him. Mr. Khatib had planned to fly from Istanbul to Los Angeles on Saturday. The AP said he had been detained earlier in the week by Turkish officials for undisclosed reasons, and that he needed a passport waiver to travel to the United States, which was denied.
