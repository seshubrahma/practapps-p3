Republican elected officials, donors and strategists grappled uncomfortably on Wednesday with the inevitability of Donald J. Trump as their presidential nominee, an unexpectedly sudden denouement that left many in a state of political paralysis and others vowing to oppose the partyâ€™s new  . While some called for unity, many Republican leaders refrained from falling in line behind Mr. Trump, with dozens avoiding inquiries about where they stood or saying they wanted Mr. Trump to detail his policies or tone down his language first. Others tied themselves in knots as they praised and criticized Mr. Trump in a single breath, or suggested that they could abide Mr. Trump but loathed his agenda. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who is in a tough   race, signaled that she would "support" Mr. Trump but not "endorse" him, as a spokeswoman put it, a rhetorical contortion that other Republicans repeated privately.
