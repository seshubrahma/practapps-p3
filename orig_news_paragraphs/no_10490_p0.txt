NEW YORK CITY, New York  —   Omarosa Manigault, a senior adviser to 2016 GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump for African American Engagement, told Breitbart News exclusively that Sean "Diddy" Combs is right about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton taking the black vote for granted. ["Everywhere we go, we’re hearing African American voters say they’re sick and tired of having their votes taken for granted, and that’s why Mr. Trump is getting such a good reception for his engagement efforts," Omarosa, a   Apprentice contestant who’s now working with Trump on black outreach, said in a statement in response to Diddy’s appearance on MSNBC with the Rev. Al Sharpton on Sunday. "
