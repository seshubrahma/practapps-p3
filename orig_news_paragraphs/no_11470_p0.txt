PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem denied that moving the World Golf Championship event, known as the Cadilac Championship, from Trump National Doral to Mexico City was politically motivated. [Finchem said on Wednesday that the decision to abandon Doral, host to a PGA Tour event for more than five decades, was strictly money motivated.   " Some of the reaction revolves around the feeling that this is a political exercise and it is not that in any way, shape or form," he said.
