Donald Trump is calling on Hillary Clinton "to replace her support for increased refugee admissions  …     with a new job program for our inner cities. " [Clinton "wants a 500% increase in Syrian refugees to come into our country," Trump said at Friday’s Faith and Freedom Summit.   Clinton’s plan to resettle 65, 000 Syrian migrants would cost U. S. taxpayers over $42 billion over the course of the migrants’ lifetimes, based on projections from Heritage Foundation scholar Robert Rector.
