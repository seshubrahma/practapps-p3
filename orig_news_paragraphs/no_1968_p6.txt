The 1967 case involving the stripping of citizenship traces back to a 1940 law that automatically revoked the citizenship of Americans who took actions like voting in a foreign country’s election or joining its military. The case centered on a man who had been born in Poland, became a naturalized American citizen, and later went to Israel and voted in an election there. When he subsequently tried to renew his American passport, the State Department refused, saying he was no longer an American citizen, and he sued. In a    ruling, the Supreme Court called citizenship and the rights that stem from it "no light trifle to be jeopardized any moment" by politicians’ attempts to curtail it.
