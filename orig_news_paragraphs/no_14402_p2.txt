Intelligence gathering, The US and other observers "can learn a lot" from any missile test, said Tal Inbar, a North Korea expert at the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies.   " We can analyze the trajectory and conclude some insight about the power of the engines and the amount of fuel, and estimate the potential range of the missile."   If it is possible to retrieve the missile or rocket from the sea, as South Korea did in February last year, Inbar said there "is a wealth of intelligence in such debris."
