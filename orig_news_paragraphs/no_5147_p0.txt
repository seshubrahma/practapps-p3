Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein installed George W.     Director Robert Mueller as special counsel Wednesday to oversee the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [Because Attorney General Jeff Sessions previously recused himself from the investigation, Rosenstein is acting  Attorney General, with all the powers that entails, for purposes of the Russia probe. As such, Rosenstein has full authority to unilaterally pass responsibility off to Mueller, who will continue the already   investigation without reporting through the normal FBI and DOJ   .   Rosenstein’s decision came after Washington exploded into speculation Tuesday over the New York Times report that a "Comey Memo" showed that President Donald Trump had suggested in a private conversation that    Director James Comey "let it go" with regard to   National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.
