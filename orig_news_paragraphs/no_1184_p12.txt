Moab, Utah, thrived by turning itself into a profitable tourism destination for    mountain bikers. What went right in southern Idaho started and ended with the rich volcanic soil. With irrigation, the black dirt was splendid for growing crops, from potatoes to alfalfa, that in turn fed the dairy cows that grew up in what became known as the Magic Valley. Idaho is the     state, after California, Wisconsin and New York, and   of that industry is clustered within 75 miles of downtown Twin Falls.
