But it is hard to understand exactly what it is the actual protesters are protesting. Are they actually opposed to "extreme vetting" of people streaming into the United States from known terrorist breeding grounds? Do these protesters object to more strenuous screening of people coming from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya? Who, again, was the   bigot who identified these countries as terror hot spots anyway?
