The admiring gestures of the Kurdish public compliment the determination of their top officials in making overtures to   Trump. Vice   Mike Pence spoke by phone on Saturday with Kurdistan Region President Masoud Barzani, just as Kurdistan Region security chief Masrour Barzani arrived to Washington, both aiming to establish mutual understanding on Mr. Trump’s fresh Iraq and Kurdistan policy. Everyone’s heard of Mr. Trump’s preferred palette of KFC, steaks and the occasional French dinner with friends. The Kurds are hoping for American leadership with an appetite for their statehood ambitions, as well.
