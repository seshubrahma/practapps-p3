The big margin allowed Cruz to secure 36 of the stateâ€™s 42 delegates. The big difference between the polls in Wisconsin and the final results is that a lot of support for Kasich moved to Cruz at the very end. Kasich was polling around 20 percent support in the poll average, but ended up with just 14 percent of the vote. That vote shifted to Cruz at the very end of the campaign.
