These resolutions would isolate Israel, embolden the Palestinians, and legitimize the   boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement.   Trump issued the following statement from Palm Beach, Florida: The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed. As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations. This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.
