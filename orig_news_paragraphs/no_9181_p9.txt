But Ohio Governor John Kasich, the third candidate remaining in the race, has made it clear he intends to compete in Utah, with several town halls already scheduled there for March 18. If Trump were to win Arizona, hold Cruz below 50 percent in Utah, and lose    Nebraska and Montana while winning in    Delaware and New Jersey, his "need to win" number of remaining delegates would jump from 43 percent if he took all four to 51 percent. The most recent poll shows Trump with a 27 point lead in New Jersey, but Nebraska, next door to Iowa and Kansas, where Cruz won, and Montana, next door to Idaho where Cruz also won, probably lean to Cruz now, although polling in either state is sparse. The bottom line on the race for the GOP nomination is that Trumpâ€™s ability to convert his frontrunner status to first ballot nominee is still unknown.
