At the end of a rough night in the first presidential debate, Donald J. Trump congratulated himself for his restraint in not attacking his opponent with her husbandâ€™s sexual history. A lot can change in two weeks. The most shocking and dispiriting visual of the second debate on Sunday appeared before the candidates even faced off. Mr. Trump held a surprise publicity event, broadcast on Facebook Live, with three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual abuse, as well as one woman whose molester Hillary Clinton was assigned to defend as a young lawyer.
