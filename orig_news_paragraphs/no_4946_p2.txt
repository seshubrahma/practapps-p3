According to the Russian assessment, six   fighter jets and some structures at the airbase were destroyed, but the runways were not damaged. The Russians also complained that America "obviously" prepared for an attack on the Sharyat airbase long before Tuesdayâ€™s chemical weapons attack. " The preparation of such a strike is necessary to conduct a large range of activities for exploration, planning, preparation of flight missions and bringing the missiles into full readiness for launch.
