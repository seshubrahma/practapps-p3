Capehart declined to answer questions from Breitbart about his statement that "hospice care" for mostly white   communities is "a way forward" for the nation. He declined to suggest alternative policies or to suggest which of the progressives’ political goals could be traded to win support for white   voters in 2020. The offer of political elimination to   communities has prompted anger even from some   writers, such as Martin Longman at The Washington Monthly. I’m not saying the whole Democratic Party feels this way, but the default position among a lot of progressives since the election has been that to even talk about these folks is to pander to their racism and dilute the party’s commitment to civil rights, women’s rights, gay rights, and the environment.
