Instead, Jackson allowed himself to become just the latest dupe in Trump’s phony black outreach. Trump’s efforts to court blacks didn’t begin until he fell way behind in the polls and have included ugly, false statements about the state of black America that he felt comfortable spouting before adoring mostly white crowds but couldn’t muster the courage to say in front of black people. Jackson is right. Jesus embraced sinners and didn’t slam the church door in their faces.
