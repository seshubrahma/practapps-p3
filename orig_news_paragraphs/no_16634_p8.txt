Birth control is an essential part of womenâ€™s health care, and    status would help more women benefit from the ability to control their own reproductive health," Dr. Mark S. DeFrancesco said in a January statement, adding that "they are safer than many other medications that are already available   . " Though the new contraceptive laws are on the books in Oregon, Washington and California, the actual prescribing and dispensing of birth control may not be up and running in many pharmacies in those states just yet.   Nash noted that the new oral contraceptive laws generally require pharmacies to provide a private consultation space and pharmacists to undergo special training.
