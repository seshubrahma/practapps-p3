  internet personality BakedAlaska, real name Timothy Treadstone, has finally received approval to release Build the Wall: The Game on iOS. [The game encourages players to stack bricks and build the biggest border wall possible, all while trying to stop illegal immigrants from climbing over before a timer runs out.   It also includes various extras, such as Trump Steaks (which attract bald eagles to swoop down and carry the illegal immigrants away) and an array of   personalities such as Mike Cernovich, Alex Jones, and Treadstone himself.
