The implication was obvious: Democrats believed many Republicans had just cost themselves their political careers by voting for an overhaul of Obamacare. And the DC political class wonders why people hate them. I understand that Democrats not only didnâ€™t like the way this bill was passed    without any estimates on what it might cost or how many people might lose coverage as a result    but also believed the policies contained in it would leave the country and its people considerably worse off. That is a worthy conversation to have.
