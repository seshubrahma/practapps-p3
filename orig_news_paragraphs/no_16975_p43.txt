No, her closest aide, Huma Abedin, should not have had an ethically questionable arrangement that allowed her to simultaneously work for four different   entities, including the Department of State.

In every single one of those instances, Hillary Clinton and her closest advisers, including Bill, exercised bad judgment. Like so many other Americans, I am left deciding which of these two candidates is the lesser of two evils, which one is capable of inflicting less damage on our country, our social fabric.
