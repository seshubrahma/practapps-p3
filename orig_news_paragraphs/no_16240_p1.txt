The campaign unveiled a new smartphone app for supporters Sunday that borrows elements and strategies directly from the mobile gaming industry, a move that Clinton’s tech team thinks will get more people involved with the campaign.   Here’s how it works: The app opens with an interactive "mobile field office" that sends users four daily specific tasks they can complete on behalf of the campaign. Supporters might be asked to share a new digital video from the campaign on Facebook, send a text message to a friend or RSVP for a local Clinton event. The app also provides daily quizzes about policy aimed at disseminating Clinton’s positions on major issues and contrasting them with Republican nominee Donald Trump.
