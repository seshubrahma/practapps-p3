 (CNN) The chief operating officer for Donald Trump’s campaign is shooting down the idea, raised by Omarosa Manigault, that the   is keeping an enemies list.   Jeff DeWit said in a radio interview Wednesday that he had never heard of the list of enemies, adding that, if he saw such a list, he’d burn it. Manigault, a Trump surrogate and former contestant on "The Apprentice," told the Independent Journal Review on Tuesday night that it was "so great our enemies are making themselves clear," referring to GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham’s announcement that he voted for Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin.
