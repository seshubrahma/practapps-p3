Tokyo (CNN) The search was on for seven US sailors missing after an American warship and a merchant vessel collided off the coast of Japan, as US forces and Japanese authorities worked to figure out why the vessels struck each other. The     destroyer USS Fitzgerald and the ACX Crystal, a   container ship flagged in the Philippines, collided early Saturday local time, officials said. The destroyer suffered severe damage to its starboard side, while the container ship sustained light damage.
