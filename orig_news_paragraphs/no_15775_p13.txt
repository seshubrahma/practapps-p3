At a news conference early Monday, when asked about President Trump’s comments, the Prime Minister took the unusual step of praising a mayor from another party, telling reporters that Khan was "doing an excellent job as mayor" and stressing that she was fully cooperating with him to jointly oversee   operations in London. But she stopped short of explicitly condemning Trump’s tweets, clearly hoping the matter would go away. How did President Trump reward her? He doubled down on his tweets just three hours later, accusing Khan of a "pathetic excuse" for his failure to prevent terror.
