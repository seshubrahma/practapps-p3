In June last year, while still a senior cabinet minister in David Cameron’s government, she campaigned against Brexit.   But since becoming Prime Minister, she has sounded more in favor of a   "hard Brexit" than the official Leave campaign, and more like Nigel Farage and his     UK Independence Party. May’s apparent Brexit priority is controlling immigration. Business comes second, and yet, as there is no groundswell of buyer’s remorse, she still seems to be sniffing the political wind correctly.
