Trump came to a state battling a drug epidemic and suggested without any evidence on Saturday that his opponent had been on drugs during their second debate. " I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate," Mr. Trump told a crowd of thousands gathered in the parking lot of a Toyota dealership on a chilly afternoon.
