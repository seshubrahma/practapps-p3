In a poll of more than 2, 000 registered voters, it found that 29 percent of adults with at least a bachelor’s degree say all five of their closest friends have at least a   college degree. And 31 percent of adults who either never attended college or never graduated say none of their closest friends had at least a   college degree. The survey shows that the less educated aren’t quite as insular as the educated. Among those without a college degree, 10 percent said all of their five closest friends didn’t attend college.
