Channelling the sentiments of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said Iran should suffer immediate consequences for likely violating U. N. Security Council resolution 2231 by conducting a series of ballistic missile tests in recent days. Netanyahu last week called for Western powers to take "immediate punitive steps" against Iran for the missile tests. Trump stated: The deal is silent on test missiles but those tests DO violate UN Security Council Resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it.
