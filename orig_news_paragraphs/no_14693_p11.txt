The government of the Philippines was taken to task in Friday’s report, cited for "killings allegedly undertaken by vigilantes, security forces and insurgents" as well as corruption and allegations of torture by security forces. It wasn’t the only ally to face criticism. In Turkey, the report pointed to "inconsistent access to due process" and "government interference with freedom of expression" as significant human rights problems. Tillerson’s decision not to speak publicly about the report, and the State Department’s decision not to hold an    press conference, was criticized Friday by human rights groups.
