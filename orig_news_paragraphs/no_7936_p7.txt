In general, when you consider this poll (although it is only 1) along with the election results from this past weekend, Trump does appear to be taking on water. He has had a terrible 10 days, much of it  . It all started when he flubbed a question about David Duke and ran straight through to a debate performance so terrible it might be remembered as a devastating turning point that occurred just when The Donald should have been sailing to the nomination. Imagine how dull politics in this country would be without Florida.
