Michigan Rep. Dan Kildee has invited Dr. Mona   a Flint pediatrician whose parents fled Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq and who helped uncover the water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan. Iraq is one of the countries named in the administration’s travel ban. " Dr. Mona’s personal story of coming to America from Iraq also reminds us of the many important contributions immigrants make to our nation," Kildee said.
