a man that Sen. Jeff Sessions has called ‘an American hero’  …     has served his country in so many different capacities: in the Marine’s uniform, as an ICE officer, [and] as a representative for all of America’s ICE officers," said Donald Trump’s Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller on Breitbart News Sunday.   Rubio has repeatedly made clear "where his priorities are" on immigration, Miller said —   explaining that there are now three lanes dividing the GOP Presidential field: the Governor’s lane, occupied by John Kasich the frontrunner’s lane, occupied by Donald Trump and the "amnesty lane," which is occupied "solely and exclusively" by Sen. Rubio. Prior to joining the Trump campaign, Miller served as Jeff Sessions’ communications director. On Friday, Breitbart News published an exclusive interview with Chris Crane, an ICE officer of 13 years and a U. S. Marine, in which Crane said Sen. Rubio treated law enforcement "like absolute trash" during his push to pass his 2013 amnesty bill.
