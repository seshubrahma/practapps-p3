However, there have also been spectacular failures, such as the "Six Californias" movement of 2015, which failed to qualify for the 2016 ballot and faced fierce opposition from state leaders (because they feared, among other reasons, it would help Republicans in the presidential election). Jeff Horseman of the Riverside     rounds up a few of the other recent flops: In 2009,   Assemblyman Bill Maze proposed the state of Coastal California consisting of 13 counties, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. Maze argued that coastal liberals politically drowned out Californiaâ€™s more conservative regions. The desire to create a conservative haven led   County Supervisor Jeff Stone in 2011 to propose the state of South California.
