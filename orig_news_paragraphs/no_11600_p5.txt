"In almost half the species looked at, there have been local extinctions already," he said. Meanwhile, last month a group of scientists discovered to their surprise that the worldâ€™s plants have somehow increased their capacity to assimilate carbon, resulting in a decline in the percentage of   CO2 remaining in the atmosphere. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that despite the increased human emissions of greenhouse gases, between 2002 and 2014, plants were somehow able to absorb more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than in previous decades. Undaunted, Wiens says that humanity is on the verge of disaster, and Americans are particularly to blame.
