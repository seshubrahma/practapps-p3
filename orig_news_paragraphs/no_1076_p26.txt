All week, Fox News had been covering a story of a    Maryland girl who said she had been raped by two of her high school classmates, one of whom is an undocumented immigrant. The way the story was discussed throughout the day on the network was not unlike a Trump campaign speech: criticism of the mainstream media, accusing it of having a liberal agenda that prioritizes identity politics over safety proclamations that sanctuary cities and states are rife with danger from illegal immigration mentions of Kathryn Steinle, the woman killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco in 2015 who was often invoked on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and other conservatives and descriptions of a border so porous that there are "waves of unaccompanied children coming across. " The Maryland case was a topic on Fox News from the morning to almost midnight.
