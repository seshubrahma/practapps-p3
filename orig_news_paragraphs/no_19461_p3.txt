Buybacks serve a   specific purpose: they make a company’s earnings   look better without them having to actually be better.    They can  —   though they haven’t much lately   —   help bolster a   company’s stock price.    The sacrifice here, though, is that the money spent on buybacks   is not being spent on building new factories, raising wages,   hiring workers or growing the business.
