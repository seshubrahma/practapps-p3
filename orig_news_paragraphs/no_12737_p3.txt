Bill Clinton wanted a small footprint. I was able to speak with Sgt. Matt Eversmann, just a couple weeks ago, and he went through a lot of what happened, and he remembers Mr. Clinton, and the small footprint, and what it cost Americans. Well, Mrs. Clinton has been there now for nearly 30 years, and it will be a continuation.
