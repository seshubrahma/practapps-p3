Question 4: A supermajority of GOP voters say immigration is too high. Every year, on autopilot, we let in another one million immigrants on green cards, 700, 000 foreign guest workers, half a million foreign students, and 100, 000 refugees and asylees. Historical precedent would be to reduce   immigration, rather than continuing to surge it beyond all historical precedent. Will you support legislation to reduce immigration numbers, and will you oppose legislation that would add to the number?
