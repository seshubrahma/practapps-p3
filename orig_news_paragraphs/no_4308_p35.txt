Now, I ask my questions based on the comments of the only one person on this earth who actually knows for sure the source of the DNC   to Wikileaks. As far as I know, by the way, I’m the only member of the media who has interviewed Julian Assange multiple times on radio and right here on this TV show. During those interviews, he told me repeatedly Russia was not the source of the DNC   leaks   —   repeatedly.
