There’s a very clear sense right now that a lot of the people who voted for Trump may not have been voting in their best interests. It really seems like an irrational act to put this man in office, especially to people who didn’t vote for him. And so people want to understand what was going on in the minds of these people. I did find myself listening with a kind of Kahneman and Tversky ear to what was going on around me after the election.
