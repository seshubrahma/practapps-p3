"I want to highlight that we have not had nor do we have any information that leads us to believe there will be immigration actions at our schools. Federal guidelines continue to provide that schools are sensitive places where immigration enforcement should not take place, and we will continue to advocate for those guidelines to remain in place. We do not want to create any additional fear or panic in our communities. "
