According to Hesson, raises related to overtime have been rescinded at Massachusetts General Hospital, Iowa State University, the University of Iowa, Michigan State University, Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wayne State University in Michigan, and the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. The expansion of overtime pay is a microcosm of the battling philosophies that animated voters during the 2016 election. Republicans, including Trump and Puzder, have characterized the rule as a   regulation, a hubristic act of bureaucratic overreach. Obama and Hillary Clinton, who supported the order, touted it as a small analgesic for underpaid and     workers.
