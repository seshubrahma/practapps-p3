The Butterfly (Ballot) Effect: One of the Democratsâ€™ strategies for overturning the 2000 election was to claim that the "butterfly ballot" in Palm Beach County was too confusing for any reasonable person to figure out, causing many confused Gore voters to incorrectly cast their ballots for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan.   The liberal outrage machine was gearing up to portray this as an evil conspiracy to disenfranchise the befuddled Democrat voters of Palm Beach, but were brought up short by the discovery that the butterfly ballot was designed by a Democrat, elections supervisor Theresa LePore, who said she used a   layout so the type would be larger and easier to read. LePore nevertheless became the target of fury from Democrats in her area and was voted out of her office in 2004.   The butterfly ballot has figured in attempts to delegitimize the 2000 election ever since it was held.
