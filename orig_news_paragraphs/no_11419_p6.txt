In the months leading up to the election of   Donald Trump, illegal immigrants began flooding across the border at record rates. Breitbart Texas reported earlier this month that in October 2016, FMUA apprehensions increased by 37 percent. UAC apprehensions were up by 19 percent, and total apprehensions were up 17 percent. By all accounts, Operation Phalanx has been an effective tool at helping to keep the border crisis from being even more dramatic that it already is.
