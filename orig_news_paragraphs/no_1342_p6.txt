Jindal cut appropriations for higher education, shifting the cost burden onto students themselves. (State spending per student was down more than 40 percent between 2008 and 2014 just one state, Arizona, cut more.) And he shuttered or privatized nine charity hospitals that served the stateâ€™s uninsured and indigent. They were outdated and costly, Jindal argued, and private management would improve access, care and the bottom line.
