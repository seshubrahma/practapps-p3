Hillary Clinton is reportedly in the process of launching a PAC that will act as a "quiet catalyst" for some of her pet causes. [The PAC is not intended to be something that the former 2016 Democratic presidential nominee will use to run for office herself one day, but it will help congressional candidates in the 2018 election, Axios reported Wednesday.   A source told Axios that the PAC will primarily work with groups that began after President Trumpâ€™s election, but it will also work with existing groups that have risen in prominence as a result of the election. Clinton has already begun meeting with some of these groups, the source added.
