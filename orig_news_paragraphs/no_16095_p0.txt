Washington (CNN) Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker withdrew himself Wednesday from consideration as a possible running mate for Donald Trump. The surprise move comes as sources had told CNN Corker was being "very seriously" vetted by the Trump campaign. But Corker, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN he is instead open to serving in Trumpâ€™s cabinet, perhaps as secretary of state, and will speak at the Republican convention later this month.
