Over and over again, for example, President Barack Obama took crucial national security decisions to the UN Security Council before approaching Congress. In 2011, with Secretary Clintonâ€™s full backing, Obama committed the U. S. to war in Libya on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 1973. He never went to Congress for approval, in defiance of the War Powers Resolution. The result was a poorly conceived intervention, with terrorist consequences the world is still suffering.
