The removal of Iraq from the list came after talks with security officials in Baghdad and at the urging of Mr. Mattis and State Department officials, who have been in communication with Iraqi officials alarmed that the ban will turn public sentiment in their country against the United States. " On the basis of negotiations that have taken place between the government of Iraq and the U. S. Department of State in the last month, Iraq will increase cooperation with the U. S. government on the vetting of its citizens applying for a visa to travel to the United States," homeland security officials wrote in a fact sheet given to reporters. The timing of the ban seemed intended to reset the White House political narrative, after a turbulent week that began with Mr. Trumpâ€™s   address to Congress.
