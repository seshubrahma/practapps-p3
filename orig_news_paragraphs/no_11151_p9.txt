Indeed, the fact that people are more upset about Mr. Trump’s tone than about the destruction wrought by open borders tells us everything we need to know about the corruption in Washington. We need a person in the White House who doesn’t fear the media, who doesn’t embrace political correctness, who does n’t need the money, who is familiar with success, who won’t bow to foreign dictators, who is   and values law enforcement, and who is angry for America and NOT subservient to the interests of other nations. Donald Trump is such a man.
