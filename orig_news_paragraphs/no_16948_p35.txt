By Lisa Rose, CNN, During a discussion about gun rights and the Supreme Court, Trump said Clinton intends to nominate justices who would "dismantle" the Second Amendment. To illustrate his point, he referenced comments Clinton and her advisers have made about a landmark case that overturned a handgun ban in Washington, DC. Trump claimed Clinton was "upset" by the D. C. v. Heller decision, which reinforced the right for individuals to own firearms but included the caveat that gun rights arenâ€™t absolute.
