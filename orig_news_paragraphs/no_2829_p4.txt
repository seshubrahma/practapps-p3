The economic recovery, however, remains incomplete. The median household income was still 1. 6 percent lower than in 2007, adjusting for inflation. It also remained 2. 4 percent lower than the peak reached during the boom of the late 1990s. The number of people living in poverty also remained elevated, although it shrank last year by about 3. 5 million, or roughly 8 percent.
