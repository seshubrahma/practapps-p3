Trump is expecting a resounding win in his home state to help him reclaim the momentum he had before his   loss to Sen. Ted Cruz in the Wisconsin primary two weeks ago. Though neither Kasich nor Cruz won their home states with more than 50 percent of the vote, (Kasich had 47 percent in Ohio and Cruz had 44 percent in Texas) the New York State Republican Party delegate selection rules have given Trump a much higher margin to hit if he intends to walk away with the kind of resounding victory he needs. In order to obtain all 14 of the statewide delegates available (out of a total of 95 up for grabs Tuesday) Trump must win at least 50 percent of the vote statewide.
