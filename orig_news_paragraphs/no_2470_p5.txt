A person briefed on the process, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive conversations, said that Mr. Romney had not sought consideration for the secretary of state, and was initially contacted by Mr. Pence. In that first conversation, Mr. Romney made clear to Mr. Pence that he would accept the position if the incoming president offered it, the person said, contradicting the claim from others in Mr. Trump’s circle who are opposed to the potential appointment. The debate over Mr. Romney  —   and before him, Rudolph W. Giuliani   —   has given an opening to Mr. Petraeus, despite the cloud of scandal that still hangs over him for sharing classified information during an extramarital affair.
