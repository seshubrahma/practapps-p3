In the latest developments, the position of Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been called into question after he failed to disclose to Congress two contacts he had with the Russian ambassador to the US. The former Alabama senator said, however, that the meetings took place in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not his role as an adviser to the Trump campaign. On Thursday, Sessions recused himself from oversight duties related to investigations into the Trump campaign involving the Department of Justice. White House spokesman Sean Spicer insists that there is "no there there" in the Russia intrigue.
