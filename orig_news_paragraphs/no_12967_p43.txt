I have some bad news for you all who seek to enable Hillary by not backing Trump on religious grounds. Listen up: A Hillary Supreme Court pick will proceed to vote in lockstep with Ruth Bader Ginsburg (when Ms. Ginsburg isn’t doing something important like napping, that is) and your personal ideas about religion and Christianity will be moot, friendo. Gone when Hillary’s Court deems your faith to be a hate crime, buddy. So shut up with your NeverTrump and think about your future NeverChurch for a minute.
