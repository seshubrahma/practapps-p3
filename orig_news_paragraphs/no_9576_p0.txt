Talk radio host Mark Levin, who has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz, declared, "I am not voting for Donald Trump. Period" and "count me as never Trump" on Friday.   Levin said that a couple of years ago, the Senate Conservatives Fund contacted his publisher to buy old copies of his book, "Liberty  Tyranny" to promote membership, something he wasnâ€™t involved in.
