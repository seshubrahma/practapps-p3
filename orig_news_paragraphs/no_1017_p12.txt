The deal was called off after the Times article appeared. Unlike her husband, Jared Kushner, who is a top adviser to Mr. Trump, Ms. Trump does not hold a formal job at the White House and therefore is not likely to be considered a federal employee under ethics rules, which prohibit government workers from participating in matters that can enrich their personal business interests, according to government ethics specialists. But the more Ms. Trump participates in White House affairs  —   sitting in on meetings, conducting business from an office in the West Wing  —   the more likely it is that she could cross that line, Mr. Painter said. With that in mind, he said it was "wise" for Ms. Trump to   act as though she were already subject to such rules.
