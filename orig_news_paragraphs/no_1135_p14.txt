There is no question that the science and technology bureaucracy at the White House expanded in recent years. In the George W. Bush administration, there were 50 people in the office, but Mr. Obama more than doubled the staff, to 130, and moved the office into a building on the White House grounds. Mr. Obama turned to the science office during crises like the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa the 2011 nuclear spill in Fukushima, Japan and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The staff of the science office developed the White Houseâ€™s recommendations for regulation of commercial drones and driverless cars at the Transportation Department.
