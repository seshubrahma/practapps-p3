One reason for caution is that history shows that "intelligence community" is sometimes an oxymoron. In the 1980s, the United States accused Russia of conducting chemical warfare in Southeast Asia, citing "yellow rain" in jungles there. Years later, it turned out that this "yellow rain" may have actually been bee excrement. Democrats should be particularly wary of hinting that Trump is some sort of conscious pawn of the Russians, or is controlled by Moscow through financial investments.
