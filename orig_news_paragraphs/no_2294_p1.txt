Backhoes and dump trucks have started crushing and carting away the    French provincial home at 515 North County Road, along with an    tennis house, a pool house and a carriage house. While such   have become common in Palm Beach and other   resort towns, the demolition of the   estate known as Maison de l’Amitié, or House of Friendship, represents a new level of disposable wealth. Bought by Mr. Trump in 2004 for $41 million and sold in 2008 to a Russian billionaire for $95 million, the residence has since sat empty, a monument to the housing bubble and to Trump’s outsize salesmanship. The big question now is what will come next for one of Palm Beach’s biggest white elephants and whether its value can ever reach its 2008 record price.
