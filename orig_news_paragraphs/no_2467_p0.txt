CHASSIEU, France   —    A patriotic sea of supporters, waving red, white and blue flags, greeted the newly ascendant presidential hopeful François Fillon this week at a soulless conference center in this suburb of Lyon. Mr. Fillon described radical Islam as a "totalitarianism like the Nazis" to the cheers of an enthusiastic crowd, adding that France would need Russia’s help to fight it.
