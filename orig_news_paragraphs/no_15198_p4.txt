The Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone is a designated region of international airspace, primarily surrounding the US and Canada, that is meant as a buffer to allow for the identification of aircraft heading towards North America.   While these flights pose no real military threat, US defense officials are taking notice of the high frequency at which theyâ€™ve occurred this week. There is "no other way to interpret this other than as strategic messaging," one official told CNN. While the Russians have not conducted flights of this nature since 2015, another senior defense official stressed that they are "not a concern" and attributed the uptick to a recent lack of available Russian aircraft and need to boost training.
