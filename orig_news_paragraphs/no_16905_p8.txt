Throughout his remarks, Trump lamented the skyrocketing cost of education and the mounting total of student debt in the US, which in 2012 topped $1 trillion and has overtaken the amount of car, home and credit card debt in the country. Trump also said he would "take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition," but did not lay out those steps beyond leveraging universitiesâ€™ tax exempt status to seek out concessions on tuition costs.
