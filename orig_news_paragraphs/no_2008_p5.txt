According to Mr. Trump, the penalty would be a 35 percent tariff imposed on goods that companies ship back into the United States after they move production abroad. It is doubtful that Mr. Trump would have the legal authority to punish individual companies without congressional action. But he is also promising a broader overhaul of corporate taxes and the elimination of a host of regulations that he sees as stifling American companies, in addition to individual incentive packages like the $7 million one that Carrier received. Mike Konczal, an economist at the   Roosevelt Institute, said he also thought Mr. Trumpâ€™s approach was doomed to failure, especially if he kept his campaign pledge to reduce taxes on corporations and investors.
