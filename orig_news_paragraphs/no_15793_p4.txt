The RNC has already begun briefing its state parties, members of Congress and surrogates in preparation for Thursday’s hearing. Their primary arguments echo those of Trump’s personal lawyer    that the President feels "vindicated" by the written testimony, in which Comey acknowledged that he told Trump he was not personally under investigation. The President’s allies had been prepared to say that Trump never asked Comey to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn or anyone else. But they backed off that plan after Comey’s written testimony    which clearly contradicted that narrative    was released, according to someone familiar with the plan.
