Despite the drama surrounding the top of the ticket, Norquist had high praise for state level Republicans as a sign of the partyâ€™s future, saying, "The modern Republican party is extremely healthy. " In particular, Norquist praised actions by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as Republican leaders who made significant strides shaping the party for the better.
