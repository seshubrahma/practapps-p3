The country’s murder rate jumped more last year than it had in nearly half a century, newly released federal crime data showed, although the number of homicides remained far below the levels of the 1980s and ’90s. The data, part of an annual report released on Monday by the F. B. I. showed that the murder rate rose 10. 8 percent across the United States in 2015, part of a nearly 4 percent increase in violent crime. Fueling the surge in murders was street violence in a handful of major cities, notably Baltimore, Chicago, St. Louis, Washington, D. C. and Milwaukee, where most of the victims were young   males.
