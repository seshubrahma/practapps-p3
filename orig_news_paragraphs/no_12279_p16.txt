Since late 2012, for example, Obama has provided work permits, or school slots, to perhaps 300, 000 migrants from Central America. If allowed to stay, those migrants will cost Americans roughly $200 billion in taxpayer funds over the next 75 years.   In the first half of 2015, Obama also allowed more than 900, 000 legal immigrants in the country. That mass immigration delivered almost 1 new immigrant to the labor market for every two young Americans who begin looking for work in 2015, or one new immigrant for every two American children born that year.
