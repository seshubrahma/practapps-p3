On January 26, acting Attorney General Sally Yates met with McGahn, making clear that, based on what the Justice Department had seen, Flynn had been compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target.   It took Trump 18 days after that   meeting to fire Flynn. And when he did so, it was because Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, not because of any of the warnings Trump had been given before and during his presidency. Despite all of the trouble Flynn caused him, Trump continued to defend Flynn in public and private.
