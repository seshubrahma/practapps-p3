Donald Trump has shown his dedication to America over and over again, and, unlike politicians, most of his finest hours were not performed in the spotlight. Whether it is lending his airplanes to combats vets trying to get home, helping a marine suffering in a Mexican prison, or spending time with the members of law enforcement that protect his rallies in every city he visits, Donald Trump is clearly for America. As an outsider, I canâ€™t observe and say the same about Barack Obama or Hillary. Donald Trump has a large and beautiful family celebrating him today.
