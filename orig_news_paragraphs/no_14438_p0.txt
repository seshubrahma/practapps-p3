Washington (CNN) A series of immigration enforcement operations around the country netted more than 680 arrests, mostly criminals, the Department of Homeland Security said Monday. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement initially confirmed the   operations, which critics described as raids, Friday, saying they were a set of targeted enforcement actions much like those they had conducted periodically under the previous administration. But immigration advocates and Democratic politicians who represented the areas affected had questioned the activities    saying they were going beyond the Obama administration in targeting   individuals and scaring communities with public arrests.
