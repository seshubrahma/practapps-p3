We believe fundamental change is needed to the corrupt system in Washington D. C. We realize the entrenched interests and donor class will fight the change with all their might and we have chosen Mr. Trump as our champion. With all due respect Senator Cruz, we don’t trust you to institute the drastic changes needed because you are part of the system. Mr. Trump is, for the most part,   funding his campaign and won’t be indebted to donors that gave millions of dollars to Super PACS.
