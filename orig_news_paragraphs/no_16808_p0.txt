Washington (CNN) New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered Donald Trumpâ€™s charity to immediately halt fundraising in the state, following reports that it had not submitted to routine audits mandated by the state, the office announced Monday.   Schneiderman sent notice Friday to the Trump Foundation, alerting that it broke state law when it raised more than $25, 000 from outside donors without filing properly with the state. New York requires charities to conduct annual audits to solicit donations.
