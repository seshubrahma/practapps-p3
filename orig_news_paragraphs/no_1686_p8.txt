The poll results offer more cause for concern than confidence for Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton as they prepare for their first debate, on Sept. 26, and as early voting begins in some states next weekend. Their favorability ratings remain stubbornly low, with only about   of voters seeing each of them positively, despite the candidatesâ€™ attempts to use their conventions, commercials and public appearances to persuade voters to see them in a new light. A majority of voters say Mr. Trump does not care about the needs or problems of Hispanics most voters see Mrs. Clinton as caring about Hispanics, and a majority of voters agree with her view that most illegal immigrants in the country should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship. The nationwide telephone poll was conducted with 1, 433 registered voters from Sept. 9 to 13 on cellphones and landlines.
