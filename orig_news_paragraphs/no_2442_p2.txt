Mr. Trump’s nominee to serve as attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, has been a fierce critic of the Obama administration’s approach. He has argued that terrorism suspects should be sent to Guantánamo Bay and interrogated without access to lawyers and the right to remain silent. If confirmed, Mr. Sessions would be Mr. Comey’s boss. Mr. Sessions has also said the United States weakened itself by banning techniques such as waterboarding, which he said were legal and effective.
