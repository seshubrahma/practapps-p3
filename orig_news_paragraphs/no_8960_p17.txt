Flake, who supports dramatically expanding immigration levels beyond all known historical precedent, has repeatedly opposed Trump’s calls for immigration controls.

" To think that we’d have a wall like Donald Trump is talking about across our   border with Mexico from California to Texas isn’t very feasible, nor advisable," the Gang of Eight Senator said.
