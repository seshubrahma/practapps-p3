After a meeting with Netanyahu in New York, Trumpâ€™s campaign released a statement saying the candidate "acknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people for over 3, 000 years". " The United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the   congressional mandate to recognise Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the state of Israel," it added.
