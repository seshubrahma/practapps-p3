The clause says that "no person holding any office of profit or trust" shall "accept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state" unless Congress consents. The word emolument means compensation for labor or services. Asked about the clause by Senator Leahy, Judge Gorsuch said "the Emoluments Clause has sat in a rather dusty corner" and "is not a clause that has attracted a lot of attention until recently. "
