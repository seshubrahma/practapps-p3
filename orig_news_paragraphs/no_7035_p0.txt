Duffel Blog, a satire blog run by military veterans, published a devastating critique of National Security Adviser Army Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster’s reported support for putting more troops in Afghanistan, amid an intense White House debate over future U. S. involvement there. [The post, while serious in tone, was dripping with irony. It contrasted McMaster’s current support for escalating the war in Afghanistan with his famous study of the Vietnam War, "Dereliction of Duty," in which he criticized policymakers for escalating an "unwinnable war. "   The post is even more notable since the blog’s contributors consist of veterans and active military members who write under pseudonyms.
