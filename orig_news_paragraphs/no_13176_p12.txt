Also, the goal of the extended nomination process will be to make it so either no one gets to eight states (or what ever number the establishment changes it to) Then, under the guise of letting "the voters be heard" the Rules committee will make a more lax Rule 40. After all, Cruz and Rubio and Romney "deserve to be nominated," they will argue. Romney will enter the late primaries because he is concerned that Rule 40 B will be changed to allow only those who won some delegates from voters in the states to be considered and because he might stand a better chance of chiseling delegates from Trump in late "â€™winner take all" primaries than the hapless Rubio.
