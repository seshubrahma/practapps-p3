Crews worked Monday to restore water levels and to repair dam controls before rains expected later in the week. Water is no longer flowing over the emergency spillway and lake levels are continuing to fall, Honea said. The goal is to lower lake levels by 50 feet in anticipation of the rain, which could come as soon as Wednesday.    These efforts come amid mounting questions about why more had not been done to prevent spillway erosion after concerns were raised more than 10 years ago.
