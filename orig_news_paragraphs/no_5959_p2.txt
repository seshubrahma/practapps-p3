Should the vote come down   Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, could provide the   vote on confirmation. Trump nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has yet to be confirmed. He is among the 52 Republicans in the Senate, and if Collins and Murkowski stand firm in their determination to vote against DeVos, Sessionsâ€™ positive vote to confirm DeVos would be needed just to reach a   tie, assuming remaining senators vote along party lines. The Senate will likely hold the vote to confirm Sessions until after the vote on DeVos, should his vote be needed to confirm her.
