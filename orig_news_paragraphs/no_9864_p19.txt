If Romney thought so highly of Bill Clinton, and if Clinton had so strongly endorsed Barack Obama, then why should anyone vote for Romney? Heck, by that logic, maybe Romney himself should have voted for Obama. (Moreover, as we consider the situation today, we might also ask: If Romney thinks so highly of the Clintons and their works, should we really trust his judgment when he excoriates Trump?) Perhaps Romney, obsessed as he has been with trashing Trump, is not aware of it, but in the years since 2012, the publicâ€™s perception of the Clinton family outfit has changed dramatically.
