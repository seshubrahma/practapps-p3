 (CNN) Three federal judges Tuesday evening will hear oral arguments in the challenge to President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration. The   hearing, conducted by telephone among three West coast judges at 6 p. m. ET, will determine the immediate fate of the nationwide temporary restraining order against Trump’s travel ban.   Trump has only been in office for 17 days, but his Justice Department is already embroiled in a   legal battle that could affect hundreds of thousands of people and the direction of his presidency.
