A number of young Palestinians told Breitbart Jerusalem that all of the candidates are indifferent to the Palestiniansâ€™ "hardships," and there is virtually no difference between them. Hani Elshaeer, a Gaza journalist, said that few Palestinians are hopeful that the U. S. elections will make any difference in their lives. " All of the candidates, from both parties, are on the same page on the Arab and Muslim issues, and share a hostility towards the Palestinians and their cause. "
