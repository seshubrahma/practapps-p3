The game is one of the best things we have in Congress. It’s a night where we all come together    who may be at odds during the day in the hallways of the Capitol    and head a few blocks down the road to Washington Nationals Park to work together for a good cause.   We hope the bipartisan, unified, and civil sentiment at Thursday’s baseball game will carry into Friday’s debates. And we will continue to bring that message to Congress and the American people.
