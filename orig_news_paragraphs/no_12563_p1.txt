NBC News reports that Trump has not been too involved in transition efforts because heâ€™s too worried about jinxing the election. Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has taken over the transition effort since New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, tasked with leading the transition effort, has "drifted from the campaign," according to NBC News. It is unclear what role if any Christie will have in a Trump administration, although many experts predicted that he would be vetted for attorney general or chief of staff just a few months ago, NJ Advance Media reported. Despite reports of Christie drifting from the campaign, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence said Sunday that Christie will remain on the transition team.
