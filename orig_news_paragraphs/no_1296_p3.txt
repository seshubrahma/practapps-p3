My first book, "Before the Storm," was about the rise of Senator Barry Goldwater, the uncompromising National Review favorite whose refusal to exploit the violent backlash against civil rights, and whose bracingly idealistic devotion to the Constitution as he understood it   —    he called for Social Security to be made "voluntary"  —   led to his crushing defeat in the 1964 presidential election.
