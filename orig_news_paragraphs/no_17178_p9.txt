Mexico City, says the NFL, has the seventh largest fan base of any North American city. The NFL hasn’t played a regular season game in Mexico since 2005, but knows that football’s   audience is growing, with Nielsen marking almost a 30% rise in Hispanic viewership in the last five years. Back in 2005, the  ’ game at the legendary Estadio Azteca, a stadium better known for its soccer   set an   record at 103, 467. Monday night at Azteca, the Houston Texans and the Oakland Raiders braved altitude, pollution and laser pointers before a decidedly   crowd that mixed enthusiastic local fans with those who traveled across the border to watch.
