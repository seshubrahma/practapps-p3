President Trump on the other hand announced the formulation of the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, insisting: "Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion". Oh yeah, and President Trump said: "Islamic terrorism" just FYI. CONCLUSIONS, The way the two presidents concluded their speeches is proof enough of how differently the two men approach the issues of Islam, Islamism, terrorism, and the U. S. relationship with the Middle East. While Ivanka and Melanie strut around Riyadh in designer clothes, and the current president refuses to bow before the Saudis, Obama took every opportunity to remain prostrate before the Muslim world, in action, as well as in his words.
