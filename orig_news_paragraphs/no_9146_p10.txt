I think that has been part of his message. If you watch what he said this week, he talked about how devastating it was for Dallas, how we need to respect our law enforcement, how we need to pray for those who are killed and those who are injured. And I think that is his intent. I trust him with his words, and I think we all need to move towards being compassionate, loving, healing, but yet, also, respecting our law enforcement.
