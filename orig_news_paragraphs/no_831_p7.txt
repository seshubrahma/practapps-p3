Trump administration officials, including John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, defended the previous restrictions, saying they were needed because the countries listed did not have vetting systems in place that could guarantee that immigrants and other travelers from those nations did not pose a threat to the United States. " I believe that the travel pause from all of those countries will give us time to evaluate those countries and the information they can provide us, which will ultimately lead to safety for the American people," Mr. Kelly told a Senate committee last month. But an intelligence assessment from Mr. Kellyâ€™s own department said there was little evidence that those travelers posed an unusual threat.
