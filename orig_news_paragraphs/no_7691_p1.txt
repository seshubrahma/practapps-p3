A prior CNN poll of New Hampshire Republicans released immediately before the Iowa caucus showed Trump leading with 30 percent support, followed by Ted Cruz with 12 percent. Since the Iowa vote, Trump has dropped a point, while Rubio has risen 7 points. Ted Cruz has moved up one point in the last few days. Trump’s   movement is obviously well within the polls’ margin of error, but Rubio’s rising support is cleary a phenomenon.
