On Tuesday night, perched in a box beside her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Ms. Clinton choked up throughout her fatherâ€™s speech. He recalled the evening of her birth, the time they watched a "Police Academy" marathon, the day he dropped her off at college (Stanford) as Mrs. Clinton spread liner paper across a drawer. On Wednesday, Ms. Clinton held forth on gay rights and voter outreach at a lunch for the Human Rights Campaign, earning two standing ovations and telling the crowd that she had been straining to suppress tears all week. An attendee, John Klenert, said he had watched Ms. Clinton grow up.
