" The agency also said the revised priorities of the department’s civil rights division "do not mention the need for constitutional policing or to combat discrimination against the LGBT community or people with disabilities," adding that the budget request calls for cutting 121 positions, including 14 attorneys. The commission also called out Education Secretary Betsy DeVos by name, citing her "repeated refusal" in congressional testimony to promise that the department would enforce federal civil rights laws. Further, the administration’s proposed budget would cut 46 staff positions at the department’s civil rights office, which investigates sex, race disability and age based complaints, the statement said.
