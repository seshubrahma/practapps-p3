A net gain of five would give the Democrats 51, and outright majority. At the Labor Day mark, top Republicans involved in Senate strategy view three GOP held seats as likely lost causes: Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. They feel confident about three other   seats that at times were mentioned as possible flips: Florida, Arizona and Ohio. Assuming those calculations are correct, that would leave little room for error in three highly competitive Senate races that also happen to be in major presidential battlegrounds: Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and North Carolina.
