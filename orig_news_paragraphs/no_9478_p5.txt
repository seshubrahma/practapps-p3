Beck endorsed Cruz before the Iowa caucus last month and has been traveling and campaigning with the Texas senator ever since. At a press conference in South Carolina this week, Beck speculated as to whether his presence on the campaign trail "helps Ted Cruz or not," saying that he didn’t know, but felt compelled to "do everything I can" to help Cruz. This week Beck also expressed his belief that God allowed Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia to die in order to "wake America up to how close we are to the loss of our freedom" and to the necessity of electing Cruz to name Scalia’s replacement. Beck also stated that "if the country is lost, it will be lost because of the Christians" who did not support Cruz.
