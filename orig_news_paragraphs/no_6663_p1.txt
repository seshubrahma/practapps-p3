Look @realDonaldTrump the absurd and unnecessary expense of this project that offense and damages our neighborliness," wrote Mexican congressman Braulio Guerra on social media.    According to Guerra, Mexico should raise the fees charged to tourist legally entering the country as a way to fund projects to benefit the expected number of immigrants deported under Trump. Guerra also called for the proceeds from the fees to be used to pay for attorneys and legal advisors to the Mexican immigrants living illegally in the U. S.   In his social media post, Guerra, who is a Mexican congressman for Mexicoâ€™s Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) for the state of Queretaro claimed that it was easy for him to climb the fence and as such it would be easy for anyone to climb the fence and cross into California.
