UNICEF reports that 1. 5 million children are currently malnourished in the country, 370, 000 of them severely. The conflict began in early 2015, when Houthi rebels    a minority Shia group from the north of the country    drove out the   government, led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and took over the capital, Sanaa. The crisis quickly escalated into a   war, which allowed al Qaeda and ISIS    other enemies of the Houthis    to grow stronger amid the chaos. Yemen has perhaps received less attention from the West than Syria because its people struggle to flee    many Yemenis are too poor to pay the people smugglers who can get them out, and they do not have the proximity to Europe that the Syrians have.
