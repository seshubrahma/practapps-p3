A measure to stop people on terror watchlists was also defeated. But Democrats have decided to scrap that background check measure in favor of one sponsored by Senator Christopher S. Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat who led a filibuster of an appropriations bill Wednesday night, that would expand background checks to all gun sales except loans and gifts between family members. Some prominent Democrats have told fellow party members not to work with Mr. Toomey, who is in a tough   fight, said three Republicans with knowledge of the conversations. Indeed, Mr. Toomey and other Republicans could end up even voting against Mr. Murphyâ€™s bill.
