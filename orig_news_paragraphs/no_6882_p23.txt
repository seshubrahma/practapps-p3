I popped on Trevor Noah’s new Netflix special, Afraid of the Dark. I wanted to see whether my political bias might have clouded my judgement of Schumer’s work, and whether I might be able to laugh at another outspoken liberal’s comedy set. Surprise, surprise. Noah’s set was both funny and insightful, and he is a talented impressionist to boot.
