The fact that a prominent Klansman recently owned property across the street was seen as simply more evidence the Klan could not have been responsible. The head detective believed "the Klan would not lynch somebody practically on their own front lawn," according to Leamer. The cops told the FBI this was a simple street crime, so they lost interest. It would later become clear that Donald had been lynched because the Klan sought to make an example of any black man it could find.
