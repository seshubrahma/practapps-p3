But last night at least 49 gays were slaughtered at an Orlando club. Despite this obvious Islamic attack, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are still in denial. I can no longer remain silent as my gay brothers and sisters are being slaughtered at dance clubs. There is only one man who can lead this nation and protect all gays and all Americans.
