Mr. Kaine suggested that more voters might trust Mrs. Clinton "even a month from now," reflecting an ABC   Post poll on Sunday in which Mrs. Clinton held an edge in trustworthiness over Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee. Asked which candidate was more honest and trustworthy, 49 percent of respondents chose Mrs. Clinton and 40 percent chose Mr. Trump, while the margin was narrower  —   46 percent to 43 percent   —   among registered voters. Both results were Mrs. Clinton’s best against Mr. Trump since the poll started asking the question in May, according to a news release accompanying the poll.
