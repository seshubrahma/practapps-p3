A statement from the campaign read in part: Following a strong showing on Super Tuesday, the Cruz for President Campaign is communicating a serious commitment to competing hard in the    Sunshine State primary on March 15th. As the vaunted Ted Cruz ground operation moves into Florida, the campaign opened 10 offices all across the state this week. Commentators have repeatedly remarked on the strength of the Cruz ground game in many states. The Cruz campaign stated that the office openings will allow volunteers to connect quickly with the campaign as they make campaign calls and walk door to door.
