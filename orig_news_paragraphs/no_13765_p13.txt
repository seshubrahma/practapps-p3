The police took my camera and put a temporary pair of handcuffs on me. I was taken across the street and into the Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters for initial processing. There were about 15 other protesters being brought into the system at the same time arrests were going on throughout the night. It turned out that I was one of three reporters arrested that night, and it seems to me that reporters were very clearly targeted.
