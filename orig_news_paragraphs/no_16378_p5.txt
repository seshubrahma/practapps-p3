In fact, among Clinton voters in all three states more than    say their opposition to Trump, rather than their liking of her, is the main reason for their vote," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, in a statement accompanying the results.   "Among Trump voters, dislike of Secretary Clinton is even a larger factor in their choice. Among Trump voters, well over half say they back him because they dislike her," Brown said.   The results in Pennsylvania and Ohio largely match other recent polling in the two Rust Belt states.
