I’ve spent my life in the private sector —  not quite as successful as this guy [Trump] —  but successful nonetheless —   sufficiently successful to understand what it takes to get America to be the most attractive place in the world for innovators, entrepreneurs and business and job creators   …      I want to say thank you to Donald Trump.
