That changed Trump’s view of the group, Spicer said. It may not be a coincidence that Trump’s adoption of conventional political positions came the day after a stunning interview with the New York Post in which he publicly criticized his political guru Stephen Bannon, his insurgent, populist political conscience. Trump diminishes, but does not dismiss, Bannon, Bannon was dumped from the National Security Council last week in a move that was seen as a triumph for officials who represent a more traditional, globalist foreign policy worldview. His demotion was seen as another sign that the more moderate,   influences in his administration epitomized by his    Jared Kushner, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn were rising to the detriment of Bannon and his   cohort Stephen Miller.
