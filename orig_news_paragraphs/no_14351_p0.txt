 (CNN) Days after a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen led to the first US military combat death under Donald Trump, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released an audio message taunting the new American President. In an   recording, AQAP leader Qassim   condemned the January 29 raid, saying, "The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face."   The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group.
