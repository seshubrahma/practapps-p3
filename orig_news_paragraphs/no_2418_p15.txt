Chris Miller, the activism manager at Ben   Jerry’s, said in an interview on Friday that the letter to Mr. Trump had reached about 350, 000 people on the company’s Facebook page and that the feedback had been "overwhelmingly positive. " But he said the letter took longer to draft than the company’s other statements about causes it supports because more "eyeballs" were put on it as the company strove for balance between people who were saddened by the result and those whom "mainstream establishment candidates" did not reach.
