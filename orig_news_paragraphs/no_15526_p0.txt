Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) Dylann Roof told his dad during a November prison visit, before he was convicted of gunning down nine people in a church, that he was going to do something to make it worse. His father asked him what was wrong with him, handed the phone to his mother and walked away. Roof’s mother asked what he’d said to make his father cry before his dad quickly returned and took the phone.
