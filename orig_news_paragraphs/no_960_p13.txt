I have about a dozen Twitter accounts set to alert me to every tweet, including the @POTUS and @RealDonaldTrump accounts, as well as the president’s senior staff like @Presssec (Sean Spicer) @KellyannePolls and others. I had to adjust my Do Not Disturb settings on my iPhone so that notifications resume earlier   —   at 5:30 a. m. now. (There are overnight editors who can call me if he tweets between midnight and 5:30 a. m.)
