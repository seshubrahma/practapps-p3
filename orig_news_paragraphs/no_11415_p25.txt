Menendez has been indicted by a federal grand jury, and after a Dominican prostitution scandal linked together with alleged financial corruption and alleged impropriety as it relates to billionaire Democratic Party   Dr. Salomon Melgen, Menendez and his allies engaged in a widespread effort to attack The Daily Caller, Breitbart News, and Fox News. Menendez alleged that it was all a giant right wing conspiracy to get him —   and the mainstream media largely bought it all in early 2013, hook, line, and sinker. Later, however, Menendez was indicted on the corruption charges —  and now the Department of Justice has even confirmed the prostitution allegations surrounding Menendez, despite their decision not to prosecute him on that front since they didn’t have enough conclusive evidence to put him away there.
