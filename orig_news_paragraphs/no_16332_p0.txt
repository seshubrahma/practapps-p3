 (CNN) Hillary Clinton has widened her lead over Donald Trump in a pair of new national polls published on Thursday, as the Republican nominee ends one of the worst weeks of his campaign. Clinton opened up a   margin in the   survey, 48% to 33% which was conducted as Trump feuded publicly first with the Muslim parents of a slain American war hero and then House Speaker Paul Ryan, one of the GOPâ€™s most popular and powerful figures. Last month, Clinton held a narrow   advantage, 42% % in a   poll.
