Ponnuru seems to recognize that the emergence of immigration restrictions as a tenet of conservatism has perhaps hurt Sen. Marco Rubio, who   an immigration agenda which, in Ponnuru’s words, "would increase legal immigration, allow many illegal immigrants to become citizens, and start them on that path even if new enforcement measures against further illegal immigration turn out to be ineffective. " Tonally, Ponnuru’s declaration that immigration has become a part of "conservatives’ creed" seems to represent an evolution for Ponnuru —   a   "Reformicon" whose movement was closely aligned with immigration expansionist Eric Cantor, Ponnuru’s own views not withstanding. His recent writing seems to suggest that he now recognizes with greater force the potency of the immigration issue amongst the GOP electorate.
