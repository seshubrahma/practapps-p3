I hear right now in Atlanta are huzzahs from the CDC headquarters.   According to the GOP plan, "Our    Approach," the first of three steps towards reshaping the American health care market was thwarted on Friday when the White House, recognizing that splits within the Republican Party could not be resolved to allow passage of the AHCA, instructed Ryan to pull the bill. Step two, led by Secretary Tom Price and his team at the Department of Health and Human Services, may still proceed: "going through every page of regulations and guidance related to the Affordable Care Act to determine whether or not they work for patients," with an eye to eliminating the rules laid out by the Obama administration.   And under step three, Congress would have passed a series of laws aimed at lowering malpractice liability, enhancing    insurance marketing and eliminating all forms of family planning provisions covered with federal funds.
