For a while this spring, it seemed possible to contain the earthquake. Trump showed flickering signs of "maturing" as a candidate, and Republicans seemed willing to "support the nominee," if not endorse him. The "normalization" of Donald Trump became a media watchword, the idea that his daily affronts could be integrated into the routine paces of a quadrennial exercise. Formerly hostile primary opponents like Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry all at various points said they would support Trump or were at least no longer (in Rubio’s case) deriding him as a "fraud," "con man" and "lunatic" or (in Graham’s) a "  xenophobic, religious bigot" or (in Jindal’s) a "madman who must be stopped" or (in Perry’s) a "barking carnival act.
