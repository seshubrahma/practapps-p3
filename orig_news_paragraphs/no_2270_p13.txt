Mr. Trumpâ€™s own bench of foreign policy advisers has had comparatively little experience. Missing from the signatories are any of the living Republican former secretaries of state: Mr. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice. Mr. Trump met with Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Baker several months ago, and "I came away with a lot of knowledge," he told The New York Times in a July 20 interview. But neither of the two, who represent different foreign policy approaches within the party, has said if he will endorse Mr. Trump.
