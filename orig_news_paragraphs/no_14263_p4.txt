The vote now heads to the full Senate. Insurers warned a congressional subcommittee Wednesday morning that Congress needs to continue Obamacareâ€™s   subsidies and provide clarity on premium subsidies in the "next 30 days" so insurers can make a decision on 2018. Sen. Orrin Hatch said he wants Obamacare taxes fully repealed rather than leave some of them in place to fund a replacement. Sen. Lamar Alexander continues to say replacement will be a slow process.
