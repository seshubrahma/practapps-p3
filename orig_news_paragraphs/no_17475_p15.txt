If we lose the right to criticize the rich, powerful, and famous in   debate, we cannot say that we are free.    But even as I am disgusted at those who would take away those rights, I’m repelled by those who would try to invoke them to excuse their own irresponsibility and malice.      You can say Mrs. Trump is a plagiarizer. You can say she’s a "skank" if you are as classless as that.
