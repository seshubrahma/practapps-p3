A word of caution, though: When tickets say "obstructed view" at BAM, theyâ€™re not kidding. There was a big pillar directly in my line of vision. (Fortunately, I was able to shift over to a better seat.) The concert I attended at Villain in Williamsburg, which had the spacey   Morgan Delt as headliner, cost $10.
