This would have supposedly closed the wound of the 2012 election, which Republican elites had convinced themselves was lost only because the party was too harsh in its rhetoric on the issue. Rubio’s decision made no political sense even at the time if a bill had passed, he would have had his name on Obama’s biggest   achievement. Instead, Rubio was tarred with the details of a bill that failed, and which he abandoned, making himself look both feckless and unprincipled.   Of course, because this is Slate, we then get some egregious garbage about how Rubio’s "  past mixed with his heritage in the minds of bigoted Republican voters," which is not only insulting, but ignorant.
