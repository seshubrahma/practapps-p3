Utah’s favorite (adopted) son, Mitt Romney, also announced Friday that he would be voting for Cruz in Tuesday’s caucus. It will be a dramatic setback for Cruz if he is unable to capture all the delegates in Utah. Arizona is also voting on Tuesday, awarding all of its 58 delegates to the winner of the statewide vote. Polling is sketchy in the state, but Trump is thought to be favored to grab Arizona’s 58 delegates.
