Mr. Trump has promised to unroll all of those efforts. Mr. Trump singled out Apple for manufacturing parts of their devices abroad. He also criticized Amazon for its dominance, and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, for owning The Washington Post, which he said had been unfair in its campaign coverage of him. The announcement that Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick were joining his business policy group came ahead of a meeting with several tech leaders at Trump Tower on Wednesday, including Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer.
