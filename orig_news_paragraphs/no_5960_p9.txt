California media outlets have breathlessly reported every new challenger in what they’ve dubbed "Hillary districts" —   that is,   congressional districts that supported Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump. Darrel Issa is in one of those districtsand has become the most cagey Republican in the California delegation, having barely survived   by just over 1600 votes. His Democrat challenger in 2016, a fairly conservative military veteran in a district with more veterans than almost any other, played the "outsider card" very effectively and almost unseated the   congressman.
