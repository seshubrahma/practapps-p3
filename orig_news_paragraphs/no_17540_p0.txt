 (CNN) Donald Trump rose to the top of the GOP presidential field by harnessing the anger of many conservative Republicans about illegal immigration. But he has softened his tone in recent days    going so far as to say that he would favor a "  system" for undocumented immigrants in the U. S. After weeks of criticism over the harsh tone of his presidential campaign announcement    where he claimed that Mexican immigrants were bringing drugs and crime to the U. S. and calling some of them rapists      Trump seems to be edging toward a more moderate position.
