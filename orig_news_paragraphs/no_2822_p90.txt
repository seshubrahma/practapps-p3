I enjoyed reading it. " "Time of the Octopus" takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their   stamped conversations and those labeled as digital files ("File 004. wav") suggesting that they are the lawyerâ€™s transcribed recordings.
