Through the campaign, Ossoff was hesitant to even say Trump’s name. Instead, he sold himself as a moderate who would happily work across the aisle, who fretted about deficit spending and who wasn’t even sure he’d vote for Pelosi for House speaker.   This reality has Sen. Bernie Sanders’ liberal wing of the party concerned that the Democratic establishment is recruiting and running too many moderates    and the establishment worried that Sanders’ insurgency could view a loss as proof the party needs to embrace a much more aggressive, populist,   message.   Sanders himself fed this narrative when he pointedly answered, "I don’t know," when the Wall Street Journal asked him this spring whether Ossoff is a progressive.
