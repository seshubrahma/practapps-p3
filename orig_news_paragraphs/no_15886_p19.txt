Thankfully, special agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner,  two brave Capitol Police officers on House Majority Whip Scalise’s protective detail, took down the attacker, after suffering injuries themselves, and prevented him from doing any more damage.   Thanks to the heroism of the Capitol Police, all those injured are expected to fully recover.     But this horrific tragedy, in which the shooter’s motive appears to have been his political beliefs, has shed light on a fact that we all know to be true: Our nation is deeply divided.     Now, we must be clear    the blame for this violence and bloodshed lies solely with the attacker.
