One possible explanation for this lack of progress is that, when it comes to inevitable disagreements with allies, Obama has occupied a middle ground between the relatively gentle public prodding of his recent predecessors and the unpredictable iconoclasm of Donald Trump. Trump, like Obama, has at times been quite critical of traditional U. S. allies. But, unlike Obama, Trump doesn’t seem to be especially concerned about allies sharing U. S. values, or to expect allies to broadly share U. S. interests he wants to partner with Vladimir Putin even though he doesn’t "happen to like [the Russian political] system," and he routinely accuses U. S. allies of exploiting America’s generosity in pursuit of their own selfish goals. And, unlike Obama, Trump has suggested that he might seriously consider alternatives to these alliance arrangements should his criticisms not be addressed —  that the United States could, say, withdraw its security commitments to Japan or NATO countries if they don’t invest more in their own defense.
