Reset with Muslim world, Trump’s trip, in which he also is visiting Israel and Europe, gives him an opportunity to reset relations with the Muslim world. The President chose Saudi Arabia    home to the world ’s two holiest Muslim sites    for his first overseas stop in what his top aides have described as an overtly symbolic gesture. During his presidential campaign, Trump’s rhetoric often blurred the lines between Islam at large and "radical Islam"    like when he said "Islam hates us" in a CNN interview in March 2016.
