Though Trump initially called Comey’s decision not to pursue prosecution a "travesty," he later praised Comey for his handling of the investigation. It seems much more revealing that Comey’s firing took place a day after he reportedly stepped up his own inquiry into the Trump campaign’s alleged links to Russia. (It is worth noting, too, that Rosenstein, an Obama appointee, does not explicitly call in his memo for Comey’s dismissal    just as Comey himself criticized Hillary, but declined to recommend charges. Precision matters in   legal inquiries.)
