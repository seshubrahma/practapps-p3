I donâ€™t think we should move forward on the Gorsuch nomination until the nomination of Merrick Garland has been dealt with fairly," Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said on Thursday, signaling his support for a filibuster. Another moderate Democrat, Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, also said he would reject Judge Gorsuch and join the filibuster effort. Mr. Casey is among the 10 Democrats facing   next year in states that Mr. Trump won. Others in the group were less eager to declare their intentions.
