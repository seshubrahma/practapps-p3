Penn State student Dimitri A. Loutsik reported the two   to the police, claiming that the two protesters were solely responsible for the destruction of the posters: "We had the very successful Trump Wall event, which I attended and supplied the Trump signs for," Loutsik claimed. " I unfortunately had a class that day where attendance is mandatory and close to 25 percent of my grade, so while I was in class the majority of my signs got ripped up by two of the  . " "Fortunately we got it on video, so I and some   went to the university police and reported it," Loutsik explained.
