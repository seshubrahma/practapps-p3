CNN’s Manu Raju does a great job pushing Rubio on his Gang of Eight bill, his missed votes in the Senate. He calls him out when Rubio says if he was intending to run in 2020, which means he is assuming the GOP will lose in 2016 (?) he would not be running for reelection. Rubio, though, doesn’t rule out a   bid and sounds like the typical politician who always talks out of both sides of his mouth.
