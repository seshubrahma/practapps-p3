Rain will be moving in from the south and is expected to reach Washington shortly after daybreak on Friday. The chance of showers will increase throughout the morning    from around 40% at 7 a. m. to 70 to 80% when Trump puts his hand on the Bible to take the oath of office at noon. The rain should move out of the area by time the inaugural parade begins making its way through the District’s streets at 3 p. m.    If you’re planning to attend the inaugural festivities, bring your rain jacket or poncho, because you may need to leave your umbrellas at home.
