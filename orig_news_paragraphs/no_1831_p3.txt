The Times built an interactive delegate calculator that let readers simulate how each state primary might unfold. Using the latest polls and delegate rules specific to each state, we mapped out how each of the candidates might win   â€”   and how Mr. Trump eventually did. The Times built a similar interactive to show the many ways the Republican and Democratic nominating contests could unfold after Super Tuesday, with a special focus on the possible paths to victory available to candidates who were not the increasingly dominant Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton.
