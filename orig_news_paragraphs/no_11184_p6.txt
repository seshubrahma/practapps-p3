Obama is unique among Democrats in not outrightly condemning Bannonâ€™s appointment, falsely accusing Trump of putting a white supremacist and a white nationalist into the White House. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid both blasted Bannon, demanding that Trump rescind his decision for Bannon to serve as his adviser. " If Trump is serious about seeking unity, the first thing he should do is rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon," Reid said in a speech on the Senate floor.
