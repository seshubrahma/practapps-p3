One is that the Ninth Circuit ruling is so bad   —    it makes no reference to the underlying statute, and would give even a   hijacker the right to sue to come to the U.

However, it is not going to be persuasive to other courts, and would likely be overturned or limited to the facts of this particular case, eventually.
