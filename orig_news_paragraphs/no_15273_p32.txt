Here are my takeaways of the learned and unlearned    so far: Campaigning was fun. But I can’t run foreign policy that way. I’ve changed my views on almost every issue    from scuttling the Iran nuclear accord to declaring NATO obsolete to questioning the value of the One China policy    and tacked back to more traditional positions in line with Obama and the Republican party establishment, too. The question now is can my administration develop not positions but policies to navigate a complex world.
