Because the truth finally got over the DC Media’s defensive line, we don’t see Bill Clinton as a popular   what we see is another Bill Cosby: a sick, old pervert protected for decades by a starstruck media who have always known the truth.

Instead, we have been reminded forever that she is something almost as unforgivable as her husband: a vicious, nasty,   enabler. People are not flocking to a 225   socialist, they’re running away from the pervert’s enabler because Bernie is all they got.
