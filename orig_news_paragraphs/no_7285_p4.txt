For this, the Cuban government has arrested many every Sunday for years, beating them and shoving them into police vans, later abandoning them hours from their homes with no way of getting back. Shortly before President Barack Obama landed in Havana in March, video showed a   mob beating a group of Ladies in White who assembled the Sunday before, shouting vulgar slurs at them, tossing money their way (an insult meant to accuse them of receiving payment for their protest) and dragging them by the feet. In other "actos de repudio," as the mob attacks are known, communist agents have burned copies of the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, slathered the women in tar, and dragged them out of their homes by the hair. Soler herself was dragged onto a bus by the hair to keep her from attending Pope Francis’s Mass on the island in September 2015.
