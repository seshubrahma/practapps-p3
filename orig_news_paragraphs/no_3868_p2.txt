Gorka has served for months on the Strategic Initiatives Group, an internal organization within the White House, and as a national security adviser. His exit from the White House comes amid increased speculation that a reported lack of a security clearance prevented him from fully performing in his job. But a source told the Washington Examiner that Gorkaâ€™s role in SIG was always meant to be temporary, and suggested he had been placed there while administration officials created a   position for him elsewhere in the government. An official said Gorka has been in a "holding pattern" while he waited for the position, which will not be at the State Department, to be established.
