I’m not sure anyone is in a position to simply tell the President to stop doing something and have him actually listen. Then there’s the argument that Trump’s silence suggests he has now finally been made aware of the political    and legal    peril he is in, and that by tweeting he makes things worse, not better. Again, count me skeptical because Trump has never shied away from tweeting amid dicey legal and political circumstances before. (Remember that he called the Russia investigation the "single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history! " in the immediate aftermath of Bob Mueller’s appointment as special counsel.)
