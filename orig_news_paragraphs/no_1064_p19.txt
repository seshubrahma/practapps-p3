In addition, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, declared that California would continue to work toward its legally required target of reducing carbon emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And the state has retained Eric H. Holder Jr. the former United States attorney general, to advise on potential legal fights with the White House. Even at the federal level, the presidentâ€™s announcement alone will not be enough to immediately roll back emissions standards, a process expected to take more than a year of legal and regulatory reviews by the E. P. A. and the Transportation Department.
