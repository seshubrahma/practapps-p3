Nehlen ran a   grassroots campaign that stayed on message and focused on Ryan’s support for globalization, and contrasted that with his —  and Trump’s —  support for a more nationalistic system of governance. Ryan told local voters he thinks parts of it need to be renegotiated before Congress would vote on it. Ryan promised there would be no vote on the trade pact without such changes, saying there is not enough support for it among his colleagues —  and that of course he doesn’t support it without renegotiations. Without getting too far into the weeds on process, it is impossible for Obama to renegotiate any of the TPP and then   it to Congress in time for approval before he leaves office.
