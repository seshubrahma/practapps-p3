Testiness is not a presidential look.   The fact that at several points Trump was arguing with moderator Lester Holt showed that things were not going his way. In one of the most notable moments of the night, Trump’s declaration that he had a much better temperament than Clinton earned spontaneous laughter from the audience at Hofstra University. As Trump might say: "Sad."     Unusual omissions tonight: No mentions of Trump’s feuds with everyone from a distinguished   judge to a Gold Star family.
