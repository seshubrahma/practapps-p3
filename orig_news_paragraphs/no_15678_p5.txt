The NIH estimates that more than 25 million Americans have rare genetic diseases. Research from the Instituteâ€™s Office of Rare Diseases Research and the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program informs their care, and it also helps diagnose and treat millions of people with more common diseases.   The hallmark of rare disease research and care is consultation    between advocating parents and attentive doctors, between clinicians and researchers and between medical experts and elected officials. Consultations get sick babies diagnosed, keep their treatment regimens from killing them and help scholars devise the cures that save lives of millions more like them.
