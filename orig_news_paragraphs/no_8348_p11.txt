In the United Kingdom it is called the "Shy Tory Factor," where polls consistently underestimate the strength of the Conservative Party going into elections. In 2015, polls showed the Labour Party leading or tied with the Tories, only to lose 26 seats and watch its leader Ed Milliband resign in disgrace. Similarly, going into the referendum on whether to leave the European Union, Brexit, polls leading up to the vote showed "Remain" consistently ahead.
