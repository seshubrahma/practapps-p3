The report states that two weapons used in the murder of Agent Zapata and wounding of Agent Avila traced back to a   gun show purchase by Otilio Osorio, and a purchase by Robert Riendfliesh at a gun store in Beaumont, Texas. The report continues, stating the ATF suspected the two men were trafficking firearms to Mexico but failed to further investigate the purchases until after the murder of Agent Zapata. ATF agents eventually arrested the two men in connection with the purchases. Despite the length of time since the incident, the creation of the report, and its issuance, Director Brandon told Chaffetz he was not prepared for the hearing.
