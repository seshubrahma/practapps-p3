On Monday, Jan. 9, less than two weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, hosted a dinner at his office in the Capitol with members of Trump’s inner circle. The guests included the  ’s chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon his    and family consigliere, Jared Kushner his chief of staff, Reince Priebus his economic adviser, Gary Cohn his nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin his incoming deputy chief of staff, Rick Dearborn and his   director, Marc Short. The ostensible purpose of the dinner was to discuss the details of Trump’s legislative agenda   —   in particular, the prospects for a sweeping   measure that Republicans, and especially Ryan, have been coveting for the past decade.
