The young family found shelter among other displaced Yazidis in a refugee camp, where Dilbireen was born on January 4, 2015. A year later, around Dilbireen’s first birthday, a fire sparked by a malfunctioning gas heater set his crib ablaze. Flosa was baking bread outside when her baby’s crib went up in flames, and people nearby rushed to his aid. Dilbireen was severely burned on his face and feet, but a blanket protected the rest of his body from harm.
