Clinton, in an interview with CNNâ€™s Wolf Blitzer, said the Dallas ambush was "absolutely horrific" and called on people to support the police. She proposed national guidelines for the use of force by officers and asked white Americans to put themselves in the shoes of African Americans.   " We just have to make up our minds that we are going to bring our country together," Clinton said.
