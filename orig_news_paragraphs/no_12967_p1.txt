I know this: I support Donald Trump to try and restore us first to sanity, then back to greatness. If you don’t believe the Constitution and our very way of life hang in the balance in this election, then you’d better start paying attention.   I’ve been supporting and promoting Donald Trump for President for a long time   —   whether it’s on the road, or on JoeForAmerica.
