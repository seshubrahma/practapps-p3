Hence the "fake news" narrative the  ’s media propagandists invented last year: to discredit the alternative viewpoints expressed everywhere from the conservative blogosphere to news sites like Breitbart. It’s no coincidence that the politicians agitating for Facebook to come down harder on "fake news" are the ones who have most to fear from the Brexit and Trump revolutions   —   people like Labour’s Yvette Cooper in the UK, Angela Merkel’s government in Germany which is planning to punish Facebook with swingeing fines it fails to toe the line. This has nothing to do with decency or fairness or balance.
