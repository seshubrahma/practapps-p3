Yet even across the ocean, Mr. Trump was unable to escape the news of the campaign trail. A group of Scottish communities and leaders organized a phone call Friday to discuss their opposition to Mr. Trumpâ€™s candidacy. Mr. Trump, who nonetheless received a fairly warm welcome in Scotland, where locals say they appreciate the money he has poured into the village economy since buying the golf course in 2014, is unlikely to be greeted as cheerfully when he visits Balmedie, north of Aberdeen. There, his course, Trump International Golf Links, has been rived with controversy, with Mr. Trump trying to push locals out of their homes, promising jobs that never materialized, fighting over an offshore wind farm and even suing the Scottish government.
