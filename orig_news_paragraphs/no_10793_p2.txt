There is a contrast, I would say, between how you’re speaking about it and how Mr. Trump spoke about it yesterday. He’s being criticized for talking about the New York bomb before local officials or local law enforcement had a chance to do so. He told the Colorado Springs crowd that "a bomb went off in New York, and nobody knows exactly what’s going on "  —   that’s really just a few minutes after the incident.
