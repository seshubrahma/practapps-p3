And if there were one more plotline for Alicia, what would it be? MARGULIES One of the things I found interesting this year was what Eli [the political adviser to Peter Florrick] kept saying, that Alicia’s the star. Because Alicia doesn’t see herself that way, at all. So even though there was this jilted run for state’s attorney that she got thrown under the bus for, I would love to see how far that could go.
