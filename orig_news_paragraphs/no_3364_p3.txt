Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said there was an "international responsibility" for countries to take action over climate change during a trip to Europe for talks with European Union officials. The communist leader also claimed there is a "global consensus" on the need to fight climate change. " In an unprecedented step, the European Union and China are to release a joint statement in a sign of the increasing closeness between Brussels and Beijing  â€”   and the widening divide between Brussels and Washington under Mr Trump," the Independent reported.
