The Supreme Court also barred Clinton from practicing law before the nation’s highest court. Trump made a reference to an $850, 000 fine Bill Clinton paid to Paula Jones. This was, in fact, an    settlement Clinton reached with Jones, not a fine leveled by the court.   The purpose of reaching an    settlement is to avoid an unpleasant trial that could very well end with even worse consequences, so Trump is basically correct that Clinton’s conduct cost him $850, 000, and he didn’t want to pay it
