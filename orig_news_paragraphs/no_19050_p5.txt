all did so long before Trump was born. ’ ’    With the Manhattan billionaire having been born in 1946,   Eisenhower was the president who represented Trump’’s most   formative years, having served in office from 1953 to 1961. Trump   once lined up with fellow students in the late 1950s to wave at   Eisenhower as he passed by in a limousine on his way to deliver   the first pitch of the World Series between the New York Yankees   and the Brooklyn Dodgers, as reported in the recently released   "Trump Revealed," which also noted that Trump, whose father was a   Republican, wore "I like Ike" pins during Eisenhower’’s reelection   year.
