These protesters did not have the agenda of overthrowing capitalism that many of the top leaders of Black Lives Matter have they want police abuse to end, and they see the Alton Sterling case as emblematic of that problem. I was open with everyone about what I did for a living and that I work for a conservative website, as well as being a Republican. I encountered no hostility whatsoever for those beliefs, although I did get some genuine curiosity, particularly from some of the younger black man who had never really had a conversation with a Republican. They were curious as to my opinion of Donald Trump, and one of my fellow inmates told me flatly that he was planning to vote for Donald Trump.
