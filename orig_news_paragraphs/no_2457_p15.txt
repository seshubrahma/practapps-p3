A handful of state Democratic leaders have entered or are considering entering the race, and Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and D. N. C. chairman, has also expressed interest.

O. has been considering an endorsement of Mr. Ellison but delayed its decision, in part because organized labor has a good relationship with Mr. Perez.
