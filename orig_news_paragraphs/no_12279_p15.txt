That process sharply increases the resident population of of   professionals in the United States, so helping hold down Americansâ€™ salaries across the economy. In Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, for example, the current population of up to 40, 000   employees is augmented by roughly 75, 000 foreign professionals who have gotten Green Cards via their employers since 1990.   The inflow of extra   temporary workers is being accompanied by a sharp increase in the numbers of unskilled migrants seeking   jobs sought by Americans. Since late 2012, for example, Obama has provided work permits, or school slots, to perhaps 300, 000 migrants from Central America.
