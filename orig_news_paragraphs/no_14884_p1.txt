Leshchenko showed CNN a   document that appears to bear Manafort’s signature on a contract and invoice for 501 units of assorted computer equipment, yielding a payment of $750, 000. CNN has been unable to verify the document’s authenticity, and Manafort said through a spokesman that he did not recognize the document and that the signature was not his. But, if genuine, it could be another piece of the puzzle in an investigation launched by Ukrainian authorities looking at whether Manafort and others received millions of dollars in illegal payments from Yanukovych’s party.   The document is dated October 14, 2009, during the years when Manafort worked for Yanukovych as a political consultant in Kiev. The date of the invoice and the $750, 000 listed on it match the details logged in an    ledger, first reported on by the New York Times, which purports to be from Yanukovych’s party, listing the series of secret payments now under investigation.
