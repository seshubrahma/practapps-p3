Nor did NBC fulfill Broaddrick’s request, which she says was communicated in the letter, for an apology from Mitchell on the "Today Show" as well as an acknowledgement on the show and on NBC’s website that there is no information that Broaddrick’s story has been discredited.   Instead, a staffer from NBC informed Hickey that the "discredited" statement had been removed, Broaddrick and Hickey said. " It is incredibly disappointing that NBC and Andrea Mitchell will not publicly apologize for this egregious error, especially considering that NBC has retroactively edited the online version of the story and taken out the word ‘discredited,’" Hickey told Breitbart News.
