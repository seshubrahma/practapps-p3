Muslim population would exceed Germany’s current Muslim population, according to data from Pew Research Center and the Department of Homeland Security. [According to a Pew report published earlier this week, "as of 2010, there were 4. 8 million Muslims in Germany. "   A Pew report from January of this year estimated that there are roughly 3. 3 million Muslims living in the United States. This means that today the U. S. already has a larger Muslim population than does Kuwait, or Brunei, or Bahrain, or Djibouti, or Qatar.
