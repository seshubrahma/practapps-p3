We defend the right to independent   organization necessary to achieve this liberation, including the right to separate   revolutionary parties. As a result of historical developments since the annexation of Mexican land by the United States, there emerged an oppressed   nation of Aztlan. Since annexation, there has been a continuous struggle for land and justice (tierra y libertad). We support the right to   up to and including secession for that nation.
