Mexican critics of Mr. Trump say he has already damaged the image of their country and of the Mexican people with his espousal of views that many regard as xenophobic. At a rally to kick off his campaign in June, the Republican candidate suggested that many Mexican immigrants were drug traffickers and rapists. Mexican officials, concerned about negative impressions of Mexico in the United States, have been rolling out a strategy to improve the image of their country and show how the relationship between the two nations has been of "mutual benefit," said Paulo Carreño, the newly appointed under secretary for North America in Mexico’s Foreign Ministry. The strategy includes "cultural diplomacy,"   activism and the deployment of Mexican community and business leaders living in the United States, he said.
