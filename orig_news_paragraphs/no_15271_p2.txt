A top Democrat    House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer    issued a statement Thursday morning saying he would advise his fellow Democrats to oppose the   bill if Republicans tried to pass their latest version of health care reform. On Thursday, Republicans had reached new agreements within their own caucus to improve their chances of passing their health care bill    but ultimately decided against bringing it to the floor this week. The   government funding bill, planned for a vote Friday, must be passed by midnight to keep federal agencies open through May 5.   House Speaker Paul Ryan said at a news conference that the House would act when Republicans feel they "have the votes" to pass their bill, though he gave no indication of a time frame.
