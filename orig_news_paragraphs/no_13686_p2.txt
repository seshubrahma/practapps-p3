In 2005 Cruz, then the solicitor general of Texas, reportedly wanted Bush to nominate federal appeals courth judge Michael Luttig to the Supreme Court. Cruz clerked for Luttig, himself Scalia’s first law clerk when Scalia became a federal appeals judge in 1982, then clerked for Chief Justice Warren Burger. The first President Bush appointed Luttig to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 1991, where he quickly earned the reputation of being a hardcore originalist in the mold of Antonin Scalia. But once Bush decided to pass over Luttig and others in favor of Roberts, Cruz joined other conservatives in supporting Roberts’s confirmation.
