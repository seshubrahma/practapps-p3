The image was posted by an anonymous account on June 22 at 2:16 a. m. EDT in response to a post pointing to news reports that Russian hackers may have breached the Clinton Foundation’s computer systems. Mic. com first reported that the image appeared on the website. CNN confirmed the report using the internet archiving site the Wayback Machine, which allows users to search archived content on websites from days, months and even years earlier. The image    which drew a rebuke from the national leader of the   League and others    is identical to the one posted on Trump’s Twitter account, except it does not include the graphic of a Fox News poll.
