"Conservatives Against Trump" group endorses brokered convention strategy against Trump and is keeping other options open in case that fails. We call for a unity ticket that unites the Republican Party.   If that unity ticket is unable to get 1, 237 delegates prior to the convention, we recognize that it took Abraham Lincoln three ballots at the Republican convention in 1860 to become the partyâ€™s nominee and if it is good enough for Lincoln, that process should be good enough for all the candidates without threats of riots. We encourage all former Republican candidates not currently supporting Trump to unite against him and encourage all candidates to hold their delegates on the first ballot.
