Here’s one more fact that will help you understand that Thomas Aquinas and the Church aren’t the   puritans that your lying professors claim:   St. Thomas and before him St. Augustine both followed this   view I’ve described when it came to prostitution. They thought it was wrong to do, but foolish to make illegal. I don’t think they’d approve of   so my 20s still require some apologizing for, but it is still an amazingly progressive position, Sorry feminists.
