Donald Trump’s campaign is calling Hillary Clinton’s press conference outside of her plane on Thursday morning "desperate. "["Last night Hillary Clinton again failed the    test, where she was unable to answer for her terrible foreign policy judgment, mishandling of classified information and claims that the VA wait time scandal was overblown," Trump’s senior communications adviser Jason Miller stated in a press release, responding to Clinton taking questions from reporters the morning after NBC’s    forum where both presidential candidates took questions from Matt Lauer.   Miller continued: Her claim that no lives were lost in Libya was an insult to the memory of the four brave Americans who died in Benghazi.
