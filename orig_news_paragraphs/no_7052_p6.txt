In other art news, following Donald Trump’s election as President of the United States of America, actor Shia LaBeouf launched an art exhibit titled "He Will Not Divide Us" in protest. The exhibit, which consisted of a wall in New York City with a   livestreaming camera attached to it, where people could go and chant against Trump, was intended to last for four years. However, after four location changes due to   from Trump supporters, trolls from 4Chan, and violence from LaBeouf himself, the exhibit was closed down indefinitely just several months after its launch. In October, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City also added the world’s first set of emojis to their prestigious art collection, while in 2012, the museum added numerous revolutionary video game titles to their collection, choosing games which held an artistic significance.
