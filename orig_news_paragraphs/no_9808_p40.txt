We know Hollywood loves communists, but they wouldn’t even go to Venezuela. I did publish a plan this week to help them out.   My simple proposal, the MILO Plan, is to relocate Hollywood celebrities, journalists, and anyone else too scared to live in Trump’s America  …      to Cuba. They can culturally appropriate the food, and maybe even the poverty and misery of living under a brutal dictator.
