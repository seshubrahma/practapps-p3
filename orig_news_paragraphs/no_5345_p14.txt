The Times of Israel reported at the time: Israel’s Channel 10 TV on Friday night quoted Israeli officials branding the American leak as "scandalous. " For Israel’s ally to be acting in this way was "unthinkable," the officials were quoted as saying. A second TV report, on Israel’s Channel 2, said the leak "came directly from the White House," and noted that "this is not the first time" that the administration has compromised Israel by leaking information on such Israeli Air Force raids on Syrian targets.
