What we saw in Tim Kaine was a friendly, loyal, bland but upstanding (upblanding?) politician who ably filled his role as Hillary Clinton’s staunch defender, but who fell a bit short in executing the other half of his job, as the ticket’s designated attack dog.

Still, he managed to come off as both human and humane, and certainly did no harm to the Democrats’ prospects.
