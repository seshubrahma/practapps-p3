Like other recent polling, the Monmouth poll found a solid pocket of support for   candidates. Clinton’s lead shrinks slightly when pollsters included libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who pulled down a combined 13 percentage points.    Also consistent with other polling, both candidates have negative favorability ratings, though Trump is further underwater. The mogul also has more voters who say it is very important to keep him out of the White House (49%) than Clinton, (41%).
