Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a Republican   on immigration who has advised Mr. Trump on the issue, said the proposal was a statement of purpose that would be filled in with details in coming months. " He has been very clear and very strong that we need to pause until we have time to figure out this violent jihadist thing and get it under control," Mr. Sessions said.
