Obama also said in the statement announcing that the diplomats have been ordered to leave the country and that those individuals and their families were given 72 hours to leave the United States. " These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm US interests in violation of established international norms of behavior," Obama said in the statement.    Donald Trump    who has publicly expressed skepticism that Russia meddled in the election    said Thursday itâ€™s time for the US to "move on" regarding the hacking.
