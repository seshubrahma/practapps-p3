Mr. Trump has often said that the United States could abandon Nafta altogether if renegotiating it is not possible. But the hawkish rhetoric of the campaign has given way to more measured statements on trade from the administration that track more closely with the stance of many congressional Republicans, who are avid promoters of free trade and deeply skeptical of policies they view as restrictive or protectionist. " In terms of what we consider to be President Trumpâ€™s economic nationalist objectives and what he has said previously about Nafta, the list of negotiating terms was relatively benign," said Scott S. Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White  Case.
