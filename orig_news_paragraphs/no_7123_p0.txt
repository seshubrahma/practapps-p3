Over 20 immigrant workers are claiming a case of wrongful termination from a Michigan car factory after they skipped work to participate in the   "Day Without Immigrants" rally in February, the Detroit Free Press reports. [The former employees of EZ Industrial Solutions, an auto parts manufacturer based in Detroit, have taken their case to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on grounds that they were wrongfully fired for participating in a political protest.   The complaint claims that the employees, who were nearly all women from Mexico and Central America, were "coercively questioned" by their employer about their plans to participate, and were originally warned they would only be suspended for one week. However, the company denies the allegations, saying that their decision was within the confines of the law.
