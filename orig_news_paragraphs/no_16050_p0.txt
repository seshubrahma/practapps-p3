Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s trade speech Thursday veered off course when he didn’t stop a woman who, while pointing to her head, objected to the "heeby jobbies" worn by some employees at the Transportation Security Administration. The comment during a town hall in New Hampshire was an apparent reference to hijabs, or headscarfs, that some Muslim women wear. When the woman urged him to replace Muslims with U. S. military veterans at TSA, Trump said, "And we are looking at that," seemingly indicating he was considering a new policy.
