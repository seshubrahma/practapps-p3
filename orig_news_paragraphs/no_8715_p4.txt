To be clear, Ibarguen’s relationship with the Clintons has raised red flags before. Hillary Clinton’s speech at the Newseum Freedom Forum, which Ibarguen chairs, presented a conflict of interest because payment for the space would have been a direct contribution from Clinton to a CGI donor. Ibarguen also sat on Clinton’s Foreign Affairs Policy Board during her tenure as Secretary of State. Members of the board included Clinton presidential campaign Chair John Podesta and Strobe Talbott, a longtime advisor to Soros.
