Many   transgender people, such as myself, do not experience gender identity discrimination in accessing public bathrooms because we do not appear to others to have altered our birth sex identity. And many people who do experience gender identity discrimination in public bathrooms do not identify as transgender. This includes a range of people whose appearances are "gender variant," be they   girls or women,   boys or men, or androgynous people.   Some gender variant people are lesbian or gay, while others are bisexual, heterosexual or asexual.
