Kasich didn’t damage himself, but he certainly didn’t vault into the top two. So Trump is the prohibitive favorite going into Super Tuesday. For those who oppose Trump’s nomination, like me, it’s disheartening to realize that none of the other candidates on stage are capable of damaging this lying, bullying wreck of a candidate. But if they can’t beat him, they’ll be just as defunct as Trump Steaks this time next week.
