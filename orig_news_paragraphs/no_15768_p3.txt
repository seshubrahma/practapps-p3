Ostensibly, in response to this statement, the Saudi Press Agency said, "(Qatar) embraces multiple terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at disturbing stability in the region, including the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS (Islamic State) and al Qaeda" as well as "rebel militias" in Yemen. But the truth is there is likely something else at play here. Trump’s continued hard line against Iran, his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, his refusal to reaffirm NATO’s Article Five and his administration’s statement that "the world is not a ’global community’ but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors, and businesses engage and compete for advantage," is an effective declaration that the age of negotiation and nuance is over and the era of confrontation and collision has begun.   If continued negotiations between the Gulf Cooperation Council    an alliance designed to counter Iranian influence in the region    and Iran were imminent, it would make sense to allow Qatar to remain   (it’s in the GCC after all, so it isn’t actually neutral).
