But "The Boss Baby"  —   in the tradition of "Look Who’s Talking," Stewie from "Family Guy" and the   Baby Herman from "Who Framed Roger Rabbit "  —   proved enormously popular, pushing past Belle of "Beauty and the Beast" to take in roughly $49 million. Theaters far from the coasts (Indianapolis, Denver) saw especially strong turnout, according to the film’s distributor, 20th Century Fox. Produced by DreamWorks Animation, "The Boss Baby" cost at least $200 million to make and market.
