I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there," Donald Trump says of a married woman who rejected his sexual advances,  in a video released by the Washington Post.     While plenty of his words are coarser than this, with a number of news outlets saying that they describe sexual assault, "bitch" stood out to me because it’s the very same slur his supporters have chanted, referring to his opponent Hillary Clinton. It also appears on the   they wear at his rallies. Trump’s supporters have long flung this epithet at Clinton.
