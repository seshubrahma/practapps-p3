The problem is that if you get it done, you own the entire system of American medicine.  . . . If you replace, you are going to have to redo all of American medicine all over again, and then you become responsible. . . .   So if something goes wrong in anybody ’s life —  denied coverage, lousy coverage, no available doctor, premiums increasing, whatever it is —  whether or not it is caused by the replacement bill, you will be responsible for it and blamed.
