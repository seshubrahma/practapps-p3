To some extent, US commanders are ensuring they have the right assets and top level personnel on duty if there is a North Korean provocation, given the rising rhetoric from the regime there. In another sign of US military concern, Gen. Vincent Brooks, the top US commander in South Korea, has decided skip   congressional hearings and remain in the country. " All decisions regarding the schedules of USFK leadership are based on our alliance priority to maintain readiness at all times," said Col. Robert Manning, a US military spokesman.
