Even as Russia insists that RT is just another global network like the BBC or France 24, albeit one offering "alternative views" to the   news media, many Western countries regard RT as the slickly produced heart of a broad, often covert disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about democratic institutions and destabilize the West. Western attention focused on RT when the Obama administration and United States intelligence agencies judged with "high confidence" in January that Mr. Putin had ordered a campaign to "undermine public faith in the U. S. democratic process," discredit Hillary Clinton through the hacking of Democratic Party internal emails and provide support for Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate said he wanted to improve relations with Russia. The agencies issued a report saying the attack was carried out through the targeted use of real information, some open and some hacked, and the creation of false reports, or "fake news," broadcast on   news media like RT and its sibling, the internet news agency Sputnik. These reports were then amplified on social media, sometimes by computer "bots" that send out thousands of Facebook and Twitter messages.
