His name is Mustafa Ali, and, according to a tearful requiem in Inside Climate, he has resigned in protest at EPA budget cuts, which will see the agency lose 20 percent of its 15, 000 staff and $2 billion from its $8 billion. " Jumped before he was pushed" is the phrase that comes to mind, for it is likely that Ali’s department will be dismantled altogether. Ali has written a resignation letter to Scott Pruitt saying what a mistake this would be. But if you go to the EPA’s website and see what the Environmental Justice Department has been doing for the last few years, you may disagree with this assessment.
