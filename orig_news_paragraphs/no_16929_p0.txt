Washington (CNN) After Juanita Broaddrick tweeted in January that former President Bill Clinton raped her, Clinton’s attorney, David Kendall, and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, held a call to talk about the case and evidence that could be used to refute the allegations, according to hacked emails released by WikiLeaks. The hacked email, entitled "History of Juanita Broaddrick Allegations," contained several attachments. The documents were made public on Saturday as part of WikiLeaks’ hack of Podesta’s email account.
