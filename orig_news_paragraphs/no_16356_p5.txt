Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns to the public, a common practice for modern presidential candidates, saying heâ€™s under audit.   The bucking of the   tradition has fueled considerable criticism and speculation over what the documents might contain, including whether Trump has any business dealings with Russia.   The US rival has been accused of being behind the hacked DNC emails, and the resulting controversy led to the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the ouster of several other top DNC officials. Assange told CNN last week his organization has "more material related to the Hillary Clinton campaign."
