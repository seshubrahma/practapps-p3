During the election, Ryan said he was determined to message on Medicare cuts: "We want this debate. We need this debate, and we will win this debate," Ryan said. It was unclear why Ryan wanted the election to be a referendum on Medicare cuts, which even for those who believe such cuts are fiscally necessary often view them as something that can only be done after winning an election rather than a rallying cry before the election is held. Ryan and Romney not only lost the election, but Ryan failed to win his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin.
