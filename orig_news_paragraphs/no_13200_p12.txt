As Breitbart News reported previously, "city leaders in Flint, Michigan have not been informed" by the federal government of plans to resettle 100 Syrian and Iraqi refugees there in FY 2017. Plans by the resettlement agencies to expand the program to a number of previously untouched areas of the state, such as Traverse County, and increase the number of refugees resettled in FY 2017 by 38 percent to 5, 600 are likely to meet resistance from local county and city officials who have, until now, had no idea they have been targeted for refugee resettlement. Recent polls in Michigan indicate that Trump has closed the gap in the normally blue state and now trails Clinton by only three percent, within the margin of error. Intensity of opposition to increases in refugee resettlement appears to be one of the factors behind Trumpâ€™s rise.
