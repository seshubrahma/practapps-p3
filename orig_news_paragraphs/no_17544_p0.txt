Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s presidential campaign said Sunday it fired a staffer after racially charged Facebook posts he allegedly wrote were uncovered Friday. Effective immediately, Sam Nunberg, a Trump political adviser, is "no longer associated with the Donald J. Trump for president campaign," Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski confirmed to CNN.   The news of Nunberg’s firing was initially reported by Mark Halperin of Bloomberg Politics.
