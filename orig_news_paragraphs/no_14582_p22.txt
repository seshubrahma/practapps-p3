The origins of its nickname are a little murky, but legend has it that upon seeing the trophy for the first time back in 1929, Academy librarian Margaret Herrick said it looked like her Uncle Oscar. Good thing her uncle wasnâ€™t named Beavis.   The academy adopted the nickname officially in 1939. I mostly just want to see pretty fashions on the red carpet.
