Though Beck’s latest prediction has fallen flat, the enmity that prompted it seems deeply rooted. This isn’t the first time Beck has lashed out at Bannon, who hosted Breitbart News Daily in the  :00 a. m. time slot preceding Beck’s radio show on SiriusXM’s Patriot Channel 125. Last February, after Beck’s endorsed candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) lost the Nevada primary to Trump, Beck launched into an angry rant on his radio show calling Trump supporters "Brownshirts" and comparing Bannon, a former Surface Warfare Officer in the U. S. Navy, to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.
