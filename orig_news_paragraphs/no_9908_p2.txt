I am    of the Norwegian daily newspaper Aftenposten. I am writing this letter to inform you that I shall not comply with your requirement to remove a documentary photography from the Vietnam war made by Nick Ut," wrote Hansen in his open letter. The demand that we remove the picture came in an   from Facebook’s office in Hamburg this Wednesday morning. Less than 24 hours after the   was sent, and before I had time to give my response, you intervened yourselves and deleted the article as well as the image from Aftenposten’s Facebook page.
