The latest solution from GOP "leadership" grab bag of bad ideas is the   proposal to "help" America with her huge ($491 billion) global trade deficit with the Border Adjustment Tax (BAT). The idea goes like this: The U. S. will tax all imports at 20 percent and provide a rebate of 20 percent on American exports sold abroad. That is not only counterproductive from a trade deficit reduction standpoint it is skewed to help large American corporations over small and   American producers. American trade with many countries is a net positive for a slew of nations.
