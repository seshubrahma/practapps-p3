Frederic C. Hof, a former Obama administration official who has been a vociferous advocate for more robust intervention against Mr. Assad, said it was too early to predict Mr. Trump’s Syria policy   —   especially since he had more to learn about the conflict. " No doubt Mr. Trump will learn during the course of his intelligence briefings," Mr. Hof wrote in an essay published by the Atlantic Council, a Washington policy institute, that Mr. Assad’s "collective punishment policy" and "mass homicide" of opponents drives recruitment for the Islamic State and Al Qaeda.
