Plans from House Speaker Paul Ryan and the budget committee chairman Tom Price,   Donald J. Trumpâ€™s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, would both offer a flat tax credit to help buy insurance that varies by age.

The health law provided federal funds for states to offer Medicaid coverage to anyone earning less than about $16, 000 for a single person or $33, 000 for a family of four. Not every state chose to expand, but most did.
