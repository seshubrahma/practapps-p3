A trail of clues led agents to Mauricio Ortega, the editor of La Prensa, a   daily in Mexico City, who had a media credential for the Super Bowl. Confronted, he turned over not only that missing jersey but also a Brady jersey from the 2015 Super Bowl and a helmet thought to belong to Von Miller of the Denver Broncos, (not Vonn, as we wrote earlier) M. V. P. of last year â€™s Super Bowl.
