Congress may change that between now and April 28, but, The actual number of refugees resettled in the United States during the first 3 months and 21 days of FY 2017 between October 1, 2016 and January 21, 2017, the last day of the Obama administration, was 30, 132, according to the Department of State interactive website, a rate that if continued through the entire fiscal year would result in a total of about 97, 200 refugees resettled in the United States by September 30, 2017, the end of FY 2017. Congress, however, has, of now, only appropriated funding sufficient to resettle 48, 901 refugees in the United States in FY 2017, which is 1, 099 below the limit of 50, 000 President Trump established in Executive Order 13780. Officials at the Department of State as well as all the refugee resettlement agencies —  including HIAS —  are well aware that their funding for FY 2017 is about to run out, and that circumstance is entirely unrelated at this time to President Obama’s September 22 "presidential determination" that set the maximum limit of refugees authorized to resettle in the United States in FY 2017 at 110, 000. As of March 23, 38, 453 refugees have been resettled in the country, so under current budget appropriations, there is money to resettle only an additional 10, 448 refugees in the country for the balance of FY 2017.
