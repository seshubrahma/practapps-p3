Welcome to a radical new world of fear as virtue, ignorance as strength and bigotry run amok. Please take care if you are a minority, especially a visible minority: I would not be surprised if, as was the case in the months after Brexit (indeed, still occurring) extremists will be emboldened feeling that their prejudices have now received an official stamp of approval. I wouldn’t say this is a final nail in the coffin, but the Western world has suffered a terrible blow this year and it came from within.   —   Joe Collison in London.
