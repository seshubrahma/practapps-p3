Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, said he still opposed the bill because he did not believe it would give people "complete and affordable access" to health insurance. At the same time, a new estimate of the billâ€™s cost and its impact on health coverage further soured the picture for wavering lawmakers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Thursday issued a report on the revised version of the health care bill showing that it would cost more than the original version but would not cover more people. The report said the bill, like the original version, would result in 24 million fewer Americans having health insurance in 2026 than under current law.
