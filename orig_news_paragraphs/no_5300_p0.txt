Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union," Sen. Bernie Sanders (I. ) said Trump "did not tell the truth" based on what he said during the campaign and what he has done so far as president of the United States.   "Let’s be clear. I mean, the point here is that, I think, all over grassroots America, whether they’re Democrats, independents or Republicans, people are perceiving that Trump did not tell the truth in his campaign in terms of what he would do as president of the United States," Sanders said.
