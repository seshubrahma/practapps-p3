It was just an intense game that saw Mexico, which lost to the US   in the last four World Cup qualifying games in Mapfre Stadium, send the US into a tailspin that just culminated this week in the firing of head coach JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann.    The   photograph was reminiscent of another where the impact of the game went beyond the score. Taken in France in 1998 when the US and Iran met in the World Cup, the game "did more in 90 minutes than the politicians did in 20 years," said US defender Jeff Agoos. A year and a half later, the two squads met again for a friendly game in Pasadena.
