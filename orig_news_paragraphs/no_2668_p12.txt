The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a statement even before Mr. Ryan uttered a (prepared) word: "There have been more than enough ‘final straw’ moments during this campaign, and Speaker Ryan has continued to unabashedly put party first in supporting the most repulsive candidate for president that our country has ever seen," Kelly Ward, the group’s executive director, said. " If Speaker Ryan steps away from Trump, it will be an act of political expedience and desperate   which won’t redeem him or House Republicans in the eyes of voters. "
