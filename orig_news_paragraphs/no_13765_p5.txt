Suddenly, the police charged and began arresting people in the line. I moved over to see what was going on, and while remaining at the front of the line of protesters, I moved laterally closer to the action. I shot a short video clip, which you can see shows that the road is closed, the police are in the road, and I was right next to both protesters and other photographers. This is the clip I was arrested for filming.
