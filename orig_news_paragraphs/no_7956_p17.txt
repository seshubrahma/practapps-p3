It’s amusing that the same media and GOP establishment pundits who said Trump could not win the GOP nomination because he initially had such unfavorable poll numbers with Republican voters are now saying that he will lose minority voters by a landslide in a  potential general election. Not so fast. First, minority voters may not want to publicly admit that they support Trump because they fear a backlash against them, stirred by "leaders" and "activists" who often care more about their bottom lines and standing in the political circles than the interests of their communities. Second, though Clinton connects better with minority voters than Sanders, that’s not really saying much.
