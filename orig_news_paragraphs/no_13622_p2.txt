If Manning turns the ball over, this will be a repeat of the   Super Bowl matchup in which Seattle thrashed Denver. The Broncos defense will have to contain Newton, but the key may be how well Denver’s defense can stifle Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, Newton’s top target. Something tells me, though, that the game may well rest on whether Panthers wide receiver Ted Ginn, a "feast or famine" player, catches —  or drops —  a   deep ball from Newton. Another interesting note: Denver is   in games Clete Blakeman (today’s referee) referees.
