Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, wanted more details on his promise not to politicize the department. " I expect our next secretary of labor to be someone who can withstand inappropriate political pressure, and prioritize workers and the mission of the Labor Department over, hypothetically speaking, President Trump’s business associates or Steve Bannon’s frightening ideology," she said, referring to the senior White House adviser. She and other Democrats pointed to a 2008 report by the Justice Department’s   investigator, which found that under Mr. Acosta his office had violated federal law and department policies by weighing political affiliations in hiring and assessing employees.
