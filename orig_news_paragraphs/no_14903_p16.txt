Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for ICE, said   a citizen of Guatemala, was stopped by a border patrol agent in Rio Grande Valley, Texas, in August 2016. Bourke said   was detained for 12 days before being placed with the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which reunited him with his family in Maryland.   â€™s attorney Jezic told CNN his client was held for 12 or 13 days by ICE, though he previously stated his client was held for four weeks. Jezic added that it took   eight days to get from Guatemala to the southern border in McAllen, Texas, where he encountered border patrol.
