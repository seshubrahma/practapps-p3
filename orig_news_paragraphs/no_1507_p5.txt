In 2008, Pakistani militants killed 166 people in Mumbai, India, attacking what experts call "soft" targets: places such as hotels and train stations that are populated but, because of their seeming randomness, rarely defended. At security conferences in Western capitals, officials and analysts began to worry about whether they could prevent a "  attack" in their own countries. Then came the rise of "lone wolf" attackers who acted on their own, without training from or often even contact with the terrorist groups they claimed to serve. Attacks are planned within the minds of individuals whose intentions remain hidden until the shooting begins.
