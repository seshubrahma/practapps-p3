Novanto received significant blowback for his statement that, yes, Indonesians do like Trump, because it turns out that, no, many Indonesians don’t like Trump, in large part because of his     proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the U. S. in fact, faced with mounting criticism, Novanto’s party apologized not only for Novanto’s statement but also for his mere attendance at the luncheon. Since Trump’s victory, both Novanto and Zon have stood up for the   arguing that Trump’s hardline stance toward Muslim immigration was merely campaign rhetoric and not actually reflective of the  ’s own beliefs, something Novanto claimed Trump personally assured him was the case. Regardless, it is clear that the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia —  which, again, is the reason Trump met with Novanto and Zon in the first place —  could introduce major complications into the relationship between the   and the political leaders of the world’s largest Muslim country, not to mention a significant trade partner and an important ally in the South China Sea region. As if that weren’t enough, Tanoe himself has shown increasing interest in becoming involved in Indonesian politics.
