Both judges cited Trump’s statements about Muslims during the presidential campaign as part of their rulings. Spicer indicated that the administration intends to appeal the Maryland decision to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals "soon," and will seek "clarification" on the Hawaii ruling before heading to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In a   ruling, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson, who presides in Honolulu, concluded in no uncertain terms that the new executive order failed to pass legal muster at this stage and the state had established "a strong likelihood of success" on their claims of religious discrimination.   Trump decried Watson’s ruling during a rally Wednesday night in Nashville, introducing his statement as "the bad, the sad news."
