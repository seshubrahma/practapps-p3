Gov. John Kasich, also still in the race, responded to the same question by saying: "All of us shouldnâ€™t even have answered that question [of the pledge]," after referring to himself as "the little engine that can". Asked whether his support for the pledge was "in the balance" Gov. Kasich responded, "Well, yeah. I guess I would say that that would be a good way to describe it".
