Besides the thousands of   now serving in the United Statesâ€™ armed forces, others proudly serve our nation in the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Congress and in countless other agencies of government.   There are even nearly 1, 000   police officers in the NYPD, protecting both New Yorkers and tourists from around the world who visit the Big Apple.   This Fourth of July, we should honor those who have served our nation, not find hateful ways to diminish them, and reject the bigotry spewed by Trump and his followers.
