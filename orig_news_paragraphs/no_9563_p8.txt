The recent revelation that nineteen refugees in Michigan have been diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB) adds further support for Trump among the state’s voters. The increasing voter opposition to refugees in Michigan puts Hillary Clinton in a difficult political position in the state over the next 53 days until the November election. As opposition to more refugees in Michigan increases and gains momentum among voters, the pending Congressional debate and votes over the FY 2017 budget, will continue to thrust the issue of refugee resettlement in the public eye. Congress is currently contemplating a Continuing Resolution to fund the government from October 1, the beginning of FY 2017, to December 9, a month after the election, rather than deal with the entire year’s budget.
