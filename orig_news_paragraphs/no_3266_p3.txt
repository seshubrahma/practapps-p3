When Melania arrived in Saudi Arabia, she opted for a flowing black jumpsuit by Stella McCartney coupled with a striking,   gold Saint Laurent belt made of python to cinch her thin frame. The belt could be viewed as a nod to the Trump familyâ€™s famous   opulent gold apartment in Trump Tower in New York City. During the trip, Melania changed into a   Ralph Lauren Collection   dress, paired with gold bangles and   Manolo Blahnik heels as she visited the American International School in the country. At night, while in Saudi Arabia, Melania stuck to the fashion houses she wears the most.
