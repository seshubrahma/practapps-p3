Mr. Sessions has also said the United States weakened itself by banning techniques such as waterboarding, which he said were legal and effective. He voted against the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005 that prohibited cruel or degrading treatment of detainees. Last year, he voted against legislation requiring all government agencies to use only interrogation methods in the Army Field Manual. Those techniques do not include waterboarding.
