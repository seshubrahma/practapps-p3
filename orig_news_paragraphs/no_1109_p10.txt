But it is difficult to deny that Mr. Trump’s intense interest in the auto industry is having an effect on the production plans of Ford, G. M. and other automakers. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Ford, for example, for its plans to build a $1. 6 billion factory to make small cars in Mexico. After justifying the move on several occasions as a prudent investment, Ford suddenly scrapped the Mexican plant after Mr. Trump’s election. Since then, the company has shifted its focus to expanding and upgrading several of its facilities in its home state of Michigan.
