President Donald Trump honored former President Andrew Jackson, celebrating his 250th birthday by visiting Hermitage, Jacksonâ€™s home in Nashville, Tennessee. ["Look what he was able to do, look what he was able to build," Trump marveled as he told the story of Jackson, who was orphaned as a young boy before fighting in the Revolutionary War.   " Andrew Jackson was a military hero and genius and a beloved president, but he was also a flawed and imperfect man, the product of his time," Trump said.
