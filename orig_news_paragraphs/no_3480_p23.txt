In June 2016, a poll of 803 registered voters was conducted by OpinionSavvy, via telephone, using automated questions, and with a margin of error of 3. 5 percent. First, the poll asked whether tourists and immigrants should be screened to check for their possible support of Islamic sharia. Seventy percent of respondents approved of the screening. The poll then asked the 70 percent "Do you believe that individuals who support the practice of [Islamic] Sharia law should be admitted into the United States?"
