Broadsheet Welt reports German security services raided a hangar at Berlin Templehof last night   —   the 1930’s former city airport which has now been transformed into the city’s biggest migrant camp.   Although Berlin police have been reluctant to make statements to this point, the paper now reports they are speaking of a terror attack and the security service was aware of the possibility for an Islamist attack against a Christmas market. While it is reported the suspected killer was known to police for minor criminal offences, he was not on a terror watchlist.
