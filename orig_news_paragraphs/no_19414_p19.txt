One of the biggest challenges facing Republicans in the       era is that as the party has grown more stridently       it has hemorrhaged       professionals. Though the GOP has compensated for this loss in     electoral terms, it’s contributed to an asymmetry in the realm     of policy expertise. Whereas Hillary Clinton’s presidential     campaign had vast numbers of credentialed policy experts at its     beck and call, the Trump campaign had a small,       coterie of contrarians, who zagged when other Republicans of     their social class zigged. That’s not a terrible thing when     you’re waging war on the conventional wisdom.
