Jack Kemp was a liberal libertarian GOP leader in the 1980s, who favored   immigration into California and other states.   When Kemp was active, California was dominated by U. S.  mainstream voters who elected Republicans. Now, after Kemp helped overcome public opposition to   migration, California’s politics are dominated by minorities, including poor immigrants, ensuring the state is dominated by Democratic politicians. But Ryan’s speech still touted Kemp’s policies.
