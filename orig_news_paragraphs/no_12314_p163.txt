Donald Trump on Saturday accused Florida Sen. Marco Rubio of stealing from the Florida Republican Party and suggested Rubio should have been "indicted" for using a state party American Express card for personal expenses. " Rubio stole from the Republican Party," Trump said of Rubio, with whom he has recently engaged in a public war of words. Rubio used a corporate American Express card that the Florida state GOP entrusted to him during his time as a Florida state lawmaker for tens of thousands of dollars in personal expenses, which he later reimbursed.
