In July, Mr. Comey announced that the bureau had not found enough evidence to charge anyone with a crime for the mishandling of classified materials on Mrs. Clintonâ€™s server. If the new emails indicate intentional efforts by her or her aides to move such information outside secure government systems, or if they tried to impede the earlier inquiry, the F. B.

But the bureau has just begun the process of combing through the new emails, and officials believe that at least some are duplicates of messages that have already been examined.   How rare is it for the F. B. I. to make a development like this public?
