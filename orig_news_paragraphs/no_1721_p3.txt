Mark Cuban, the voluble billionaire who owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and is supporting Mrs. Clinton, announced on Twitter on Thursday that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign had given him a   seat at the debate to watch her "overwhelm" Mr. Trump. For good measure, Mr. Cuban  —   who once hosted a   reality television show called "The Benefactor," and more recently offered $10 million to the charity of Mr. Trump’s choice if the Republican nominee would let Mr. Cuban interview him for four hours about his "policies and their substance "  —   suggested the debate would become known as the "Humbling at Hofstra.
