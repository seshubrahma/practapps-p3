By a planned, coordinated chorus of shouting, chanting and provocative physical obstructions, these thugs are not affirming anyone’s rights. They are enforcing the canons of political correctness as currently taught in our universities —   condoned by the mass media and too often excused by   politicians too willing to score cheap shots at the expense of vital principles. Candidate Donald Trump is the number one target today, because he is leading the parade. But it was me yesterday and it may be you or YOUR favorite candidate tomorrow.
