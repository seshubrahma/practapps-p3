On Thursday, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called again for the US to provide weapons. " Vladimir Putin’s continued aggression against the people of Ukraine is outrageous, and further destabilization in the region will have profound negative consequences for us here in America," Rubio told CNN.   He noted that Trump’s new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis both advocated during their confirmation hearings for providing Ukraine with weapons to defend its sovereign territory.
