The Middle East, since Reagan’s administration, has tumbled into chaos —  getting    with each successive administration since the late 1980s. George H. W. Bush, of course, as he laid out in that "new world order" speech, began much of this with the first Gulf War. Since then, things have spiraled worse and worse out of control in the Middle East where during the Bill Clinton administration Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations formed —   then they attacked the United States during the George W. Bush administration —  in the wake of which the U. S. invaded Iraq again.
