Marches also took place in cities up and down the United Kingdom, from London to Cardiff, Liverpool, Manchester, Belfast and Edinburgh. In London, large crowds joined a   march starting outside the US Embassy and ending with a rally in the city’s historic Trafalgar Square. Marcher Victoria Dawson told CNN the atmosphere was "positive, inclusive, electric. "  Women’s rights weren’t the only issue on the agenda, with placards also bearing slogans to do with Brexit, nuclear weapons, workers’ rights and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.
