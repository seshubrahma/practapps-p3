Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton is repeating her false claim that the FBI said her statements on her use of a private email were "truthful." "As the FBI said, everything that I’ve said publicly has been consistent and truthful with what I’ve told them," Clinton said in an interview with KUSA’s Brandon Rittiman on Wednesday. Clinton made a similar claim    which was widely debunked    in an interview last weekend on "Fox News Sunday."  "(FBI Director James Comey) said my answers were truthful, and what I’ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails," Clinton said.
