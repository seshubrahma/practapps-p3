During the final presidential debate in October, Fox News moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if heâ€™d accept the results of the election no matter what they were. But Trump demurred, causing a chorus of Democrats and members of the Old Media Complex to condemn the GOP nominee. After the debate, the media erupted in attacks calling Trump a "destroyer" of our democracy. The Clinton campaign even insisted that filing any challenges to the election was somehow contrary to American political tradition.
