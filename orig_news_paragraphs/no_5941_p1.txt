This isnâ€™t the first move to beef up immigration judge staff. Early in March the Trump administration also began sending judges to immigrant detention centers to speed up services. The initial plan came on the heels of a Department of Homeland Security memo that requested the Trump administration allow federal immigration courts to use "expedited deportation proceedings" for any illegal immigrants living in the U. S. for two years or less. The process is currently limited to those only living in the U. S. for up to two weeks.
