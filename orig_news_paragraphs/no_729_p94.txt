Zappos has more than 500 people on its   team, about a third of the company’s total staff. Most employees work together in the company ’s headquarters, a   building downtown that used to be Las Vegas’s city hall. Employees like Dolan, who work the phones, start at $14 an hour, about a dollar less than the median wage earned by the more than 2. 5 million Americans who work as   representatives.
