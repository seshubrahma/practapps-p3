The duet also takes partial inspiration from when Robbie and I were roommates at the School of American Ballet. What happened? We were 17, and we got really into Dance Dance Revolution, the video game. We actually got a system for our dorms, and we started to play it obsessively, and we got really good and really in sync with our movement.
