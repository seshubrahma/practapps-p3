Rank becomes the second US diplomat serving at one of the largest embassies in the world to publicly split with Trump in recent days.   The acting US ambassador to the United Kingdom, Lewis Lukens, issued a statement on Twitter singling out London Mayor Sadiq Khan for praise after Trump attacked him on Twitter in the wake of the terror attacks which killed at least seven people. " I commend the strong leadership of the @MayorofLondon as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack," read a tweet from the USâ€™ London embassy attributed to Lukens.
