Earlier in 2012, Ambassador John F. Tefft wrote to Mrs. Clinton about a visit to Ukraine by Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, "at the invitation of oligarch, Victor Pinchuk. " Mrs. Clinton replied, "As you know, hearing nice things about your children is as good as it gets. " In July 2013, the Commerce Department began investigating complaints that Ukraine  —   and by extension Mr. Pinchuk’s company, Interpipe  —   and eight other countries had illegally dumped a type of steel tube on the American market at artificially low prices.
