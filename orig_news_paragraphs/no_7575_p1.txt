[Alex Marlow,    of Breitbart News, will appear on the program.   Tom Rose will discuss the key issue that overhangs this week’s AIPAC conference featuring all the presidential candidates (except for Bernie Sanders who turned down their invitation): can AIPAC recover from its failure to defeat the Iran nuclear deal. Other special guests include: David Webb, Breitbart California’s Joel Pollak, as well as Lee Stranahan, Dan Fleuette, and Brandon Darby who will discuss the   rallies over the weekend. Breitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 7PM to 10PM EST.
