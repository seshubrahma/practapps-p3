Washington (CNN) Green Party officials filed Friday for a recount in Wisconsin, following reports of voting discrepancies, and were seeking a deeper investigation into the election results, which handed the state to Donald Trump two weeks ago.   Wisconsin Green Party    George Martin said that they were seeking a "reconciliation of paper records"    a request that would go one step further than a simple recount, spurring, he said, an investigation into the integrity of the stateâ€™s voting system.
