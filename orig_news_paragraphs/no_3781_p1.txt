A recent report released this week by U. S. Customs and Border Protection revealed the number of apprehensions of what the Border Patrol calls Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) during the month of December rose for the sixth month in a row   —   up 109 percent in the first three months of this year compared to last.   " They’re mobilizing because they don’t know what tomorrow will bring, but know today they can cross," Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera told Fox News while acting in his capacity in the National Border Patrol Council.
