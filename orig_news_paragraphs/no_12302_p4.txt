Mr. Timothy has been described as the Prime Minister’s "political brain" with one insider telling the Spectator earlier this year that "Nick seems to influence what she thinks to an almost scary extent". Timothy also used his account to promote Trump’s rival Hillary Clinton, going so far as to retweet one of her attacks on Donald Trump’s temperament. Another retweet from a reporter featured a Clinton attack ad.    In March, Mr. Timothy shared a tweet calling Trump "racist and misogynist".
