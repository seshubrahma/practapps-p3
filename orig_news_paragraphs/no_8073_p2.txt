Playing the armchair theologian, Kaine said that his support of homosexuality is rooted in the teaching of the Bible, and specifically the Book of Genesis. " I think it’s going to change because my church also teaches me about a Creator, in the first chapter of Genesis, who surveys the entire world, including mankind, and says: It is very good. It is very good," Kaine said, in an apparent reference to God’s alleged nod of approval for homosexual practice.
