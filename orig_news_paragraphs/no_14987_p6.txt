He signed a pair of executive orders aimed at identifying and targeting foreign trade abuses. One will commission a   study of the USâ€™ trade deficits with some of its largest trading partners to identify potential trade abuses and cheating. The study will serve as ammunition to a president intent on reevaluating free trade agreements and bolstering US manufacturing. The second directive will order stricter and more effective enforcement of US   laws to prevent foreign manufacturers from undercutting US companies by selling goods at an unfair price.
