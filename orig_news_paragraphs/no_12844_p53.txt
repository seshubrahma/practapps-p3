Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s personal doctor and the chair of Internal Medicine at CareMount Medical in Mount Kisco, New York, said she evaluated Clinton multiple times in the last week   —   including Wednesday   —   and found that the Democratic nominee had a small right   pneumonia. Clinton’s doctor claims she is in "excellent mental condition" and "continues to remain healthy" and "fit" to serve as president.
