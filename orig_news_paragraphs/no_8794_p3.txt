Lessig’s effort to help electors vote against Trump was first reported on Monday by Politico: Lessig says his new effort, which he calls "The Electors Trust," will provide free counsel to electors, provided by the midsize firm, Durie Tangri, whose partner Mark Lemley is a longtime associate of Lessig’s. More significantly, Lessig said, the Trust will offer a platform  —   with guaranteed anonymity   —   for electors to strategize about stopping Trump from taking the White House. It’s a platform, he said, that could help electors coordinate to determine whether they’ve gathered enough support to stop Trump from winning the presidency.
