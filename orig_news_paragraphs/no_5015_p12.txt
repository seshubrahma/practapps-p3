Stone, who was a White House aide to President Richard Nixon and later introduced Nixon to Trump, told Breitbart News: "Both Nixon and Trump have obvious advantages and nobody is perfect, everyone has a flaw, but in terms of his intelligence, in terms of his speaking out for people who have been forgotten within our system, in terms of his executive ability, and in terms of his toughness and his pragmatism   â€”    n all those ways he is like Nixon.
