[On Wednesday, American Gen. Joseph Votel, the chief of U. S. Central Command (CENTCOM) told the House Armed Services Committee:   The nature of this fight has evolved over the course of the operation on this two and a half year campaign, and our approach has evolved as well. One example of how we have evolved has been our effort to enable and entrust our leaders at the tactical edge with the authorities they need to help our partners win. We have not relaxed the rules of engagement.
