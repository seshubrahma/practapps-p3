After all, President Obama has spent his entire second term following the same basic strategy of looking for lanes for bipartisan cooperation on things like infrastructure spending and immigration overhaul, while using the federal bureaucracy to try to tilt the playing field toward workers within the confines of current law. As the election advances, Mrs. Clinton will be vulnerable to the charge that she is promising to do the same things as Mr. Obama has, but with the hope of getting better results for American workers. Politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose.
