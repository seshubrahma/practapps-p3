That does not even begin to cover the rest of the more than 4, 000 appointments that a president typically makes. In some cases, the Trump administration is even going in reverse. A senior political appointee at the housing department, who had already started the job, was fired this past week and marched out of the building when someone discovered his previous statements critical of Mr. Trump. The presidentâ€™s top Latin America official at the National Security Council was likewise fired after just weeks on the job for complaining about internal dysfunction at an    discussion at a Washington research organization, according to officials, who confirmed a Politico report.
