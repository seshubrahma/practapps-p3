Decker has been slowly increasing jobs in the U. S. for the past several years. Its current level of some 3, 000 workers is already up 800 from 2013. It is not yet known how many more jobs the company will be bringing to the U. S. as a result of its latest announcement. The remarks come after the company announced the impending purchase of the Sears Craftsman tool line for about $900 million after Sears suffered another round of setbacks which will include the closing of at least 150 more stores.
