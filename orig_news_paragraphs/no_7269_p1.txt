The usual suspects —   those who profit from illegal immigration.   Back in 2004, I proposed the same thing in a speech on the floor of Congress and became Public Enemy Number One at Western Union headquarters and the National Council of La Raza. Wells Fargo Bank wasn’t too happy when I exposed it as the first American bank to help expedite wire transfers of remittance money by illegal aliens. Wells Fargo made it easier to send money back to Mexico by allowing illegal aliens to open bank accounts using their Mexican Consular ID cards.
