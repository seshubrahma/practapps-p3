The acceleration of refugee resettlement is even more stunning if the first three days of October are compared to the next three days. As the chart above illustrates, no refugees were resettled on October 1, 10 were resettled on October 2, and 370 were resettled on October 3. Eight hundred and six refugees were resettled on October 4, 945 were resettled on October 5, and 931 were resettled on October 6, according to the most recent State Department reporting (see chart above). During the three day period between October 4 and October 6, 2, 682 refugees were resettled in the United States.
