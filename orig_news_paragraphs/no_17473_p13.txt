Russia is Assadâ€™s most powerful ally and has propped up his regime since September 2015 with airstrikes. Erdogan on Thursday said the ceasefire "opportunity in Syria shall not be missed."  "The parties in Syria will not expand the territories they have control over," he added.   Putin said Russia would begin scaling back its military presence in Syria, though it would continue to support the "legitimate Syrian government in its struggle with terrorism. "
