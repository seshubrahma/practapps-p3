Who leads it: Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat.   Whatâ€™s the latest: Chaffetz and Cummings revealed the stunning news Tuesday that former national security adviser Michael Flynn left foreign payments off of his 2016 application for a security clearance, a possible felony punishable with up to five years in jail. Nobody from the House oversight committee is literally prosecuting Flynn, but they have been digging into his foreign payments from   a Russian state news outlet, and a company tied to the Turkish government.
