Thursday, the Obama White House Council of Economic Advisers released its eighth and final "Economic Report of the President," an annual   analysis of the state of the United States economy. It has a bit of a valedictory tone, which is to be expected given the contrast between where things stand today and when the administration began   â€”   and the desire of White House aides to put a positive spin on the Obama legacy. But if you read carefully, you can also find in this   document a road map to what has gone wrong in the Obama economy: where progress toward higher standards of living has been fleeting, or nonexistent, or has gone in reverse.
