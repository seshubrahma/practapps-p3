Following presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s Tuesday economic address in Monessen, PA, CNN’s Dana Bash said that congressional Republicans were pleased to hear their party’s standard bearer deliver such a "detailed" and "cogent" policy speech.   Bash told viewers that the media is  witnessing "a new Trump campaign," which appears to be better organized and more efficient —  providing reporters with detailed citations for the facts and figures Trump cited during his address. During the panel, CNN contributor Pamela Brown pointed out that "it was interesting how Trump framed Hillary Clinton as running a campaign of fear. "
