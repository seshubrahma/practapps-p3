The latest fight is beginning to play out much like one that occurred in the   when activists in the nationâ€™s big cities resisted the immigration policies of the Reagan administration. Central Americans had become the subject of fierce political jockeying, and scores of churches opened their doors as sanctuaries to flout the Reagan White House. Members of churches and synagogues are again offering their houses of worship as sanctuaries for undocumented people fearing deportation, according to groups that work with immigrants and refugees. A   network known as the "sanctuary movement" was revived in the past few years to take in those at risk of deportation by the Obama administration.
