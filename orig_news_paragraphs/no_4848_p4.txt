Kelly told the Post that she wanted a job with more amenable hours to ensure she could spend more time with her children: "My next deal is all about greater balance," she told the paper’s Erik Wemple. A source close to the negotiations told the New York Times that NBC News chairman Andrew Lack won what was reportedly a network bidding war for Kelly’s services by asking her what she wanted from a new job instead of simply explaining what his network could offer her. The move to NBC caps a tumultuous year for Kelly at Fox News, the network she joined in 2005. During the first GOP presidential debate, the anchor "became the story," as she put it to the Post, when she challenged    Donald Trump with a question about his past treatment of women, which led to months of headlines and an eventual reconciliation.
