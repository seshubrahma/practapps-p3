The Milins were known for running   ads that screamed "FREE MONEY!" and offered tutorials on how to obtain government grants and loans. They were also notorious for being frequent targets of state regulators. In 1993, the Texas attorney general accused their company, then called Information Seminars International, of taking customersâ€™ money and running. People who bought a $499 "Milin Method" package were promised financing to resell real estate purchased at government auctions, officials said, but when customers sought to follow up with the company, the Milins had vanished.
