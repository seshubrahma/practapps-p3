Daile Rois, 56, lives about 2, 000 feet from a shuttered coal mine outside Charleston, W. Va. The mine, Keystone Development No. 2, released debris and chemicals into two creeks that meet at the edge of her property and run past her home. After intense opposition from environmental groups, which documented streams clouded by sediment and monitored rising acidity levels, West Virginia’s Department of Environmental Protection permanently closed the mine last year and ordered the operator to restore the site   —   a rare victory for local environmentalists.
