Neither Mr. Tomasso nor Mr.   responded to requests for comment. Shacara McLaurin, a singer and   activist in New York, said that she was walking home after a performance last week when she passed a political protest, and an elderly man who supported Mr. Trump began to heckle her. After a physical altercation in which the man fell to the ground, Ms. McLaurin, 23, was charged with assault and harassment. She said that the man had thrown himself onto the ground and appeared to be drunk, and that she had lost her day job as a home health aide because of the episode.
