The UK terror threat level has been raised to critical for the first time in over a decade in the wake of the bombing    meaning more attacks may be imminent    as investigators seek to track down any associates of the suspect, named as    Salman Abedi. Rudd earlier told Sky News that she expects the critical threat level to be temporary. She also said the bomber was known "up to a point" by the intelligence services. Abedi is believed to have died in the powerful blast, though he has not yet been formally identified by the coroner, Manchester police said.
