Tennis balls bounced from Cleveland "event zone"  —   but not guns, Trump himself will speak on the fourth and final night. RNC Chair Reince Priebus will speak that night, as will business leaders such as Thiel, a   of PayPal, who caused a stir in May when he revealed that he financed several lawsuits, including the one brought by Hulk Hogan, against Gawker. While much of the journalism community bemoaned the thought of a billionaire suing a news outlet into oblivion    Gawker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June and will be sold in an auction next month    others celebrated Thiel’s secret legal battle, which he described as "specific deterrence."   It appears Trump may support Thiel’s efforts.
