Robert J. Dold, a congressman from Illinois who has said he will not vote for Mr. Trump, began running a commercial this week that shows him switching off a television broadcast featuring clips of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. And veteran Republicans have urged Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey, who is seeking   in a district Mr. Trump is behind in the polls, to portray himself as a check on Mrs. Clinton, though he has not yet done so. Few have gone even as far as Mr. Dold, fearing backlash from Mr. Trump’s ardent supporters   —   and perhaps from Mr. Trump himself, who has repeatedly attacked Republicans who have snubbed him.
