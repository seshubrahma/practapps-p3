Washington  (CNN) While much of the world is applauding President Donald Trump’s decision to strike a Syrian airbase in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack against civilians,   populist supporters at home and abroad are criticizing the move and distancing themselves from him. Nigel Farage, the   leader, aligned himself with Trump during last year’s campaign, spoke at his rallies and was among the first to meet with him after his election. On Friday morning, however, he said he was "very surprised" by the Syria action.
