â€”   the same deep love Donald Trump has articulated in a very persuasive manner. You see, we believe in American exceptionalism and we believe when it comes to trade agreements, the interests of American workers should hold a higher priority than the profits of giant corporations and big banks. Gone are the days when American workers could begin employment at a company when they were starting a family and retire with the same company to spend more time with their grandchildren. Donald Trump stood with us on ObamaTrade, while at the same time you put Constitutional principles on the shelf and bowed down to Wall Street and the donor class by advocating very strongly for ObamaTrade.
