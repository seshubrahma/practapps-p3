Tessa   president of the Baltimore branch of the N. A. A. C. P. said on Friday that residents she had spoken to "really wanted this to go through," and were worried the effort they had put into the agreement would be for naught. " For all of that just to fall apart because they didnâ€™t want to go through with it would have hurt everybody," she said.
