Trump currently holds a delegate count of 739, with Cruz, at 465, the only other candidate left with the possibility of securing the 1, 237 delegates before the GOP convention. It remains unclear whether either candidate will be able to reach that threshold or be faced with duking it out over delegates in Cleveland. Ohio Gov. John Kasich currently has a mere 143 delegates and could not reach the 1, 237 needed to secure the GOP nomination before the July GOP convention. Yet Kasich is refusing to leave the race and will be participating in CNNâ€™s Tuesday night town hall event.
