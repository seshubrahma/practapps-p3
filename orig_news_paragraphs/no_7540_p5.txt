Just as Colombian voters rejected a "peace" deal earlier this week, American voters would likely vote against the Iran deal if given the chance. But the deal was never ratified by the Senate, and Democrats used the filibuster to prevent the Senate from voting on it when it was presented last year. Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump were tied in the overall poll, 44% to 44% in a   race, despite a majority saying that Clinton won last weekâ€™s first presidential debate. Libertarian Gary Johnson took 5% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein captured 1% of the vote.
