Conservative Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America said, "Bathroom privacy bills are not meant to discriminate against those who identify as transgender. " "Privacy bills are common sense regulations that protect women and children," she explained in a statement. " Conservatives are not saying those who identify as transgender are committing sexual assault, but instead that these laws would allow sexual offenders to pose as transgender individuals to obtain entry into the bathroom of the opposite sex. "
