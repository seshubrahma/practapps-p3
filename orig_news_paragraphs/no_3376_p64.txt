When someone has to go to the hospital because they don’t have insurance   —   and by the way, I think the insurance companies should be out of the mix altogether  —   but when someone needs health care and they don’t have the ability to pay for it, in our communities, we end up paying for it one way or the other. That means my property taxes go up.
