The goal is to demonstrate the importance of immigrants to society, as the Trump administration continues to pursue   enforcement policies that advocates fear will disrupt communities and the economy.   Restaurants in the DC area were planning to operate with short staff, offer menus in solidarity with striking immigrants and in some cases, close altogether. The actions are taking place around the country.   Celebrity chef José Andrés, who is locked in a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for pulling his restaurant from the Trump hotel project in Washington over Trump’s   immigrant rhetoric, announced he would close most of his restaurants Thursday as part of the protest.
