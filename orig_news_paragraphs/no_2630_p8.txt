For Kanye West, the "Famous" video wasn’t a disruption of his public narrative, but a bold extension of it. The controversial work, in which he and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, lie naked in a large bed, surrounded by nude   of their friends and foes (Taylor Swift, Ray J, Donald J. Trump, Caitlyn Jenner and more) was a reinterpretation of a painting by the artist Vincent Desiderio. It is also a mood piece about innocence, a provocative and unlikely rejoinder to the song’s tabloid DNA. But it, too, ruffled the feathers of those who thought Mr. West’s use of his peers’ images was a violation too far.
