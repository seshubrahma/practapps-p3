President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed deep changes to federal taxes, including sharp cuts in both individual and business taxes and the elimination of the estate tax. [The proposal reduces the number of individual income tax brackets to three —  10 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. It would double the standard deduction, effectively eliminating federal income taxes on the first $24, 000 of a couple’s income. It also calls for the elimination of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.
