A NATO official told CNN Friday that, at Abadi’s request, the alliance had already begun training Iraqi troops this month and that NATO’s presence there "has no fixed end date." Dunford’s comments come days after Secretary of Defense James Mattis and the commander of the     coalition, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, suggested in Baghdad that there would be continued   military collaboration even after the terror group is ejected from Mosul. Forces are currently advancing on the terror group there, the last major city it controls.
