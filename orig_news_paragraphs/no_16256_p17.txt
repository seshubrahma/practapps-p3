The FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Report measures violent crime, which includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In 2014, the violent crime rate was the lowest it has been since it peaked in the 1990s. And in 2014, the federal prison population decreased for the first time since the 1970s, by 2% according to numbers from the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Holder is correct in saying that both measures went down simultaneously for the first time in decades, but his statement is missing some context.
