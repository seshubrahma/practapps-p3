Obama spoke with CNN’s Jake Tapper last month on his particular reluctance to use the phrase, saying, "The truth of the matter is that this is an issue that has been sort of manufactured, because there is no doubt, and I’ve said repeatedly, that where we see terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL, they have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse, for basically barbarism and death."  Clinton doesn’t object to the phrase so we rate Trump’s claim as false. Obama may call the issue a distraction, but he refuses to use the term. That claim is true.
