When "The Fourth Turning" came out, our biggest partisan fans were Democrats, who saw in our description of an emerging "Millennial generation" (a term we coined) the sort of   optimists who would pull America toward progressive ideals. Yet we’ve also had conservative fans, who were drawn to another lesson: that the new era would probably see the successful joining of   economics with   social values. Beyond ideology, I think there’s another reason for the rising interest in our book. We reject the deep premise of modern Western historians that social time is either linear (continuous progress or decline) or chaotic (too complex to reveal any direction).
