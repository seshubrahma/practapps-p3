While walking backwards, Scott is shot at four times by Officer Brentley Vinson, who is off camera throughout both videos. Another camera, worn by a uniformed Charlotte police officer, shows that man running up to the encounter. The officer moves beside a white truck and pauses next to a plainclothes officer before running around to his left to go around to the other side of the vehicles.   As the officer passes a gap between vehicles, Scott is visible with his right arm by his side.
