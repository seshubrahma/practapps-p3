McMaster said Trump plans to deliver an "inspiring yet direct" speech to leaders from Muslim countries on Sunday. The topic is the "need to confront radical ideology" and the "Presidentâ€™s hope for a peaceful vision of Islam to dominate across the world." "The speech is intended to unite the broader Muslim world against common enemies of all civilization and to demonstrate our commitment to our Muslim partners."   The President is fairly popular among Muslim heads of state, experts say, because of his hardline stance on Iran and reluctance to lecture Middle East dictators on human rights.
