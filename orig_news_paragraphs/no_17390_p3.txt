That will give Trump the   share of the electoral vote out of 54 presidential elections since the modern system started in 1804. It’s a better performance, though, than President George W. Bush’s   victory in 2000 and slightly larger win in 2004.   Bush, too, lost the popular vote    but Trump lost by a larger margin. He will become the   president in the popular vote relative to his closest rival aside from Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and John Quincy Adams in 1824, an election that featured four candidates and was decided by the House of Representatives.
