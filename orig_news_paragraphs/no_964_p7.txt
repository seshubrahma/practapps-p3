Here’s a look at how four presidents have invoked Jackson’s complicated legacy. Roosevelt, a Republican and later a member of the Progressive Party, visited the mansion on Oct. 22, 1907, and reportedly coined the phrase "good to the last drop" after being served a cup of Maxwell House coffee there. It’s not clear what Roosevelt said about Jackson that day, but in his 1913 autobiography he cited "Good King Andrew," as he put it, and Lincoln as the progenitors of the modern idea of the president as a strong leader who sets the nation’s agenda. (Roosevelt also admired Alexander Hamilton, another strong nationalist, for the similar reasons.)
