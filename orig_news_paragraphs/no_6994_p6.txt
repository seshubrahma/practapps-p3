This is a Jewish holy place," Rajoub told Channel 2 TV in Hebrew. Rajoub, who is also head of the Palestinian Football Association, was praising U. S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to reach a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians and commenting on Trump’s visit last month to Israel and the West Bank. Rajoub, who has in the past stated that he is proud he served time in an Israeli jail for lobbing a grenade at a bus full of IDF soldiers in 1970, later tried to deny he ever made such a statement.
