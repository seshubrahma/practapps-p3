These are goals that opponents of Obamacare have long sought and should help bolster the conservative case for the AHCA. The Trump administration and congressional Republican leaders will need to balance these benefits against the reality that some moderates cannot be won over without changes to the law designed to boost coverage. That may mean increased funding for the Medicaid program to create an even more gentle transition for states that elected to take the Medicaid expansion, such as Ohio and New Jersey    or more generous tax credits to help those who are older or who are poorer, for example, afford private coverage. Or perhaps provisions that require states to automatically enroll the uninsured in default,   private insurance plans.
