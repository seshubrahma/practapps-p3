arrests of dissidents in Cuba for their political beliefs skyrocketed following the 2014 announcement from President Obama that he was willing to cooperate with the Castro regime. During Obama’s visit to the island in 2016, the Cuban government arrested nearly 500 people for expressing   views in public. Meanwhile,   government media outlets reporting that lobbying and advocacy groups that benefit from Obama’s policy have placed Trump "under pressure" to maintain "normalization" policies. "  activist group Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) has urged the president to rethink his hitherto   stance on America’s former cold war foe, claiming that the cutting of improved relations would do nothing to help Cuban citizens or serve the U. S.’s national interests," CNBC reported.
