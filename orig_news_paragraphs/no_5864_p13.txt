Nehlen concluded in his Friday statement by saying that Ryan is a "career politician" who must be drained from the swamp of Washington, D. C. Nehlen said: Paul Ryan is a career politician who has been in D. C. for nearly two decades. He may have been a nice Wisconsin boy when he left Janesville, but now Ryan is working for special interests and industry bosses, working to sell Wisconsinâ€™s jobs to Mexico and Asia. Ryan is working    with multinational corporations to reduce their costs by giving them access to   immigrant labor.
