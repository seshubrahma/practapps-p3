I got to see what law enforcement has to deal with on a daily basis. While some of the protesters who had been arrested were acting disrespectfully, most were not. During this initial phase, while the police got my information and took my property, such as my phone and wallet, I noticed a    girl whom I recognized being processed close to me. The night before, I had spoken to her and her father they had both seemed   and intelligent but committed to exposing what they saw as injustice in the legal system here in Baton Rouge.
