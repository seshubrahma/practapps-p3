One of the Iraqis’’ lawyers, Mark Doss, told CNN that he and his   colleague had been at JFK "all night," and that they had not been   able to meet with Darweesh or Alshawi in person. ’ ’    "They are being unlawfully detained in the airport" because they   were in   when Trump signed the order, Doss said. He said   customs agents told him to "call Trump" when he asked who he   could speak to about seeing his clients.
