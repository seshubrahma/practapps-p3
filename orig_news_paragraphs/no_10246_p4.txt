He launched his own blistering attack against Trump as voters cast ballots in Indiana on Tuesday, likening him to a fictitious character he described as "a braggadocious, arrogant buffoon" and contending the nation could face disastrous times if he is elected.   " We are not a proud, boastful,     hateful, bullying nation," Cruz said in Evansville, with his wife Heidi and running mate Carly Fiorina by his side.
