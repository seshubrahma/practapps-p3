If you are going to engage the ideas that are the life force of al Qaeda and its sisters, we must be able to name and discuss these ideas â€”  and their opposites. The politically correct do not take nearly enough heat for the aid and comfort they bring to the enemy by doing this. There is much lazy talk about what ISIS or   supposedly "want" American commentators and politicians to do. In truth, there is nothing they truly want more than for P. C. mobs to smear everyone who talks honestly about radical Islamic terrorism as an "Islamophobe" and chase them out of the public square.
