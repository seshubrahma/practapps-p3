The lawyers for the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division asked the judge to postpone the hearing until February 24 or thereafter. As reported by Breitbart Texas in October 2014, U. S. District Court Judge Nelva Gonzalez Ramos sitting in Corpus Christi, Texas, issued a permanent injunction requiring Texas to return to enforcing the   voter identification requirements that existed before Senate Bill 14 was initially enforced in 2013. The Obama appointee had held that the Texas photo voter ID law violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because it: had an impermissible discriminatory effect, including deliberate discrimination against blacks and Hispanics violated the Equal Protection Clause and unconstitutionally offended voting rights guaranteed under the Fifteenth Amendment. She also ruled that the voter ID law was an unconstitutional poll tax prohibited by the   Amendment because the law provided for a fee for issuing copies of birth certificates or other information needed to obtain an acceptable ID.
