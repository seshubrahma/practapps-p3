What we have learned is that the foundation said it did fail to disclose a funding source while Mrs. Clinton was at the State Department. That donation, the $500, 000 from the government of Algeria. The foundation called the lack of disclosure an error but again said there was no connection between the donations and the policies of the Clintonâ€™s State Department. Earlier this year, Hillary Clinton told Jake Tapper the foundation is an open book.
