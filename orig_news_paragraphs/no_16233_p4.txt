Vice President Joe Biden ’s late son, Beau, was a JAG officer in the Delaware Army National Guard, having been deployed to Iraq in 2009. And in the 2008 election, Arizona Sen. John McCain’s two sons were in the Marines and Navy, while his running mate, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s son was in the Army Reserves.
