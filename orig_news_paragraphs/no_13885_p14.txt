That warm layer is so thick that temperatures don’t get below freezing until just above the surface, not enough time for that raindrop to freeze again.   So, it freezes on everything it makes contact with, roads, bridges, power lines, tree branches, everything. On the other hand, you have sleet.   The only difference is that warm layer isn’t so thick and the raindrop has enough to freeze again.
