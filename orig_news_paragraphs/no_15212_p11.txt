Without a public explanation of why these authorities have been granted and what their provision is intended to achieve, they become untethered from the real heart of the counterterrorism struggle: a contest for achieving legitimacy by restoring the stateâ€™s monopoly on the use of violence, under the rule of law. Similarly, US counterterrorism efforts in Iraq and Syria are reported to have generated, under the Trump administration, a disturbingly high number of noncombatant casualties. Yet the administration appears content simply to indicate that "nothing has changed" and soldier on without meaningfully engaging with the reports of deaths. Maybe this trend reflects an affirmative belief on the part of the Trump team that explanations and justifications are a waste of time or show weakness.
