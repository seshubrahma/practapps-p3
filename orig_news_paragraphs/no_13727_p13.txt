As a matter of fact, the greatest progress Iran was making with regard to nuclear weapons uninterrupted was under George W. Bush. I would have liked to have had an earlier or even better resolution, but the Obama record regarding Iran is better than the Bush record regarding Iran. There are realities that you have to deal with. As to the economy, once again, comparison very much favors the Democrats between the bush years and where we are today.
