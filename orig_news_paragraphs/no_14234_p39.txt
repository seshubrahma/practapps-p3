The earth is surrounded by a growing cloud of orbiting garbage that according to NASA contains at least 20, 000 objects larger than a softball, 500, 000 bigger than a marble, and millions of pieces of debris, they’re simply too small to track. The trash comes from explosions, spacecraft collisions and expendable rocket stages.   And as our space environment is getting more congested and complicated, it’s also getting cluttered with all kinds of garbage.    The problem is, is that these pieces of trash are traveling at speeds up to 18, 000 miles per hour, which is almost 10 times faster than a bullet.
