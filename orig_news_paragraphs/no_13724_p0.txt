[Geert Wilders, who is presently facing charges of inciting hatred and discrimination against Moroccans in his native Netherlands is a prominent leader in the European   movement and has praised the Trump candidacy for its unaccommodating stance on Muslim mass migration.   Speaking out after Ted Cruz and John Kasich stood down from the Republican candidate race and left Mr. Trump as the only credible candidate earlier this week, Mr. Wilders said of Mr. Trump: "He has guts, a lot of good ideas and speaks to broad groups in society" reports Rotterdamâ€™s largest newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. Of the coming race against the candidate most likely to lead the Democrat Party into the 2016 election, Mr. Wilders said: "Clinton may well win in the primaries, but she is incredibly unpopular with the ordinary man and woman in the U. S. I give Trump a good chance".
