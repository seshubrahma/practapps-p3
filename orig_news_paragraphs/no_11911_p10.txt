Jenny Beth Martin released an advance version of her speech this morning, in which she rips Donald Trump in terms no different from Mitt Romney. In the fall, she built Trump up at the rally to stop the Iran deal. That’s a significant reversal.   My guess is that she figured Trump is likely to win the nomination anyway, so pounding him would not hurt, and would preserve the Tea Party’s outsider brand.
