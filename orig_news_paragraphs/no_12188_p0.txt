Following the receipt of a retraction demand, NBC News has quietly edited the Internet edition of a segment that aired on the   "Today Show" in which anchor Andrea Mitchell claimed Juanita Broaddrick’s rape accusation against Bill Clinton had been "discredited. " [After receiving the legal letter, penned by Broaddrick’s attorney and son, Kevin L. Hickey, NBC removed the word "discredited" from the network’s Internet version of Mitchell’s video report, Broaddrick and Hickey told this reporter. However, NBC did not make any indication of the edit in the video or on the webpage that hosts it.   Nor did NBC fulfill Broaddrick’s request, which she says was communicated in the letter, for an apology from Mitchell on the "Today Show" as well as an acknowledgement on the show and on NBC’s website that there is no information that Broaddrick’s story has been discredited.
