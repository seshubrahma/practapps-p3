He added, "Democrats are engaged right now in unprecedented partisan obstruction, but I hope on the Supreme Court they will not engage in that practice.   â€¦     Democrats will not succeed in filibustering Judge Gorsuch. They may try, but they will not succeed. " Cruz also addressed whether or not blocking Gorsuch would be fair turnabout for blocking the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland by saying the two nominations took place under a "fundamentally different" set of circumstances because Garland was appointed during an election year.
