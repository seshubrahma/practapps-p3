They’re sticking to a   gospel that is difficult to sell to people nervous about the future of the American middle class after years of Obama’s policies, and lingering anxiety over the 2008 financial crisis.   At this point, when a lot of people hear talk about   tax cuts, they recoil from either liberal caricatures of   robber barons lining their pockets while the Little Guy suffers   …     or they recoil from the memory of Obama’s cronies getting rich off their political connections while the rest of the U. S. economy was stuck in a quagmire. Both "reform conservatism" and Trumpism aim to rewire parts of the Leviathan State to directly benefit   constituencies, rather than cutting that bloated government down to size and   the engines of capitalism to grow us out of malaise and impending government fiscal crisis.
