We’re committed to work with the President, the speaker, the current speaker, and make sure that what we do is get some consensus," Meadows said on March 26. Amash has said before that he was unhappy with Ryan’s leadership, saying in the thick of the health care fight last month that Republicans may have been better off under former House Speaker John Boehner    even though Amash is a member of the group that spurred Boehner’s retirement. Amash is hosting three town halls this week, and touted his openness to the exceedingly polite Western Michigan crowd (which lacked the screaming and chanting that have made other town halls national spectacles.) Other lawmakers have held closed meetings, avoided town halls or, in one case, been the beneficiary of a busload of Trump supporters, who fought back against angry progressive activists.
