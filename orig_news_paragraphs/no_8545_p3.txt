The "negative vote" factor is strong in the state. 56 percent of Trumpâ€™s voters said they supported him "mainly to oppose Hillary Clinton," while 48 percent of her voters said the same with respect to Trump. A slightly higher percentage of respondents said they would never consider voting for Clinton than Trump (85 percent to 75 percent.) Clinton also fares slightly worse on the question of voters disliking her "as a person," although Clinton and Trump both generate strong personal dislike (74 percent Clinton, 69 percent Trump.)   percent of respondents said Clinton was running for President primarily to "help herself and her friends," while only 12 percent thought she wanted to help the country, and 17 percent said it was a mix of both.
