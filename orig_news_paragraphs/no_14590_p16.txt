We need to recognize that while we are not monolithic, there is power in embracing a common agenda.   There are so many things that can never be taken from us   â€”   our desire to seek change, our resilience, and our progress. This February, I am so proud to be part of a team that launched a campaign called #OurBlackisBeautiful to celebrate our beauty and our unity for Black History Month and beyond.
