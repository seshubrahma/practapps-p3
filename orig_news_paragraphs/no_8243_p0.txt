Dr. Ben Carson, still running for the Republican nomination for President even though his campaign admits he has no " " path, has called for fellow GOP candidates to meet before the upcoming debate March 3 in Detroit, Michigan. ["The American People deserve so much more from the candidates who are seeking the most powerful position in the free world, and I share their concern that this race has taken a turn for the worse, to the point of embarrassment on the world stage," Carson said in a statement released to the press.    "A house divided cannot stand, and it is imperative the Republican Party exhibit unity by the candidates coming together with a pledge to talk about the many serious problems facing our country, instead of personally attacking each other," he added. Carsonâ€™s statement comes amid a continuing divide between the populist, establishment, and conservative wings of the Republican party.
