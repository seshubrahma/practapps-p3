 (CNN) JetBlue forced a man off a Thursday morning flight after an apparent incident involving Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who was also aboard the plane. Matthew Lasner tweeted about the incident and said his husband was kicked off the flight from New York’s John F. Kennedy airport after a flight attendant overheard a man "expressing displeasure" about   Donald Trump’s eldest daughter and her husband, who has become a key adviser to the incoming commander in chief. Another   tweet posted to Lasner’s account at 8:29 a. m.
