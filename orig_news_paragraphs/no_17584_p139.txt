I’m trying to find a way so   that anybody in the process can literally push a button and   get an answer or see the relevant part of a tape. Forget about   what the technology is. Just understand the motivation behind it.    If you have the power to see things through somebody else’s eyes,   it’s like going from black and white to color or two dimensions   to three dimensions.
