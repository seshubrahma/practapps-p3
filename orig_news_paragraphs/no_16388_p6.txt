U. S. intelligence estimates the   coalition has also killed at least 135 of ISIS leaders. Meanwhile, the flow of Americans going to join ISIS or attempting to do so has slowed to a trickle from an average of six to one a month, according to US intelligence estimates. The U. S. military has also stepped up the air campaign against ISISâ€™ wealth, for instance, bombing a bank in Iraq in January in which ISIS had stored millions in cash.   U. S. bombers have also repeatedly struck trucks carrying oil that ISIS has extracted from oil fields in the shrinking area it now controls, striking 83 tankers along the   border as recently as Sunday.
