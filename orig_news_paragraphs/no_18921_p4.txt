As   Trump was blasting trade in a series of speeches and events this   week, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for ensuring that TPP   doesn’t get a vote before Congress.

Jeff Flake of Arizona, a fierce critic of Trump, told   Business Insider in an interview last week that he thought the   Manhattan billionaire’’s message of "economic independence" was   simply a code for "Fortress America. " ’ ’    "Anybody who believes that we’’re going to grow economically and   deal with the huge fiscal problems that we have from shutting   ourselves off from the rest of the world is just certainly not   what I’’d call a Republican," Flake said.
