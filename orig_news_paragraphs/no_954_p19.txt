The hackers stole a database of 500 million Yahoo users and other Yahoo software code which they used to falsify cookies, a technique that gave them full access to millions of Yahoo accounts without needing the passwords. They found accounts of interest by searching   recovery email addresses that users provided, allowing them to target employees of specific companies or organizations for other attacks. At least 50 Gmail accounts were targeted, as were accounts at financial firms and other technology providers. Mr. Belan, one of the F. B. I. â€™s   cybercriminals, was also making money on the side as part of the scheme, officials said.
