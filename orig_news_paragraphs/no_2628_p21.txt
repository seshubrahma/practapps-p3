As far as the bagels are concerned, the lye (i. e. NaOH) reacts with the proteins and sugars in the flour and causes (I am guessing) carmelization reactions. By the time the bagels are boiled and baked, the lye has been completely neutralized and there should, in fact, be no free lye remaining. If you want to follow the recipe that uses lye, be careful (generally speaking, kitchens can be dangerous places if you aren’t careful) but don’t worry about having remnants of a toxic chemical in your food.   —   Perry Brown in Salt Lake City, reacting to an article about whether lye is a key ingredient in bagel baking.
