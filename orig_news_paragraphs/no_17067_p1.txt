One America is rejoicing, while another grieves in disbelief.   In January, Trump’s new party will retool federal and international policies to recalibrate the government’s internal and global posture. Then, four or eight years from now, the "other" America will likely retake the White House and reverse those actions. I believe we can do better than whipsaw between two angry, divisive extremes every presidential term or two.
