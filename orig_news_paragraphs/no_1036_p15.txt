Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, said that despite recent changes to the health care bill, he was unable to vote for it. " This legislation simply wonâ€™t lower premiums as much as the American people need, and lowering the cost of coverage is my primary goal," said Mr. Harris, an anesthesiologist and member of the Freedom Caucus. House leaders were also contending with opposition from more moderate Republicans worried about the toll that the health bill could take in their districts.
