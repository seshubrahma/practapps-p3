His spokesman, Sean Spicer, was unable to quell the controversy on Tuesday, citing "studies and evidence" as the basis for Trump’s claims    then refused to discuss or produce any such material. " The President does believe that, I think he’s stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him," Spicer said. The reappearance of a controversy the Trump camp had thought was in the past was another sign of one of the President’s most dominant traits    an inability to accept any suggestion that he was unable to pull off a complete and total victory in any area of his life.
