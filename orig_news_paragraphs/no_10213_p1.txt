Under California law, a member of the general public may not carry a concealed weapon in public unless he or she has been issued a license. An applicant for a license must satisfy a number of conditions. Among other things, the applicant must show "good cause" to carry a concealed firearm. California law authorizes county sheriffs to establish and publish policies defining good cause.
