Notably, Ring and the Advocate do not link to any of Breitbart News’ articles about the march, so that its readers might decide for themselves. She writes: The   site, one of several we monitor so you, Advocate readers, don’t have to, is going so far as to call Sunday "The Day the Gay Rights Movement Ended. " Breitbart, which claims not to embrace homophobia (that claim is questionable, and it certainly is full of transphobia) is basically making the argument that the LGBT rights movement used to be OK but has descended into   insanity. Actually, it’s doubtful that the people behind Breitbart would have embraced the Stonewall protesters, many of whom were transgender women of color and far from wealthy, or any LGBT movement with a shred of diversity or an ounce of backbone.
