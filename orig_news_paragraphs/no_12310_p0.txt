On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s "Morning Joe,"   Mika Brzezinski and Bloomberg Politics Managing Editors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann described the timing of former President Bill Clinton’s meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, a report in the New York Times that the Clintons were considering keeping Lynch on as AG, the FBI’s decision not to pursue charges against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and President Obama campaigning with Clinton as "rotten," and not a coincidence.   Brzezinski said that it was "strange" that President Obama spoke out on the case back in April. After playing a clip of Obama’s statement on the case in April and October,   and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough said that the FBI agents working on the Clinton case were "absolutely outraged that the president of the United States tried to bigfoot the investigation all the way back in October. It was so inappropriate.
