Mr. Trump asserted just the opposite in a series of five Twitter messages beginning just minutes before sunrise in Florida, where the president is spending the weekend. In the first message, the president said he had "just found out" that "Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower" before the election. Mr. Trump’s reference to "wires tapped" raised the possibility that he was referring to some other type of electronic surveillance and was using the idea of phone tapping loosely. The president was adamant in conversations with several people throughout the day on Saturday that he believed he was right about the wiretaps, according to three people with direct knowledge of those conversations.
