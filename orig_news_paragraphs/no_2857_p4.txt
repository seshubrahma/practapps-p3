With nominees chosen for C. I. A. national security adviser, secretary of education and ambassador to the United Nations, the next pick is expected to be the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That could be official as early as Friday. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that he was "seriously considering" Mr. Carson, a former rival in the Republican primaries, as housing secretary.
