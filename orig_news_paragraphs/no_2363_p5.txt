But it is Mr. Trump who faces graver political consequences if he does not show the best of himself, according to several of his allies and advisers. His performance in the first debate was widely criticized after he seemed to struggle to stay focused and to keep to the debating points and tactics that his advisers had given him. They are now preparing him again, somewhat differently than before, but with the same uncertainty about whether he can follow through. Some of his advisers fear that Mr. Trumpâ€™s fiery style could create uncomfortable moments with undecided voters in the debate hall at Washington University in St. Louis.
