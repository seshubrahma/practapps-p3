The California Environmental, Public Health, and Workers Defense Act of 2017, introduced in December by Democratic state Senators Kevin De Le√≥n (  Angeles) and Henry Stern (  Park) would require the Golden State to implement environmental laws that are equal to or even more stringent than regulations set into law under federal environmental laws. According to the San Bernardino Sun, the bill, SB 54, seeks to ensure that California maintains and strengthens protections for air, water and endangered species, including for worker safety laws. " This is the least we can do to protect our state," Sen. Stern reportedly said before the Senate Environmental Quality Committee on April 5, the San Bernardino Sun notes.
