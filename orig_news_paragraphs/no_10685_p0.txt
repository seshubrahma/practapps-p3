San Francisco Supervisor John Avalos, the leading advocate for expanding San Francisco’s sanctuary city policies, attacked Donald Trump in explaining his newest resolution to a Board of Supervisors meeting last Tuesday. [Last year, San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy, which effectively protects criminals from deportation by barring local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, was the focus of negative press nationwide after a young woman, Kate Steinle, was shot by an illegal immigrant who had previously been deported five times and convicted seven times.   Supervisor Avalos used a speech on Tuesday to argue that San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy should actually be expanded to make it even more difficult for local law enforcement to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials when they have detained an illegal alien. Avalos paid lip service to Steinle’s death, and then immediately pivoted to attack presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and attempt to spread the blame.
