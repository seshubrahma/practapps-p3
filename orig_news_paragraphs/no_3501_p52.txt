Paul Crowther, who visited the officer in hospital, said he showed "enormous courage in the face of danger". He said: "Although he is seriously unwell, he was able to recount how he faced the attackers armed only with his baton, outside London Bridge station. " For an officer who only joined us less than two years ago, the bravery he showed was outstanding and makes me extremely proud.
