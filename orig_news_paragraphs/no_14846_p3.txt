Dunford said the two "assessed changes in North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat" but then went on to say the two "discussed response options."   Dunford’s statement also said the two "recognized the possibility that North Korea could conduct provocative actions" during ongoing   Korean military exercises or during upcoming celebration periods in North Korea. The latest indicators, US officials told CNN, is that North Korea has moved some launch equipment that is associated with an intercontinental ballistic missile launch.   The equipment has been observed near parade grounds, but the concern is it could quickly become part of an actual launch.
