actually got more votes than Clinton’s margin of victory in Minnesota. That’s remarkable because Republicans haven’t won Minnesota in a presidential election since 1972 in Richard Nixon’s   campaign, and Trump barely focused on the state at all, having just one staffer on the ground according to campaign sources, spending no money on   advertising, and appearing there only a couple times throughout the entire campaign —  including just once in the final few months. In Minnesota, she only earned 46. 9 percent of the vote to take the state’s 10 electoral votes.
