Mexican citizens in United States warned to ’take precautions’ Sunday’s march also came as citizens are rallying behind a Mexican mother who was deported Thursday and separated from her two American children.     Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos was deported after a routine   with an office of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Phoenix.    US immigration officials say there was nothing special about the case of Garcia de Rayos. Prior to Thursday, she had checked in with the immigration office seven times since a 2008 arrest for using a fake social security number.
