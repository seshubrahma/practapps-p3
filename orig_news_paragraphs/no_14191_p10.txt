" The truth is that there are undocumented immigrants all over our country in all of our communities who are working to make everyone safer, to increase the wealth in their communities, who are part of the civic fabric, who have family members who are US citizens, who are key contributors to the health of our communities, and what publishing a list like this is trying to do is to ignore those facts and ignore the reasons why mayors and police chiefs and sheriffs around the country have made the decision to do what’s best for their communities in a constitutional fashion," Jadwat said.   Washington University law professor Stephen Legomsky called the quarterly victimization reports "problematic," saying its goal seems to be painting an image of undocumented immigrants in the public’s mind, despite evidence of lower crime rates.   But he also said the measure would likely survive constitutional challenge.
