Nogales International reports: "Despite the nature of the charges against him and the fact that he is a citizen of another county, Andrade was never arrested or ordered to post bond. Even after he pleaded guilty, Deputy County Attorney Kimberly Hunley did not ask the judge to have him taken into custody. Andrade fled the state after his    hearing and was eventually arrested in California on Feb. 19 after a nationwide manhunt. "
