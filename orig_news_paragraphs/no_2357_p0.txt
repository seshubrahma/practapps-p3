WASHINGTON   â€”   More than 20 years ago, a surreptitious recording of a cellphone conversation arrived at a Pennsylvania radio station. A federal law made it illegal to broadcast such recordings, but the radio station aired it anyway. The case reached the United States Supreme Court, which in 2001 ruled for the radio station.
