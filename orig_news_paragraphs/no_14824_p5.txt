At a meeting with senators and the White House Tuesday, administration officials acknowledged the House bill, in its current form, canâ€™t make it through the Senate, an adviser to one of the senators present said. After the White House meeting, the senators now "fully expect" some changes to the House bill once    or if    it arrives in the Senate, the adviser said, declining to go into detail of what changes the White House may have explicitly indicated support for, because "negotiations will continue. " In light of the new CBO report, Lance said House leaders must make changes to their existing bill and only bring to the floor a version that can survive in the Senate.
