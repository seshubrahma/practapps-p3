The FBI found that 13 different mobile devices were used with her two known phone numbers, and thus may have sent emails with her private account. After Clinton switched to a new device, the previous incarnation would often disappear, and a former Bill Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, said he could recall two times he destroyed the old device either by breaking it in half or hitting it with a hammer. The findings also noted that Clinton stored her BlackBerry in a desk drawer in her office, which was not authorized. Her office was in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) and thus the use of mobile devices in the office was prohibited.
