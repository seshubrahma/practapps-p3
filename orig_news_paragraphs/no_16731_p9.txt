Better training of the officers is certainly a good idea, but what kind of training should it be?   I think there is an immediate need for clear, national standards on the use of deadly force. There is no uniform set of policies that educates officers on when they can use deadly force and when they cannot.   Current laws are incredibly vague about when an officer can and cannot use deadly force.
