That means that over the next seven months and 23 days that remain in FY 2017, the maximum that can come into the country is 17, 032, or slightly more than 2, 000 month. That contrasts significantly with the 8, 000 plus per month that have arrived in FY 2017 to date, and the 7, 000 per month that arrived in FY 2016, when a total of 84, 995 refugees legally entered the country. Although Washington State Attorney General Robert W. Fergusonâ€™s complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, filed in United States District Court, Western District of Washington on January 30, criticized all the key elements of the executive order as unconstitutional, his prayer for relief specifically did not request a temporary restraining order halting Section 5( d) which stated: Pursuant to section 212( f) of the INA, 8 U. S. C. 1182 ( f) I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50, 000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.
