Mr. Trump could appoint a new leader to the Fed who is more hospitable to his view (though she would have the option of continuing her time as a Fed governor, one of seven policy makers who are appointed to   terms). There are two governor vacancies available now, so Mr. Trump could quickly influence the direction of the Fed with new appointees. But itâ€™s not clear whether any new Trump appointees would steer the bank toward higher interest rates and greater concern about inflation or let a potential Trump boom advance unconstrained. Big fluctuations in the dollar could also shape a potential tension between Trumponomics and Fed policy.
