The draft budget memo, obtained by CNN, proposes cutting the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy’s budget from $380 million to $24 million    or nearly 94%    a move at odds with Trump’s campaign pledge to fight opioid addiction and abuse.    The cuts would aim to create "a small, more streamlined organization that can more effectively address drug control issues," the memo said, adding that the office would look to remove the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, which tries to coordinate the   efforts of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, and the   Communities Support Program, which provides funding to   coalitions that organize to prevent youth substance use. Acting drug czar Richard Baum called the proposed cuts "heartbreaking," NPR reported.   The Untied States is currently in facing epidemic levels of opioid abuse, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
