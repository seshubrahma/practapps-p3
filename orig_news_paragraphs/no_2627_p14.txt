Mr. Burns is trusted by Mrs. Clinton and is close to Mr. Sullivan, who worked with him on the secret negotiations in Oman that led to a nuclear deal with Iran. Mr. Donilonâ€™s name also figures in speculation about secretary of state, as well as C. I. A. director. For the C. I. A. post, Mrs. Clinton could also pick Michael J. Morell, whom she got to know when he was acting C. I. A. director in the Obama administration, or Michael G. Vickers, a former senior C. I. A. official and under secretary of defense for intelligence. Both recently wrote   articles sharply critical of Mr. Trump and favorable to Mrs. Clinton.
