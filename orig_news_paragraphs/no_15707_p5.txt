Christian: ’I can die in prison a happy man’ Court documents obtained Tuesday reveal new details about Christian and the train attack:     Train security cameras showed Christian taking "large drinks from a bladder style container of purple liquid" that Christian later identified as Sangria wine, according to a deputy district attorney’s affidavit of probable cause to support the continued detention of the defendant.     When police cornered Christian after the stabbings, he threw a folding knife with a 3.   blade that bounced off a police vehicle, the affidavit said.
