The senior incoming administration sources expect this fight to play out on three major policy fronts: trade, infrastructure, and taxes and the budget. Globalist elitists want Trump policies on these fronts to benefit the upper corporate echelon, whereas the nationalist populists would rather the focus be on benefits to the middle and working classes. Those same upper corporate echelon elites have shipped jobs overseas thanks to weak U. S. trade deals, then reaped the benefits of government connections for major contracts for U. S. projects â€”   all while being sheltered by tax code proposals from career politicians that reward the wealthiest in society without much regard for the average American worker or family.
