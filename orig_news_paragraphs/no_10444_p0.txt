  Donald Trump’s transition team responded to Carl Paladino’s racist remarks that he allegedly made about President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama to ArtVoice, a New York publication, saying that in 2017 he would like President Obama to die, and Michelle Obama to "return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla. "["Carl’s comments are absolutely reprehensible, and they serve no place in our public discourse," stated Jessica Ditto, who is part of the press team working Trump’s transition.   Paladino previously helped with Trump’s New York campaign. ArtVoice asked the following four questions to several people, including Paladino, a businessman and political activist.
