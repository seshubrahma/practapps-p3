" We agree with Charles Koch that Hillary Clinton’s policies are far    with what’s needed to change the trajectory of our nation. We’ve seen no indication that she would do anything other than continue the policies responsible for creating a   society, and we will not support anyone that doesn’t share our commitment to protecting free speech, ending corporate welfare and restoring fiscal responsibility," Freedom Partners spokesman James Davis told Breitbart News. Freedom Partners chairman Mark Holden said that the group does not plan to get involved to support any candidate in this current race.
