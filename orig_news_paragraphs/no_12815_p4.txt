Hillary Clinton was last in Los Angeles in August, when a   fundraising swing netted around $18 million for her campaign. The candidate attended fundraisers at the homes of Magic Johnson, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, billionaire entertainment mogul Haim Saban and Apple CEO Time Cook and taped an appearance on ABCâ€™s Jimmy Kimmel Live. Clinton had been scheduled to travel to Los Angeles for another fundraising trip earlier this months, with stops planned at the homes of Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and billionaire IAC chairman Barry Biller, but was forced to cancel after being diagnosed with pneumonia.
