We have not been contacted by anyone and don’t know anything formally about an investigation," the source said. The FBI focus on Flynn also touches on Kushner because he led the presidential transition’s foreign policy efforts.

This source says both Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump wanted Flynn in as national security adviser.
