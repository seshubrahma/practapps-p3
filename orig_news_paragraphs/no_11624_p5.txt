Of the just over $1 billion raised by Republicans in 2012 for the election, more than   was collected through the   efforts. The Romney campaign itself raised just over $300 million, while the joint fundraising effort netted just over $700 million. The Romney joint fundraising effort, however, had a $75, 000 limit on donations, far less than the $449, 000 limit on the   effort. The higher limit is due to a Supreme Court ruling, which eliminated aggregate caps on individuals, and a statutory provision tucked into a 2014 appropriations bill that allows both national party committees to create new fundraising committees.
