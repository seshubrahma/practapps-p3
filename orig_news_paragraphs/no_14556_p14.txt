The official explained that the administration would focus on cooperation with the bloc without advocating for it overtly, adding that if a country decides to hold a referendum on exiting the union, the White House will remain neutral. That’s a shift from the administration of President Barack Obama, which vocally advocated against Britain’s decision to leave the EU this summer, a campaign that included a presidential visit to London in April 2016. Decisions on whether to remain a member, the official said, should be left to the countries themselves, without US interference. The official added that while the US will seek to cooperate with the EU in   areas of collaboration, it is not seeking to bolster the union by preventing further disintegration.
