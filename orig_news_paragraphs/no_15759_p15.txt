In addition to the arrests, a large pickup truck flying two large American flags cruised past hundreds of   protesters and honked its horn. Several people in the group ran up to the truck and ripped out the flags, bringing them into the crowd as others applauded. Others threw multiple large water bottles, sticks and other projectiles at the truck, which then sped away.   One Trump supporter said she was marching in support of "free speech" after the mayorâ€™s attempt to silence the Patriot Prayer event.
