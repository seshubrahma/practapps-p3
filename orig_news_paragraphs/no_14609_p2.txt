" It is for the present generation to defend and, when the time comes again, extend freedom in Europe." Acting Deputy Secretary of State Tom Shannon called Fried a "national treasure" for his work to help advance freedom and security in Central and Eastern Europe throughout the Cold War and after the fall of the Soviet Union.
