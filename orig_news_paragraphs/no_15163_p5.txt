The US has leaned on China    North Korea’s main ally    to apply pressure on Pyongyang to curtail its nuclear ambitions.   At the same it’s increased its military footprint in the region by deploying a naval carrier strike group to waters off the Korean Peninsula. US President Donald Trump held a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month, and has praised China’s turning back of North Korean coal ships as a "big step" forward in the effort to enlist Chinese pressure on Pyongyang. Pence said Monday Trump was "very hopeful that China will take actions to bring about a change of policy in North Korea," but added later that Washington was "troubled by China’s economic retaliation against South Korea (for) taking appropriate measures to defend itself" by deploying the US THAAD missile defense system.
