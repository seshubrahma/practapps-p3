Considering that we have released 183 detainees during President Obama’s time in office, a little     math would indicate that our percentage is much better, and it’s a result of the reforms that President Obama instituted on his first day in office. " According to ODNI, 20 out of 161 detainees (12 percent) had been confirmed (nine) or suspected (11) to have returned to terrorist activities under Obama’s watch as of July 2016. Under the Bush administration, 188 out of 532 (35 percent) are confirmed (113) or suspected (75) to have   in terrorism. When taken as a whole, if there were 20 detainees confirmed or suspected to have   in terrorism for every 161 detainees released under Bush like during the Obama administration, the overall rate of terror returnees before 2009 would be closer to 40 percent, not 35.
