Romney has been perhaps the most outspoken voice within the Republican Party against Trump, and his endorsement could have been a major boon to the   ticket. But his endorsement never came. He told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in June that he would have supported Weld for president, but that he didn’t know enough about Johnson and was turned off by his former   challenger’s enthusiasm for marijuana legalization. Johnson said he eventually spoke with Romney, and in August said he did not expect Romney’s support.
