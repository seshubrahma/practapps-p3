that McGinty had taken with him from his time in D. C. We looked at page after page of his old investigations, his memory jogged by particular details: specific victims, witnesses, or suspects he was able to apprehend and arrest. In addition to investigating gang shootings and serial killers, McGinty also worked Internal Affairs, he pointed out, where he briefly served in a   unit, tracking cops who, among other things, had been openly profiting from a local prostitution ring. Elsewhere on McGintyâ€™s desk were guides to the science of crowd control, an encyclopedia of airport operations, even a pamphlet or two on extremist groups, including how to recognize and interpret White Nationalist tattoos we had discussed   missiles, Hezbollah, and disgruntled cargo employees.
