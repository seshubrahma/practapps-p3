Now comes this month’s FBI testimony that the agency has been conducting an investigation of the Trump campaign, and yet the FBI still has not cited any evidence of any   that justifies the investigation. This involvement of intelligence agencies and the FBI in   investigations  —   and the subsequent leaking of information gathered in the surveillance —   puts into question the President’s ability to trust the information provided to him by those agencies. And THAT, my friends, can seriously impair his ability to manage national security policy and any international or   crisis that occurs. The theme of an "illegitimate presidency" provides a veneer of moral justification for seemingly disconnected acts of political sabotage.
