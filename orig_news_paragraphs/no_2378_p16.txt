" By the way, let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk and let’s see how long she lasts, folks," Mr. Trump told a crowd in Ocala, Fla. on Wednesday. Mrs. Clinton has held 19 rallies in the 38 days since Labor Day, the official kickoff of the general election campaign, compared with Mr. Trump’s 32 rallies, according to a New York Times tally. But she has had a stream of     stops at community centers and small   discussions targeted at specific voters.
