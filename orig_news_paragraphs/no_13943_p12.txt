A third US official told CNN the Department of Homeland Security has been preparing for a scenario where they are told a wall along the southern border must be built.   " The moment Donald Trump won the election, DHS started discussions about how to achieve a wall if tasked to help make it happen. Those conversations included determining where to start erecting the wall first and identifying the priority areas along the border," the source told CNN.
