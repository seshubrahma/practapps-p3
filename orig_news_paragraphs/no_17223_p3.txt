Mattis, 66, would join a Trump national security team that already includes retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser and Rep. Mike Pompeo as CIA director. The retired   general, known as "Mad Dog," was lauded for his leadership of Marines in the 2004 Battle of Falluja in Iraq    one of the bloodiest of the war. But he attracted controversy in 2005 when he said "it’s fun to shoot some people" while addressing service members in San Diego. Mattis’ selection could put him in position to temper both Flynn and Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an appointee of President Barack Obama    whose generals Trump has said he distrusts.
