" If the president came forth with a legislative proposal that would ban all Muslims from coming into the United States, I would obviously oppose something like that," said Ms. Collins, a centrist who wrote an   article in August announcing that she would not vote for Mr. Trump because he did not represent historical Republican values. She and others in this group are fully capable of building bipartisan coalitions large enough to assert control over an issue and push legislation in one direction or another, siphoning some authority from the leadership. Though House conservatives are agitating to eliminate the filibuster, most of the senators in this group would be reluctant to support such a move since they derive some of their own clout from the threat of that procedural tool.
