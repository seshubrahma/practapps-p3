These are just some of the questions Indians have. But the questions also extend to international affairs    how is India going to adjust if Washington decides to revise Obama’s policy towards the Middle East and western Asia? Policymakers in New Delhi are already worried, for example, that reimposing sanctions on Iran would impact India’s crude oil supply and delay the completion of Chabahar port  that will create a new trade route for Afghanistan and drastically alter the trade dynamics in South Asia. In addition, New Delhi is also keenly waiting to see how Trump goes about dealing with Pakistan.
