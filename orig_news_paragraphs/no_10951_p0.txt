On this weekend’s broadcast of on "Fox News Sunday," Associated Press White House correspondent Julie Pace said President Barack Obama and   Donald Trump were "speaking on a somewhat regular basis" and she added Trump was trying to get guidance from Obama.   Pace said, "I think the most important thing that’s happening at the White house right now is what’s going on behind the scenes in terms of Obama’s conversations with Trump. I am told they are speaking on a somewhat regular basis and that the   is asking very real questions, actually trying to get some guidance from President Obama. I think the White House sees this as an opportunity to try to preserve some of what’s in place right now, try to make their sales pitch to the   before he ends up in the White House.
