This isnâ€™t the first time CNN and FNC have peeled away from live coverage to redirect their narratives. During speeches at the Republican National Convention from parents who have lost children at the hands of illegal aliens, Fox News and CNN cut away from their speeches. CNN also failed to carry the speech of Pat Smith live. Smith is the mother of Sean Smith who died in the terror attack in Benghazi, Libya.
