A Marine veteran who served in the second Gulf War and was stationed variously in Okinawa, Kosovo, Honduras, and the Mediterranean, McGinty is quiet, keeps his hair shorn close to his scalp. He bears a slight resemblance to actor J. K. Simmons in the film Whiplash. While he was working the murder beat back east, McGinty also applied for and received Top Secret clearance. This helped pave the way for him to become a liaison between D. C. police command staff and the National   Center, where one of his responsibilities was to review classified overseas intelligence reports detailing threats that might target the DC area.
