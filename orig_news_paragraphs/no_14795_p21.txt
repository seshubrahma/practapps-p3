Spicer added that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly "was kept aware of the situation the entire time."   There have been numerous instances of people trespassing on the White House grounds over the last several years.   In one notable instance in 2014,    Omar Gonzales, of Copperas Cove, Texas, made it through the north portico doors with a      folding knife in his pants pocket, according to the Secret Service. Gonzalez was apprehended just after making it inside the doors, the Secret Service said.
