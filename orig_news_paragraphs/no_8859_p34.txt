It’s a significant difference: The Republican position on trade is now, under the party of Trump, to oppose trade deals like the TPP. Sure, there are some Republicans like Ryan who still back it, but thanks to Trump the party has seen a massive shift —  one that will become official here in Cleveland over the next four days. Republicans seem to have, with Trump at the top of the ticket, found their backbone again as well not just on trade but also on issues like immigration, foreign policy and crime.    "criminal justice reform" —  efforts by GOP insiders like Ryan and Sen. Mike Lee ( ) to release criminals from prison —  has been all but halted as cops get shot in Baton Rouge and Dallas, and Trump pushes a   and order platform.
