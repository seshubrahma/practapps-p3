What should really worry liberals is what Trump spoke about during his speech. Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT[Q] community. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT[Q] citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.
