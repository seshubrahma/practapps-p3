For example, Beck said, Puzder can work with high schools and colleges to get more youths into skilled vocational training so they can build and maintain the   machinery, he said.   More Americans will be able to pay for college courses if education schedules are adjusted so the youths can work in extended summer tourism jobs that are now given to temporary foreign workers, he said.   Puzder can also help young Americans by pushing companies to build factories and workplaces in the heartland states where too many young Americans lack jobs, said Beck.   Amid the current federal policy of high immigration, companies "have not had good [business] reasons to go to Detroit or Memphis because they get all the legal and illegal workers arriving in the coastal states," such as California, New York, Texas, Georgia or Florida, he said.
