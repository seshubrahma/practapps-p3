Without explicitly changing the standard for "credible fear"    the threshold at which asylum seekers are granted permission to continue to pursue court hearings on their asylum claim    the guidance makes clear that asylum officers can use more discretion in determining an individualâ€™s credibility, and use their own knowledge to weigh against what migrants claim about potential persecution or torture back home.   Another change: Once people reach the credible fear point, instead of waiting for their full hearings on asylum in the US, the new guidance makes use of a law that allows   migrants to be sent to Mexico to wait, provided they arrived through Mexico. The change could send potentially tens of thousands of   migrants back over the border, and would largely apply to Central Americans who flee violence, gangs and drug cartels to seek refuge in the US.   DHS will also explore a video conference system to potentially keep these individuals in Mexico even for their court hearing, which could be conducted remotely.
