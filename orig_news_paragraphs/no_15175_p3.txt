" Being aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, seeing these extraordinary soldiers, sailors, and Marines gives me great confidence that the United States’ presence in the region is strong and under President Trump’s leadership will be stronger still," Pence said. The vice president is on the second stop of a   visit to the   region after visiting South Korea, where he toured the demilitarized zone (DMZ) the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea.   Pyongyang has been a main focus of his visit and public speeches so far, during which he’s stuck fast to the US message that the "era of strategic patience is over."
