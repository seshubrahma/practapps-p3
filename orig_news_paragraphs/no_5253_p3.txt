Silicon Valley captured a growing percentage of the $1. 24 trillion federal procurement budget during the Obama Administration, including half the $86. 4 billion information technology budget, and billions in secret "black"   budgets. The Democrat president’s policies also allowed the offshoring of U. S. tech jobs, and let tech companies use foreign tax havens to shelter $89 billion a year from the IRS. Thiat explains why Silicon Valley firms dominate the $2. 1 trillion in profits that American businesses now have parked offshore. Michael Hartnett suggests that liberals are beginning to understand that Silicon Valley’s globalist digital technology firms’ business model has been spectacular for a handful of CEOs and venture capitalists, but left the vast majority of Americans economically behind.
