Every six to seven weeks North Korea may be able to add another nuclear weapon to its arsenal," Siegfried S. Hecker, emeritus director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, said in a recent   article. The leader of the North Korean delegation, Ms. Choe, planned to travel to New York in her "nongovernmental" role as president of North Koreaâ€™s Institute for American Studies. The American participants were mostly former officials who had dealt with North Korea over many years. Some of them have participated in similar gatherings with North Koreans organized outside the United States.
