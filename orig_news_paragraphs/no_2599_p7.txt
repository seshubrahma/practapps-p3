On Wednesday, Mr. Trump and his children threw together a hasty series of conversations with other finalists in the   search, including Mr. Christie, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Mr. Gingrich. Paul Manafort, the chairman of the Trump campaign, said at midday Thursday that the campaign had not notified anyone of a final decision. " We have not been reaching out to Washington to tell them to prepare for any particular candidate," Mr. Manafort said by phone.
