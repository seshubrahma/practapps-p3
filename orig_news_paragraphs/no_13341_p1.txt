Curran told the gossip outlet that she had been admiring a piece of jewelry at Brown’s home when the singer lost his temper, allegedly pointed a gun at her and ordered her to leave. The woman added that members of Brown’s entourage tried to get her to sign a nondisclosure agreement, though she reportedly left without signing. As of 12 p. m. PT, police were still outside Brown’s home, reportedly waiting to obtain a warrant to search the premises for the weapon. Brown posted several videos to Instagram during the standoff, in which he cursed the police and made reference to the Black Lives Matter movement.
