Black Protestants are firmly in Mrs. Clintonâ€™s camp, and white mainline Protestants favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton, 50 to 39 percent. The survey did not show results for members of minority religious groups, like Buddhists, Hindus, Jews and Muslims, because there were not enough of them in the poll. The survey found Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump decisively in a   contest, 51 to 42 percent.
