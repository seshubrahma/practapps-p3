What was shocking to me that the entire rest of the mainstream media —  whether it be the New York Times and Washington Post, or CNN or any one of these outlets that has been overloaded with this whole narrative —   none of them did any research into figuring out anything about this guy. He actually just deleted his website because what we did is looked up what it is he does for a living and what is his political motivation here?
