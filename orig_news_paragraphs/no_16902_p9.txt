The war in Yemen is escalating and becoming more dangerous," said Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution. With its strategic location at the entrance to the Red Sea, extensive border with Saudi Arabia and desperately poor population, Yemen is "a military and civil strategic nightmare," according to Anthony Cordesman, a former state and defense department official at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. A deadly mix of forces are competing within its borders, including small cells of ISIS fighters, separatist groups, tribal factions, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Houthi rebels backed by Iran, forces linked to the former government and groups allied with Yemenâ€™s internationally recognized and   exiled leader.   The danger in Yemen is growing at a time when Congress has reduced US leverage with Saudi Arabia by passing legislation allowing US citizens to sue the kingdom for damages related to the attacks of September 11, 2001.
