Attorneys for the accused Russian money launderers questioned Gorokhov for seven hours over two days in 2015. During that deposition, they served him with a subpoena that would force him to return and testify at trial.   American prosecutors asked the judge to not force Gorokhov to return, and to issue an order making clear that Gorokhovâ€™s already recorded deposition would fulfill all his testimony at trial. It was a move intended to "dramatically reduce the incentive for anyone in Russia hoping to influence this proceeding to threaten or injure him or his family," prosecutors wrote.
