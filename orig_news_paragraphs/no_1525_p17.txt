The political nimbleness of Mr. Ailes’s network   —   which became No. 1 over CNN about 14 years ago and never looked back   —   is matched by one politician in particular, Mr. Trump, with whom Mr. Ailes, like so many other of the New   networks, has had a long relationship. It was an intriguing subplot this year when Mr. Ailes emerged as the only major television executive who was willing to take on Mr. Trump directly, in defense of Megyn Kelly, whom Mr. Trump repeatedly attacked, often in misogynistic terms.
