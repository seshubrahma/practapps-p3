Mr. Carter said the reinforcements would include American commandos and   specialists. They will join the 300 Special Operations forces already working in eastern Syria to recruit, train and advise local Syrian militias to combat the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS. " This latest commitment of additional forces within Syria is another important step in enabling our partners to deal ISIL a lasting defeat," Mr. Carter told a security conference here.
