"  activist group Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) has urged the president to rethink his hitherto   stance on America’s former cold war foe, claiming that the cutting of improved relations would do nothing to help Cuban citizens or serve the U. S.’s national interests," CNBC reported. " A rollback of recent progress in U. S.  relations would be out of step with the views of the majority of the American public —   both Republican and Democrat —  and would threaten the significant gains reaped by the American people and the Cuban people since the restoration of U. S.  ties," CDA’s Executive Director Emily Mendrala said on Tuesday.
