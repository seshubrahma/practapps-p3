Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and 2016 presidential candidate told graduates Friday at her alma mater, Wellesley College in Massachusetts, that she and her fellow students were "furious" when Richard Nixon was elected president but that he did not remain in office. ["By the way, we were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice," Clinton said, referring to President Richard M. Nixon.   She continued by saying Nixon "[fired] the person running the investigation into him at the Department of Justice," an obvious comparison to President Donald Trump, without naming him.
