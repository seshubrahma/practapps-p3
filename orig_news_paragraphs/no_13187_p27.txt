Writing at National Review Online, former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy asked, "What’s the story with the other $1. 3 billion in this deal, the money Iran is supposed to get in addition to the $400 million in cash?" Bloomberg in June reported on the $1. 7 billion, which the news agency claimed was transferred by the U. S. Treasury "to Iran’s Central Bank in January. " On Tuesday, Sen. Deb Fischer put out a press release similarly stating that in January 2016, "the U. S. Treasury transferred $1. 7 billion from the Judgment Fund to Iran’s Central Bank. "
