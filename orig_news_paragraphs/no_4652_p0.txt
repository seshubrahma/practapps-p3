The Senate intelligence committee released on Wednesday remarks prepared by former FBI Director James Comey for delivery the next day. [In the prepared remarks, Comey confirms that he told Trump he was not under FBI investigation multiple times, as Trump has asserted.   Comey said he told the president on January 6, January 27, and on March 30 that he was not under investigation. They also show that Trump had never pressured Comey to drop the FBIâ€™s investigation of whether there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia.
