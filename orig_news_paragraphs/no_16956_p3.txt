Otis managed to remove the gold emblem from the middle of the star and damage the star itself and the area around it. The shape of the star was still recognizable after Otis had vandalized it.   Leron Gubler,   of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said work to repair the star will happen immediately but the star is expected to remain covered for several days.   Gubler said the Chamber is working with the police and intends to prosecute to the full extent of the law.
