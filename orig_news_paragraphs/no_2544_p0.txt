JERUSALEM   —    For years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a conservative, has played a double act, competing domestically with his   rivals in backing the settlement project all over the occupied West Bank while professing support for a   solution with the Palestinians. Now, with the stinging United Nations Security Council resolution on Friday condemning Israeli settlement construction as lacking any legal validity, Israeli politicians and analysts on the right, on the left and in the political center say Mr. Netanyahu’s game may soon be up.
