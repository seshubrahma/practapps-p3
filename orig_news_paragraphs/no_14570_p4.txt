Washington was a strong backer of the European Union its commitment to NATO was   beyond question, and everyone knew that the United States supported the   solution to the   conflict. In those days, the thought that US forces should have seized Iraqâ€™s oil were being dismissed as the rantings of a political candidate who defied all norms, supporting torture, proposing a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the United States and claiming he would build a giant wall to block immigration from the south. That candidate, of course, was Donald Trump. He is now President, and his policies are in question his State Department is not speaking, and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is barely letting his voice be heard.
