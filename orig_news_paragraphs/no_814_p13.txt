Mr. Greenblatt, who handled outreach to Jews for the campaign, said that Rabbi Lazar was one of several Chabad leaders he had met during the campaign. He said the two men did not discuss broader United   relations and called the meeting "probably less than useful. " Rabbi Lazar said they had spoken about   in Russia, Russian Jews in Israel and Russian society in general.
