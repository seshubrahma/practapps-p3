I was proud to endorse her because she is the rare loyal candidate who has been fighting for us her entire career. It goes back to traveling across Texas in 1972 to register Latino voters and to organizing the   White House conference on Hispanic Children and Youth. But it is her time in the U. S. Senate, fighting hard for comprehensive immigration reform that sets her apart from Bernie Sanders. Hillary is the only candidate in this race who has always had our backs.
