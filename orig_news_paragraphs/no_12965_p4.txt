" I could have just stayed home and found the video on YouTube," one frustrated   attendee said as he was turned away.   At the conclusion of the rally, the protesters turned and marched toward the entrance of the gymnasium, chanting "Pueblo organizado, nunca se cansa!" or, "An organized people never tire!" According to Los Angelesâ€™ KNX 1070 AM talk radio, rally attendees were led out of the back of the gymnasium at the conclusion of the event to avoid a confrontation with the protesters.
