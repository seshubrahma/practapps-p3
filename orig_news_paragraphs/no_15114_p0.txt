Washington (CNN) US President Donald Trump says China has turned a fleet of   cargo ships back to North Korea this week, describing it as a "big step" towards cracking down on the rogue state. China banned all imports of coal from North Korea in   soon after Pyongyang tested a new   missile.   Almost all coal shipments to the Chinese city of Dandong, on the North Korean border, since February have been turned back, a source with knowledge of North Korean government operations in Dandong told CNN. The ban followed strict, new sanctions imposed in November by the United Nations on North Korean coal exports, which China helped to draft and pass, Coal accounted for a third of all official North Korean exports in 2015, making up a large part of its income.
