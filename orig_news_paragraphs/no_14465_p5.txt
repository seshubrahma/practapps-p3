It remains to be seen whether the Cabinet secretaries will outline any specific shifts in US positions    despite Trumpâ€™s rhetoric before and after the election    both on European issues as well as the Middle East. The ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen are expected to be a major focus of discussion on the sidelines of official meetings. Trump has long criticized the Obama administration for its approach to the Syrian crisis, suggesting he would reconsider providing aid to moderate groups taking on Syrian President Bashar   and take more aggressive measures against ISIS.   A senior administration official said the secretary of state will likely approach his initial meetings on Yemen and Syria as an opportunity to gauge the state of play rather than influence the debate.
