Statists understand that average people view government’s destructive powers as a force that should be deployed primarily against criminals  …      so they teach everyone to think of themselves as criminals. We all deserve to be punished for our   transgressions, fined heavily for unfairly benefiting from implicitly biased society, and controlled lest we prey upon one another. Conservatives learn from history, and so they trust people enough to delegate power and autonomy to individuals of every background.
