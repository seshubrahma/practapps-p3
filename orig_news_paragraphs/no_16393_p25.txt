The Trump campaign issued a statement Thursday, saying: "Right now the American economy is only working for the rigged system in Washington and on Wall Street, yet Hillary Clinton is running to keep things as they are. Clintonâ€™s plans today will short circuit our economy by raising taxes, increasing spending and killing jobs. Donald Trump presents a better vision and a new direction    a plan to unleash prosperity, create jobs and increase wages so that all Americans can succeed.
