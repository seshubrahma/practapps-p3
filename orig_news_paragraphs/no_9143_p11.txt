The   poll out on Tuesday showed Trump over 50 percent for the first time in North Carolina, leading Clinton by seven points —  well outside the margin of error. That survey had Trump up 51 percent to Clinton’s 44 percent. This all comes as early voting numbers suggest that Clinton is in serious trouble in the Tar Heel state, as the black community is not coming out to vote for her like they did for President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. Republican Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, but even Obama is admitting now that black turnout in the state is way down.
