The students allegedly involved in the altercation have been suspended, pending an investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, consequences will be applied in line with the Districtâ€™s Code of Conduct. The Stafford Municipal School District works diligently to ensure a safe environment for all students and staff and will not tolerate aggression of any kind. Technically, an "altercation" is an argument or disagreement, not an assault.
