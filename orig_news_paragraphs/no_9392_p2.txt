"Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the second amendment essentially," Trump added with regard to Sundayâ€™s deadly Islamic terror attack in Orlando, Florida. The Muslim shooter killed 49 people and injured at least 53 more at a gay nightclub in the early morning hours. It was deemed the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Obama made references to increasing gun control measures as he initially reacted publicly to the attack while failing to acknowledge reports that the Muslim shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS.
