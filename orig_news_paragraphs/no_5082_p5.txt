Under former Speaker John Boehner, House Republicans sued the Obama administration to prevent it from doling out the subsidies. In 2016 a federal judge ruled against the Obama administration but allowed the Obama White House to continue providing Obamacare subsidies while the administration appealed the decision. Republicans sought to delay the court case after Trump was elected president. The president will have to inform the U. S. Court of Appeals how he wants to resolve the House Republicansâ€™ lawsuit.
