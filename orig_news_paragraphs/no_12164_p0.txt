Rep. Darrell Issa ( ) joined Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 and discussed the Brexit vote with guest host Matthew Boyle, Breitbart’s Washington political editor, saying it was a "significant loss" for both President Obama and the presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton because they were behind the push for the United Kingdom (U. K.) to remain part of the European Union (EU). [Issa stressed that it was a big loss for Obama since he had travelled to Europe and actually made comments during a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron suggesting the relationship between the U. K. and other countries with trade wouldn’t be the same. " He wasn’t even truthful in what he was saying," Issa said of Obama.
