I saw I’m on the third base side of home plate swinging the baseball bat because I was next up, when I saw the first shot, I saw the rifle, I did see    you know, first I didn’t know what the bang was. Then I looked over there, and then see the point  of the rifle gun, and I got a glimpse of the shooter, which meant he also could see me if he looked in my direction.
