We regained our Independence and we light the menorah candles in the temple. I ask each and every member of this council, who voted for this resolution, who gave you the right to issue such a decree denying our eternal rights in Jerusalem? We overcame those decries during the time of the Maccabees and we will overcome this evil decree today. We have full confidence in the justice of our cause and in the righteousness of our path.
