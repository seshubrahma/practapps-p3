We conclude that the President, in issuing the Executive Order, exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress. In suspending the entry of more than 180 million nationals from six countries, suspending the entry of all refugees, and reducing the cap on the admission of refugees from 110, 000 to 50, 000 for the 2017 fiscal year, the President did not meet the essential precondition to exercising his delegated authority: The President must make a sufficient finding that the entry of these classes of people would be "detrimental to the interests of the United States. " Further, the Order runs afoul of other provisions of the INA that prohibit   discrimination and require the President to follow a specific process when setting the annual cap on the admission of refugees.
