 (CNN) In seizing an unmanned, underwater US Navy drone in international waters off the Philippines on Thursday, China has thrown down a North   gauntlet to both the outgoing Obama Administration and the incoming Trump team.   While media reports are still sketchy, it appears that a Chinese naval vessel was close enough to a US oceanographic survey ship to launch a small boat to grab the scientific drone as the American vessel was preparing to retrieve it. That would mean a    level of intimidation, and not a    action in isolated waters.
