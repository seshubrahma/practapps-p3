Each movement is made up of at least three factions: believers, political insiders and instigators. I saw these divides emerge in the Tea Party, where   "leaders"  —   but really just insiders   —   tried to take control of the movement to their own benefit. Not surprisingly, we have seen the same thing happen with the Occupy Wall Street movement, and the activists who gathered in Ferguson, Mo. (be it as insiders or as instigators).
