So what is the United States going to ask for? We donâ€™t know for sure, but some hints have emerged. One strong possibility would be to focus on "rules of origin" governing what counts as an automobile or other finished good produced within the free trade area. For example, a steering wheel might be assembled in Mexico but include parts made in China the rules of origin state how many of those parts can come from China while still counting as a Mexican steering wheel and thus enjoy the benefits of the free trade zone.
