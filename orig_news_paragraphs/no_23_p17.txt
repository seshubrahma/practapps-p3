For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised  â€”   entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others. " During the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U. S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters," said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration.
