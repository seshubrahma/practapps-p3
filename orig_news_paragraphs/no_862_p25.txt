Oscar Torres, a prosecutor who runs the homicide division in the area where Reinaâ€™s mother and stepfather were killed, acknowledged that the entire family was in grave danger, whether they witnessed the murders or not. Of the seven people who participated in the killings, he said, four are in jail pending trial, one is still wanted, another was killed in a shootout with the police and a minor is out on bail. One of the accused is a gang leader known as El Tigre. Gang members are particularly known to kill the families of potential witnesses when a gang leader has been accused, he said.
