Only last week, Mr. Xi was trying on the mantle of global leadership at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, suggesting that with the United States in retreat, China was prepared to step up as a champion of free trade and protector of the global environment. Mr. Xi has kept China’s economy behind high walls, and China remains the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but inconsistencies have never ruffled the president. " This is indeed a big win for China in the struggle for global leadership," said Zhang Baohui, director of the center for Asia Pacific studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.
