Donald Trump Jr. declined to answer questions about his work for Cambridge. His father’s presidential campaign issued a statement saying the younger Mr. Trump’s role at the company "was an arrangement made totally outside of the Trump Organization and there was never any commingling of the two corporations at any level. " Mr. Narod said that the younger Mr. Trump worked with Cambridge for a year while also continuing as a top executive with the Trump Organization, and that he had been aware of the complaints against Cambridge, as well as Mr. Narod’s censure by the securities industry.
