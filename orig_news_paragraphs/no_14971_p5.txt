But the military and its allies are determined to keep that from happening. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona threatened Wednesday that he would vote to shut down the government before he would vote for a continuing resolution. " If thatâ€™s the only option, I will not vote for a CR no matter what the consequences, because passing a CR destroys the ability of the military to defend this nation, and it puts the lives of the men and women in the military at risk," McCain said.
