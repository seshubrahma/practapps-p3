A White House official close to Kushner pushed back on any notion that Kushner would take leave from his West Wing duties in light of recent reports. This official said Kushner will keep his head down and stay focused on his work. Kushner is eager to cooperate with any and all inquiries, this official said.   McMaster was visibly frustrated as he faced a barrage of questions from reporters on Saturday about Kushnerâ€™s contacts with the Russians.
