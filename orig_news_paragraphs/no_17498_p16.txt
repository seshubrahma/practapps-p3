Many of them were either   supporters of Trump’s past flirtations with elected office or small business owners in New York who said they were confident Trump would be a boon for the economy. Supporters donning "Make America Great Again"      several of them boisterous and interjecting loudly in the middle of Trump’s speech    shuffled up golden elevators to watch from two stories up. Outside, campaign volunteers flagged down pedestrians to hand them the campaign   and invite them inside for the announcement.
