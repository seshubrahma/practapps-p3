The holiday congestion had inspired a local group, Hudson Square Connection, which runs a business improvement district in the neighborhood, to start a new tradition: dispatching eight prancing and caroling elves along with traffic managers to keep the peace at heavily congested intersections. " There’s only so much you can do about congestion, so we thought, ‘Let’s make it fun,’" said Ellen Baer, the president of the Hudson Square Connection. Some holiday destinations have taken steps to reduce lines.
