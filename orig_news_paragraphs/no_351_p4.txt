" This is something where the fear outruns the fact by a factor of 100 to 1 or even 1, 000 to 1," said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has tracked American sentiment about refugee resettlement over years. Mr. Galston said the reaction to misleading coverage of refugees was reminiscent of the wave of measures introduced in state legislatures in recent years to stop the spread of Islamic law, despite scant evidence that it has been promoted anywhere. And while he doubted that alarmist stories about refugees were powerful enough to change peopleâ€™s minds, he said the coverage played to existing fears and pushed mere differences of opinion into hyperpartisan outrage.
