Many of those false reports originated from RT News and Sputnik, two   Russian sites. Those   reports were widely circulated on social media, independent studies, including one set for release soon, have shown, sometimes in an organized fashion by groups that appear to have had common ownership. Individuals, conservative   hosts and activists recirculated them, often not knowing, or apparently not caring, about the accuracy of the reports. A study published just before the election on War on the Rocks, written by Andrew Weisburd, Clinton Watts and J. M. Berger, documented efforts by "trolls" to attack the reputations of those who challenged Russia’s activities in Syria, and to spread rumors about Mrs. Clinton’s health.
