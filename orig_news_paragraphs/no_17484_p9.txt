At home I practiced preparing blinis, driving my mom crazy.   Once a week our teachers would make us tour local orphanages and schools to mingle with other Russian children, bringing them cakes and books. I had a pen pal named  Anna with whom for a couple of years we kept writing to each other even after I left Moscow. The best moments were during our school trips.
