■ I don’t usually pay much attention to the margin of error because it does not even come close to approximating the actual potential for error in a survey. And pollsters calculate margin of error somewhat differently. In particular, I see a lot of   firms that don’t adjust their margins of error to account for the effect of weighting   —   making their poll seem more confident than it is.
