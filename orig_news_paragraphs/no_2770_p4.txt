Doctors are divided big time," said Dr. Carl G. Streed Jr. a primary care doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a member of the A. M. A. house of delegates, the organization’s principal   body. The controversy began soon after Mr. Trump announced on Nov. 29 that he had chosen Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which controls Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act’s federal health insurance exchange, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Within hours, the A. M. A.  —   the nation’s largest medical advocacy group, which has nearly 235, 000 members and calls itself "the voice of the medical profession"  —   issued a statement saying it "strongly supports" the selection. It noted Mr. Price’s experience as a doctor, a state legislator and a member of Congress.
