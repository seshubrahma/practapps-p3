Flynn was forced to resign from his role as Trump’s national security adviser after it was discovered he withheld information about discussions he had with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Flynn is one of four former Trump aides at the center of the FBI’s probe and is a top target for House and Senate investigators as well. Since he resigned, Flynn has retained a lawyer and has offered to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution    an offer nobody has apparently taken him up on. RELATED:
