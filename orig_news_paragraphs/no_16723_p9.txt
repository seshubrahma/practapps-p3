Reines was a press secretary for Clinton during her Senate tenure and one of her closest advisers as secretary of state. In Clinton’s memoir about her time leading the State Department, "Hard Choices," she describes him as "passionate, loyal, and shrewd." " He usually knows what Washington’s movers and shakers are thinking even before they do," Clinton wrote in her 2014 memoir.
