First, the administration appointed Lee Wolosky to fill the vacancy as the State Department special envoy for Guant√°namo closure, a role that had been open for six months his Pentagon counterpart was Paul Lewis. Then, Mr. Wolosky met with Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, and they developed a plan to speed up the process by imposing a   deadline on the Pentagon to act on any proposal. Under law, the secretary of defense must approve any transfer both Chuck Hagel, the former secretary, and Ashton B. Carter, who took over in early 2015, went through periods when they were slow to act. Later that month, at a National Security Council Principals Committee meeting, the White House presented Mr. Carter with a memo imposing the deadline.
