Goldman Sachs estimates that almost one million foreign   contract workers are now employed in   jobs throughout the United States, even though many media outlets routinely say the federal government approves only 85, 000   visas per year. [Goldmanâ€™s February estimate of the huge   population also ignores multiple other visa programs which invite foreign graduates to work in the United States. These other temporary work visas are used to employ an additional 470, 000 foreign college graduates in the United States, according to a study released on March 7 by the    Economic Policy Institute.   The EPI study, titled "Temporary foreign workers by the numbers," says U. S. companies employ roughly 470, 000 foreign professionals via the   O, L, J, OPT, and TN visas.
