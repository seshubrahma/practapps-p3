Several months ago, I wrote that part of the reason Trump resonated in American culture has to do with a popular fascination with the   in recent decades. Our films and television shows have been populated by characters who we like to see even though we know deep down that they are not good people.   Whether it was Tony Soprano, a mafia boss who is willing to kill turncoats during a college visit with his daughter or Walter White of "Breaking Bad," who makes money for his family by running a drug empire, sometimes being bad can be good. Throughout his presidential campaign, the pundits kept wondering when Trump would stop angering people, when he would start reaching out and when he would pull back from the incendiary comments that left a long trail of broken feelings along the way.
