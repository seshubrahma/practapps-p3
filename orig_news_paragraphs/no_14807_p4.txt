Many progressives criticized the pick that night and referred to the seat as being "stolen" from President Barack Obama â€™s choice of Merrick Garland, but then they largely turned their attention to a series of extraordinary events unfolding from the Trump administration and   Congress. " There has been so much else going on beyond the nomination    from the travel ban to all of the Russia allegations and the efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act    that Democrats have been distracted, and the nomination has been effectively drowned out by what seems to be a   series of breaking news," said Amy Howe, a Supreme Court expert at Scotusblog.
