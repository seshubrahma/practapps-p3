It is noteworthy that Trump is polling exactly the same as another Republican running for federal office in Wisconsin. It is also interesting that the state’s current polling picture falls squarely in the middle of the state’s election results in the past two elections. In the past two weeks, Hillary Clinton has enjoyed a bump in national polls following her clinching of the Democrat nomination. The benefit she received is about equal to the bump Trump enjoyed in early May, after he wrapped up the Republican nomination.
