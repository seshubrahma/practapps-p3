Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams, who has gained new fame for his predictions and analysis of the 2016 presidential race, told Breitbart News on Sunday that growing violence in America benefits Hillary Clinton at Donald Trump’s expense. ["All domestic violence, as long as it’s not terrorism, seems to play against Trump, because they have successfully framed him as the ‘divider,’ the one who is dividing society," Adams said in an interview via FaceTime.   Adams described the political effect of violence in the context of his overall theory of persuasive techniques, which he says are shaping the election more than rational arguments about policy and experience. Last week, Breitbart News noted the emergence of a Democratic National Committee memo, via Wikileaks, detailing plans to link Trump to "incidents of violence," regardless of whether they were carried out by   protesters or by Trump supporters.
