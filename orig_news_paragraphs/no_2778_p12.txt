Air travel is one of the largest expenses of Mr. Trumpâ€™s Republican presidential campaign: A company he owns has charged the campaign approximately $3. 7 million in travel costs since he announced his candidacy in June 2015. Using the 757 does not help keep costs down : It guzzles fuel and costs thousands of dollars an hour to fly, more than private planes being used to shuttle other presidential candidates.
