Since Trump’s election,   hysteria has become the norm in California.   Two San Francisco Supervisors are pushing an even tougher measure that would ban any company that bids on the border wall from consideration for city contracts. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "any company looking at President Trump’s proposed border wall between Mexico and the United States as a business opportunity may soon want to reconsider —  if it wants to do business with San Francisco. "  Two supervisors introduced a local measure last month that would "bar San Francisco from contracting with companies that seek a deal to work on the wall during the bidding period, regardless of whether the companies win a contract. " "It is time to move beyond symbolism and use the power we have as a city to fight for the values we hold most dear," Supervisor Hillary Ronen told the Chronicle in March, who is introducing the measure with Supervisor Aaron Peskin.
