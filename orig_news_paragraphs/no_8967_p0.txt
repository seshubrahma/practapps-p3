Hundreds of cars were forced to make a   less than three miles from a Donald Trump rally today after protesters parked in the highway to block Trump supporters from reaching the event. [The rally was scheduled for 2 pm Eastern in Fountain Hills, Arizona, but was delayed to 3 pm because of the protest and the time needed to tow the blockade of cars off the highway.   I was assigned to cover portions of the rally for Breitbart News and was on my way to the event when traffic moving eastbound on Shea came to a complete halt shortly before 1 pm Eastern. I found myself sitting in a line of cars three lanes wide that stretched ahead and behind me as far as I could see.
