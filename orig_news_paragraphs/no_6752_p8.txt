Designers and models have infused this winter’s New York Fashion Week with plenty of political statements as President Trump completes his first month in office. For her show this week, Indonesian designer Anniesa Hasibuan casted exclusively immigrant models, with each wearing a   hijab as they walked down the runway. Meanwhile, Mexican immigrant designer Raul Solis sent models down the runway wearing underwear bearing the slogans, "F*ck your wall" and "We are all human beings. "
