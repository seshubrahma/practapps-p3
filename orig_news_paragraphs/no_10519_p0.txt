In an interview that aired on CNBC’s "Squawk Box" on Monday, Diana Orrock, a GOP delegate from Nevada and supporter of Republican presidential   Donald Trump, downplayed the role that primaries and caucuses play in selecting the eventual Republican presidential nominee.   According to Orrock, the power rests in the hands of the delegates. " People are under the misconception that it’s the results of the caucus and the results of the primary that determines who becomes the nominee," Orrock said.
