Paula Barche Rupnik, a Republican from Scottsdale, Ariz. was planning to vote for Senator John McCain in his   campaign this year. But she changed her mind this weekend, after he rescinded his support for Donald J. Trump. Instead, she plans to split her ticket, voting for Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, but for Mr. McCainâ€™s Democratic challenger, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick. She has never voted for a Democrat before.
