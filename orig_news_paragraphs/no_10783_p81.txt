Sanders says that there is more excitement in his campaign than in Clinton’s because they are bring out   people who had given up on politics in addition to young people. He says he is the strongest candidate to bring in "new energy into the Democratic party"  and give Democrats the best chance of winning in November. When Cooper asks what he would say to independent voters who are deciding between Sanders and Trump, Sanders says to examine Trump’s   carefully and cites Trump’s "bigoted" statements about illegal immigrations and Muslims. Sanders says since Trump is not for raising the minimum wage and said that wages are "too high" in America, independents should vote for Sanders.
