From Benjamin Oreskes writing at Politico:  In a stunning reversal, a large majority of Republicans are repudiating their party’s traditional support for free trade, and falling sharply in line with nominee Donald Trump’s insistence that trade costs Americans more jobs than it creates. Meanwhile, Democrats, whose representatives in Congress have traditionally been far more skeptical of trade deals   —   and largely voted against giving President Barack Obama the " " authority to negotiate the   Partnership last year   —   are now far more apt than Republicans to see the benefit of trade, according to an exclusive poll conducted for POLITICO and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.   percent of Republicans surveyed said that trade deals have hurt their communities over the last 10 years, compared to only 24 percent of Democratic voters.
