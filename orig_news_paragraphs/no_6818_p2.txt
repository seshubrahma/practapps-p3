A source close to the talks indicated that as of Wednesday morning the Freedom Caucus was still waiting for that text. Another meeting that continued late into Tuesday evening involved moderate Republicans, Republican Study Committee, Freedom Caucus, and members of the Trump Administration including Vice President Pence. The meeting has been described as a discussion out of which no decision was reached. A Freedom Caucus representative told Breitbart News: The Freedom Caucus remains wholeheartedly committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare with a   approach that brings down costs for consumers.
