The message, also circulated by Rick Hasen, a leader in urging academics to oppose any election integrity projects, called on the education community to "resist participation" in the commission. If the President does indeed create a commission to study voter fraud and voter suppression in the American election system to be headed by the Vice Preisdent [sic] and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, I’m calling on scholars of election administration to resist participation of any kind in such an effort. We should expect a   Commission to find "evidence" of rampant voter fraud across the U. S. and to recommend proposals to amend the Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act to require    to register and a national voter ID requirement, among other changes that will be damaging to voting rights and therefore, damaging to democracy. Not only did the Rutgers prof urge educators to turn their back on Trump’s commission, but she went on to propose they create their own working group to present alternate facts to Trump’s effort.
