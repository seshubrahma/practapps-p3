Not since Bill Clinton in 1993 had an incoming president signed an executive order on his first day in office.   Trump can reverse any of his predecessorâ€™s executive orders, just as his successor can overturn anything the 45th President signs while in office.   Both Trump and Obama signed five executive orders within their first seven days in office.   Shortly after his inauguration, Obama signed executive actions aimed at closing the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and shuttering secret detention facilities    promises he had assured voters of while on the campaign trail.
