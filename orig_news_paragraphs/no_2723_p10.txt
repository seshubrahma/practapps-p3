After spending almost five days in Palm Beach, Fla. where he celebrated Thanksgiving at his    resort, Mr. Trump made no public statements on Sunday other than those via Twitter. He returned in the afternoon to Trump Tower in Manhattan. Through the day, Mr. Trump appeared fixated on the recount and his electoral performance. In a series of midafternoon Twitter posts, not long before he boarded his flight, Mr. Trump boasted that he could have easily won the "  popular vote" if he had campaigned only in "3 or 4" states, presumably populous ones.
