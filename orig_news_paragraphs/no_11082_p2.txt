The petition continues: "We also believe that an official LDS organization performing at a presidential inauguration gives the perception that the LDS Church and its diverse 15+ million members worldwide support an incoming presidentâ€™s agenda, values and behaviors.   Performing at other government events would not be a concern ( e. g. national holidays such as July 4th). As members and friends of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, we strongly urge the Church to stop this practice and especially for an incoming president who has demonstrated sexist, racist, misogynistic, and xenophobic behavior that does not align with the principles and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints.
