Despite the issue being a civil violation, Krikorian told Breitbart Texas that he questions whether or not   a visa should remain as such. The vast majority of illegal aliens who cross the U. S. Southern border are from Mexico and Central America. Visa   on the other hand, tend to be of Asian, Middle Eastern, and European descent, according to Krikorian. Keeping   as a civil violation is unfair, Krikorian says, because while border crossers are criminalized, visa matters are not.
