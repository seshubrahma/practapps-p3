The decision by Penn State to not accept the sanctuary campus status also comes after State Rep. Jerry Knowles ( ) announced that he would be introducing legislation to strip funding from any sanctuary campuses in the state. If Penn State had taken up the banner of a being sanctuary campus, the university would have risked nearly $300 million in state funds per year. Neighboring universities, though, have designated themselves sanctuary campuses. Expensive, private colleges such as the University of Pennsylvania and Swarthmore College have already pledged their sanctuary campus policy, announcing that federal immigration officials would be barred from campus without a warrant and faculty and staff are not to comply with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
