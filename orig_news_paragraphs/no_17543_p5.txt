The first was The New York Times’ publication in   of damaging deposition transcripts from a prior Cosby lawsuit, indicating that in the 1970s he had supplied quaaludes to an aspiring young model and engaged in sexual activity with her. The second was a California Supreme Court decision last week permitting a civil claim for money damages relating to the alleged sexual abuse of a    girl in 1974 to proceed through the court system. Famed and   plaintiff’s attorney Gloria Allred is handling the Judith Huth vs. William Cosby case on behalf of the claimant, now in her late 50s.   Allred is to sexual abuse lawsuits what Donald Trump is to Republican politics    a headline machine.
