The studio held a meeting on Monday morning with Parker’s team, and they are considering not granting new interviews with Parker from now until the movie debuts at the Toronto Film Festival in September. The hope is that by addressing the case well in advance of the movie’s festival run and October 7 debut, Parker can put it behind him by the time audiences get to see the movie. Searchlight is also still trying to determine what the impact of the 1999 Penn State case will have on Parker as the face of the "The Birth of the Nation. "
