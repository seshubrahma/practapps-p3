Despite having multiple degrees, Thiel launched the fellowship in   2011 to offer an alternate path than the traditional education   system. The $100, 000 grants let fellows drop out or pause their   education for two years to pursue their ideas. Some, like James   Proud, have already sold a company and started another. Others   have created a startup or two before returning to school to   finish their degrees.
