After tepidly endorsing Trump in May and popping up occasionally since then to criticize some of Trump’s basest actions, the cynical majority leader has all but disappeared from the presidential debate in recent weeks and gotten away with it. McConnell’s     play was in stark contrast with his opposite number, the leader of Congress’ lower chamber Speaker Paul Ryan. In the time between Ryan’s endorsement and Columbus Day, the speaker was quick to lend credibility and cover to Democratic attacks on Trump, such as his call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration, Russian tampering in the presidential election, claims that the Trump campaign was using   messaging and that Trump called for gun owners to assassinate his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Then, after the lewd 2005 tape of Trump using foul language to describe women was released Oct. 7, Ryan canceled his Oct. 8 invitation for Trump to campaign with him for the first time in the campaign.
