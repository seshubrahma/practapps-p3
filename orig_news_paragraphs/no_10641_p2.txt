Assange never once actively praised or stated his support for   Donald Trump. Assange was not even asked his personal opinion on Trump he was asked what he believed the consequences of a Trump victory would be.

Donald Trump is not a DC insider, he is part of the wealthy ruling elite of the United States, and he is gathering around him a spectrum of other rich people and several idiosyncratic personalities.
