Cable news personality Sally Kohn issued several tweets defending Sarsour, including calls for people to donate to the AAANY. I do nâ€™t think Kohn is aware that the AAANY used to receive financial support from Qatar Foundation International, an organization closely linked to the Qatari government. Additionally, because of her ties to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, the AAANY was able to secure $500, 000 in funding for the AAANY.
