It is, admittedly, a pretty   cast, with other principals portrayed by   Parker, Rachel Griffiths and Michael K. Williams. Several other   performers lend their names to the exercise, among them Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O’Donnell and David Hyde Pierce    the last of those as Jones’ stern father    and acclaimed filmmaker Gus Van Sant (also from "Milk") directed the first chapter. The main drawback is that it feels as if there’s too much ground to cover on too many fronts. While it’s interesting to see gays and lesbians overcome differences to unite politically, or Jones debate tactics with the more militant leaders of the ACT UP movement, there’s a disjointed quality, especially in the early going, in trying to service the various stories.
