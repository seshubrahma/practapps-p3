That, according to calculations made by the one and only Philip Bump of the Washington Post, is the   Twitter outage for Trump since he announced his candidacy in June 2015. To pass the fourth longest drought, Trump will need to stay away from Twitter for 2, 312 minutes    38 total hours, or until 10:17 p. m. Thursday    which looks doable. To break his   longest tweet drought, according to Bump, Trump would need to not tweet until 6:14 a. m. tomorrow. Whatâ€™s fascinating about the past droughts is that they almost always have corresponded with slow news moments.
