—   Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) June 3, 2017,   Aslan is best known for coming under heavy criticism after eating part of a human brain while filming a segment on a Hindu sect in India as part of his TV series Believer.   The US India Political Action Committee commented on Aslan’s actions at the time saying, "With multiple reports of   attacks against people of Indian origin from across the US, the show characterizes Hinduism as cannibalistic, which is a bizarre way of looking at the third largest religion in the world.
