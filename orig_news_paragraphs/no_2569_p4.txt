And that is not to mention the declarations of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, that NATO is "obsolete," that the allies are "ripping off" the United States and that he would not really be concerned if the alliance broke up. While that may be campaign bluster, it does reflect a growing unwillingness in the United States to shoulder a disproportionate share of the NATO burden, militarily and financially. The current concern, and a major element of what the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, calls "the biggest reinforcement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War," is the decision to put four combat battalions of up to 1, 000 soldiers each in those   countries bordering Russia. While Britain, Germany and the United States have agreed to lead one battalion each, to be filled out with soldiers from other NATO allies to preserve the idea of multinational forces, leadership of the fourth is not yet in sight as the July   summit meeting in Warsaw rapidly approaches.
