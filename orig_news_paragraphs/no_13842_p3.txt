Without the US veto, the Security Council passed the measure.   Oklahoma Rep. Jim Bridenstine is developing the legislation, according to Buzzfeed, which first reported the story.    Sen. Lindsey Graham, who had lobbied members of the Security Council to oppose the settlements resolution, will lead the GOP effort in the Senate to hit the UN in its wallet.    "I am a huge supporter of foreign aid and the UN," the South Carolina senator told CNN after the Security Council vote.
