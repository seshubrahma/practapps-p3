They discussed how Palin’s use of the phrase, "don’t retreat, reload," may have also created an environment that made the shooting possible. As Palin noted, "CNN, among others, implied that using a ‘crossfire’ icon (which was a tactic first employed by Democrats to illustrate political maps of districts they ‘targeted’ to win) was inciting violence. " CNN, along with other mainstream media networks, refused to acknowledge all the examples of Democrats having used "crossfire" icons to "target" districts while rushing to link Palin to the attempted murder of Giffords and the murder of six others. Anchor Wolf Blitzer, along with television personalities Gloria Borger and Jessica Yellin, noted there was no evidence that the shooter, Jared Loughner, was motivated by opposition to Obamacare or misinterpreted Palin’s Facebook post in support of conservative candidates who would fight against Obamacare in 2010.
