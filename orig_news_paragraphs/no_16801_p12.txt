ADF remains firmly committed to the goal that Pulpit Freedom Sunday is not about any particular issue or candidate or election, but is about restoring the right of pastors to speak freely from their pulpits and removing the censorship and punishment power from the IRS," Stanley said.   Trump supporter Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council, said that although pastors donâ€™t need to choose a candidate, they do need the freedom to do so if they want. " As a pastor, you have a biblical responsibility to speak to your congregation and help them understand the issues and how they line up with Scripture," he said.
