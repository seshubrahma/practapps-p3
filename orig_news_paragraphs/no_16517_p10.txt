A grand jury indicts Rick Perry on charges of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. He allegedly threatened to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg unless she resigned following her arrest on a drunk driving charge. She stayed in office, and he later vetoed the funding. August 19, 2014   Perry voluntarily appears at the Travis County Court house to be booked and fingerprinted and to have his mug shot taken.
