The people who stand to lose the most in tax credits under the House Republican health plan tended to support Donald J. Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, according to a new Upshot analysis. Over all, voters who would be eligible for a tax credit that would be at least $1, 000 smaller than the subsidy they’re eligible for under Obamacare supported Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton by a   margin. The voters hit the hardest  —   eligible for at least $5, 000 less in tax credits under the Republican plan   —   supported Mr. Trump by a margin of 59 percent to 36 percent.
