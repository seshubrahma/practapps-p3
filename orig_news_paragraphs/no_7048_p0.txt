The Trump administration has announced it will end the public release of White House visitor logs, bringing an end to a policy introduced during the Barack Obama presidency. [In a statement from their communications director, Michael Dubke, the White House claimed the logs presented "grave national security risks and privacy concerns," adding that stopping their release was the only way Trump could confer with advisers "with some discretion. "  "By instituting historic restrictions on lobbying to close the revolving door, expanding and elevating ethics within the White House Counselâ€™s office, and opening the White House press briefing room to media outlets that otherwise cannot gain access, the Trump administration has broken new ground in ensuring our government is both ethical and accessible to the American people," the statement continued. From now on, only certain logs will be available through freedom of information requests, such as in the Office of Management and Budget.
