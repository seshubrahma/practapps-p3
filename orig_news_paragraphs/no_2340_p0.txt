With clashes over truth, lies and exaggerations dominating the prelude to the first presidential debate, The New York Times has assembled a team of at least 18   for Monday night, drawing on the expertise of some of our most seasoned reporters. (Here’s our live analysis and video of the debate, highlights and fact checks.) These reporters will assess the accuracy of assertions made by either candidate, or by the moderator, in real time as the debate unfolds, with an aim of posting each fact check within five minutes of the statement’s being made. The   operation is an important dimension of an expansive coverage plan for the debate, which begins at 9 p. m.
