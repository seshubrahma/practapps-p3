" Heritage President Jim DeMint, a former GOP senator from South Carolina, said the location of Tuesday’s event was selected mainly because the President’s Club is meeting at the nearby Ronald Reagan Building this week. But in an interview, DeMint also said that having the event at Trump’s new luxury hotel would have special meaning.    "It just turned out to be a good opportunity for us, and I think some of our folks are staying there while they’re in town, so they just get a kick out of having our closing event at the Trump Hotel with the (incoming) vice president speaking," DeMint told CNN.
