Sanders fans in the California section shared articles predicting that Trump had a better chance of winning the presidency. They defaced the Clinton signs they were given by the ushers, turning "STRONGER TOGETHER" into "STOP HER," and "JUNTOS SE PUEDE" (together, we can) into "NO SE PUEDE" (it cannot). Some of the Clinton fans complained, leading to heated verbal confrontations ("I’m about to kick some ass") and at least one ejection. But over time, the energy of the protest seemed to fade, ever so slightly, as the show grew ever bigger, the speeches more and more dramatic.
