As a parent, I would like to know what on earth qualifies DeVos with the knowledge required to develop "internationally competitive performance standards" that were "voluntarily" forced on all students of this nation, as we are experiencing with the disastrous Common Core? DeVosâ€™ resume seems more filled with experience in writing donor checks and in obtaining fancy board memberships, as a result of those donations, than anything that would qualify her to run the U. S. Department of Education or to develop standards for anything, least of all education. Wood says the choice of DeVos is disturbing to the thousands of parents who have been fighting the establishment elites and big business and industry groups that support Common Core: All of this should unsettle anyone who has been fighting the Common Core, not just as damaging standards, but as a Trojan horse disguising and distracting from the entire initiative to centralize education in America, leaving no choice but the choice of educating children to the lowest common denominator. Concerned citizens, like myself, who supported Trump because of his promise to get rid of Common Core and restore local control of education, should be alarmed by this decision.
