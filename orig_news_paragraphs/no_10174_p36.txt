Capt. Khan was an Army officer who gave his life defending fellow soldiers in Iraq, and whose parents attacked Trump in a speech at the Democratic National Convention. When asked about the speech by ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos (a former aide to President Bill Clinton) Trump made a comment about the silence of Khan’s mother, who stood mute onstage alongside Khan’s father.
