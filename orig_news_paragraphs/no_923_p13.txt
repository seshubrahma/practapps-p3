He was arrested in March 2015 by a Philadelphia Police Department SWAT team as he dropped off an undercover agent at a detention facility. Mr. Ford, who told the authorities that he had taken only a few hundred dollars from detainees "a couple of times," pleaded guilty in June 2015. Mr. Echevarria, who was indicted last year, accepted $75, 000 in bribes in exchange for employment authorization documents for several immigrants in the country illegally, the authorities said. Prosecutors said he also had demanded sex in at least one instance.
