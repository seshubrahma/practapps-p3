A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other peopleâ€™s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified. The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance. And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts).
