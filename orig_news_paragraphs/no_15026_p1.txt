Bannon should never have had a permanent seat on the NSC as he is a political operative and the NSC has traditionally been a place where American interests are considered rather than narrow Republican or Democratic interests. In late January, White House spokesman Sean Spicer tried to justify Bannon’s seat on the NSC because he had once served in the US Navy, but Bannon left the Navy as a lieutenant in the early 1980s. The military and the world have changed quite a bit since Olivia  ’s "Physical" was a No. 1 song and Ronald Reagan had recently become president.    Another NSC official who may be sidelined is deputy national security adviser K. T. McFarland.
