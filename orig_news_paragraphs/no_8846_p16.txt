The same bogus federal remedies have been thrown at them for decades, under Administrations from both parties.    An increasingly expensive educational bureaucracy, coupled with a university system dominated by political correctness and   programs, have failed to deliver on the theory that education automatically confers wealth.

We spend more on education than ever, with more attention paid to getting minority youth into college than ever  â€¦     but the inequality gap widens.
