■ Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Friday to again play down Russian interference in the elections   —   this time, seemingly praising one of the cyberattacks for the revelations it contained. The Trump family on Friday appears to have canceled a charity auction that featured the  ’s daughter Ivanka, as criticism mounted that the future first family’s charitable solicitation risked opening the White House to special interests seeking to pay for access. The auction for a chance to spend up to 45 minutes with Ms. Trump over coffee at either Trump Tower in New York or the recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington was to continue for another three days.
