The European Union (and NATO) were designed to bind Europe together, both to prevent another war on the continent and to contain the Soviet Union. The idea of a war between the Western European powers is particularly unthinkable, but the history of the region is one wracked by devastating wars. And while war on the continent is a very low probability, confrontation with Russia is significantly more likely.   years after the end of the Cold War, Russia again threatens Europe. It has invaded an EU neighbor, launched   and   kidnappings against Estonia, and violated NATO airspace all along the allianceâ€™s Eastern border.
