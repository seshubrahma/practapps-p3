New York (CNN) A trio of military aircraft seen flying at low levels over midtown Manhattan last week were conducting surveillance and mapping escape routes as part of a security plan for   Donald Trump, two law enforcement officials told CNN Thursday. The aircraft, identified as an   search and rescue plane and two   Pave Hawk helicopters, were taking photos and surveying rooftops and street layouts for the Secret Service in the case that Trump would have to be removed from the city in an emergency, the law enforcement officials said. Trump has said that he plans to return to his home in New York regularly after taking office next month.
