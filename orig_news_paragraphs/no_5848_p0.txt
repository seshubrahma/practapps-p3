California Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration is unhappy with President Donald Trump’s budget proposals and how they will potentially affect several programs and funding for some projects in the state. ["The president’s budget proposes a complete withdrawal of the federal government ’s commitment to working with states to solve the critical issues of the country, from environmental protection and emergency preparedness to transportation and other infrastructure," Brown’s budget director, Michael Cohen said, according to the Los Angeles Times.   Brown’s administration is also concerned about limited grant funding for rail and transit projects.
