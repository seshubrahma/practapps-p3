That is to say, in this new era of   politics, the   forces must win, and the   must lose. For his part, McGarvey, the   union leader, issued an angry response. If union leaders choose to regard "climate change" as the "most pressing issue" he snapped, they can look to themselves first: I suggest they work within their own industries to do their part to combat the problem and not callously and hypocritically take it out on hard working American   members. Still, it seems a safe bet that McGarveyâ€™s lament will not change any minds within the Democratic Party.
