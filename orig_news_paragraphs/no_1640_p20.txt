Jennifer Oâ€™Malley, a spokeswoman for the Indiana State Department of Health, said that since early July, 474 residents of the housing complex and surrounding neighborhoods had been screened for lead and that 29, including 19 children younger than 8, had elevated levels in their blood. But in a July 14 letter to the E. P. A. Mr. Copeland said preliminary tests had found that "hundreds of children suffer from excessive levels of lead in their blood," according to The Times of Northwest Indiana. Shantel Allen, 27, who has lived at the complex for five years, said tests had shown that all five of her children, who range in age from 2 to 10, had alarmingly high levels of lead. She said she had been told that her yard had some of the highest lead and arsenic levels.
