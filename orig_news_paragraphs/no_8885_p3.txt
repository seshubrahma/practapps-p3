The Malicious Communications Act has already been used to jail teenagers for posting offensive messages on Facebook. In another notorious case, a man was put on trial under the Act after he posted a joke bomb threat on Twitter. The CPS also urges prosecutors to watch for hate speech on social media. Prosecutors must also have regard to whether the offence was motivated by any form of discrimination against the victimâ€™s ethnic or national origin, gender, disability, age, religion or belief, sexual orientation or gender identity or the suspect demonstrated hostility towards the victim based on any of those characteristics.
