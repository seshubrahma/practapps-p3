On Tuesday, Louisiana Republicans met and voted in caucuses to select delegates to the state’s convention. Cruz dominated Tuesday’s vote. The caucus vote doesn’t have any official bearing on Saturday’s primary, but it suggests Cruz has a strong organization in the state. The most recent poll in Louisiana showed Trump with a 12 point lead over Cruz.
