On December 20th, Donald Trump’s lead over Hillary among white working class voters was just 5 points. Between then and now, Trump has amplified his call to temporarily ban Muslim refugees,   on building a border wall and called out Hillary over Bill’s past transgressions with women. Trump, in other words, threw aside   and raised troubling issues about the Clintons that the polite political establishment had refused to raise. He now leads Hillary by 20 points among white   voters.
