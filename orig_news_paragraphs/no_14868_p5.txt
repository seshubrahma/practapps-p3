White House officials later told CNN that it was British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall Grant, national security adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May, who "expressed their concerns to Sean Spicer and Gen. McMaster" in two separate conversations on Thursday. " Mr. Spicer and Gen. McMaster explained that Mr. Spicer was simply pointing to public reports, not endorsing any specific story," one official said. Spicer spoke to Darroch    at a White House St. Patrickâ€™s Day event, according to a British government official, who described the meeting as "serious" in tone and said it was not cordial.
