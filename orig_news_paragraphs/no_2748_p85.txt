Tracing how these enormous returns wind their way into Mr. Black’s pocket is a byzantine task. Mr. Black collected a $100, 000 salary and no bonus in 2015. How did Mr. Black, on such a relatively modest salary, come to acquire an art collection that is said to include one of Edvard Munch’s " Scream" series, which he bought in 2012 for about $120 million, then the highest price ever paid for a painting? The answer is that Mr. Black and other private equity executives make their money in ways that set them apart from most other industries.
