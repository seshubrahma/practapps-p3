The most controversial element of   district court Judge Derrick Watson ’s ruling was its justification of the injunction based not on the text or effect of the executive order, but on statements President Trump made during the 2016 campaign. According to that ruling, speaking about a "Muslim ban" and speaking negatively about the religion’s relationship with the West mean that the plaintiffs had a high enough likelihood of proving a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause to block the order. This is true even though the actual order does not take any action based on people being Muslim because, "[A] reasonable, objective observer —  enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous public statements, and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance —  would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion[. ]
