A case can be made for Chicago not to bear the brunt of national outrage: its per capita murder rate over the last 30 years is actually lower than cities like St. Louis, Detroit and New Orleans. Its downtown and lakefront museum campus is even more vibrant than when I graduated from college in 1998 with a journalism degree. In a bid to attract younger workers, McDonald’s is moving its corporate headquarters from the suburbs to a brand new campus on Oprah Winfrey’s former Harpo Studios lot in the West Loop.   How could a city this grand be so maligned in the national spotlight?
