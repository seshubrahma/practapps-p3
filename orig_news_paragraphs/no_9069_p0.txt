Monday on "CNN Newsroom," while discussing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s economic predictions, former speechwriter Nixon and Ford speechwriter, actor and author Ben Stein said Trump’s ideas were "nonsensical" and "breathtakingly horrible. "  Stein said, "In all of my years as an economist, which is roughly 50 years, I’ve never seen such nonsense as we just heard from Mr. Trump. And it breaks my heart, it makes me want to cry because I’m Republican, I’ve never voted for a Democrat, and to think the guy who’s our likely standard bearer has such nonsensical ideas on every single aspect of the economy is just breathtakingly horrible. "
