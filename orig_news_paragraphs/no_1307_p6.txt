Republicans may face a tougher test next week in Georgia, where both parties have poured millions into contesting the seat vacated by Tom Price, Mr. Trumpâ€™s new health and human services secretary. At a   shopping mall outside Atlanta, Eric Riehm, 48, said he was beginning to question the point of casting his ballot for Republicans. " The vote seems to matter less and less, because nothing can be done, just like repealing Obamacare," said Mr. Riehm, who works in information technology sales and voted for Mr. Trump.
