Aseman currently has a fleet of 31 aircraft, a mixture of Boeing, Airbus and Fokker models with an average age of 25 years, according to the website Planespotters. net. The Boeing deal requires permission from the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, which has regulatory authority over such transactions with Iran. Not mentioned in the Boeing announcement, but still a significant hurdle for both sides, is how the company would be paid for the aircraft.
