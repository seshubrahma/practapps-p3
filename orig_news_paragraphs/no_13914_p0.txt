Washington (CNN) Rep. Mike Pompeo, Donald Trumpâ€™s pick for CIA director, promised Thursday at his Senate confirmation hearing to deliver unvarnished facts to the President and pledged to shield the agency from political influence at a time when Trump has been critical of the intelligence community.       Like other nominees this week, the Kansas Republican disagreed with the   in tone and substance on several occastions. He vowed not to reinstate enhanced interrogation techniques    even if ordered to do so by Trump    and took a harder line on Russia than Trump has displayed.
