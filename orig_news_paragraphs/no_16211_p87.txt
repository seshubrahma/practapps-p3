So on the number of coal workers who’ve lost their jobs, we rate Capito’s claim false. Clinton, however, did actually say at a CNN town hall in March that as President, she’d put a lot of coal miners and companies out of business. She later called it a misstatement, saying she meant that coal miners would continue losing jobs the way things were going. Clinton has proposed "revitalizing" coal country with $30 billion in investment aimed at retraining former coal miners, protecting health and pension benefits for mineworkers and attracting investment to counties impacted with layoffs.
