A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir has quit the esteemed singing company over its scheduled performance at   Donald Trump’s inauguration in Washington DC in January. [In a resignation letter sent to fellow choir members and later posted on Facebook, singer Jan Chamberlin said she’d spent "several sleepless nights and days in turmoil and agony" since the choir announced it would perform at the inauguration, and that she could not "in good conscience" join her colleagues at the event.   " I have highly valued the mission of the Choir to be   will ambassadors for Christ, to share beautiful music and to give hope, inspiration, and comfort to others," Chamberlin wrote.
