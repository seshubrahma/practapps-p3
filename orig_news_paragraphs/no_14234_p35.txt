Scientists estimate that there are more than 7, 000 tons of trash orbiting the Earth.    And this year, the United Kingdomâ€™s Surrey Space Centre is launching a mission that test ways to clean up space.    A giant net could be used to catch satellites instead of butterflies.   A harpoon can help a space trash collection system spear chunks of junk and what scientists call a drag sail could be attached to future satellites and act like a giant parachute that would slow them down once they are done working and cause them to move toward Earth faster and then burn up sooner in its atmosphere.
