Outside of Assange’s appearance via satellite, the convention saw many   speakers take the stage touting the party’s liberal policy positions and appealing to Sanders supporters. Most prominent among the speakers was scholar and activist Cornel West. He served as one of Sanders’ representatives on the Democratic platform committee, but he has since offered his support of the Green Party. Speaking at the convention Saturday, West gave a rousing speech about the "issues of integrity" ranging from human rights abroad to the history of the civil rights movement in the US, citing W. E. B. duBois in particular.
