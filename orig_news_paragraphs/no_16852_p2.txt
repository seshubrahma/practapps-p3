About a week after Sanders raised the issue in a January debate, the campaign’s head of research, Tony Carrk, sent around the excerpts, apparently provided by "HWA" (likely referring to the Harry Walker Agency, a firm representing Clinton and other   speakers) to Podesta and other top campaign officials, including Podesta and Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri.   The speech excerpts shed light on Clinton’s relationship with Wall Street behind closed doors, as well as her positions on issues such as trade and regulation.
