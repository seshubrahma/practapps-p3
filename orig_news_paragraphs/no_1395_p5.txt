The 2009 letter that Mr. Trump sent to Mike Tollin, a movie director, makes for painful reading: It denounced a film by Mr. Tollin that explored Mr. Trumpâ€™s role in the collapse of a football league as "third rate" and "extremely dishonest. " In a fulminating flourish, Mr. Trump wrote: "P. S. You are a loser. " Nevertheless, Mr. Tollin had the letter framed and he keeps it on a shelf in his office, next to photographs of his family.
