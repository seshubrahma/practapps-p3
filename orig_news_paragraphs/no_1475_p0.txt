WASHINGTON   —    Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, conceding that her airport meeting with former President Bill Clinton this week had cast a shadow over the federal investigation of Hillary Clinton’s personal email account, said Friday that she would accept whatever recommendations career prosecutors and the F. B. I. director made about whether to bring charges in the case. Ms. Lynch said she had decided this spring to defer to the recommendations of her staff and the F. B. I. because her status as a political appointee sitting in judgment on a politically charged case would raise questions of a conflict of interest.
