Coons, who was the 41st senator to say he plans to take part in the filibuster, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer immediately after his announcement that he understood the consequences of his decision, but also reiterated his pledge that he’s open to negotiating with Republicans to find an agreement on avoiding the nuclear option on the next nominee. " I said, ’I will vote against closure unless the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate can somehow find an agreement that is trustworthy and reliable, where on the next Supreme Court nominee, they won’t change the rules and we will have input and a more confirmable, consensus nominee will be put in front of the Senate,’ " Coons said.
