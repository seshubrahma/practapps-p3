There is an estimated 1. 1 million metric tons of   on the moon. A mere 40 tons could power the United States for a year if scientists are able to build a fusion reactor, we could shovel it into our nuclear power plants for centuries to come. There are also countless scientific questions that can be answered on the lunar surface. A telescope, for example, built on the far side of the moon and thus free of Earthâ€™s ionosphere and radio interference would allow scientists to see the beginning of the universe.
