Ms. Mendoza said that "Donald Trump is the change this country needs," Breitbart Texas reported in June. Breitbart News reported in late May that Sabine Durden, whose    son Dominic was murdered by an illegal alien, said she "lost it" when Donald Trump kissed her son’s poster. A video in the article captured Trump’s interaction with mothers who had lost their children to violence by criminal illegal aliens. Durden said that Dominic’s killer had committed two felonies but pleaded them down to one.
