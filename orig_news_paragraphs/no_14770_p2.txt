US District Court Judge James Robart issued a nationwide temporary restraining order blocking implementation of key sections of the original travel ban on February 3. Trump signed a new executive order Monday, however, banning foreign nationals from six   countries from entering the US for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, but specifically excluded green card holders and those with existing valid visas from the new order.   The two states that filed the original lawsuit    Washington and Minnesota    argue that Robartâ€™s current temporary restraining order suspending the first travel ban should block implementation of the new executive order as well.
