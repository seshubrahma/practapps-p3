What made it into the movie was actually a reshoot of a discarded and more risqu√© scene filmed on the Upper East Side in the summer of 1954. The discarded version happened to also be captured on   film by an amateur filmmaker who lived nearby. Jules Schulback often talked about the footage, but no one saw it for 50 years, until he was 92 and his granddaughter found it. Have a great weekend.
