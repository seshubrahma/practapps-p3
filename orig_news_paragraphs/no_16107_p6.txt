The presumptive presidential nominees for both major political parties have postponed campaign events Friday, following the deadliest single day for U. S. law enforcement since September 11, 2001. Trump canceled campaign stops in Miami and Hillary Clinton postponed her scheduled rally with Vice President Joe Biden in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as well as a fundraising event. Clinton is still expected to speak Friday afternoon in Philadelphia, where she is expected to address this week’s shootings in Dallas, Baton Rouge and Minnesota.   Clinton’s speech was scheduled before the shootings.
