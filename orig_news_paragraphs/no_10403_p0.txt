Veteran pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell, a regular on the Fox News Sunday night show "Political Insiders," joined Breitbart’s Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle on Monday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM to break down the latest Breitbart   national poll, which showed a significant tightening of the presidential race, placing Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump by a statistically insignificant 1 point. ["This poll, if anything, is somewhat more Democratic, because of the samples, than it ought to be," Caddell noted, suggesting the news might be even better for Trump than it appeared.   " The race has tightened," he argued.
