My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests," Manafort said in a statement his spokesman provided to CNN. He issued another statement on the matter Wednesday afternoon: "I have always publicly acknowledged that I worked for Mr. Deripaska and his company, Rusal, to advance its interests. For example, one of the projects involved supporting a referendum in Montenegro that allowed that country to choose membership in the (European Union) a measure that Russia opposed. I did not work for the Russian government.
