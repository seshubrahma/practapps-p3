Sigourney Weaver spoke in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the party’s national convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday, where she discussed her "deep concern" about climate change while introducing a warning video directed by James Cameron. ["As an American, I am also deeply concerned about my family’s future, indeed about our shared future as a nation, because that future is at risk," the    Alien star and environmental activist said.   " You see, when we talk about greenhouse gases, warming temperatures or deadlier droughts, even more destructive storms, what we’re really talking about is people," Weaver added.
