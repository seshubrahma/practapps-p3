The picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her.

Anyone who would pay thugs to incite violence at a rally against American citizens, as was released on video, will stop at nothing.
