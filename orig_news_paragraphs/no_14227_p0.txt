Washington (CNN) House and Senate Democrats stood outside the Supreme Court in the cold on Monday night to protest President Donald Trump’s travel ban. " I’m very proud to stand her with members of the House Democratic Caucus, soon to be joined by the Senate Democrats as well, sharing views in a bipartisan way with many of our Republican colleagues who agree that what the President did undermines our values and is not in support of the oath of office that we take, to support and defend the Constitution of the United States," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said before the audio cut out.
