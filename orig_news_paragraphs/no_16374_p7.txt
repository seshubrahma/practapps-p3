Throughout his own campaign for president, Trump has referred to unnamed sources, typically multiplied with terms like "a lot" and "many" to say outrageous things without taking responsibility for them. He has mentioned people who "think" Clinton administration aide Vince Foster, who committed suicide, was murdered and that "a lot of people are talking about" the possibility that his primary campaign rival Ted Cruz was not born in the United States.   Every time he uses this technique, Trump gives himself an excuse in the event he is proven wrong: He wasnâ€™t saying something himself.
