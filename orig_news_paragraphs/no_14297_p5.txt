Banking on the success of the country’s   "green gold," the association purchased an ad that will run after the third quarter of Super Bowl LI.   The ad features a cloaked secret society, talking up the health benefits associated to the fruit and is distributed through the association’s   brand Avocados from Mexico. This is the third year in a row that Avocados from Mexico is running a Super Bowl ad.   Mexico began exporting avocados to the United States 1997, three years after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed.
