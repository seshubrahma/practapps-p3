As to Kushner meeting on the Sabbath, the senior editor for standards, Greg Brock, notes that The Times offered similar explanations when Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was running for president.   Brock also said, "I can see why a reporter or editor might have included the reference to Kushner’s religion because it is the type of question another reader might very well ask: Why is Kushner attending meetings and not observing the Sabbath? I don’t know that the reference was necessary, but mentioning it seems legitimate.
