Trump tweeted that the court "kept us safe" from amnesty and in a statement said the issue is key in November’s election. " The election, and the Supreme Court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and, hence, a country. Clinton has pledged to expand Obama’s executive amnesty, hurting poor   and Hispanic workers by giving away their jobs and federal resources to illegal immigrant labor    while making us all less safe," he said.
