Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) plans to snub the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this year, and won’t show up at all, Breitbart News has learned exclusively. [CPAC is hosted by the American Conservative Union (ACU) in National Harbor, Maryland, just outside Washington, D. C. In 2016, the conference will be held right after Super Tuesday from March 2 until March 5.   That Rubio is skipping the   annual conservative gathering of thousands of activists in a presidential election year is extraordinarily telling about the direction of his campaign as the entire Washington establishment aligns behind him in a   desperate bid to stop billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump.
