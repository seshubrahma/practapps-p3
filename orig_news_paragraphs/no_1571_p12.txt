At the moment, that seems likely. Mrs. Clinton opened a large lead last week in national polls, with a handful showing her leading by double digits. Perhaps more significantly, new surveys indicate that she has staked out leads in states Mr. Trump most likely needs to win the White House, including Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan, and that she is also close or edging ahead in   states such as Georgia, where at least one poll has her ahead. Mrs. Clintonâ€™s advantage may ebb.
