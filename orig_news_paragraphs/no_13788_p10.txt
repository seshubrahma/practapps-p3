The Religious Test Clause forbids government agents from taking into account a person â€™s religion only when considering whether to appoint that person to serve in the federal government. Government actors remain free to consider religion for any other purpose, and voters can consider religion for anything at all, even for public office. Ironically, the only government officials who have violated the Religious Test Clause in modern times are Democrats, usually over judicial nominations.
