St. Louis Park Public Schools Superintendent Metz sent the late notice of the case of active TB to parents eight days after he announced he was resigning to become deputy director of a program called Building Assets, Reducing Risks that began at St. Louis Park High School. " The Building Assets, Reducing Risks position became a possibility after the center won a $20 million U. S. Department of Education grant to implement or expand the initiative in at least 116 schools nationally within the next five years," the Sun Sailor reported: The federal government has already helped fund expansions of the Building Assets, Reducing Risks program to dozens of schools. The new funding will help the program expand to 50 additional schools across five states, according to the U. S. Department of Education.
