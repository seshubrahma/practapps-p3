In one of its final and most significant acts, the House on Wednesday is set to pass the 21st Century Cures Act, an ambitious and pricey initiative that would deregulate some forms of drugs and medical devices and would fund President Obama’s cancer "moonshot," Alzheimer’s research, regenerative medicine and efforts to address opioid addiction. The agreement, reached between House and Senate negotiators over the Thanksgiving break, should be passed next month by the Senate. The legislation’s total funding for the National Institutes of Health is $4. 8 billion, a reduction from what the House sought last year. The bill, large as it is, is expected to pass with little debate and lots of lobbying fingerprints
