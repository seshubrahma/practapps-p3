President Donald Trump will appoint a Supreme Court Justice to "uphold the   liberties enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia," the new Vice President told the cheering crowd at the nationâ€™s March For Life. ["We are, all of us, endowed by our Creator, with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," Vice President Mike Pence declared Jan. 27.  "  years ago our Supreme Court turned away from the first of these timeless ideals," Pence said, referring to the right to life declared by the Founders of the United States 240 years ago in the Declaration of Independence. Pence, the first Vice President to attend the March, continued, "but today, three generations hence, because of all of you and the many thousands who stand with us in marches like this all across the nation, Life is winning again in America.
