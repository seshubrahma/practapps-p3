On the question of whether the tech CEOs are motivated by ideology versus a pragmatic concern for the bottom line, Bokhari said: "It’s hard to tell sometimes what’s really motivating them  …      but there are certainly cases where these companies have taken decisions that don’t seem to make any business sense. You can clearly see that from the case of Twitter, where they have been going after Conservative users and Trump supporters for the past few months. " "
