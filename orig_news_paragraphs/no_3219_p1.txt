As the opening paragraph of Politico’s article details, Buchanan is nothing short of a living legend whose keen insights into the populist nationalist movement predate Trump’s political ascendancy by decades:  His first date with his future wife was spent in a New Hampshire motel room drinking Wild Turkey into the wee hours with Hunter S. Thompson. He stood several feet away from Martin Luther King Jr. during the "I Have a Dream" speech. He went to China with Richard M. Nixon and walked away from Watergate unscathed. He survived   too, and sat alongside Ronald Reagan at the Reykjavík Summit.
