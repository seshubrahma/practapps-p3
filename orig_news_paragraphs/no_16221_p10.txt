The reason that people are crossing the border is shifting, said Donald Kerwin, director of the Center for Migration Studies of New York. Fewer people are coming to seek work and more people are seeking refuge from violence or because they are afraid for their lives, which could explain the increase in families and children being apprehended trying to cross the border illegally. We rate Obamaâ€™s claim as true based on the best metric we have to measure how many people may be crossing the border, even though it is far from perfect.   Thursday night, Trump warned that dangerous criminals from Central and South America have entered the United States illegally and are at large.
