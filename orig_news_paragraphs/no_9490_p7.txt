In Georgia, tea party activists are part of the Trump Leadership team. A survey I sent out to 350 Georgia tea party activists a few weeks ago found that Ted Cruz only had a   advantage over Donald Trump. In talking to activists nationwide, I would expect you would see the same results state after state. Ohio tea party leader Ralph King helped organize delegates for Mr. Trump in Ohio and found much support for Trump among tea party activists.
