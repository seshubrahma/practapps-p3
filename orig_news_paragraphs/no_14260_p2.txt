Refugee deal, The disagreement came as the two leaders discussed a deal, reached under the Obama administration, for the US to accept refugees from Australia who are living on islands in detention centers off the mainland due to strict government policies.   Many of them are from the seven countries affected by Trumpâ€™s travel ban. Trump on Friday also suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days, along with indefinitely suspending the entry of Syrian refugees. Sources say Trump insisted it was a very bad deal for the US to take 2, 000 refugees and that one of them was going to be the next Boston bomber.
