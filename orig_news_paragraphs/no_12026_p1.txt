The great thing about this project is that volunteers from anywhere in the United States can help     in these key swing states by simply signing up on our web site," Tea Party for Trump spokesperson Bill Hennessy said. Hennessy is the   of the St. Louis Tea Party, whose first rally at the Gateway Arch on February 27, 2009 attracted more than one thousand attendees and was part of the fifty similar rallies held around the country that day. Less than two months later on April 15, 2009, more than one million supporters attended Tax Day Tea Party rallies in more than 900 locations around the country, and the Tea Party movement was launched.
