The Russian test, coming as   Donald Trump prepares to enter the White House next month, could be seen as a provocative demonstration of Moscow’s capability in space. Russia has demonstrated the ability to launch   weapons in the past, including its Nudol missile. US military officials have expressed concerns about Russia’s burgeoning   arsenal, as the US has become increasingly dependent on satellites for both military and commercial uses. US officials believe Russia has also deployed what could be kamikaze satellites, known as "Kosmos 2499," which are designed to sidle up to American satellites and, if ordered, destroy or disable them.
