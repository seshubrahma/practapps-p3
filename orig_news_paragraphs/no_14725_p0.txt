 (CNN) The father, mother and three young children came to the United States with special immigration visas, granted because the father put himself in danger by working with American forces in Afghanistan, lawyers for the family said. They landed in Los Angeles on Thursday and planned to take a connecting flight to Seattle, where they would settle. But instead of rolling out the welcome mat, the federal government took them into custody, said Talia Inlender, a senior staff attorney for Public Counsel Law Firm.
