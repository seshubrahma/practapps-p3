When asked which issue was the most important to them, 46 percent of respondents pointed to the economy  —   encompassing jobs, taxes, and government spending   —   as the most important issue.   Meanwhile, 29 percent said that issues of national security and fighting radical Islam remained their number one issue, while 13 percent said that changing social attitudes on issues such as abortion, protecting the family, and religious freedom are their personal priority.   However, just 44 percent of respondents said that the country is now going in the right direction, while 47 per cent believe it remains on the wrong track.
