The Democratic Party has destroyed its chances for success by barring   candidates, according to a   author analyzing November’s election. [In an   in the online journal Paste earlier this month, Stephen Markley, who "believes in the autonomy of a woman’s body and her prerogative to do with it as she wishes," declares that Democrats have been shooting themselves in the foot by silencing   voices within the Party.   Markley says that while most liberals recognize that Democrats must reach out to working class whites whom they have alienated, they have ignored "the primary cultural issue that keeps most of those voters incapable of even contemplating anything but a Republican vote," namely abortion. Those who spend their time within the liberal bubble easily forget that "there are hordes of   voters who view abortion with the same moral urgency that Leonardo DiCaprio views climate change or Bernie Sanders views income inequality," Markley states.
