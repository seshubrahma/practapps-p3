Joseph Bermudez, an analyst for North Korean monitoring group 38 North, said preparations could even be seen on satellite images, which showed thousands of people and hundreds of vehicles practicing ahead of the event. Monday, hundreds of members of the Korean Peopleâ€™s Army (KPA) crowded the plaza of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang to pay tribute to past leaders and vow loyalty to Kim Jong Un, according to state media Rodong Sinmun. Kim Il Sung died in 1994 at the age of 82, after leading his country from its establishment in 1948 until his death.
