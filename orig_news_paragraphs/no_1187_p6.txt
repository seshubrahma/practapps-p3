Opponents of expansion questioned whether Kansas could afford it, expressed doubts about whether the federal government would continue to pay for most of it if the health care law eventually is repealed, and suggested the promised benefits to rural hospitals were overstated. Mr. Brownback vetoed the measure almost as soon as it reached his desk on Thursday, saying that the cost to the state would be "irresponsible and unsustainable," and that it would be "unwise" to expand Medicaid while President Trump and Congress were still vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He also said the bill was unacceptable because it did not include a work requirement for beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion. While the federal government has never allowed states to require that people have jobs in order to receive Medicaid, the Trump administration has hinted that it may.
