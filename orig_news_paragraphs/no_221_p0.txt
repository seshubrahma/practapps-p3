Donald J. Trump will become president of the United States after he says just 35 words: the oath of office. What is the oath, you may ask?   have taken the oath since the beginning of the republic. George Washington first said it in 1789, and the oath has been the centerpiece of presidential inaugurations ever since, symbolizing the continuity of democratic rule and the peaceful transition of power. The oath of office comes directly from Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution.
