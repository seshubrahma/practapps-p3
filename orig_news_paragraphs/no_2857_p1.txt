" Until we have a better reason to embrace and support the top of the ticket, and see an agenda that is truly an opportunity agenda, then we have lots of other options in which to invest and spend our time helping," she said in May. The DeVos family, heirs to the Amway fortune, has long been a leading source of money for Republicans in Michigan and beyond.
