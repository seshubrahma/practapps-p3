Breitbart News reported from that Nashville rally, where Cruz explained that Pastor Wiley, who now lives in Tennessee, had baptized his father, Rafael Cruz, when both lived in Texas in the 1970s: "Tennessee has a special place in my heart. Tennessee is now the home of the man who led my father to Jesus, Brother Gaylon Wiley. Brother Wiley is here," Cruz said as he brought Wiley on stage with him. Wiley asked the crowd to raise hands and lay a blessing on Cruz.
