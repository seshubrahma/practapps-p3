Sometimes in their hallucinations, people suffering DTDS see a similarity in the ways both men purse their lips and speak. Best remedy is to explain that Benito Mussolini was Hitler’s stooge and, to date, it is safe to say Donald Trump has never been anybody’s stooge. Another symptom has people his hysterics over how "vulgar" Donald Trump is and talking about how he lacks the virtue and morals to be president.
