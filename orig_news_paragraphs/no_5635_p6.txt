In the phone call, Trump and King Abdullah reportedly reaffirmed the need for U. S.  coordination in   operations generally, the effort to end the civil war in Syria, and the shared fight against the Islamic State, the White House said. During the presidential campaign Trump spoke out about the nuclear agreement with Iran that former President Barack Obama helped broker as a "terrible" deal and last month ordered a review of it. " Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror, through many platforms and methods," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement.
