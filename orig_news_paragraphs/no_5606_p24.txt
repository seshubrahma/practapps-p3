Meanwhile, those in the exact middle can look forward to another 33 years.   Those in the   have another 28 years, while those at the bottom have another 26 years.   So we can see the wide disparity â€”  a   gap of longevity between the top and the middle, and a   gap between the top and the very bottom.   (Statistics for women show the same      although women typically live a couple of years longer than men.)
