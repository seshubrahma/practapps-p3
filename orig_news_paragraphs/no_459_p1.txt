A soldier opened fire, hitting the attacker several times, but not before he slashed at one of the other soldiers, causing minor injuries. The Paris prosecutor, François Molins, said the attacker, who was 29 years old, was believed to be an Egyptian who arrived in France on Jan. 26 from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, on a visa he obtained last November. The intervention by soldiers from the 1er Régiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes, an airborne unit based in Pamiers, in southwestern France, "ended a terrorist attack and enabled the arrest of its perpetrator, who by all indications was very determined," Mr. Molins said. The assault took place on a stairway leading down to the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall that lies between the subway station closest to the museum and one of the museum’s entrances.
