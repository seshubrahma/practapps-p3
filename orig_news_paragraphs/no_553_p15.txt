The vetting process is designed to identify issues about fitness and confirmability prior to public announcement," said Leslie B. Kiernan, a former deputy White House counsel for President Obama and now a partner with the law firm Akin Gump. The confirmation hearing for Mr. Puzder, the billionaire restaurant   to head the Labor Department, was postponed several times because of a delay in filing his financial disclosure statement. Mr. Puzder’s hearing is now scheduled for Thursday after the ethics office on Wednesday cleared his financial disclosure statement and ethics agreement. In the agreement, Mr. Puzder said that if confirmed, he would divest himself of his holdings in CKE Restaurants, the operator of the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.   chains that he heads.
