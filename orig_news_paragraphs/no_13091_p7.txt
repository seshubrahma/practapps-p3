Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has yet to make an official statement or even comment on the   areas of Louisiana. Clinton tweeted days ago that she was "closely monitoring" the floods in the state, but has since not mentioned it at her campaign rallies. At least 13 residents have died due to the unprecedented flooding, with more than 20, 000 being rescued so far by law enforcement and emergency officials, Breitbart Texas reported. Trump is expected to visit the flooded areas of the state Friday.
