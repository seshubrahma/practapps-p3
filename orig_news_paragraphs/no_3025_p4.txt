Up to 254, 000 children a day eats breakfast at New York City schools, according to district officials. The move to replace several of the Kelloggâ€™s brands with the healthier choice comes on the heels of pressure from Congress, the state and some parents for schools to make better choices for school food programs. New York school officials also said that during the taste testing, kids chose the Back to the Roots brand over others. The district is still offering brands by the big cereal companies
