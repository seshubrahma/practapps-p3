This is a demonstration of the alliance’s resolve to defend all allies against any threat, and to enhance maritime security in the region," said a NATO official. While "Sea Shield" is not technically a NATO exercise according to officials, it will include a number of NATO countries, including Bulgaria, Canada, Greece, Romania, Spain, the USA and Turkey. American tanks and troops on Monday also took part in military drills in Zagan, Poland, sending a message to the Kremlin amid concerns that US President Donald Trump’s commitment to NATO allies and partners is wavering. Trump’s statements earlier this month that NATO is obsolete and that he wants to improve relations with a Russia that has been testing the borders of   War Europe have triggered alarm on the other side of the Atlantic.
