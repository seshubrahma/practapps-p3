I built a wall on the floor of the House of Representatives with a model that we built here to demonstrate how it can be done and I have spent my life in the construction business. I know how to build. Also, Iâ€™ve spent a fair amount of time on the border and I have personally been involved in detaining drug smugglers and unloading illegal drugs on that border.
