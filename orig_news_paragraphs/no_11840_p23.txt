That’s not to mention the vicious attacks he’s sustained from each of his GOP presidential rivals throughout this primary campaign, ranging from Cruz’s to Rubio’s to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s to Sen. Rand Paul’s to former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s to Sen. Lindsey Graham’s and more. He’s even survived vicious personal attacks from the former GOP nominee, 2012’s Mitt Romney, who’s lost both times he ran for president. It seems like everyone wants to stop Trump, except the actual voters who keep backing him over his rivals in contest after contest.
