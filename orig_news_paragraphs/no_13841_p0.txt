Talladega, Alabama (CNN) Students in the marching band of a historically black college in Alabama welcomed the announcement by the school’s president Thursday that they will participate in inauguration festivities for   Donald Trump. The decision follows several days of controversy after the Talladega College Marching Tornadoes initially accepted an invitation to perform on January 20, with critics saying the move amounts to support for Trump. He made comments during the presidential campaign that were widely viewed as disparaging to people of color and immigrants.
