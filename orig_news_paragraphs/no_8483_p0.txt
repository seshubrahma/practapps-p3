A Democratic congressman told MSNBC Monday that Israel and   Donald J. Trump are waging "war" with the government of the United States by rebuking President Barack Obama for failing to veto last Friday’s United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the Jewish state. ["They’re running their own war against us and our policies," said Rep. James McDermott ( ) who retires from Congress in January at the end of this session, after he was asked about charges made on multiple media outlets by Israel’s Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, that Obama had orchestrated Friday’s condemnation.   The Israelis, McDermott claimed, have been frustrated by the President’s reluctance to support their agenda fully: "Barack has pushed back and they are angry about it. "
