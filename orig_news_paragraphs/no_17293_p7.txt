It is possible the plane is too expensive, but how would Trump know? And if he did know, wouldnâ€™t it be better if he documented why the price was excessive rather than blasting the company via Twitter? It feels like Trump wants to show that he carries a big stick and he is willing to use it,  possibly in the subsequent phone call he had with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Do not get me wrong.
