He added: "People shouldn’t have to drop their cultures and traditions when they arrive in our cities and countries". The United Kingdom, and especially areas of East London which overwhelmingly voted for Mr. Khan, is currently suffering from Muslim ghettoisation, horrific employment rates for Muslim women, an internal debate surrounding the banning of the burka, and ongoing issues such as female genital mutilation,   and homophobia within Muslim communities. Under Mr. Khan’s plans, none of these "cultures and traditions" would need to be dropped for Muslim migrants to Western countries. According to VOA News, Mr. Khan called himself a "big fan" of Hillary Clinton, adding: "We play straight into the hands of those who seek to divide us, of extremists and terrorists around the world, when we imply that it’s not possible to hold Western values dear and to be a Muslim".
