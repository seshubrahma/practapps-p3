For many Russians, the assassination is likely to recall the   killing in Tehran of Aleksandr Griboyedov, a poet and diplomat who died after a mob stormed the Russian Embassy. That episode is remembered as the most severe insult to Russia’s diplomatic corps in the country’s history. More recently, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, now allied with Russia in Syria, kidnapped four Soviet diplomats in 1985, killing one and releasing three a month later. The United States, which has tangled bitterly with Russia over the Syrian conflict, quickly condemned the assassination in Ankara.
