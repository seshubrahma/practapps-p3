The closest anyone has come would appear to be the effort to create the State of Jefferson, which is still ongoing in parts of Northern California. The initial push came in the early 1940s, but was cut short by the bombing of Pearl Harbor, which united the state and the nation. More recently, several northern counties have seen efforts by residents to revive the Jefferson idea as a response to a   state government that seems completely out of touch with the needs of the inland and rural parts of the Golden State. However, there have also been spectacular failures, such as the "Six Californias" movement of 2015, which failed to qualify for the 2016 ballot and faced fierce opposition from state leaders (because they feared, among other reasons, it would help Republicans in the presidential election).
