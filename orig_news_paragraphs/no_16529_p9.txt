In a   administration, does anyone think human rights for all will remain a pillar of our foreign policy? Or that our embassies abroad will provide the same beacon of hope to local LGBTQ communities? Or that whomever Trump selects as his secretary of state or UN ambassador will go before the international community to fight against discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity?   Would Donald Trump stand up against hateful legislation in countries like Russia and Uganda when heâ€™s endorsed the ability of US states to legalize discrimination?
