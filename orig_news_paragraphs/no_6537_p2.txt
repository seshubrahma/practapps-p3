"  The processing of migrants at other CBP ports of entry and stations has been reduced to a "manageable level," Maier stated. The Tornillo station, located about 40 miles east of El Paso, will be placed in a "warm standby" status in the event it is needed to return to an operational status in the future. He stated basic maintenance, oversight, and   security will continue at the facility to make sure it is ready if the migrant crossings surge again. It is anticipated CBP could bring this facility, and the recently closed Donna facility, back into fully operational status within a   period if needed.
