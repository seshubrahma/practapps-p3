Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff and expert on delegates and convention rules, said a break from Trump by the delegates would be unprecedented. " The delegates are bound right now to nominate Donald Trump. They would have to unbind themselves, go through a process of changing the rules and go against the wishes of the voters," Shields said.
