But unlike Johnson, Lincoln had already sealed a preeminent reputation. As he was signing the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, Lincoln had confided to eyewitnesses at the scene: "If my name ever goes into history, it will be for this act."   And he was right. Black freedom, along with solidifying national authority and making the union permanent and powerful, would have stood as legacy achievements even if peacetime unity had unraveled during a second Lincoln administration.
