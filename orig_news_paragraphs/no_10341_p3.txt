At one point, the Clinton campaign compares Trump to Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckooâ€™s Nest, as well as bullies from Karate Kid and Teen Wolf. Clinton, the ad argues, is not a bully, and cares more about love and kindness. The ad concludes with footage of a question asked by a little girl about how Clinton plans to stand up to bullies.
