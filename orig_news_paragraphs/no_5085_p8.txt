DHS Secretary John Kelly directed the new policy change in a February 25, 2017 memo, where he said:  I direct the Director of ICE to immediately reallocate any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens (except as necessary to comply with a judicial order) to the new VOICE Office, and to immediately terminate the provision of such outreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens. Analysts estimate that roughly 11 million illegal aliens are living in the United States. Roughly 8 million of the illegals hold jobs, which adds up to one job for each of the four million young Americans who turn 18 each year. The illegals’ inclusion in the nation’s labor pool makes it harder for young Americans to get   jobs, and annually transfers roughly $500 billion from employees to employers, according to George Borjas, a Harvard professor.
