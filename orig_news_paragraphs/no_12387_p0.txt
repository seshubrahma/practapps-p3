Dr. Cornel West is refusing to fall in line behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, announcing his support for Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein despite his serving on the Democratic Platform Committee at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. [West is a former Harvard and Princeton professor and a leading progressive activist who previously endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.   I endorse Brother @BernieSanders because he is a   runner with integrity in the struggle for justice for over 50 years.   â€”   Cornel West (@CornelWest) August 25, 2015,
