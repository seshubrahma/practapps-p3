Ivanka Trump and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, collected about $195 million in income, according to a new financial snapshot of about 180 of the men and women serving in Donald Trump’s White House. Other Trump aides with lucrative histories include Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn, the former president of banking giant Goldman Sachs, who netted up to around $75 million in the previous year. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon made up to $2. 5 million. The newly released financial disclosure forms list the assets the Trump aides held when they walked in the doors of the White House in January    before administration counsel advised them to resign from various postings, divest certain holdings or recuse themselves from future decisions.
