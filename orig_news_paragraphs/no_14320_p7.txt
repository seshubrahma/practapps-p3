Inspired by the massive turnout of   activists at a town hall hosted by Rep. Mike Coffman,   Dahman said he believed people craved opportunities to tell their representatives       much as tea partiers did in 2009    and he wanted a way to empower them.   " I thought, ’ I wonder how many people feel the same way but didn’t know the event exists,’" Dahman said.
