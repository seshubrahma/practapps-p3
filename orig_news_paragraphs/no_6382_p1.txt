[Observers expect the Trump Cuba policy to roll back some of the measures former President Barack Obama put into place to allow more robust business cooperation with that countryâ€™s communist government.   Those rollbacks may include the reinstatement of some travel restrictions for U. S. citizens following a review by the National Security Council, multiple media outlets are reporting. " Trump is expected to use tough rhetoric against the Cuban government in calling for tightening rules for U. S. travel to the country," the Washington Examiner reported on Tuesday.
