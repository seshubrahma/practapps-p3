Instead, Democrats intend to focus on a sparer agenda of    priorities that can win support from both liberal and moderate officeholders   â€”   and appeal to voters just as much in red states as along the two coasts. Beyond that, they expect wide variance in how officeholders handle Mr. Trump and his agenda, from moderates who seek out accommodation to   leaders who pursue total war. Their emerging message is likely to focus on protecting Medicare and Social Security, attacking income inequality and political corruption, and blocking legislation that might restrict access to health care.
