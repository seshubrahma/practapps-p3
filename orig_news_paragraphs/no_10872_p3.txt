Ryan himself has yet to respond to Trump’s endorsement, which his team previously said he had not asked for when Trump refused to endorse him. Nehlen, despite Trump’s endorsement of Ryan, is still barnstorming the district over the final few days. On Saturday he is holding two rallies with conservative columnist Ann Coulter in Janesville and Kenosha and now has the support of Diamond and Silk, conservative black YouTube celebrities who have backed Trump. Nehlen has forced Ryan to   on the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, which he previously supported but now opposes, and has forced Ryan for the first time in over a decade to campaign and respond to criticisms in his district.
