" Mr. Manafort was advised last week that he should file the belated registration within 30 days to come into compliance with the law, according to a person with direct knowledge of conversations between Mr. Manafort’s lawyers and the Justice Department. One of Mr. Manafort’s recent loans, previously unreported, was for $3. 5 million in September from the private lending unit of Spruce Capital, a small New York investment firm that has a Ukrainian connection through the billionaire Alexander Rovt. An American citizen who made his fortune in the privatization of the fertilizer industry in   Ukraine and has long done business in that part of the world, Mr. Rovt is a financial backer of Spruce, whose   Joshua Crane has been a developer of Trump hotel projects.
