a visit from President Donald Trump. The President dropped in at about 10:30 p. m. ET, hours into the reception, which was being held at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster Township, New Jersey, according to someone who was in the room.   Guests were unaware that Trump, who stayed at the club this weekend, was stopping by until Secret Service agents came into the room minutes before his arrival to clear the way and make sure guests wouldnâ€™t surround him, the source said. Once he was there, Trump asked the names of the bride and groom and posed for photos.
