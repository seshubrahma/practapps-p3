Priebus has a healthy appreciation for gallows humor, which is not a bad thing for an R. N. C. chairman these days. " I haven’t started pouring Baileys in my cereal yet," he says often enough that it has become a signature line. I would regularly break the ice with something sarcastic, like asking Priebus how his party’s Hispanic outreach program was going on the morning after the committee’s head of Hispanic outreach resigned rather than work another day for Donald Trump’s election.
