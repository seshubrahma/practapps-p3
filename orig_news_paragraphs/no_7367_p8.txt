In July, a jihadist in France plowed a   truck down Niceâ€™s Promenade des Anglais and into a crowd assembled for a July 14 fireworks display, killing 86 and wounding more than 200. His victims include children. The carnage ended when police killed the armed truck driver, Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, after he drove onto a sidewalk for more than a mile. Bouhlel is believed to have been inspired by ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the attack.
