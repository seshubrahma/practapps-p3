It was a very narrowly drafted bill. You had to have a certain GPA, you had to live in the U. S. a long time, you had to graduate from a Florida high school. It was very narrowly tailored to   students who found themselves in a situation where they were brought here by their parents when they were 5, didn’t even speak another language except English and therefore couldn’t attend college because they were being charged like they were from out of state. They still had to pay for college but they paid for what people paid when they lived in Florida.
