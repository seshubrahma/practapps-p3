Mr. Trump also took aim at Mr. Cruz (a "smart guy, he was a little late to the plate, but that’s O. K. ") Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a rival in the primary ("he can be nasty, that Scott Walker") members of the "Never Trump" movement ( "they’re really right now on a respirator they’re pretty much gone") and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson (he mocked him for being late to donate promised money to outside groups supporting his candidacy). Such groups, like super PACs, need to be "straightened out," Mr. Trump said.
