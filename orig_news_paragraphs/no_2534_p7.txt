The transition team declined a request for comment on the memo. A person answering the phone in the State Department transition office directed inquiries to the public affairs office, which declined to confirm the memo ’s existence or to discuss information being sought. After a slow start, the transition team is accelerating its work to staff the State Department, sending memos requesting information from the rank and file on issues such as the department’s antiterrorism initiative, Countering Violent Extremism.
