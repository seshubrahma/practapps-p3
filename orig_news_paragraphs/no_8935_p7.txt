When Marlow asked if Democrats supporting a recount effort in certain states may have an impact in terms of putting another Clinton email investigation back on the table, Caddell said it should not. However, he also added, "I’m hoping that Donald Trump will allow Jeff Sessions as attorney general" to make the decision whether or not to go forward with a new investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. The topic came up while discussing the ramifications of Clinton’s support of Jill Stein’s recount efforts, which many see as an attempt to undermine the coming Trump presidency even before it gets started. Caddell said he understood the dynamics of the decision and that one would not want to be perceived as doing it simply to "persecute" a former political opponent.
