This was Steve House’s decision. He’s the one who is responsible for making the caucuses here in Colorado essentially meaningless, and preventing the tens of thousands of precinct caucus voters who did bother to show up even the chance to cast a vote for their choice for President. Massive disorganization at congressional district assemblies the day before. Misprinted ballots.
