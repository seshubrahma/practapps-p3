Of course, the Census Bureau’s numbers on income and poverty don’t add up to a perfect representation of families’ means. For one thing, they include only "money income"  —   excluding   government benefits like housing vouchers or food stamps.

The official poverty line, moreover, is assessed using a basket of necessities defined in the 1960s
