 (CNN) Michael Flynn, the man who holds the   record for the shortest tenure as national security adviser, continues to tarnish the reputation of the Trump administration even after his very public retirement from the position. The former   Army general was forced to resign by President Trump for allegedly lying to Vice President Pence about his discussions with the Russian ambassador.   In the latest development, the inspector general of the Department of Defense released documents responding to congressional subpoenas revealing that Flynn allegedly received payments from entities tied directly to foreign governments after his retirement from the military, without properly notifying and receiving permission from both the Defense and State Department.
