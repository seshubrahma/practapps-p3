—    Multiple survivors think the Orlando terrorist didn’t act alone. At least two survivors have said that the terrorist claimed there were snipers outside ready to shoot at police and was calling possible accomplices. One survivor tells CNN that there’s "no way" he acted alone and the terrorist said there were people outside holding the doors so some people couldn’t get out.
