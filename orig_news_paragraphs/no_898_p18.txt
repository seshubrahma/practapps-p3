In Germany, by contrast, there are complaints that the European Central Bank’s low interest rates penalize   savers, who earn almost no return on their nest eggs. The resentment has grown recently because of an increase in inflation. Consumer prices in Germany rose at an annual rate of 2. 1 percent in January, above the European Central Bank’s target of just under 2 percent. The inflation rate for the eurozone as a whole was 2 percent in February.
