The Detroit metropolitan area is home to over 150, 000 Chaldeans, according to Manna.   Since 2007, over 30, 000 Chaldean refugees have come into the area, fleeing violent conditions in Iraq.   The biggest wave of Chaldeans first settled in Detroit in the late 1960s, escaping the regime of Ahmad Hasan   and later Saddam Hussein, according to Manna. Detroit was a good fit for the community because of the job opportunities in the city and its proximity to Canada, where other Chaldean communities grew over the years, he said.
