The White House declined to respond to comedian Kathy Griffin for her widespread public meltdown after her decision to feature herself holding the bloody, decapitated head of President Donald Trump in a photo. ["The president, the first lady, and the Secret Service have all made it very clear their view on those thoughts," Spicer said in response to a question from Breitbart News, asking if the family wanted a personal apology from the comedian:   Melania Trump called the photo "very disturbing" and questioned Griffinâ€™s mental health. " When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
