Rubio’s team hasn’t released their numbers yet and hasn’t responded to a request from Breitbart News for where they’re at a    in fundraising or what they hauled in in the fourth quarter of the year. But in the third quarter of 2015, Rubio barely squeaked by, raising a paltry $6 million. As the supposed donor class candidate of 2016, publicly backed by multiple billionaires, $6 million in a quarter is troubling. If Rubio doesn’t significantly improve that total in his fourth quarter and year end numbers, he’s going to be a sitting duck walking into the early parts of 2016.
