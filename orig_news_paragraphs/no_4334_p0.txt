In an interview with sportscaster Jim Gray on Fox News Channel’s "The O’Reilly Factor," host Bill O’Reilly said the reason sports media hammers New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for his relationship with President Donald Trump is because sports media is mainly liberal.   " Brady’s a friend of Donald Trump’s   —   not an overt political guy, but I did see a bunch of articles saying Brady is the devil because he’s friends with Trump," O’Reilly said.
