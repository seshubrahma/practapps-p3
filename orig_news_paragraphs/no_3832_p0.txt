" [Bassem Barhoum, a columnist for Palestinian daily     expressed the importance of keeping the "resistance" movement alive. The   demonstrations that took place in the wake of the president’s inauguration were protests, he said, of the "savage capitalism and unprecedented greed that he represents, and to the dangers he could bring upon the world.
