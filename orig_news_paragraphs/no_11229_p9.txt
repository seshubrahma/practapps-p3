Variety reports a donation to the Clinton campaign is not required to enter the contest, although her campaign is requesting $10 donations in the Clooney letter. Those interested in meeting Clinton and her Hollywood friends can enter the contest by texting CLOONEY to 47246. Tickets to the event at Clooneyâ€™s Los Angeles home are priced at $33, 400 per person, with money going to the Hillary Victory Fund. The couple will also host a fundraiser for Clinton a day earlier, on Apr. 15, in San Francisco.
