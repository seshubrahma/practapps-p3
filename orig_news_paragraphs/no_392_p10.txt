The letter was apparently circulated through informal networks of diplomats and not through any State   email list. One diplomat on vacation in the United States said he received the letter from a colleague in another part of the world who was not connected to the drafters and was simply passing it along. The diplomat predicted that hundreds of other diplomats would be eager to sign it if they could, but because of the complications of figuring out where the dissent memo originally came from, he was not sure how many would actually sign it. Most people in the State Department have never seen anything like this, the diplomat said.
