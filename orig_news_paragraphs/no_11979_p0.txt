President Barack Obama criticized the Electoral College, calling it an outdated "vision" from America’s Founding Fathers. ["The Electoral College is a vestige, it’s a carryover from an earlier vision of how our federal government was going to work that put a lot of premium on states," President Obama said Friday during a press conference at the White House.   Obama, a former constitutional lawyer, listed the Electoral College as one of the "structures in our political system as envisioned by the Founders that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats. " "It used to be that the Senate was not elected directly, it was through state legislators," he added.
