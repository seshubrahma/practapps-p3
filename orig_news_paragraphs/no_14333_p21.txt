Trump may also be angry like a fox. His feuds with Hollywood, his refusal to play along with SNL and his jousts with the media and the Silicon Valley tech titans amount to more than a rejection of the pop culture that made him. He’s aligning himself exactly with the views of many of his supporters who disdain what they see as the elite’s political correctness and smugness. Even people who have worked for Trump admit he makes an odd blue collar hero, given his eponymous Manhattan tower dripping with gold leaf and his life once lived in the pages of New York gossip columns and his obsession with one particular spoil of pop culture    the cover of Time magazine.
