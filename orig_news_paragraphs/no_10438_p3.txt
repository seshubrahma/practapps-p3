Other than my boss at the time, Rep. Steve King,   I had to flatly admit that was true. How could he possibly hope to win, I asked? Everyone had counted him out of the Senate bid as well, he said, and he defeated the Establishment favorite and went on to victory in the fall in a bad GOP year. Republican moderates said every four years, "We need to nominate someone who can win"  —   and then when the party nominates their choice, they lose, over and over, Ford, Dole, McCain, Romney, because they don’t excite the base or draw in skeptical Independents and Democrats with a compelling vision.
