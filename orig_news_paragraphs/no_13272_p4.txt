The previous night’s protesting had seen internal squabbles between two groups of protesters. On one hand, the group Democracy Spring  —   which grew out of the Occupy Wall Street movement   —   wanted to maintain a peaceful protest, largely involving a citizens arrest. On the other hand, more angry socialist and anarchists factions were urging for direct, violent action, and rebuked Democracy Spring, saying they were accomplishing nothing.
