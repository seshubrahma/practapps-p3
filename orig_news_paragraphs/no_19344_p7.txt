’ "   Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby   Mook, highlighted the state’s   trends in a conference   call Friday. " ’    "We are seeing Asian American and Hispanic American turnout has   surpassed what it was in 2012. And when we step back and think   that Obama won Election Day in Nevada by 25, 000 votes, we   estimate that, with those that we’’ve banked from Latinos, from   Asian Americans, those suburban women, millennials, African   Americans, that Trump will probably need to win Election Day by   10 points at this point to overtake and win the state of Nevada,   which we think is a pretty high wall to climb for him," Mook   said.
