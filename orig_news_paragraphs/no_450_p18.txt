Mr. Shenker sued, and the Labor Department joined the case with the pension fund. In 1980, after a federal judge summarily dismissed the case halfway through the trial, Mr. Puzder presented the appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, arguing, in part, that the loan was promised before the new law took effect. In court filings, Labor Department lawyers described Mr. Puzder’s efforts as "a vigorous but futile attempt to backpedal, sidestep, and otherwise avoid the absolute barriers" of the pension protection act known as Erisa. The appellate judges denied Mr. Puzder’s appeal.
