The U. S. administration secretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme   resolution behind Israelâ€™s back which would be a tailwind for terror and boycotts and effectively make the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory. " The White House bristled at the attack, denying that it was behind the resolution but defending the decision to abstain rather than veto it as consistent with longstanding, bipartisan American opposition to Israeli settlement construction as an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. The Israeli statement was "full of inaccuracies and falsehoods," Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, told reporters on a conference call.
