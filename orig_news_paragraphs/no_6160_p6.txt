In an essay published three days after Trump defeated Clinton, actress Lena Dunham said she found it "painful" that white women had been unable to see past their "violent privilege" to vote for the Democratic candidate. " Itâ€™s painful to know that white women, so unable to see the unity of female identity, so unable to look past their violent privilege, and so inoculated with hate for themselves, showed up to the polls for him," Dunham wrote. Talk show host Chelsea Handler also criticized female Trump voters in an essay published in December.
