The move to conclude de Blasio parallel criminal probes came just days after Preet Bharara, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was fired by President Trump. Bharara led the   investigation into the mayor fundraising after a lead investigator at the state Board of Elections asked prosecutors to investigate whether de Blasio broke the law by funneling campaign contributions to Democratic state Senate candidates through state committee groups to evade donation contribution limits. Just last month, de Blasio met with Bharara voluntary for four hours regarding the probe. The meeting was considered to be the final step in determining whether or not charges would be brought.
