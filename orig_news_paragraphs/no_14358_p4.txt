We also have a tradition of valuing choice in our health care system. That means that rather than having health care decisions dictated solely by the government, most Americans still have the final say over decisions about the care they receive.

The federal government doesnâ€™t impose price controls or engage in direct negotiations over price on most health care products and services.
