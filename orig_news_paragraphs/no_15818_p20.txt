Vice President Mike Pence signed the country’s first state religious freedom bill into law in Indiana during his governorship in 2015. Evan Wolfson, who founded Freedom to Marry, an organization often credited for   marriage victories on state and federal levels, said the legislation stems from the same "  industry" as in the past, adding that the political and legal landscapes have changed since the Supreme Court guaranteed   marriage equality in 2015. " There’s no question there’s a lot of things to be afraid of," he said.
