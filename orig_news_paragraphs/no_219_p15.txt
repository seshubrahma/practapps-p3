Another group of documents produced in discovery from that lawsuit, first provided by the A. C. L. U. to The Washington Post, showed that in   about a year after the agency hired the two contract psychologists, James Mitchell and J. Bruce Jessen, to design a torture regimen for Mr. Zubaydah, unidentified C. I. A. employees raised sharp questions about their ethics and competence to judge whether the techniques they had orchestrated were harmful or effective. While other documents, including the Senate report summary, have shown that there were internal concerns about relying so heavily on the two psychologists, the newly available documents add texture to that history. For example, a June 2003 message that appears to have been sent by an official representing a "Renditions and Detainees Group" at the C. I. A. which had assumed control of Mr. Mitchell’s and Mr. Jessen’s activities, criticized the psychologists’ "arrogance and narcissism" and "blatant disregard for the ethics shared by almost all of their colleagues.
