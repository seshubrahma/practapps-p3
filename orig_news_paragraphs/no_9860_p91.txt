the 23 year old Pakistani citizen presently held in custody denies involvement. Although he did not say the arrested man was the wrong suspect, the prosecutor remarked: "We donâ€™t have anybody claiming responsibility so we are not 100% sure over the background at this stage. " Investigations are ongoing, and we are coopering with the Federal Investigation Bureau [BKA] and Berlin, we are carrying out investigations, looking at the lorry, gathering witness statements, and analysing them.
