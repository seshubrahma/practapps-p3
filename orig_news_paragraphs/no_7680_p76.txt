Clinton Foundation reportedly will not release donors who donate to Bill Clinton’s birthday bash: Actually, @ClintonFdn now telling me they WILL NOT release names of donors who gave   this bash, contra @DonnaShalala suggestion.     —   Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) September 15, 2016,   Instead, @ClintonFdn after end of Oct. will disclose all donors who gave in 3rd Q, so it’ll be impossible to know who gave for this bash    —   Kenneth P.
