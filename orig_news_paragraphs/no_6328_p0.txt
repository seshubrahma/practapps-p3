House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) refused Sunday to condemn a sexist joke by a Democratic House colleague about Kellyanne Conway, President Donald Trump’s campaign manager and White House counselor. [Pelosi, appearing on CNN’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper, cited the Access Hollywood video that emerged during the presidential campaign last October as a reason for her refusal. That video, filmed in 2005, recorded Trump making crude comments about women in a hot mic,   conversation with host Billy Bush.   Rep. Cedric Richmond ( ) had joked that Conway looked "familiar in that position" when a photograph emerged of her on her knees on a couch in the Oval Office.
