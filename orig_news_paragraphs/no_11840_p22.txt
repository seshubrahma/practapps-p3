Trump, meanwhile, has battled with the governments of Mexico, China, Canada, and many other foreign leaders who have been trying to stop his election to the presidency here. He’s fought with the Pope over immigration and Christianity. He’s battled with the most powerful criminals in the world, the Mexican drug cartels, and Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman has put a bounty on his head. That’s not to mention the vicious attacks he’s sustained from each of his GOP presidential rivals throughout this primary campaign, ranging from Cruz’s to Rubio’s to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s to Sen. Rand Paul’s to former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s to Sen. Lindsey Graham’s and more.
