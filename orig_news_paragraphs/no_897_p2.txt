The Rangers’ presence became apparent last weekend when they were seen driving around the northern Syrian town of Manbij in Stryker vehicles and armored Humvees. The Washington Post earlier reported the deployment of the Marine artillery battery. " We are preparing logistical and fire support to enable a successful assault on Raqqa, the   capital of ISIS," said Col. John L. Dorrian, a spokesman for the   command that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
