  Donald Trump is planning a victory tour to states that voted for him, including swing states that supported a Republican for president for the first time in decades. ["We’re working on a victory tour now. It will happen in the next couple of weeks," Trump’a advance team director, George Gigicos, confirmed to reporters at Trump Tower on Friday.   The tour will take place after Thanksgiving, according to Gigicos, but it remains unclear exactly what Trump has planned.
