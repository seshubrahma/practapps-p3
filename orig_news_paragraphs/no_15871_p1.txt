Gillespie’s tight victory over Prince William County Board of Supervisors chair Corey Stewart came as a major surprise. Observers initially expected it to be an easy win for Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. Frank Wagner, a senator in the commonwealth’s legislature, trailed in third place. Meanwhile, Northam’s win capped off fierce competition on the Democratic side, where he faced off against former congressman Tom Perriello.
