On the day before the champion New England Patriots visited the White House to celebrate their winning Super Bowl game, Politico published a hit piece smearing the team as representatives of the racist, white nationalist " " movement. [For Politico, author Ben Strauss began his April 18 piece engaging in a bit of guilt by association, by noting that now notorious   leader Richard Spencer tweeted a message saying "rooting for the Pats!" According to Strauss, Spencer was drawn to the team because of the team’s white quarterback who threw to a trio of white wide receivers.   Strauss also attacked the Patriots for being President Donald Trump’s favorite team, as if taking for granted that anything Trump likes must therefore be racist and evil.
