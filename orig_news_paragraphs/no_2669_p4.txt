Facing a vacuum, several Republicans who have long opposed Mr. Trump have already stepped forward to help shore up the party’s embattled majorities. Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee and a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, has laid out plans to campaign more publicly for Republican Senate candidates in the coming weeks, according to two people familiar with his plans, which were confirmed by an aide. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, another Trump foe who has already hit the trail for congressional candidates, plans to campaign soon for Senator John McCain in Arizona and for Joe Heck, the party’s Senate nominee in Nevada, according to John Weaver, Mr. Kasich’s top political adviser. But with no overarching strategy yet in place for abandoning their nominee, Republicans beat a ragged and improvised retreat from Mr. Trump, pulling endorsements here and scolding him there, and preparing to flee more visibly in the event of another disastrous debate on Sunday night.
