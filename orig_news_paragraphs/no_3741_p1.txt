Coverage of the riots spread across the world, as people watched on in horror at a university known for its heritage of free speech being taken over by political thugs. In an email to students, UC Berkeley chancellor Nicholas Dirks said that the university "condemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of individuals who invaded the campus, infiltrated a crowd of peaceful students, and used violent tactics to close down the event. We deeply regret that the violence unleashed by this group undermined the First Amendment rights of the speaker as well as those who came to lawfully assemble and protest his presence. "
