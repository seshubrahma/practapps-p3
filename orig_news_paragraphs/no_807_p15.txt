The Congressional Budget Office has not completed an estimate of the cost of the repeal bill or its effects on coverage, and Republicans are still trying to narrow their differences on issues like Medicaid and tax credits to help people buy insurance. But, as of Thursday, they were determined to move ahead. " We are going to mark up the legislation next week," said Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, after a   meeting of House Republicans.
