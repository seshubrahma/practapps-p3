It’s a tumultuous time in the presidential race. A judge’s ruling ensured that questions about Hillary Clinton’s email while she was secretary of state will continue to shadow her. Bill Clinton announced that, if Mrs. Clinton wins in November, the Clinton Foundation will cease accepting the large foreign donations that have long powered its philanthropy  —   and raised questions about governmental favoritism. A series of celebrities appear with or hold   to help Mrs. Clinton’s bid this week, including Cher today, Leonardo DiCaprio on Tuesday and the Apple C. E. O. Tim Cook on Wednesday.
