John Kerry, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with the leader of the North Korean delegation, Ri Yong Ho, who at the time was the country’s representative to the "  talks" with the US, South Korea, China and Russia over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Ri is now North Korea’s foreign minister. The Obama administration did not approve visas for future talks, however, after the North Korea continued to provoke the US with nuclear and missile tests. The group of Americans planning to take part in next week’s talks included former US Ambassador to China Winston Lord, Robert Gallucci, who served as a negotiator with North Korea under President Bill Clinton, and Victor Cha, a top Asia adviser to President George W. Bush.
