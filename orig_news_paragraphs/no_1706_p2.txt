Mr. Adelson also gave $1. 5 million in August to a super PAC backing Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire. Mr. Trump is already raising far less money directly for his campaign than Mrs. Clinton is raising for hers, taking in $42 million in August compared with her $59 million. Now he is also heading toward Nov. 8 with relatively limited financial help from super PACs and outside groups that can accept unlimited contributions from rich donors. Groups supporting Mr. Trump have aired just $12 million in broadcast advertising, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group.
