From its     perch, the radar can track moving vehicles low,   aircraft and smaller potential targets such as people, said Lt. Col. William B. Hartman, 39, of Irvine, Calif. the Joint Stars squadron commander. The operators on board can change the filters on their systems to show   targets or their direction of travel in different colors, all of which is relayed back to operations centers in Baghdad and Erbil, in northern Iraq, he said. Flying from a base in the Persian Gulf, a typical Joint Stars mission over Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan can last about 11 or 12 hours.
