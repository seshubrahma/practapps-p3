Rand Hoch, a gay activist who founded the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council in 1988, recalled bringing dates to    on two occasions. Both times, he said, Mr. Trump, who loves to play the role of greeter as guests arrive at his club, was pleasant and approached the two for chitchat. " He treated us no differently than everyone else who was going through that door," Mr. Hoch said, adding that it was not possible that Mr. Trump was unaware they were gay.
