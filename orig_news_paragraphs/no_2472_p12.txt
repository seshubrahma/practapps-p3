Lithuania last week chose a new prime minister, who renewed the nation’s promise to raise security spending. In the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte has feuded with President Obama, the government has tried to gain favor in Mr. Trump’s Washington. Mr. Duterte named as his new trade envoy to the United States Jose E. B. Antonio, a real estate tycoon who is helping build Trump Tower Manila. After Britain rebuffed Mr. Trump’s suggestion to name Nigel Farage, a leader of the "Brexit" campaign to leave the European Union, as ambassador to the United States, The Times of London reported that Mr. Farage may move to America anyway.
