He told Mr. Christie’s deputy chief of staff, Bill Stepien, who was keeping track of endorsements and would go on to run Mr. Christie’s   campaign. He told Bridget Anne Kelly, who replaced Mr. Stepien in Mr. Christie’s office, and is now on trial with Mr. Baroni on charges that they conspired to close the lanes to punish the mayor for not endorsing Mr. Christie, and then covered it up. And when Mr. Wildstein, Ms. Kelly and Mr. Baroni had finally decided to act on the plot and had concocted a story that it had to be done as part of traffic study, Mr. Wildstein testified that he also told a Port Authority commissioner who was seen as "a member of the Christie team," who "understood" the need to hurt the mayor. Mr. Wildstein, the admitted mastermind of the plot who has pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his role in the scheme, is the prosecution’s star witness.
