How did they end up there?   Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) was launched in 2013 after a previous relaxation of immigration policies resulted in a surge of the number of people arriving by boat from 161 in 2008 to 2, 726 in 2009.   Even that higher figure is a tiny percentage of overall immigration to Australia. During the   financial year, around 190, 000 people were granted residency visas, while nearly 400, 000 people were granted temporary student or skilled work visas.
