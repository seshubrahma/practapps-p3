On Friday, Robart said he would like to hear from the government on next steps in light of the Ninth Circuit’s ruling. Robart has ordered the Justice Department and the states to submit a joint status report by 3 a. m. ET Monday that sets forth a plan moving forward while the appeal is pending the Ninth Circuit. The court will then hold a conference call with the parties at 2 p. m. ET Monday.
