Having to sue to get a document that was leaked to the New York Times is a scandal. The memo should be released forthwith, and, frankly, the president can and should order its immediate release. The lawsuit was only one of several significant actions we took this week. Yesterday, we sent acting FBI Director Andrew G. McCabe a letter reminding him about the FBI’s legal obligation under the Federal Records Act (FRA) to recover records removed from the agency, including Comey’s memos, apparently taken by Comey when he left the FBI and subsequently leaked them to the media.
