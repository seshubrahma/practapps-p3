The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the Presidentâ€™s request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a    conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in   investigations. (He did so two weeks later.)
