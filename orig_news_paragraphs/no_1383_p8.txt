Cohen’s also remodeled its flagship store, outfitting it with subway tiles and making it look like the kind of place a recent graduate of a   liberal arts college might come to shop. Recently, I sat down with Bob Cohen, who runs Cohen’s, at Katz’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side. The place was packed at lunchtime and has thrived by not changing anything, not recalibrating, not making vegan pastrami. In the 1970s, the neighborhood was excluded from laws that kept many stores closed on Sundays, and Cohen’s made the most of it.
