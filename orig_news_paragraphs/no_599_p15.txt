After being stopped by the immigration authorities, some detainees have come to learn that they may be eligible for asylum, either through word of mouth from other detainees or during screenings with immigration officials. " Many come here not knowing that the experiences they’ve had fit perfectly with asylum," said Javier Martínez Hernández, a lawyer at Casa del Migrante, which helped more than 100 migrants apply for refugee status in 2016, more than double the number in 2015. If the current trends continue, United Nations officials predict, Mexico could receive more than 20, 000 asylum claims this year.
