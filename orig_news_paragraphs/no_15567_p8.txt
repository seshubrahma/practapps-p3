The US has applied sanctions on Russia since 2014 for its actions in Ukraine. Flynnâ€™s calls with Kislyak in December have received the most attention, but his relationship with the Russian ambassador goes back four years. He first met Kislyak in June 2013 during an official trip to Russia, according to The Washington Post. He led the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time and met his counterparts at the Russian military intelligence agency known as the GRU.
