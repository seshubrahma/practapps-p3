Dickerson now turns to Cruz about whether Obama should nominate Scalia’s replacement. Cruz calls Scalia a "legal giant" who was someone who was "faithful to the Constitution" and "changed the arc" of legal history. Cruz says "we are one Justice away" from striking down abortion restriction, striking down Heller, undermining religious liberties. He says the Senate needs to stand strong against Obama’s potential nomination.
