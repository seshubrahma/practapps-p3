The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reviews a district court’s preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, a limited and deferential standard.   That standard means that if the District Court identified and applied the correct legal rule, the appeals court will reverse only if the court’s factual findings were illogical, implausible or without support based on the facts in the record.    So on the one hand, the appeals court as a rule defers to the lower court. On the other hand, where the written opinion is sparse on identifying legal rules or factual findings, the 9th Circuit might not have much to defer to.
