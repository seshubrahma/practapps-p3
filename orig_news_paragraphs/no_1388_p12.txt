The divergent fortunes of state and national Democrats go beyond voter registration. California Democrats have a bench of younger candidates waiting to step up as its older leaders  —   Mr. Brown, 78 and Senators Barbara L. Boxer, 75 and Dianne Feinstein, 82   —   approach retirement. By contrast, the choice of Mrs. Clinton, 68, and Mr. Sanders, 74, is a reminder of the absence of fresh players prepared to take the national field.
