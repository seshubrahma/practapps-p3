—   which the president himself has called the Winter White House   —   has doubled to $200, 000, after membership applications surged in the wake of Mr. Trump’s election, the head of membership there said. Bernd Lembcke, the managing director at the Palm Beach, Fla. club, said the change in the initiation fee had been planned last fall, before the election, and that $200, 000 had been the fee before 2010, when it was cut in half because of the recession. But Mr. Lembcke, who has been at the club for 21 years, said that it also reflected the upswing in   ’s popularity.
