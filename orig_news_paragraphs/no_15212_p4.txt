If our use of violence seems indiscriminate    even as the result of our terrorist adversaries’ manipulation of images and planting of false information    then our ability to accomplish our counterterrorism objectives suffers. These lessons now seem forgotten, and a new, worrying approach has crystallized, especially since the Trump administration fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian government airfield. Put aside whether the strike was a good or bad idea. At its best, our country’s decision to use violence against another state to uphold international norms barring the use of chemical weapons was a chance to show the world how violence can be used for the legitimate pursuit of political ends    and thus to draw a contrast with the Syrian regime’s illegitimate use of violence.
