Vice President and former Senator Joe Biden (turning 78 by 2020) and bitter 2016 loser Hillary Clinton (who will be 73 by 2020). Currently the record for the oldest president on inauguration day is held by the nearly    Ronald Reagan, but in a few weeks Donald Trump will beat Reagan’s age record by nearly a year when he takes the oath of office at age 70 years and 220 days to Reagan’s 69 years and 349 days. Of course, far left social justice warrior and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who will be 71 by 2020, heads the list   —   just as she sent the hopes of many liberals soaring in 2015, until she firmly shut the door on a run for president in 2016.
