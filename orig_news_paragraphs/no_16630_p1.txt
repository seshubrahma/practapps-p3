I am pleased to enclose a letter from my immigration attorney which states that, with 100% certainty, I correctly went through the legal process when arriving in the USA," Trump wrote in a post on Twitter, with a photo of the attorney’s letter attached.   Michael J. Wildes, Trump’s lawyer who signed the letter from the firm Wildes  Weinberg, wrote, "It has been suggested by various media outlets that in 1995, Mrs. Trump illegally worked as a model in the United States while on a visitor visa. Following a review of her relevant immigration paperwork, I can unequivocally state that these allegations are not supported by the record, and are therefore completely without merit. "
