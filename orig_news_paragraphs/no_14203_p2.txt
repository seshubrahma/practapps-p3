Thanks to our conversations between cases I’ve learned about different medical systems and different approaches to managing the same conditions, and I’ve enjoyed their camaraderie.   Today I work at one of the top rehabilitation hospitals in the country, and on our wards I’ve recently had the pleasure of overseeing a resident physician from Iran who’s doing her rehabilitation specialty training through Emory University School of Medicine. She holds an   visa, the kind our government grants to the highly skilled workers our economy needs. Under President Trump’s new order, even after the interventions of two federal courts, if she left the country for any reason, such as going to visit family, she might be locked out from returning.
