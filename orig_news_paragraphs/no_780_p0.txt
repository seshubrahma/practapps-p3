WASHINGTON   —    Facing a fierce backlash after she called historically black colleges and universities "real pioneers" of school choice, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, spent Tuesday afternoon backtracking on the controversial statement and highlighting the institutions’ roots in racism and segregation. Ms. DeVos, in a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday and in remarks at a luncheon with presidents from some of the schools, repeatedly acknowledged that the schools were not created simply to give   students more choices but because black students across the country were not allowed into segregated white schools.
