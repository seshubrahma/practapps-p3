The Kremlin thought that forging an alliance with the West on Syria would render illogical the idea of maintaining the economic sanctions. Mr. Trump, during his campaign, seemed to champion the idea, as well, questioning the need for sanctions, suggesting that Crimea probably did belong to Russia and repeatedly praising Mr. Putin as a strong leader. He endorsed the idea that the two countries together fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS. While that raised suspicions in the United States of collusion, it was welcomed in Russia as a new dawn in relations.
