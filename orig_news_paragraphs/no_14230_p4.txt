Hameed Khalid Darweesh worked with the American government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. Another Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for an American contractor in Iraq, and son, 7, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees.   The two men were detained Saturday at John F. Kennedy International Airport, setting off a large protest.   The ACLU and other groups filed a   lawsuit    the first to challenge Trumpâ€™s executive order on immigration    on behalf of the men.
