A former Louisiana state representative, Duke has waged many political campaigns, including a run for governor of the state in 1991 and for Congress in 1999. Duke was thrust into the 2016 spotlight given his embrace of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. Trump initially declined earlier this year to distance himself from white supremacists like Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard. The billionaire later said he disavowed Dukeâ€™s support.
