An opposition motion called on Prime Minister Theresa May to reveal her strategy for leaving the European Union. In return, Ms. May asked that lawmakers approve the beginning of talks, in late March. Michel Barnier, one of the E. U.’s lead negotiators, took a hard line against Britain’s plans to retain some advantages after leaving. He also said a deal needed to be reached within 18 months of the start of talks.
