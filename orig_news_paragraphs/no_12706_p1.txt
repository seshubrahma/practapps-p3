Trump has a big stake in the show and conceived of it with Mark Burnett," Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement to Variety Thursday.   "Additional details regarding his business interests will be shared December 15th," Hicks added. Trumpâ€™s return to the   show he had hosted since 2004 was no longer an option following his historic presidential election victory on November 8. Instead, earlier this year, the network announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger had been tapped to take over hosting duties.
