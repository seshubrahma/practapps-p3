To his left, a    set of interlocking fences slices into the distance, this one 12 feet high, this one 18 feet high, this one a metal mesh, this one a vertical grille, section after section after section. Mr. Ladd, 61, looks and acts the way a rancher is expected to, with brush mustache, hard squint and    affect, all kept tight under a   cowboy hat. Bouncing westward, he points to spots where fencing had been peeled in the past like an upturned can of Spam. In the last four years, he says, more than 50 vehicles have rumbled through fence cuts and across his property.
