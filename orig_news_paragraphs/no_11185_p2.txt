From the NYT: This effort is highly unusual in its scale. Although law firms often donate time to individual causes, and some firms have worked on gun control on a piecemeal basis, the number and the prominence of the firms involved in the new coalition are   for   big law. [And] other firms are expected to join [the effort] in coming months. The article likens law firms’ efforts to litigate guns with efforts to litigate segregation during JFK’s presidency.
