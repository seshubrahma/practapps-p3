And "Snow Beach," a new book, chronicles the style of snowboarding culture in the 1980s and 90s. Artists, art collectors, curators and the scenesters who surround them are in Miami this week for Art Basel Miami Beach. It’s a spinoff of the fair held in Switzerland. (There’s also a Hong Kong version).
