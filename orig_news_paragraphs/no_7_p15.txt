Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of Indiaâ€™s ossified and bureaucratic economy.

If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane.
