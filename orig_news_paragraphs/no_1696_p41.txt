During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Mr. Trump built a number of New York projects without taxpayer subsidies. But he continued to chase benefits, large  â€”   and small. For instance, he sought, and received, a tax abatement worth $48, 000 for the conversion of a condominium tower called Trump Parc East under Mr. Giuliani. And after the Sept. 11 attacks, he obtained a $150, 000 grant for 40 Wall Street, an office tower eight blocks from ground zero, through a   recovery program.
