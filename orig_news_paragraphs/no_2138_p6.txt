On Wednesday, the company said in a statement that it would be creating or bringing back jobs in a variety of departments, including customer care and sales, and that all would be added by the end of its 2017 fiscal year. It was not clear where in the country those jobs would be. " We are excited to work with   Trump and his administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U. S.," said Marcelo Claure, Sprintâ€™s chief executive.
