 (CNN) President Donald Trump released a   financial disclosure form Friday, detailing the broad outlines of his wealth but still leaving a number of unanswered questions about the specifics of not only Trump’s income but also the details of his vast holdings. In short, Trump’s financial disclosure is nice. His tax returns    which he became the first presidential candidate in four decades to refuse to release    would be far better.
