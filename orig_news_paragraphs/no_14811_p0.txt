Washington (CNN) White House adviser Kellyanne Conway is denying she suggested there was wider surveillance of President Donald Trump during the campaign, telling CNN Monday that her comments in a recent interview were taken out of context. Sunday night, Conway appeared to expand Trumpâ€™s allegations that the Obama administration wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower    a claim for which the President has not yet provided evidence    when she told the Bergen Record there could have been even wider spying on the Trump campaign, including the use of microwaves and television sets.   She did not provide any evidence for the claims.
