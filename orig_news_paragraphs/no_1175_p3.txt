But under current Senate rules, ending debate or a filibuster over a Supreme Court nominee  —   called a cloture vote   —   requires a   majority. Eight Democrats would need to vote for cloture to end debate over Judge Gorsuch and bring his nomination to a straight    vote. The Senate has moved to invoke cloture only four times in history for Supreme Court nominations, most recently for Justice Alito’s confirmation in 2006, when it voted   to end debate.
