Well, first of all, people have voted for me overwhelmingly in the Democratic primary process. and that is absolutely clear, and very different from where we were in 2008. I could make the case, which I did, that I was actually slightly ahead in the popular vote when we ended that primary, but i was behind in the pledged delegates. Itâ€™s also fair to say that i have been vetted and tested, and I think that that puts me in a very strong position.
