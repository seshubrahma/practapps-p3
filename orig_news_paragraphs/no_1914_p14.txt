Canada’s national carbon pricing system, set to go into force by 2019, allows its provinces to mix    programs and carbon taxes. With Congress unwilling to pass either a carbon tax or a    program, President Obama pushed for climate change regulations to limit carbon emissions while encouraging states to create their own    programs to comply. Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese, campaigned on a promise to dismantle the Obama administration’s climate rules and put coal miners back to work. But since he was elected, he has not commented publicly on his climate plans.
