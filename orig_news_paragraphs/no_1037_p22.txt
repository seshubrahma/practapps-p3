So says a lawyer for an Army veteran, Elliott Williams, who died in an Oklahoma jail cell in 2011. A jury awarded his family $10. 5 million this week. Immobilized by a broken neck, Mr. Williams, 37, spent his last days lying on the floor of his cell, unable to reach the food and water placed nearby by guards who did not believe his claim that he was injured. The cellâ€™s video monitor captured 51 hours of his suffering and death.
