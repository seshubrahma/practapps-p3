But Comey is expected to abstain from discussing the ongoing federal Russia investigation, a Senate intelligence committee source told CNN. The broad boundaries, relayed by Comey to Burr and Vice Chairman Mark Warner last week, comes after Comey’s discussions with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the agency’s probe into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said Monday he has not yet spoken to Mueller about Comey’s expected testimony. He added he does not think he needs to talk to Mueller before Comey’s hearing but he does expect to.
