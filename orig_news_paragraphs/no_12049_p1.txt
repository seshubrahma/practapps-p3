Baker County, the fifth county in the First Coast region, doesnâ€™t put its vote totals online.   All told, First Coast registered Republicans sent in 20, 000 more absentee ballots and cast 28, 000 more early votes than Democrats in those five counties. WOKV notes that while Duval County has around 20, 000 more registered Republicans than Democrats, the other four counties have thousands more registered Republicans. When looking at Florida as a whole, the Tampa Bay Times reports that Democrats are lagging behind: Four years ago, Democrats led by about 13, 000 in ballots cast at this point, whereas today Republicans lead by nearly 9, 000 votes.
