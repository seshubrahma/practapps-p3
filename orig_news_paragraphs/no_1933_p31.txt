A handwritten poem scrawled by Anne Frank in a friend’s notebook is up for sale in the Netherlands today. Bubb Kuyper Auctions, based in Haarlem, expects to sell the rare item for between 30, 000 and 50, 000 euros. Anne penned the short poem in a notebook belonging to her friend Jacqueline van Maarsen’s older sister, Christiane. The work is dated March 1942, just a few months before Anne and her family went into hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam.
