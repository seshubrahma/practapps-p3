Russiaâ€™s presence in the region also adds to what is already a tense situation. North Korea fired a   missile Wednesday, seen as a message of warning to the U. S. and South Korea. The missile reportedly exploded within seconds of launch. Earlier this week, North Korea released a video showing a simulated attack on the Vinson as well as a U. S.   Lancer, accompanied by bellicose language.
