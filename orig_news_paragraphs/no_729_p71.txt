Minn. • The Delivery Driver By Jaime Lowe Stuart Culver starts his overnight shift for O’Reilly Auto Parts at 7 p. m. and finishes about nine hours later. A relay driver, he exchanges freight   —   mufflers, batteries, drums of   fluid   —   with another driver in La Crosse, Wis. and then makes deliveries to five stores on his route.
