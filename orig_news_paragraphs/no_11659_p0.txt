Reuters reports that Roger Stone, a Republican strategist and Donald Trump supporter, is putting together a group of women to campaign against Hillary Clinton, should the former Secretary of State win the Democrat nomination. The political action committee, originally created last year with the name Women Against Hillary, is now called the Rape Accountability Project for Education PAC, or RAPE PAC.   Kathleen Willey, a Democrat who once volunteered in Bill Clintonâ€™s White House, is in talks to be the national spokesperson for the Stone group. Willey claims that in 1993, in the Oval Office, Bill Clinton pinned her to a wall and groped her.
