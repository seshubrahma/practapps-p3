The dramatic and   announcement put to an end a flurry of speculation on Wednesday about whether the Republican health care bill would come up on the House floor for a vote    or collapse one more time in another embarrassment.   An   deal announced earlier in the day renewed momentum as leaders furiously lobbied undecided or skeptical lawmakers on the plan that had been teetering on the brink of collapse. The bill advanced out of the Rules committee Wednesday night. House leaders have continued to make clear that if everything goes their way, their preference was to have a vote Thursday.
