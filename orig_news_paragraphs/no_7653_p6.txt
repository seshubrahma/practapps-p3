And then we get them out. Another reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a   illegal immigrant. The   bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly identified and removed. After years of being ignored in the media, family members whose relatives were killed by illegal aliens first received national attention after Steinleâ€™s death, when Trump met with several family members in Los Angeles, California.
