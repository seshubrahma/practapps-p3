Trump tweeted Friday that CNN and other major media outlets were "the enemy of the American people. " CNN contributor Carl Bernstein, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the Watergate scandal, which led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon, called Trump’s words "treacherous." "The most dangerous ’enemy of the people’ is presidential lying    always," he tweeted.
