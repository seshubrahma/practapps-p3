The precious cargo of a   Arab trading ship that sank while sailing from China will go on display in the U. S. for the first time. Six years ago, a planned U. S. exhibit was canceled amid ethical concerns over how the wreckage was salvaged. Down in New Orleans, the annual party leading up to Mardi Gras will be in full swing over the coming days, culminating next week on Fat Tuesday. One of the highlights is the parades by social clubs known as krewes.
