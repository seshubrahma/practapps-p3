There are no credible allegations that any sort of recount would actually reverse the outcome of the election. Even if there were, this would not confer standing on Stein to seek a recount, since she received only one percent of the vote in Michigan, so no court decision would result in her winning the state â€™s 16 Electoral College votes. Stein said that she was, instead, pursuing the recount as a form of audit so that Michigan citizens could have the satisfaction of knowing whether the election results were precisely accurate, giving them confidence in the electoral system.
