A second federal judge in Hawaii, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson, issued a nationwide ruling that halted the   travel ban on the same grounds as Chuang, finding it likely violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. Yet Watson’s decision was slightly broader in scope and paused Trump’s   ban on refugee admissions as well. So if the Justice Department prevails in the 4th Circuit, the case will then go back to the district court judge for further litigation and the key portions of the revised executive order will stay on hold as long as Watson’s nationwide decision remains in effect.
