If the media can strangle Trump by terrorizing people about everything he says, then it’s already over.

It can be very difficult for people to overcome whatever meaning the press superimposes on what someone has said, no matter how psychotic. Throw in incessant repetition and uniform agreement among the pundits (Hillary cheerleaders versus Never Trumpers) and completely deranged interpretations become historical facts.
