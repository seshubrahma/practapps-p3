Lacking a traditional campaign operation, ties with the GOP establishment and the desire to pay millions of dollars to political consultants, Trump has, in effect, morphed his corporate operations, in which his children play substantive leadership roles, into a small but intensely loyal political kitchen cabinet. That has meant investing Eric and Donald Jr. and Ivanka, his children with his first wife Ivana Trump, with considerable power in his campaign. While Trump has parted with   advisers such as Roger Stone and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, his family has consolidated power and laid the foundations for increased influence. Michael D’Antonio, who wrote a biography of Trump, told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin Thursday that Trump’s children were "supremely" important to their father’s political and businesses careers.
