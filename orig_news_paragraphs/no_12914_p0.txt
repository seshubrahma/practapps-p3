Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign reacted strongly to the news that Breitbart News’s executive chairman left the company to work for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. [Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook opened a conference call with reporters by calling Breitbart a "  news site" that trafficked in conspiracy theories and began smearing the journalistic company with the usual leftist attacks on Republicans and conservatives.   " Donald Trump has decided to double down on his most small, nasty, and divisive instincts by turning his campaign over to someone who is best known for running a   news site that peddles divisive, at times, racist,     conspiracy theories," Mook said.
