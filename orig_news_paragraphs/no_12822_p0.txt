E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt has called on the cast of the Broadway show Hamilton to apologize to Mike Pence for what he described as their "bullying" of the Vice   during a performance in New York City Friday night. [In a series of Twitter messages on Saturday, Van Zandt said the cast of the     play "made a mistake" and had set a "terrible precedent" for the theater when they addressed Pence directly from the stage toward the end of Friday nightâ€™s performance.   At the end of a show which saw Pence booed loudly at various points, actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays former vice president Aaron Burr, read aloud a message to the future vice president: "We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights," the actor said. The brief remarks were reportedly written by Hamilton creator   Miranda, director Thomas Kail and producer Jeffrey Seller.
