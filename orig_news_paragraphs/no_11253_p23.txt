It’s unclear what role Santorum will now play in national politics after setting aside an issue which presents perhaps the last existential threat to Western culture and civilization, and which has electrified an American electorate once resigned to a    matchup. As Santorum weakly backs Rubio, Trump is offering an alternative to future in which Mexican cartels and illegal alien drug mules pump heroin into the nation and profit as half a million Americans die from drug overdoses in a single decade, and in which the Muslim world storms Europe and inflicts massive   on German women in the shadows of the Cologne cathedral. It’s likely that Trump’s explosive campaign with promises to build a border wall simply dwarfed Santorum’s, who has also branded himself a hawk on foreign policy similar to Rubio. Van Susteren asked Santorum the first state he would hit to campaign for Rubio, but Santorum demurred and said he would let Rubio know after he made his endorsement.
