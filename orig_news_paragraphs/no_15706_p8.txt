The BBC said driver Mohammed Nazir, who had worked with the broadcaster for four years and had a young family, died in the blast. Four BBC journalists were injured, but their injuries are not thought to be life threatening, according to a BBC World Service statement. At least 11 US citizens assigned to the US embassy as contractors were injured in the blast, according to US officials.    German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the bombing was in the "immediate vicinity" of its embassy.
