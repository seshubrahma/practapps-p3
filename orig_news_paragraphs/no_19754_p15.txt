For the increasingly global world car market, where the same models are sold across different continents, another key factor is free trade (and    trade). One reason Mexico is a desirable place to manufacture the cars that have been the object of Trump’s attacks —   the Chevrolet Cruze, the Ford Focus and   and the Toyota Corolla —  is that these are models that sell in car markets around the world. The Ford Focus is the   selling car in the U. K. for example, while the Mustang being built in Flat Rock, Michigan, by contrast, started being produced in   drive for the first time this year, more than six decades after its U. S. debut.
