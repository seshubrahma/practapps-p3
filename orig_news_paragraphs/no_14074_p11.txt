If Trump and his administration are going to continue lying to us, how can we trust any information they release?   How can we trust the administrationâ€™s statements on issues like the unemployment rate, GDP growth or numbers of people signing up for government programs like Obamacare?   And even more concerning , how can we trust anything the Trump administration states about national security issues?
