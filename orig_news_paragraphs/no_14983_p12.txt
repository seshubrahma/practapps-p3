Flynn’s Justice Department filing last month raised questions when it revealed that Flynn’s firm worked on behalf of a   company, Inovo BV, to improve US confidence in Turkey’s business climate.   Flynn Intel Group received $530, 000 in payments from the company and acknowledged in its registration as a foreign agent that the work may have benefited the Turkish government. The White House has many advisers who earned millions of dollars last year, including President Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, whose assets combined with her husband’s could exceed $700 million. Ivanka Trump and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, collected about $195 million in income, according to a new financial snapshot of about 180 of the men and women serving in Donald Trump’s White House.
