On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily (6AM to 9AM on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125) veteran NBC newsman Tom Brokaw said he credits GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for bringing in more Americans to the political process. [In a   interview on domestic and international affairs, Brokaw told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that he "will give Mr. Trump credit" for that and joked that though some have come into the political process because they "want to do anything they can to make sure he doesn’t succeed," others "quite obviously are involved in the process now because they have someone who speaks their mind. "   The key to Trump’s success will be how many of his supporters from outside of the traditional political system go to the polls and vote. Brokaw said that since Trump has about 30% of the support before votes have been cast, he could inherit the support of other candidates or "everybody else will consolidate around one or two candidates" once "we have a winnowing out. "
