Bharara recently said on Fox News that she would support Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee, and she has also criticized both Trump and Ted Cruz after they warned of jihad threats from Muslims in the United States. Fairfax County property records show that Shah Bharara jointly owns a house in Reston, Va. with her husband Niteesh Bharara, a doctor, who bought the house on August 18 for $1. 178 million. Both Bharara and her husband were listed in Washington Post real estate records at the time of the purchase. Bhararaâ€™s Instagram page, which has since been deleted, showed that in September 2015 Bharara Instagrammed the Virginia house with the captions "#OurFirstHome, #VirginiaIsForLovers and #FinallyCrossedThePotomac.
