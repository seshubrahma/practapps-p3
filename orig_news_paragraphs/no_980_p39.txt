Whatâ€™s with those raggedy circles drawn on the wall of each floor? The exhibition graphics were inspired by the Biennial catalog design by Tiguere Corporation, in San Juan, P.

The single slash means "this floor has some Biennial works" and the double slash or X means "this entire floor has Biennial works.
