We must remember that the problem of North Korea is a regional one, a global one    one in which the interests of many other nations intersect, to include China, Japan, Russia and, most of all, South Korea.    Direct talks with Pyongyang, absent the participation of    and input from    the Republic of Korea, makes it nearly certain that any reconciliation would come at the expense of the South from an emboldened North. President Trump has been right to stress the important role that China must play in resolving this crisis. The path to Pyongang runs through Beijing, no question.
