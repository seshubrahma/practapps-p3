The case has implications that go far beyond MetLife. In striking down the FSOC designation, the district court cited the failure of the council to engage in   analysis. In its appeal, FSOC argued that it could ignore the costs of designation because the   Act did not explicitly require such analysis. If that view prevails at the Appeals Court level, it would make it far more difficult to challenge regulatory action on   grounds.
