Once the Supreme Court has heard from the challengers, it will decide whether it should allow the revised controversial executive order    that blocks entry from six   countries    to go into effect while the justices decide whether they should take up the government’s appeal. To succeed, the Trump administration will need the votes of five justices. According to rules that govern the Supreme Court, the justices would take into consideration whether there is a "reasonable probability" that four of the justices would eventually agree to hear the case and a "fair prospect" that a majority of the court will hold that the lower court opinions were erroneous. They’d also consider if "irreparable harm" would result from the denial of the request to lift the injunction.
