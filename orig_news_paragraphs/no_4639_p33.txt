In Iraq, there are Sunnis living in territory captured by ISIS that openly welcomed their ghastly conquerors, or were at least reluctant to work with the Iraqi government, because they distrusted the    Iraqi government, and were terrified of the   Shiite militias operating in the region. In Bahrain, the government is under fire for suppressing the Shiite majority in its population, with five dead in a recent police raid against a Shiite community. The Bahraini monarchy, in turn, credibly accuses Iran of seeking to destabilize the country by exacerbating   tensions. Bahrainâ€™s Sunnis fear they would be brutalized on an epic scale if Shiites overthrow the government.
