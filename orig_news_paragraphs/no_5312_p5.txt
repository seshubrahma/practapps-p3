" The president’s Executive Order is a shot in the arm for America’s struggling   workers, and must now be followed up with legislation that makes permanent changes to our immigration system so it truly benefits America and its citizens," said a statement from Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. He continued: Employers should be required to hire American workers who meet minimum job requirements and the foreign workers they do hire must be required to be paid a fair, market wage. We cannot achieve the goal of ‘hiring American’ while maintaining a policy that allows them to bypass Americans in favor of foreign guest workers.
