Established groups in Washington are running more traditional campaigns. The Alliance for Healthcare Security, a coalition of health care worker unions and other groups, is running television and online ads during the recess in five states where it believes Republican senators are either inclined to vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or vulnerable to defeat in   bids if they vote for repeal. The ads  —   in Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Nevada and West Virginia   —   feature constituents with   diseases telling emotional stories about how the health care law saved their lives.
