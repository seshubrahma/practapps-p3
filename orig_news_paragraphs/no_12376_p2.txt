The worst terror attack on domestic soil hit us just a few months ago in San Bernardino, California, and one of the two jihadists snuck into our country using a fiancée visa.

We’ve been told by no less than the F. B. I. that our government cannot properly vet refugees from   areas like Syria, a country from which Obama is importing tens of thousands of Muslim refugees.
