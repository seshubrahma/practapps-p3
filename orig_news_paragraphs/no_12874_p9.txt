I don’t expect it to hold for very long. But it’s consumed an enormous amount of Secretary of State Kerry’s time, to deal with the Russians on an issue where we are fundamentally diverging from them, and has aroused intense opposition at the Pentagon.   I just think it shows the mistakes in the overall world view of the Obama administration. It simply can’t understand how countries can have interests adverse to the United States, and why we need to protect them.
