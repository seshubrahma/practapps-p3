The   Tax Foundation estimates that they account for 60 percent of all business income in the United States. While they can be found in all sectors of the economy (including private equity and hedge funds) they are especially prevalent in real estate. Mr. Trump identified 564 separate business entities in his financial disclosure forms, most of them L. L. C.s and partnerships. That amounts to a huge tax cut even for people who had been paying taxes on carried interest at the preferential rate, "since most carried interest is generated by a business entity," said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundationâ€™s Center for Federal Tax Policy.
