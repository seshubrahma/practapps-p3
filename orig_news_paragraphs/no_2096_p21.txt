__ 8. A scathing attack on global health advice to eat less sugar as "unscientific" set off a storm of criticism. The authors of the paper, published in a prominent medical journal, have ties to the food and sugar industries, and the review was paid for by a group funded by companies including   Hershey, General Mills, Kraft Foods, Kelloggâ€™s and Monsanto. Critics said the episode recalled how the tobacco industry enlisted scientists for decades as "merchants of doubt" about the hazards of smoking.
