A     windowless, fortified ATT building in downtown Manhattan has been identified as an N. S. A. listening post. Neither ATT nor the National Security Agency would confirm this, but thatâ€™s the conclusion of a short film debuting this weekend, based on material provided by Edward Snowden. The film, "Project X," says the building was   Titanpointe and used to collect communications from international entities with operations in New York.
