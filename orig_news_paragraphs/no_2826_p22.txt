Why isn’t Mrs. Clinton doing better than Mr. Obama among Hispanic voters? Part of her problem, I suspect, is that Hispanic voters are disproportionately young, and she has had a tough time rallying the support of young voters. It is also possible that she is struggling among less educated   or   Hispanic voters who may vote more similarly to less educated white voters. Mrs. Clinton isn’t doing better than Mr. Obama among black voters, either.
