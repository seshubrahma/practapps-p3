" "Fidel Castroâ€™s regime committed horrendous and innumerable atrocities against the Cuban people, advancing corruption and violence and preventing a   economy that would have brought opportunity and prosperity to several generations of Cuban families," he said Saturday. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called Castro an "evil, murderous dictator who inflicted misery  suffering on his own people." "Over six decades, millions of Cubans were forced to flee their own country, and those accused of opposing the regime were routinely jailed and even killed," said the former Republican presidential candidate whose parents were Cuban immigrants.
