Sylvester Stallone won his first Golden Globe for his supporting role in this summerâ€™s Creed and got a really nice standing ovation from everyone in attendance.

Stallone reportedly returned to the stage after the broadcast cut to commercial and thanked both Jordan and Coogler. Not to worry, though: Selma director Ava DuVernay and others were there to remind everyone what happened.
