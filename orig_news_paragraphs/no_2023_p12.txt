But the vote last week in Washington to extend sanctions for another decade, which they say violated the nuclear agreement, seemed to strike a nerve. " If the Iran Sanctions Act is carried out, it will be a clear and obvious violation of the agreement and will be met with a very harsh response from us," Mr. Rouhani said, joining dozens of other clerics, politicians and generals who have made similar threats. He told Iranians not to be "concerned," saying that a government committee would meet on Wednesday to determine Iranâ€™s reaction to the extension of sanctions, which the Obama administration said did not violate the nuclear agreement.
