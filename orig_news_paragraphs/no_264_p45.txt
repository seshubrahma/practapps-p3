Mr. Tillerson appears likely to win Senate confirmation, close relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and all. But senators are still wary of the Russia connections. Mr. Schumer and Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, are introducing legislation that would require a congressional vote to lift the sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and proxy war in that former Soviet state. The two senators will emphasize that the legislation will also cover sanctions imposed just weeks ago by Mr. Obama after intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election in hopes of helping elect Mr. Trump.
