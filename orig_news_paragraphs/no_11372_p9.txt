As Arina Grossu notes at The Federalist: Between 1973 and 1977, the years between Roe v. Wade and the Hyde Amendment becoming law, the federal government spent about $50 million annually to fund approximately 300, 000 abortions per year under Medicaid. In defending his amendment, Hyde said we "cannot in logic and conscience help fund the execution of these innocent, defenseless human lives. " Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) says this anniversary should be celebrated.
