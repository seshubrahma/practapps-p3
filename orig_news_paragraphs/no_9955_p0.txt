Friday on ABC’s "Good Morning America," presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump fielded questions from   George Stephanopoulos about his releasing his tax returns to the public.   During that interview, Stephanopoulos insisted Trump could release those taxes, despite being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Trump argued there was a double standard when it came to his tax returns and Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton’s emails.
