know how many of those being investigated are refugees or immigrants, but it’s safe guess too many are. As far as Jeb’s condescending, sanctimonious "act of love" nonsense, he sounds no different than Obama or Hillary someone pandering to identity politics, to lawbreakers who cost   taxpayers a $100 billion per year, and the jobs of working class citizens and legal immigrants who do play the rules. Jeb sounds proud of the fact that he is not on the side of Americans. Rather than protect and look out for Americans, he’s making foreigners a priority.
