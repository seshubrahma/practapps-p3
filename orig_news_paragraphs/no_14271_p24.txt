Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey drew a link between Trumpâ€™s mollifying approach to Russia and the aggression in Ukraine. " At the mere hint that President Trump would take a softer stance towards Russia, we have already seen   forces emboldened and renew fighting" in eastern Ukraine, he told CNN.   Menendez is part of a bipartisan group of senators who have introduced the Countering Russian Hostilities Act, which he said would hold Russia accountable for its international aggression and interference in the US election.
