" Bernie Sanders and the   political revolutionaries behind him have more than earned the time and the space, just as Secretary Clinton and her supporters did eight years ago, to determine the best steps we can take together to help unite our party against Donald Trump in the days and weeks ahead," said Jim Dean, the chairman of Democracy for America, which endorsed Mr. Sanders in December. Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which stayed neutral in the race, said Democrats should not "guilt trip" Sanders voters by warning them of the risks of electing Mr. Trump, but instead incorporate their ideas, including expanding Social Security benefits and breaking up big banks, into the party platform. In a taped appearance on "The Tonight Show" that is to be broadcast Thursday night, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Sanders, saying he brought "enormous energy" and "new ideas" to the campaign.
