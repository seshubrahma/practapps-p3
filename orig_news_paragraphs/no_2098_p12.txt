Matthew G. Olsen, the former National Counterterrorism Center director who led the task force in 2009 that initially reviewed and recommended what to do with each of the   detainees, said nearly eliminating the transfer list was a major accomplishment. " There is a humanitarian imperative not to detain people who can be safely transferred to their home country or to another country, and much of what we have seen over the past few years has been continued detention for many such people," he said. Most who would be transferred next month are Yemenis.
