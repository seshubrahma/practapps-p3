Being a Rockette is among the most lucrative jobs a dancer can get in New York, complete with   health insurance even though the company performs on a seasonal basis. Ms. Kakuk, who loved her time as a Rockette, said, "You get six months of pay for three months of work, and it is six months’ worth of work in three months because it’s so incredibly intense. " She added that some of the dancers live in New York during the Christmas show and then go home to Wisconsin or Florida to teach.
