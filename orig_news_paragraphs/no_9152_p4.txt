Ryan’s challenger, Paul Nehlen, is a Trump Republican and influential conservatives such as Sarah Palin and Ann Coulter have openly called on Badger State voters in Ryan’s district to send him packing.

Huelskamp was a prominent #NeverTrump Republican who staked his campaign on opposition to the controversial billionaire only to be defeated by a   Republican. So why should Trump endorse Ryan now, especially when establishment Republicans are on the ropes?
