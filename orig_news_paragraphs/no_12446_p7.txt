The suspect, who was free awaiting a hearing on the earlier charge, was taken back into custody and was lodged in the Lancaster County prison in lieu of a $250, 000 bail. The arrest in Pennsylvania comes about two weeks after the arrest of a man in California who was dressed as a woman and caught taking video of women in a Macy’s store women’s restroom.
