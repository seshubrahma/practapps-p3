As Happy Valley Republican Cheadle sees it, politicians have historically dismissed African Americans and that is why they clung so quickly to Barack Obama as the first black President. Searchlight reported that Cheadle is running for Congress in California’s 1st district. During Trump’s Redding rally he commented on the violence of   protesters outside the prior night’s rally in San Jose, California. He went on to recall an incident at an Arizona Trump rally in which a black Trump supporter punched an   protester with a graffitied Trump image whose fellow protester was wearing a   hood.
