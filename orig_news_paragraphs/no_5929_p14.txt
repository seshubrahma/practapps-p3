It is astonishing that anyone thinks "vetting" is possible for many refugees from   Syria, whose sinister central government still does not control many parts of the country. ISIS, of course, is headquartered in Syria, and   is one of the strongest military forces in the rebellion. Syrian resistance groups are so difficult to screen that the Obama administration could only find tiny handfuls of reliable "moderate" fighters to arm and train they were promptly kidnapped, killed, or   by terrorist groups after Obama deployed them. The "white hat rebel" program ended as a laughingstock across the Middle East.
