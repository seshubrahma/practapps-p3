Several online retailers have thus far retained the Ivanka Trump line. Last year, a call for boycotting Nordstrom’s over carrying the brand gained traction with the viral letter of a Twitter user who has since tweeted ugly criticism of counselor to President Trump, Kellyanne Conway. On November 21, 2016, Nordstrom   Pete Nordstrom distributed an internal email to employees which specified that the company fully intended to continue carrying the Ivanka Trump brand despite the boycott and lauded the success of the brand. In the weeks following Nordstrom’s letter affirming the brand would be continued, boycott leader Shannon Coulter of #grabyourwallet stated that she tracked how much of the Ivanka Trump line was carried on the retailer’s website.
