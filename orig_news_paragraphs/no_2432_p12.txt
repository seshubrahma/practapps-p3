" The whole principle is to bring voice recognition to customers so they can keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel," said Alan Hall, a spokesman for Ford, which began installing Sync in cars in 2007. Since then, the company has added features to reduce distractions, like a "do not disturb button" that lets drivers block incoming calls and texts. CarPlay allows use of the iPhoneâ€™s Siri virtual assistant to answer phone calls, dictate texts and control apps like Spotify and Pandora.
