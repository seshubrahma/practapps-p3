Arutz Sheva, which caters to Israelâ€™s nationalist camp, started out as a pirate radio station broadcasting from a ship acquired by Mr. Katz. The yeshiva complex also runs a tour company and a rabbinical website. One of the stated goals of its online efforts, it says, is to "delegitimize the notion of the   solution," spreading its influence far beyond the geographical confines of Beit El. Then there is the real estate.
