Bill Clinton will curtail his direct involvement in the charity and the group will transition some programs to   charities, he said in a statement on the foundation’s website Monday. Clinton last week also said he would stop giving paid speeches. " Over the last several months, members of the Foundation’s senior leadership, Chelsea, and I have evaluated how the Foundation should operate if Hillary is elected," the former president wrote.
