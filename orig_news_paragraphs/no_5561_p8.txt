The lawsuit was backed by PayPal   and billionaire Peter Thiel, who himself had been affected in the past by the outlet after being outed as gay, and forced Denton to file for bankruptcy. At SXSW on Sunday, Denton claimed that Thiel had become a "national figure" and "extremely prominent" in American politics and culture. " Peter Thiel, through his financial support of litigation and his support for political disruption through Donald Trump, has become a national figure," Denton proclaimed.
