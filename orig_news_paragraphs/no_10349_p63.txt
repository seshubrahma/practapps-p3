" However, contrary to Levin’s suggestion, from 1871 to 1913 under the leadership of mostly Republican presidents, "the average U. S. tariff on dutiable imports never fell below 38 percent [and] gross national product (GNP) grew 4. 3 percent annually, twice the pace in free trade Britain and well above the U. S. average in the 20th century," notes Alfred Eckes Jr. chairman of the U. S. International Trade Commission under President Reagan. Moreover, contrary to Levin’s telling of history, defending the American worker through trade protectionism was a priority of the original Republican Party. Free trade was the policy of Democrats.
