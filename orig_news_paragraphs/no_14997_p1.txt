This has become a bit of a pattern in the Trump White House. Last weekend, the President visited Trump National Golf Club in Virginia two days in a row while Pence discussed small business in West Virginia on Saturday and addressed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Sunday. Linda McMahon, head of Trumpâ€™s Small Business Administration, joined the vice president last Saturday.   The President held meetings at the golf course, the White House said, declining to say with whom.
