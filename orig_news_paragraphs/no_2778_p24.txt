Boeing no longer makes 757s, but a 2015 Boeing Business Jet would sell for approximately $80 million, and cost anywhere from $20 million to $40 million to outfit. After Mr. Trump took possession of the 757 in 2011 he made a number of changes but did not fundamentally undo Mr. Allen’s initial renovation, records show. For instance, he kept the headboard in the master bedroom, as well as most of the chairs, couches and toilet seats Mr. Allen had left, choosing to reupholster them. Greg Raiff, chief executive officer of Private Jet Services, an aviation consulting firm and   charter broker for corporations and individuals, said the Boeing was an unusual aircraft for a man of Mr. Trump’s wealth.
