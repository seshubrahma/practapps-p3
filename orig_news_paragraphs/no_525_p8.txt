" Everybody in this body knows Senator Sessions well, knows that he is a man of integrity, a man of principle," Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said during the debate on Wednesday afternoon. The "twisting" of Mr. Sessionsâ€™s record offended him, he said, even as Democrats continued their attacks on the nominee. As the 84th attorney general, Mr. Sessions brings a sharply conservative bent to the Justice Department and its 113, 000 employees.
