Ransomware encrypts data, so one of the best defenses against ransom attacks is to maintain good backups of valuable data. That way, if a ransomware virus strikes, the system can be cleaned off, and a safe backup copy of the data installed. Backups of important data should be kept safe from contamination, so the best protection strategies donâ€™t rely entirely on backup devices that are constantly connected to your computer, like those popular external hard drives. Good password security is also important for defense against ransom attacks.
