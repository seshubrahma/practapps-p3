Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, addressed these concerns during a Democratic lawmaker retreat in West Virginia, telling his colleagues he had spoken to Pompeo and that the CIA chief was just as surprised as the senators to learn of the document in question. Warner added that Pompeo told him that he had not been informed of the memo in advance and wasn’t aware that it was a White House document. During his confirmation hearings, Pompeo said he believed torture to be illegal and that he would not order waterboarding or other enhanced interrogation practices. But in a series of written responses to senators’ questions, Pompeo did leave the door open for reviving some of the techniques, should experts say their prohibition harmed intelligence gathering    but only if the current laws prohibiting them were changed.
