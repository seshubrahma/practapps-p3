Thus we can ask: Would a President Trump really cross his own   base by going over to the other side —  to the globalists who voted, and donated, against him? If he did —  if he repudiated his central platform plank —   he would implode his presidency, the way that Bush 41 imploded his presidency in 1990 when he went back on his "read my lips, no new taxes" pledge.
