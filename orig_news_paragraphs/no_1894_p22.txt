Germany has fallen short of its contributions over the past several years, and in 2015 made good on only about half its pledge, despite record tax income for the government. Ms. Merkel vowed that this would change in the future, crediting Mr. Obama with delivering the message that Germany needed to increase military spending. " In the long term, the imbalance over defense spending cannot be maintained, and Germany has understood this message and already begun to react," Ms. Merkel said.
