Trump and top White House officials have condemned the use of anonymous sources in a slew of damaging reports about the Trump administration. Trump on Friday morning tweeted that "the FBI is totally unable to stop the national security ’leakers’ that have permeated our government for a long time" and said leaks of classified information "could have a devastating effect on US. " But in pushing back on CNN’s reporting Friday morning, two senior administration officials said Priebus had asked top FBI officials to brief reporters on background, or anonymously, after the FBI refused requests to publicly knock down the reports of contacts between Trump advisers and Russians known to US intelligence.
