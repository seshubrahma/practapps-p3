This gentleman is doing a very counterproductive job with respect to the Los Angeles bid," Mr. Smirnov said. The choice for the 2024 Games is down to Los Angeles and Paris, and United States Olympic officials and other powerful interests involved with the bid have expressed concern to members of Congress that the   crusade could alienate some of the global officials who will make the decision. Mr. Tygart is to continue his crusade on Tuesday, when he is scheduled to address a House subcommittee about the doping scandal and the ways in which the global sports system could be improved. Testifying alongside him will be Michael Phelps, the worldâ€™s most decorated Olympian Adam Nelson, an American shot putter who was awarded a gold medal nearly a decade after his 2004 Olympic performance when a competitor was disqualified for doping as well as officials from the I. O. C. and the World   Agency, to which the United States contributes $2 million annually.
