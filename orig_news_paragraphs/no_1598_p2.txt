Mr. Trump may not have purposefully snubbed black neighborhoods   â€”    he rarely plunges into any community to tour businesses, sample local cuisine or spontaneously engage in the handshake and   rituals of everyday campaigning. His preferred style of politicking consists almost entirely of addressing   rallies, conducting media interviews and receiving visitors in private at events or at his Manhattan skyscraper.
