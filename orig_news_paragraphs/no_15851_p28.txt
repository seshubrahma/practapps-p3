Multiple cruise lines make stops at the port of San Juan, adding even more visitors to the mix. El Yunque National Forest, the San Juan Historic Site, which includes Fort San Crist√≥bal, plus beautiful beaches and the streets of Old San Juan draw hordes of visitors.   Unfortunately, the Zika virus, an illness spread through mosquito bites that causes birth defects and other neurological issues, has affected tourism numbers. More than 40, 000 cases have been reported there since the epidemic began, and a public health emergency was declared.
