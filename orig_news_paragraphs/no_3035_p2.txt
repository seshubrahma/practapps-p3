Employers have also found themselves managing a tighter employment market, according to the New York Times: Regardless of government estimates, however, employers across sectors and across the nation have increasingly complained about the difficulty of finding workers, a competition that kept the increase in the average hourly wage ahead of a 1. 6 percent price inflation rate. " Weâ€™re still continuing to see wage pressure as the candidate market continues to shrink," said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing USA, which has 300 branch offices. In addition to the omnipresent hunger for engineers, Ms. Glaser said there is a demand for those with   trade skills like welding that fell into disuse during the recession, as well as   warehouse and light assembly workers.
