Rubio has received bad advice how to battle Trump, and has made some laughable attempts to   him, going far beyond the bounds of decency in the process. Marco likes to make fun of Trump’s hands, a typically catty move common in the gay community (Marco honey, the feet are a better predictor of what a man is packing). Trump makes fun of Marco’s vote counts and event attendance. If we look at his past, the foibles aren’t new.
