On this weekendâ€™s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, suggested that new executive orders were a possibility to take on illegal immigration.   Miller explained there was a variety of other option, but added Trump would be well within his authority to use executive orders as a means to prevent the immigration process in the United States to be used by those he deemed were "hostile" to the nation and its values. " Right now we are considering and pursuing all options," Miller said.
