—    Two additional women on Friday stepped forward to accuse Donald Trump of sexually assaulting them, the latest revelations to rock the GOP nominee’s campaign. One woman alleged that Trump slid his fingers under her skirt in the early 1990s. Another, a former "Apprentice" contestant, said Trump grabbed her breast and kissed her aggressively in 2007.
