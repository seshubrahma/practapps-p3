If we had immigration reform and were able to hire these people who want to work   …      We’d have access to not only   workers in our business but the high skilled workers that everybody talks about. You’d have consumption from these individuals, because obviously if they’re working and they’re making money and supporting their families they’d be out there buying things.   That demand for more imported customers is common among business leaders.
