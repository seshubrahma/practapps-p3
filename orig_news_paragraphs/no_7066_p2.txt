Melania kept her   attire going into official White House business, donning a rich     crepe midi dress by Michael Kors to meet the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela. The Michael Kors dress retails for $1, 695 and was last seen on supermodel Cindy Crawford just days ago. Melania paired the dress with Christian Louboutin heels.
