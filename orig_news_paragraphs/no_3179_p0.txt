Former Secretary of State John Kerry defended the Iran nuclear deal on Monday evening at a gala dinner in San Francisco for the Ploughshares Fund, a George   group that was part of President Barack Obama’s "echo chamber" to sell the agreement to the public. [Kerry called the Iran deal’s monitoring processes a "system that’s working," according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and criticized President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress for pushing for new sanctions against the Iranian regime.   " It doesn’t make sense, folks, to risk a step that gets us nothing," Kerry said of proposed new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile program, according to the Chronicle.
