Based on these two elections and the recent vote in the Iowa caucus, expect   to break for one of the candidates other than Donald Trump.

Polling in New Hampshire this year has been very steady at the top of the race. For at least a month, and in recent daily tracking polls, Trump has been polling around 30 percent support.
