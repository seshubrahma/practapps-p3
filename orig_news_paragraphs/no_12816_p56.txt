We all recall the case of Chelsea Manning, aka Bradley Manning, the Army soldier who leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents in 2010.   Manning was prosecuted under the Espionage Act and sentenced to 35 years in prison.    And once in prison, Manning declared that he was a she.    And so, bolstered by a slew of ACLU lawyers, Manning demanded a   operation, as well as associated hormone treatments.
