[Many of the federal prosecutors who were nominated by former President Barack Obama have already left their positions, but the nearly four dozen who stayed on in the first weeks of the Trump administration have been asked to leave "in order to ensure a uniform transition," Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said.   " Until the new U. S. attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U. S. attorney’s offices will continue the great work of the department in investigating, prosecuting and deterring the most violent offenders," she said in a statement. It is customary, though not automatic, for the country’s 93 U. S. attorneys to leave their positions once a new president is in office.
