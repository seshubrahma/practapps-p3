One question requests recommendations to implement a 10 percent budget reduction over the next four years. The questionnaire also suggests a new emphasis on nuclear power, including queries about supporting the operation of existing nuclear reactors preventing the premature closing of nuclear plants increasing research and development of advanced nuclear reactors and moving forward with plans to license nuclear waste disposal at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, which was shut down by the Obama administration. One question touches on the department’s support for "offshore wind," a particular interest for Mr. Trump, who is fighting wind turbines off the coast of one of his golf courses in Scotland. The Energy Department’s national laboratories are largely focused on   scientific research, but several questions seem to indicate an interest in pushing the research in a commercial direction, including a request to the labs for a list of licensing agreements and royalty proceeds over the last five years.
