Unlike areas farther north, which have barrier islands and then the mainland, the Keys are made up solely of a chain of   islands built on porous limestone. Stopping the water from rolling into neighborhoods here is not an easy task. Sea walls, for example, do not work. Patience is a requirement nowadays on some Keys roads.
