When people seek to prevent others who are peacefully assembled from making their voices heard, it threatens the very foundation of our democracy," a local attorney said Friday after the charges against Kaine and seven others were announced.   Police said Kaine was allegedly part of a violent, masked group: Security officers saw five people dressed in black leaving the Capitol, including one who threw a smoke bomb inside, according to complaints filed by the city attorneyâ€™s office. They went to a nearby spot and "tried to change their appearance by doing things like taking off their black clothing, putting on different jackets or hats, and turning their clothing inside out," the complaints said. When police approached, they scattered and ran.
