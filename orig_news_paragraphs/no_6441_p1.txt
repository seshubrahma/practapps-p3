President Duterte repeatedly claimed he had "realigned" himself ideologically with Russia and China after he claimed to end the Philippines’ relationship with the United States. Citing historical ties between the Philippines and the United States on Sunday, however, President Duterte declared, "As we fought together to stay above the enemy then, so we should help each other to address the threats that confront our societies, our region, and our world," reports the Southeast Asian country’s   News. " Now the menace of terrorism, violent extremism and transnational crimes such as the illegal drug trade have called into question, efforts uphold the responsibility to defend the common good," he added.
