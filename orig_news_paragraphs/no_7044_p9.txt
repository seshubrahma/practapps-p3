During the Vietnam war, while the U. S. poured ground forces into the country to stem the flow of Hanoiâ€™s efforts to take control of the country, we were confronted with powers in that region having contrary interests that proved able to draw the conflict out, engaging us in what was then our longest war. Countries like China and Russia achieved this by providing Hanoi with an unlimited supply of equipment, vehicles,    missile launchers, arms, ammunition, etc. Similarly, Iran today provides its proxy forces with these assets which, were there to be U. S. ground forces committed to Syria, would drastically increase. The leader of the North Vietnamese Army, General Nguyen Giap, prided himself in conducting a war against America not involving major confrontations of massive armies but, rather, numerous limited smaller unit engagements the Chinese call "lingchi" or "death of a thousand cuts" to bleed America dry and into withdrawing.
