" Two Trump advisers declined to predict how the nominee would react to the    proceedings and media coverage of the convention, though one of them expressed concern that Mr. Trump might say something or unleash a Twitter post that undercuts a unifying message or roils Republicans in the arena. They described planning for the convention as somewhat haphazard, saying that Mr. Trumpâ€™s focus on lining up speakers had been hot or cold on any given day, and that he had not spent much time making calls to convention speakers to strategize about their remarks and encourage them. The advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said they could not rule out Mr. Trump making decisions on the fly next week to try to influence the convention.
