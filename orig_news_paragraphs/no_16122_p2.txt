Itâ€™s amazing. This is not just a victory in Virginia for delegates, but this is a victory for delegates all over the country who want to vote their consciences," said Beau Correll, the Republican delegate who filed the suit as part of a broader push by   delegates to derail his nomination next week. Correll said the decision, which removes one tool that party leaders and the Trump campaign had to enforce primary results, will embolden   delegates in the other states that have similar provisions. He said, however, that he did not think additional lawsuits were planned in those states.
