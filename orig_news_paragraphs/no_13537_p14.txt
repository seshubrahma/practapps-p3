Even if Trump doesn’t have the votes in Congress to repeal the Obamacare law, this abortion rule and the "accommodation" were created by administrative rules, and can be abolished by President Trump without congressional action. If so, this case will become moot, and never return to the Supreme Court. If, on the other hand, Hillary Clinton wins, and fills the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Scalia, then conservatives may find out whether any of the liberal justices who did not join Sotomayor’s separate opinion were willing to side with the   employers, or instead if the heavy hand of the federal government will force these employers to abandon all their employees’ healthcare to avoid being bankrupted by Obamacare’s massive penalties. Ultimately, the fate of the Little Sisters likely will be decided by the 2016 presidential election, not the Supreme Court.
