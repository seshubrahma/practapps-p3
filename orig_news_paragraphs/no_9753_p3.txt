Since they’ll be in the same place at the same time, Cruz has renewed his challenge for Trump to debate him, this time in Washington, D. C. adding on The Kelly File that he would be happy to make the debate about foreign policy, or some other topic that fits AIPAC’s theme of focusing on Israel. " If you won’t debate in Utah, we’ll bring the debate to you," Cruz said in his statement. Cruz’s campaign has starting pushing the twitter hashtag #DuckingDonald, explaining in the statement that, "Donald can’t duck us for the rest of this campaign, and so we will happily press the issue until the public pressure becomes too much for him to bear.
