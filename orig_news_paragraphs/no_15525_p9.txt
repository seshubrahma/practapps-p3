The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, also called on Comey to testify before his panel. " Enough is enough, Congress really needs to get to the bottom of this," Schiff said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of a judiciary subcommittee investigating Russia, said that Comey should testify before his Senate panel about his discussions with Trump over Flynn, who resigned earlier this year.
