I realize that such luminaries as Bill Kristol, George Will, Lindsey Graham, and Charles Koch actually prefer this outcome for a variety of insane reasons, but if you’re a SANE conservative please explain to me how this works out for our good? If Hillary wins, there exists the very real possibility of a Democratic Senate that will confirm each and every Bolshevik she appoints to the high court, much less every other court and governmental regulatory entity. Want to roll back some of the ridiculous and myriad regulations eight years of an overreaching Obama Administration have given us, much less Obamacare itself?
