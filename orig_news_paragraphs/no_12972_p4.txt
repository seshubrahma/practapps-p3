We are going to work to protect vulnerable refugees around the world, and weâ€™ll share that responsibility with our friends in the regions that are most affected by this challenge," Kerry told reporters in New Zealand. Australia refuses to resettle any refugee who has arrived by boat since the date the tough policy was announced on July 19, 2013. Australia pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to house boat arrivals and has been searching for countries that will resettle them. Few refugees have accepted offers to resettle in Papua New Guinea and Cambodia because most hope that Australia will eventually take them in.
