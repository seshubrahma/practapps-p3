Trump has tapped into the concerns and frustrations of those alienated Republicans and "Blue Dog Democrats" whose parties are now unrecognizable to them. He has surrounded himself with and listens to other strong voices who, whether they pass the constitutional conservative purity test or not, fully support his   mantra of America First. He has imperfectly, but significantly, adapted his behaviors and his rhetoric to his new role as potential future president. These actions and more, plus the support of a   number of true movement conservatives, border patrol agents, police fraternities, Tea Party Patriots, military heroes, wildly changing and favorable polling, and the voices that have been pushing us all along â€”  all have made the case for Donald Trump.
