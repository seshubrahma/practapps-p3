Why is this guy not on television more representing the Trump campaign?   Miller rips Rubio for repeatedly saying that Rubio tried to get the best bill that he could. He reminds the audience that Rubio’s bill issued work permits to 12 million illegal immigrants to take jobs from every American, would issue 33 million green cards to immigrants in ten years, and made it easier to import unlimited numbers of refugees from the Middle East with no additional screening. He says Rubio’s bill doubled the number of   foreign guest workers.
