As Reuters reported, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the move by Obama a "hostile act" and said in a statement: Washington has placed its bets on supplying military aid to   forces who donâ€™t differ that much from blood thirsty head choppers. Now, the possibility of supplying them with weapons, including mobile   complexes, has been written into this new bill. U. S. policy has been to not officially supply the Syrian rebels with   air defense system, or MANPADS. Although the official policy of the United States is to not supply   weapons to the Libyan opposition, there has been a great deal of reporting that the Obama administration was, in fact, supplying the weapons through the Central Intelligence Agency.
