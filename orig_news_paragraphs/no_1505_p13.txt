Ms. Knizhnik’s Tumblr site, Notorious R. B. G. sells   coffee mugs, iPhone cases and tote bags with Justice Ginsburg’s face on them. Ms. Knizhnik said the internet offered a caricature that exaggerated the liberal philosophy of Justice Ginsburg, who had formed a close personal bond with Justice Antonin Scalia, the court’s most outspoken conservative before his death this year. " The idea that she is this hyperpartisan is not true, even though certain people in political life paint her that way," Ms. Knizhnik said.
