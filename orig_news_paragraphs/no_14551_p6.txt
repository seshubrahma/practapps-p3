A cardboard cutout of Waldo    of "Where’s Waldo?" fame    with Issa’s face stood in for the congressman.   Issa’s staff says he met with protesters this week after they showed up outside his office.    Another version of Waldo joined the search party for Ohio Republican Rep. Michael Turner. Political action committees have also gotten in on calling out members of Congress.
