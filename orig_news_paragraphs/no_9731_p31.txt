Thus we come to a remarkable group of American Compradores, avowedly conservatives, who happily pull out their verbal truncheons to beat down the people. They might well have come from the   or   themselves, but by now, having moved to the bright lights of the big city, they have totally absorbed the   of their paymasters, and this inward propagandizing, in turn, leads them to hate their "inferiors" —   that is, to hate their former selves. Yes, we are talking about such    artists as National Review’s Kevin Williamson and David French, and also The Weekly Standard’s Matt Labash.
