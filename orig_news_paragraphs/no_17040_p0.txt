 (CNN) Eight thousand people angry about    Donald Trump’s policies on immigration, the environment, LGBT rights and other issues marched in the streets of downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, the fourth day of   demonstrations. The march was peaceful, unlike the Friday night protest by 1, 000 people that resulted in the arrests of 187 adults and eight juveniles, Los Angeles police said.
