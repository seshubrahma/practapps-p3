Nominations for the department’s deputy positions have yet to be announced or submitted. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Thursday morning that in spite of President Trump’s perpetual tweet storms, distracting television interviews, occasional lies, and intraparty slights, they are with him on policy. " We are on the same page with the White House," Mr. Ryan told reporters in Philadelphia, before a visit from Mr. Trump to the congressional Republican’s policy conference.
