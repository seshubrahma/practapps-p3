To too many liberal Jews, the very purpose of Judaism is now wholly subordinate to the cause of liberalism. Judaism’s purpose is no longer to stand alone, but rather to provide support to what ever the liberal ethos of the day happens to be  —   even if it means bringing more antisemites to our shores. Anymore it seems, the only way to be a good liberal Jew requires sacrificing clearly identifiable Jewish self interest   —   all to prove continued support for the gauzy cause of an ever changing "greater good".
