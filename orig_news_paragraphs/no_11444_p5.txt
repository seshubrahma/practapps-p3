The media creates scandals around Republicans. That is what they have always done They found this David Duke thing dates back to before he was a mainstream reality TV star in America’s living rooms everyday, so it’s not a fair attack. This is media bigotry and I just encourage people to look at his position, what he stands for, and what he has done his whole life, and not buy the media spin. Make up your own mind.
