â€”   who will defend our Constitution.   I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.   Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.   To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law.
