Monday on CNN’s "New Day," network weekend host Michael Smerconish reacted to remarks made by Hollywood actress Meryl Streep aimed at   Donald Trump a night earlier at the Golden Globes awards ceremony.   According to Smerconish, Streep’s effort won’t damage Trump and will instead "energize his base. " " If she wanted to hurt him, the best thing she could do is praise him," Smerconish said.
