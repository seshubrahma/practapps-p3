According to Dutch newspaper Telegraaf, the municipal authorities were made aware of the incident and went to the centre to make sure the flags and other items including leaflets for Diyanet, the Turkish government agency in charge of religion, were removed from the polling area.   " Campaign expressions are not allowed in the polling station. We have sent someone there to correct it," a spokesman from the municipality told the paper.
