On Saturday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that Trump planned to speak to former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, acting national security adviser Gen. Keith Kellogg, West Point Superintendent Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who directs the Army Capabilities Integration Center, and "potentially more" candidates.   Sanders confirmed those four men had been interviewed, adding: "We may have some additional names tomorrow and he may also meet with a couple of those people again. " Two other candidates, former Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal and former CIA Director David Petraeus, are no longer in the mix, sources told CNN Friday night.
