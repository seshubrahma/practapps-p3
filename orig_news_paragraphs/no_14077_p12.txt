Although we don’t know if he will brand his programs with the Trump logo, we do know that there are a number of areas where he will pursue legislation that fulfills some of his campaign goals.   We are very likely to see efforts from the White House to make good on his     rules. He might go for broke and push for the construction of a wall    or else he might work within the boundaries of what’s politically easier such as increasing deportations and putting more funding into border control. He is also expected to put forward an infrastructure bill laden with tax incentives for developers to show that he is serious about creating jobs while placing Democrats in a difficult position to oppose him.
