Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cautiously reacted to an attack on law enforcement officials in Baton Rouge that killed three police officers and wounded three others. ["Today’s devastating assault on police officers in Baton Rouge is an assault on all of us," Clinton said in a statement nearly seven hours after the attacks were reported. The shooting occurred around 9:40 AM EDT and Clinton’s campaign posted the statement at 5:05 PM EDT, moments after President Barack Obama took the podium at the White House to share his own response to the attacks.   In the hours after her Republican rival Donald Trump posted a response to the news, Clinton became the butt of jokes about needing to "focus group" her response.
