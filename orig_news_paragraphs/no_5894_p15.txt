To those who say: "They will just go elsewhere to sell their products," I say if they could do that now why wouldn’t they be doing it, and the demand doesn’t go away because of a tariff on imports. That void will be filled either by domestic manufacturers or foreign shipments with a Treasury check. Meanwhile, a freight train of money will be steady delivering tariff collections to the U. S. Treasury, commingled with tax receipts from American businesses whose export businesses will explode when the tariffs are in place. The inbound tariff receipts will reduce the tax burden on everyday Americans.
