During his second term, Obama   diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than 50 years, made history by becoming the first US president to visit the island since the 1959 revolution and ended the   "wet foot, dry foot" policy that allowed Cubans who reached the United States to stay there. Many Cubans are hopeful that Trump will restore their special immigration status, but so far he has not given any indications that migrants from Cuba would be exempt from his stringent   policies.   During the presidential campaign, Trump shifted from saying he agreed with the Cuba opening, even if he would have negotiated "a better deal," to then promising to scrap the new détente with Havana if Cuba’s leaders did not allow greater political and religious freedoms. After Fidel Castro’s death in 2016, Trump in a statement signaled he would take a harder line on Cuba.
