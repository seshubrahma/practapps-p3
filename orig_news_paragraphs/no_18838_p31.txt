For further context, I have   views that precluded Rubio and Cruz from getting my vote:’ "One thing I fear is that if Trump loses, it may be seen as the reverse of what I just said: that America rejected a   candidate (especially if he loses overwhelmingly). Clinton’s victory could be seen as a further vindication for the PC crowd that there is no tolerance for Trump’s type of views, and I fear it will hit other   views. " "
