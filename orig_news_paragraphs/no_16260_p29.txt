If you believe any one of the dozens of accounts and stories    from the many victims of Bill Clinton’s sexual harassment, from Clinton aides like George Stephanopoulos, and from journalists like Carl Bernstein     Hillary Clinton enabled her husband’s behavior, helped cover it up, and then later bullied his victims into keeping quiet. She’s since had to defend her own insistence that every victim of sexual assault be heard and believed. Her uneasy role as a feminist who only fights for women who don’t threaten her stature and grasp of power makes her, at best, a controversial role model.
