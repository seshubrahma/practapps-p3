George W. Bush, unpopular and facing a financial crisis, delivered his final   address in the White House East Room to a crowd of 200 supporters and aides. Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter all used the Oval Office    a setting Obama has long spurned for formal remarks. George H. W. Bush traveled outside of Washington to West Point for a departing address after failing to secure a second term, though he didnâ€™t actually bill it as a farewell. The tradition extends back to George Washington, who issued warnings against unchecked power and partisan entrenchment in a written address to the nation in 1796.
