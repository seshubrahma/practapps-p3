Updated on January 11 at 5:56 p. m. ET,   Donald Trump announced at a press conference Wednesday that he is transferring control of his company to his sons, a plan that falls far short of what ethics experts have advised for the   to prevent conflicts of interest as a result of his business entanglements. The steps announced Wednesday won’t resolve Trump’s potential conflicts of interest, according to Norman Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Obama. " Mr. Trump’s   course will precipitate scandal and corruption," Eisen said in an   arguing that when he assumes the presidency, Trump will be poised to violate a provision of the Constitution intended to prevent foreign governments from buying influence in the U. S. government.​ Later on Wednesday, U. S. Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub denounced Trump’s plans in no uncertain terms.
