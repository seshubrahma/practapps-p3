Despite clear statistical evidence of the effectiveness of walls in tackling illegal migration, Europe’s leading politicians remain wedded to open borders. Federica Mogherini, the EU’s unelected High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security, has insisted that "we have a history and a tradition and an identity based on the fact that we celebrate when walls are broken down and bridges are built". Her statement was seen as a   swipe at U. S. President Donald J. Trump, and was reiterated by the bloc’s Trade Commissioner earlier on Wednesday. The German foreign minister, whose country has absorbed millions of unvetted illegal migrants at a cost of over 20 billion euros and suffered terror attacks as a result, has also told the president that "building walls is a bad idea".
