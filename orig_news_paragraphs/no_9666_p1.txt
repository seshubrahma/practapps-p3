‘ Trump Fish,’ open this week, beckons diners to feast on common carp prepared in traditional Kurdish fashion. Freshly caught from the nearby Duhok reservoir, the fish is slowly baked near open fire for over 1. 5 hours before served whole. Considered less popular fare in America, the carp is a common culinary delight in Europe and Asia.
