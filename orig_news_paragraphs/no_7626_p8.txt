In July, Zinke voted with Democrats to unsuccessfully block a program to transfer federal land to the states. According to a report in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle: Zinke’s crossover vote comes as the Montana Democratic Party and his opponent in the November election, Denise Juneau, try to pin the congressman to his party ’s support for transferring control of federal lands to the states, which, opponents say, is a step toward privatizing public lands. The day after the vote, Zinke announced that he had resigned his post as a nominating delegate at the Republican National Convention over the GOP’s   platform.
