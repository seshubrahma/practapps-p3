According to the Atlantic, former Congressman Becerra was chosen by Governor Jerry Brown to replace the previous Attorney General Kamala Harris, who was elected California’s junior senator in November to support 15 other Democrat Attorney Generals in a united front of forward leaning politics against Trump’s agenda. The Atlantic believes that Attorney General Becerra can play the role against Trump that Texas Attorney General, now Governor, Greg Abbott, and current Attorney General Ken Paxton, played against Obama. Abbott sued the federal government 50 times on issues ranging from Obamacare to the transgender bathroom mandate. Abbott said his job for 8 years was to go work, sue the federal government, and then go back home.
