On Tuesday, another   potential running mate, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, campaigned with Trump in North Carolina. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also introduced the presumptive Republican nominee at a Raleigh rally. Two sources familiar with the vetting process told CNN Wednesday that Corker was "very seriously" being vetted and has submitted a lot of information to Trump’s campaign. He’s on a very short list, the sources added.
