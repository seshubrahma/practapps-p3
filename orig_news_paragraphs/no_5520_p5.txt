The Bow Group, took to Twitter to suggest that had the piece targeted any other minority group as opposed to white males, it would "be the end" of the online publication. Social media users also speculated on the likelihood of Shelley Garland merely being a pseudonym, with some pointing out her lack of presence on the internet besides The Huffington Post. A parody account for Garland created after the article was published joked about the amount of "[white male] tears" shed for the piece, and rejected the notion she was a work of fiction. The implication that I was created by @HuffingtonPost to spread their opinions or that I wasnâ€™t properly vetted is absurd!
