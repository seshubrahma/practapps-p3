 (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign is undergoing more   changes, just two weeks after Trump reshuffled his campaign leadership. The Republican nominee hired David Bossie, the president of the conservative political advocacy group Citizens United, as deputy campaign manager to help steer his campaign in the final months of the election, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway confirmed to CNN Thursday. The campaign’s hire of Bossie adds several decades of national political experience to Trump’s presidential bid, which has faced several weeks of gloomy poll numbers.
