Paul S. Atkins, a former S. E. C. Republican commissioner who has advocated deregulatory policies, is leading Mr. Trump’s effort to select a new chair for the agency and could be a candidate. Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager who supported Mr. Trump’s candidacy, is also advising the transition team. " As the head of the S. E. C. you’ve got to get back into reffing the game properly and end the demonization of Wall Street," Mr. Scaramucci said in an interview last week before his appointment to Mr. Trump’s transition team.
