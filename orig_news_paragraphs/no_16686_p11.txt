The chief said he was not certain whether Scott pointed his gun at officers. Vinson, who was in plain clothes and wearing a CMPD vest, did not have a body camera. Three uniformed officers were wearing cameras, there is also dash cam recordings,  and investigators are reviewing the footage, Putney said.   The mayor said she will be watching video from the incident on Thursday.
