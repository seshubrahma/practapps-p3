For nearly four decades, no American companies could engage in significant business with Iran, which officially considers the United States an archenemy. But with the deal, the country is not only buying aircraft from an American supplier it also means there will be   interaction between Boeing trainers and employees of Iran Air.

His Republican supporters in Congress introduced a bill that attempts to stop sales by Boeing to Iran, obliging the Treasury Department to refuse the licenses needed by American banks to finance such an agreement.
