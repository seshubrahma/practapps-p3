Then there is President Trump. Yes, Republicans have labored to promote some of his priorities and look away from his myriad controversies, but they have also shown signs of holding together with Democrats toward mutual goals that are not always in concert with Mr. Trump’s. To wit: Even as members of both parties railed against one another on the Senate floor on Thursday, appropriators and party leaders in the House and Senate were working to come up with a plan to fund the government for the rest of the year that would most likely ignore Mr. Trump’s request for a large pile of cash to build a wall on the border with Mexico and cut programs that have bipartisan support. While the White House and the House have struggled to find a way forward on health care, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have held largely together in defiance of   changes to the law that would have left many people in their respective states uninsured.
