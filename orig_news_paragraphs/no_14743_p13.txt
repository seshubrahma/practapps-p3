It would also restructure Medicaid and defund Planned Parenthood. It seeks to maintain Obamacareâ€™s protections for people with   conditions, but would allow insurers to charge higher premiums to individuals whose coverage has lapsed. Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski has expressed frustration of the effort to tie Planned Parenthood to the health care measure.
