Chase Strangio, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Manning, said he was "relieved and thankful " Obama commuted her sentence, and Amnesty International also cheered news of Manning’s commutation. " Chelsea Manning exposed serious abuses, and as a result, her own human rights have been violated by the US government for years," Margaret Huang, the group’s executive director, said in a statement.
