Senate Majority Leader     said on Wednesday he   does not yet know how Republicans will amass the votes needed to   pass legislation now being crafted to dismantle Obamacare, but   expressed some optimism on another top priority, overhauling the   tax code. ’ ’    In an exclusive interview with Reuters,    said healthcare and taxes still top the Republican legislative   agenda, and he added that he will not reach out to the minority   Democrats on either one because differences between the two   parties are too stark.
