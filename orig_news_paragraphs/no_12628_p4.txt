Breitbart News reporter Jerome Hudson was recently subject to a tirade of vile, aggressive racial abuse from rapper Talib Kweli Greene, who repeatedly referred to the reporter as a "coon" and an "uncle Tom". Many of Greeneâ€™s followers led a campaign of harassment against Hudson, saying that he was "cooning for money or attention or both".   Weeks later, no action has been taken against those that tweeted the racist and vitriolic comments at Hudson but Dorsey was quick to jump to the defence of Leslie Jones, personally tweeting his support to her after she complained about abuse on the platform.   @Lesdoggg
