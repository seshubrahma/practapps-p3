He’s a somewhat more modest favorite in South Dakota, but Clinton overperformed a bit in caucuses in neighboring Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Wyoming, so I wouldn’t completely write off a Clinton win in a primary there. Next up would be New Mexico, but that ’s both a diverse state and a closed primary. It’s a lot harder for him.
