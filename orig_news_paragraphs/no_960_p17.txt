I find it much easier to simply say "Hey, Google, set a timer for 30 minutes" than to use the   timer on my oven. We also have fun using Google Home for our grocery shopping list. Throughout the week, as we notice things we need at the store, any of us can say, "Hey Google, add orange juice to the shopping list. "
