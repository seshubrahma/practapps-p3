Polls show the law has become somewhat more popular as Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans try to kill it. Under a draft of the bill that became public last week, the government would offer tax credits to help lower the cost of insurance for people who did not have access to coverage through an employer or a government program. The tax credits, as initially proposed, would be available to people regardless of their income. Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee, said the credit should not be available to people with incomes above a certain level, around $118, 000.
