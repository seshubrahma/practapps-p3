The office rejected the request, though the CHP and another minority party, the leftist   People’s Democratic Party (HDP) have compiled a growing list of potential irregularities with the way the election was conducted. Paramount among the list of complaints is the YSK’s decision to accept ballots from voting stations that had not been officially sealed by election staff, a decision that came down around midday, long after Turks began voting. The HDP claims hundreds of ballot boxes unverified through proper sealing means were counted as legitimate, potentially putting the "yes" vote over the   line. In addition to ensuring international leaders maintain their relations with his government after the referendum, Erdogan has some fences to mend following diplomatic   with a number of European nations during the referendum campaign.
