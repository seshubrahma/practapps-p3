The young, photogenic centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, who served as economy minister under outgoing president François Hollande, also gained 24 per cent of their support in the Harris Interactive survey for French radio station RTL. Another 19 per cent of those interviewed wanted the   candidate   Mélenchon to win the presidency and 14 per cent said they were rooting for   Benoît Hamon of the Socialist party. This means that Ms. Le Pen is more popular than both   candidates in the first round of voting among young people. In the second round, they will likely unite against her and she will lose.
