In Michigan, as Breitbart News reported previously, nineteen refugees have been diagnosed with active tuberculosis over the past six years. In June, Patterson wrote a letter to Robert Carey, director of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, "demanding and requesting" that the federal government "consult with" Oakland County officials prior to resettling refugees in the county, as required by the Refugee Act of 1980. Carey told Patterson in response that he had no intention of complying with the law that places a positive burden for consultation on the federal government and Office of Refugee Resettlement, but that Patterson could attend "consultations" held in the state in the future. Pattersonâ€™s announcement has the potential to launch a number of lawsuits against the federal government by county and city governments who have not been consulted by the federal government and Office of Refugee Resettlement prior to the resettlement of refugees within their jurisdiction, as the Refugee Act of 1980 requires.
