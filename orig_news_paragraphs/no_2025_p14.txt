Mr. Serrajâ€™s administration was left to watch helplessly. The United Nations envoy to Libya, Martin Kobler, said he was "extremely alarmed" by the clashes, and Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, said on Monday that the warring factions should rally behind the faltering unity government. Another uncertainty in Libya concerns the policy of the new administration of   Donald J. Trump in the United States. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to defeat the Islamic State but said he was averse to becoming involved in foreign countries.
