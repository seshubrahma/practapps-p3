It was a clear shot at Netanyahu, with whom Obama has had an antagonistic relationship. The Israeli leader once memorably lectured Obama on Jewish history before the cameras in the Oval Office to the fury of the President’s aides. He overtly rooted for Republican Mitt Romney in Obama’s 2012   race and used his extensive contacts on Capitol Hill in an effort to derail the central foreign policy initiative of the President’s second term: the Iran nuclear deal. The Obama administration is leaving no doubt that they believe Trump is putting the United States on an unwise course in the Middle East.
