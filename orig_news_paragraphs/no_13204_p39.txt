this is a political attack on Donald Trump. The university had an A rating from better business bureau. You can go online, see the peoplesâ€™ comments that were enrolled that absolutely loved their experience. If you want to talk about scams, the only scam in education that I am aware of is the scam of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton at Laureate university where Bill Clinton was paid millions of dollars where Secretary Clinton was funneling money to this university.
