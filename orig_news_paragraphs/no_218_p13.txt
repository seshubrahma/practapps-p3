A pioneer of the   tunnel, used to shuttle tens of thousands of tons of drugs into America, he ultimately adapted those feats of secret underground engineering for his escape from the Altiplano prison: a   facility in the State of Mexico where he lived in isolation, under   surveillance by a camera in his cell. On the night of July 11, 2015, shortly before 9 p. m. Mr. Guzmán stepped into his shower and passed through a small hole in its floor, positioned in the camera’s one blind spot. From there, he descended into a   tunnel, equipped with a motorcycle on rails, and raced to freedom. His escape was a stinging embarrassment for the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto, which had trumpeted his capture as a crucial victory in its bloody campaign against the narcotics trade.
