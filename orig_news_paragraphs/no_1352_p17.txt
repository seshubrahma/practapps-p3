" There are at least 50 sets of laws and regulations that exist that China has, at least in spirit, crossed the boundaries," Sam Clovis, an adviser to Mr. Trump, said in an interview. But Mr. Trump would have the difficult task of proving that China is breaking the rules before the World Trade Organization, which polices global commerce. International trade laws limit the type of help governments can provide to companies, but the role of the Chinese government is particularly opaque, said Mark Wu, a professor of law at Harvard and a former United States trade negotiator in the administration of President George W. Bush.
