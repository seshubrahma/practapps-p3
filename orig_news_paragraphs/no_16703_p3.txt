After August, during which Clinton was posting at times   national leads over Trump, the Republican nominee has closed the gap considerably and most surveys show a tight   gap. Yet Clinton still has an easier path to 270 electoral votes, due in no small part to Virginia and Colorado, two states expected to be battlegrounds that Clinton had been thought to have put away early in the race.   Trump would have more paths to the White House should those states become more competitive. Quinnipiac surveyed likely voters from September 13 to September 21, and the margin of error is 3. 9 percentage points in Colorado and Georgia, 3. 8 points in Virginia and 4 points in Iowa.
