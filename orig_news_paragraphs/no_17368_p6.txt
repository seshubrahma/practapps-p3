While it is likely that the Chinese will surrender the drone after a few days, a toothless US response will only embolden further belligerence on Beijingâ€™s part.   The Obama Administration should make clear that if the drone is not returned, then an escalating series of reprisals will be triggered these could include reducing military contacts and disinviting the Chinese navy from RIMPAC naval exercises, considering targeted sanctions against Chinese companies connected to the military and refusing visas for   Chinese.    Should similar offenses occur again, Washington should make clear that it will take further action, including more direct support for nations facing Chinese pressure over their own territorial claims, such as enhanced defense cooperation and expedited supply of defensive equipment. Through it all, Washington must maintain a constant presence in contested waters, including freedom of navigation operations near   territory.
