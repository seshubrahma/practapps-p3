Pence also defended Trumpâ€™s comments that "the generals have been reduced to rubble" under the Obama administration, responding to critics that interpreted those words to mean Trump was putting down the US military.    "I think he was talking about the commander in chief reducing the influence of generals to rubble," Pence said. He added that Trump was describing a "sense that he got recently that in fact our President had not taken all of the counsel of our military advisers in confronting and defeating ISIS. "  Trump has been focusing on his national security policy in the past few days, including announcing that his plan to combat ISIS would include ordering military generals to put together a plan to defeat the terrorist group in his first 30 days.
