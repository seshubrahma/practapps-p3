Despite disparaging Hillary Clinton as lacking the temperament of a winner (a temperament like his, of course) Trump must know that in a    debate, Clinton will crush him.   After all, Clinton is a tough and prepared opponent. If you don’t believe me, listen to someone who has actually gone head to head with Clinton    President Barack Obama, who has regularly called out her toughness as an opponent, most recently in his speech at last week ’s convention.
