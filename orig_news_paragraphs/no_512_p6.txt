Ms. DeVos’s support for charter schools and vouchers  —   which allow students to use taxpayer dollars to pay tuition at private, religious and   schools   —   reflected a deep disconnect from public schools. Neither Ms. DeVos nor any of her children attended a public school. Most Republicans described Ms. DeVos as committed to what is best for children.
