Why isn’t the American left fighting slavery today on a global scale? I won’t say anything about modern slavery involving a lot of child sex trafficking, which is pizza for another day. The real reason is that slavery in America is used to control American politics and continue to drive a wedge between the races, for the political and financial advantage of a small group of   progressive elites. Although there have been divisions within leadership of the black community since the slaves were freed, modern race relations can be traced back to the sixties.
