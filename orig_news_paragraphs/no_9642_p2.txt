A huge 88 per cent of Americans living abroad did not register to vote in the last presidential election, and Avaaz points out that "this massive untapped voting block" is much more likely to be "progressive" because "56 per cent of us [in the UK] have masters degrees" and overwhelmingly donated to Democratic candidates in the last three presidential primaries.   In a press release, Avaaz references a new Oxford University study that found "America’s overseas voters  …     could decide the US presidency in 2016". When combined, the potential 8 million voters around the world, "would make up the 13th largest state" they say. Just 12 per cent of Americans abroad were registered to vote in 2012, and "the reason they don’t vote is that it’s a complicated process for them to register from abroad and many Americans miss the deadline" Meredith Alexander, the Campaigns Director for Avaaz, told Breitbart London.
