Jeremy Hanson Willis, deputy commissioner of Minnesota’s Department of Employment and Economic Development, told the media that he received the company’s notification satisfying a federal mandate to alert state authorities when a mass layoff is occurring. Willis tried to put a brave face on it insisting the laid off workers will be fine. " There are a lot of businesses around the state looking for workers and having a hard time to employ them because we have so few unemployed folks in our state," Willis told the media.
