Financed by Western governments, the White Helmets have saved the lives of more than 75, 000 Syrians, pulling them from the rubble of   buildings and administering emergency first aid. Hala Kamil, a Syrian refugee and mother of four now living in Germany, will also be attending the awards now, too. Mrs. Kamil and her children fled Syria after her husband was kidnapped by the Islamic State. Their ordeal is captured in "Watani: My Homeland," which is also up for best documentary short.
