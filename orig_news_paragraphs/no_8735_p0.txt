Glenn Beck delivered a fiery closing keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) comparing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump to the "Arthur Slugworth" character from Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factory and claiming that the Industrial Revolution "was born" in the United States due to the Constitution. [Beck opened his speech by recounting the story of the 1971 film adaptation of Roald Dahl’s famous children’s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.   He paid special attention to the film’s villainous businessman Arthur Slugworth, who approached the main character Charlie Bucket after the boy had won his golden ticket to enter Wonka’s chocolate factory. Slugworth offered Charlie money if the boy would steal for him a new candy from the factory.
