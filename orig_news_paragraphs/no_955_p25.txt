The   remake of Disneyâ€™s 1991 animated blockbuster "Beauty and the Beast" arrives in theaters this week. But not in Malaysia, where the government demanded that Disney cut a brief scene that shows two men dancing together in a ballroom, saying it promotes homosexuality. (Bill Condon, who directed the film, has called it "an exclusively gay moment. ")
