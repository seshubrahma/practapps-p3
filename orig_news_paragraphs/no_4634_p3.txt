Last week, we reported on "flippy," a   robot that has replaced human fast food workers at a restaurant in California. The next day, news emerged of a new startup using robots to deliver takeout food in Washington D. C. You may have thought the automation of fast food would end at ordering kiosks, but now robots will cook your food and deliver it too. They wonâ€™t ask for minimum wage increases either!
