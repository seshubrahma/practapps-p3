Trump has, despite eons of predictions from the permanent political class in Washington to the contrary, not faded in this election cycle. Trump has remained well atop virtually every poll sans some in Iowa that predict Cruz winning the Hawkeye State —  and has remained in control of the political narrative since very early on in his candidacy. With Rubio fading fast into the crowded establishment column with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie nipping at his heels, the race very well could come down to Trump and Cruz heading into the deeper parts of the primary. Many in the establishment, U. S. News and World Report’s Dave Catanese detailed earlier this week, are begrudgingly preparing for the possibility this race comes down to a battle between the two political outsiders —  both of whom are universally detested by the political class in Washington.
