Trump is "criminalizing the immigrant population," Ramos told CNN’s Michael Smerconish.   US Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted multiple raids this week, its first concerted effort under the new administration to arrest targeted undocumented immigrants for deportation proceedings. " I can’t believe a President, who is the son of an immigrant, suddenly wants to close the door after those who came after him," Ramos said, referring to Trump’s late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born in Scotland.
