tv â€™s Laura Loomer was arrested for running onstage during the Shakespeare in the Park production, while activist Jack Posobiec taped her demonstration and shouted at the crowd: "The blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands!" "Old Right" Several authors at   conservative publications condemned Loomer and Posobiec, arguing that the two infringed on the free speech of Shakespeare in the Park and their tactics were too close to the Occupy of Black Lives Matter movement.    conservatives labeled this faction the "old right," stating that there is no moral equivalence between this disruption and the violence of   protesters in dozens of recent incidents.
