Washington (CNN) Rex Tillerson, the millionaire tapped by Donald Trump to lead the State Department, could have trouble getting Senate confirmation for the job, senior lawmakers tell CNN.   With Democrats and some Republicans expressing doubt about the ExxonMobil CEO, there is a chance that the    Texan might not get past the committee confirmation hearings that lead to a vote on the Senate floor.   If he made it to the full Senate, Tillerson would need the support of a majority of the chamber to become the next secretary of state.
