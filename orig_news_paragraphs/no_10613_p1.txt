The U. S. electronics industry understands this. It keeps at home product design, software development and sophisticated microprocessors but outsources to Asia simpler components and assembly for items like cell phones and laptop computers. Americans would get richer if sales of U. S. products abroad approximately equaled imports, because workers in exporting industries are nearly 11 percent more productive than those competing with imports. Sadly, the trade deals we have signed —  ranging from the comprehensive agreements administered by the World Trade Organization to bilateral pacts like the 2012 free trade agreement with Korea —  have not worked out that way.
