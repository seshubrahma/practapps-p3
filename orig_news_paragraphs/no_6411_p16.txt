In addition, the U. S. Commerce Department announcement welcomed Chinese investment and participation in the SelectUSA Investment Summit set to commence June   in Washington, D. C. Ross stated that the document laying out the ten agreements is an official document signed by both the United States and China. In response to questions on whether these agreements related to diplomatic negotiations with China concerning North Korea, Ross said there was not a quid pro quo in the discussions of these agreements. These ten agreements are merely initial within the   action plan under the framework of the U. S.  Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, according the the Department of Commerce.    Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Commerce Ross and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang lead the negotiations on these issues and objectives for next steps.
