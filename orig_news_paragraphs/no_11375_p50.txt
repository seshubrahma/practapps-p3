To be sure, those were rough times. Most of Jackson’s fellow citizens loved him for his crude and violent ways, even as they recognized his patriotic, unionist core he became a national hero after his smashing 1815 victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson ran for president in 1824 and lost, mostly because so few of his supporters could vote in those days, the voting franchise was severely limited, open only to those who could read and who owned property. Thus Jackson’s "rustics" were mostly excluded.
