Election law officials have expressed concern that Mr. Trumpâ€™s incendiary words will create a   prophecy, all but ensuring claims of fraud from his poll watchers and a delegitimization of the election results should Mrs. Clinton win. " It went from being laughable to be what I consider to be dangerous," said Richard L. Hasen, a professor and election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law. Mr. Hasen said that while it initially seemed Mr. Trump was merely seeking an early scapegoat for a possible loss, his language had taken a darker turn.
