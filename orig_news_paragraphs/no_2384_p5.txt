One of the F. B. I. reports said State Department employees who reviewed nearly 300 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails on the Benghazi attacks in early 2015 in response to requests from Congress had "felt intense pressure" from Mr. Kennedy and other senior State Department officials to complete their review quickly and "not label anything as classified. " Mr. Kennedy was part of a   battle between the State Department and the intelligence agencies over Mrs. Clinton’s emails. As the emails were prepared for release, officials from the intelligence agencies argued in some cases that information in them should have been marked classified, while State Department officials countered that they contained the routine business of American diplomacy.
