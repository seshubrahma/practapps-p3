Sputnik, a Russian   news agency that often  spreads disinformation, said Kuwait had "ripped a page from the playbook of U. S. President Donald Trump" with its own visa ban. But indications soon surfaced that the article was wrong. Pakistanâ€™s ambassador to Kuwait denied that a visa ban had been placed on Pakistanis. And on Feb. 3, Kuwait said in a statement on its state news service, KUNA, that it "categorically denied" that it had stopped issuing visas for some nationalities.
