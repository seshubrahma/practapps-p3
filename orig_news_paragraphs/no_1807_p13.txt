Not wanting to go alone, Ms. Drake said she was accompanied by a couple of female friends. Ms. Drake, who appeared Saturday with the womenâ€™s rights lawyer Gloria Allred, said Mr. Trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission. After returning to her room, Ms. Drake said, Mr. Trump or a man phoning on his behalf offered her $10, 000 to return to his room, which she declined. In a statement, the Trump campaign called the accusation "another example of the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election. "
