There are various groups, organizations, governments, etcetera all have different standards, ways of doing business, values, and systems. I simply find it shameful that people expect to be accommodated by groups that are opposite to themselves. The Citadel is going to waste countless hours and dollars making the school "ready" to accommodate this woman. They shouldnâ€™t have to because they are ready.
