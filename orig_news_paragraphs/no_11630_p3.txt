" Trump has pointed specifically to voter fraud, the decision to "let Crooked [Hillary] off the hook  …     for [her] crime," the questionable practices during the primary process that helped enable Clinton to prevail over Bernie Sanders to become her party’s nominee, and corporate media’s collusion with Clinton’s campaign revealed by WikiLeaks. Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!   —   Donald J.
