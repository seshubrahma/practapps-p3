For U. S. resettlement, the International Organization for Migration and the U. S. Office of Refugee Resettlement work with voluntary agencies such as the International Rescue Committee or Church World Service to resettle refugees. These agencies have offices across the country and resettle refugees across many states. After 90 to 180 days, financial assistance from federal agencies stops. Breitbart News reported in February that U. S. taxpayers would expend more than $4. 1 billion in the 2017 budget to support the 519, 018 refugees resettled in the country since October 2009.
