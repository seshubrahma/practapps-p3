Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has worked to distinguish radical Islamist ideology from moderate Islam and has dismissed the "Islam is a religion of peace" line   —    essentially the bipartisan position of the American political class since the Bush administration  —   as simplistic.
