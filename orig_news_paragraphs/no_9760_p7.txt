San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and others in the NFL and professional sports have taken to sitting or kneeling during the national anthem to protest perceived racism, oppression, and police brutality against African Americans.   Jeremi Duru, a professor of sports law at American Universityâ€™s law school in Washington, D. C. claims sports figures are realizing that they have a powerful stage to express social injustices.   " Throughout the nation, athletes on different levels are finding their voice and recognizing that they have a platform," the lawyer said.
