Trump is an incredibly talented, natural marketer. He was very   good at convincing people they should want to buy Trump   apartments, reasonably good at convincing people they should want   to golf at Trump golf clubs, and for a time quite successful at   getting people to want to watch Trump fire people on television. ’ ’    Trump innately understands certain kinds of consumers, and he   understood things about the electorate that none of his opponents   in the 2016 election did.
