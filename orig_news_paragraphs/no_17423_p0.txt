 (CNN)   Donald Trump’s top defense priorities came to light on Tuesday when Foreign Policy published a memo from Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Brian McKeon and informed by his conversations with the Trump transition team. According to McKeon, Trump’s four priorities will be: "develop a strategy to   ISIS" "build a strong defense" "develop a comprehensive USG cyber strategy" and "find greater efficiencies."    While all these are important priorities, none of them should be his top ones.
