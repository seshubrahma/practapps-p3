Islamic State said in a statement that "caliphate soldiers, strapped with suicide vests and carrying explosive devices and machineguns" struck Zaventem airport and Maelbeek metro station. It was not clear, however, that the attackers used vests. The suspects were photographed pushing bags on trolleys, and witnesses said many of the airport dead and wounded were hit mostly in the legs, possibly indicating blasts at floor level. Officials said the final death tolls remained uncertain from the carnage in the morning rush hour, around 8 a. m. (0700 GMT) at the airport and shortly after 9 a. m. on the metro.
