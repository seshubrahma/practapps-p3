What we must do is connect deeply with other communities of color, critically analyze government policies, and be ready to confront Islamophobia,   bias and   racism, both within and outside our communities.   That means challenging Trump’s proposed "Combating Islamic Extremism" program that will further stigmatize American Muslims and lead to the surveillance of Muslim youth and Muslim organizations. It means raising our voices against the administration’s "law and order" framework that targets black people and strips away civil rights protections. It means supporting undocumented people subjected to raids just as robustly as standing by Indian   workers likely to be harmed by Trump’s forthcoming executive order.
