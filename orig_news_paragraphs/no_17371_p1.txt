A final selection has not been made and there are other candidates who have met with Mattis in recent days, one source cautioned. Trump originally interviewed McCormick as a potential Treasury secretary candidate    a position that ended up going to Trump loyalist and fellow financier Steve Mnuchin. But Trump and his senior advisers were impressed with McCormick’s interview and resume and have been mulling potential   slots for him in the administration, one source said. McCormick served in several senior posts in President George W. Bush’s administration, including as the Treasury Department’s undersecretary of international affairs.
