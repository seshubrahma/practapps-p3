Representative Leonard Lance, a New Jersey Republican who is   of the Congressional Arts Caucus, said that as he tries to marshal support for the arts endowment among his colleagues, he is focusing on the jobs it supports not just in the arts sector but in tourism, restaurants and other fields as well. " I will try to be persuasive that there is a tremendous multiplier effect   â€”   that this brings in revenue to the government," he said.
