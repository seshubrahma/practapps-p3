Flynn, through a lawyer, said that he fully briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency both before and after the trip. The White House insisted late Tuesday that they are withholding no documents. They say they as well as the Department of Defense, Director of National Intelligence  and the FBI received a form letter from the Oversight Committee asking for documents related to his security clearance.   They did not possess that information due to the fact that Flynnâ€™s clearance ran through DOD and had been approved in 2016.
