Washington (CNN) CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Tuesday if President Donald Trump told the FBI to end a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, then it would amount to obstruction of justice. The New York Times first reported Tuesday that former FBI Director James Comey wrote a memo about Trump telling him that Flynn "is a good guy" and the FBI should drop an investigation into Flynn, citing sources who had read the memo.
