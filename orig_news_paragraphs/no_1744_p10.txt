Mrs. Clintonâ€™s speech fit into a broader economic philosophy, endorsed by her closest economic advisers and often referred to as inclusive capitalism, that calls for corporations to put less emphasis on   profits and invest more in employees, the environment and communities. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton reiterated her proposal to raise the minimum wage, strengthen labor unions and offer tax incentives to companies that share profits with employees. She also unveiled two new policies to protect workers, including curbing the use of "forced arbitration" clauses in contracts that prohibit workers and consumers from bringing legal action against companies that have harmed them.
