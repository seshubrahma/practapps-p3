(REUTERS)   —   British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Sunday he would be prepared to meet U. S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, but kept up his criticism of the Republican’s proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States, calling it "very dangerous". [In December Cameron called Trump, potentially the next leader of Britain’s closest ally, "divisive, stupid and wrong" for calling for the ban. Trump fired back, saying he would probably not have a good relationship with Cameron.
