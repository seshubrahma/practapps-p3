Thereâ€™s a distribution company   down here, they know what these kids have been trained in, they   were part of the training effort. Locally, if you go to Texas,   they need welders. If you go to other areas, they need people who   can do construction, plumbing, electrical work. Business has to   be involved locally with civic society, in this case schools, to   get the kids trained to have a job.
