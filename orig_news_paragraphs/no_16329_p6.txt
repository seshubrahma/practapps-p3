Freeman, an Air Force veteran himself, is working with Jim Battin, a former California state senator and now a political consultant. Freeman also spoke with   operative Karl Rove, a friend of Battin, at the Republican National Convention last month, but said he told Rove that the Chandis would strike out on their own and not contribute to any of Roveâ€™s major super PACs. Chandi immigrated to the United States from India and started as a cashier at a convenience store. His company is now valued at $1 billion, Freeman said.
