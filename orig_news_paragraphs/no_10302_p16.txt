Marco Rubio will not be one of those two candidates. Ted Cruz is hated by the Washington establishment of both parties because he actually has a record to prove his conservative principles. He fought on the Senate floor for conservative principles, and they hate him for that —   for repeal of Obamacare, for secure borders, for defunding Obama’s unconstitutional executive orders. The other candidate riding the "tsunami of populist anger" is, we all know, Donald Trump.
