The Secretary of State’s remarks regarding potential military action against North Korea follow remarks in Japan that emphasized a "different approach" to the rogue government in Pyongyang. " Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach," Tillerson noted on Friday in a press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. The Trump administration has hinted at a change in America’s approach towards Pyongyang in other venues, as well.
