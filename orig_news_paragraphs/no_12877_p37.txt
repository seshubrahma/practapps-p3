In particular, Ricardo’s celebration of comparative advantage can be seen as an artifact of his own era, when England enjoyed a massive   advantage in the   game. Smith died in 1790, and Ricardo died in 1823 a lot has changed since then. And yet the two economists were so lucid in their writings that their work is studied and admired to this day. Unfortunately, we can also observe that their ideas have been frozen in a kind of intellectual amber even in the 21st century, free trade and   comparative advantage are unquestioningly regarded as the keys to the wealth of nations —  at least in the U. S. —  even if they are so no longer.
