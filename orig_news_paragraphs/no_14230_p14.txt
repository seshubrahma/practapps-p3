Experts differ on whether the case is a viable one, and Trump lawyer Sheri Dillon said earlier this month that the Constitution’s framers never considered "that paying your hotel bill was an emolument."   Also, the US Supreme Court has has ruled that to sue in federal court, plaintiffs must prove a concrete and particularized injury. CREW has said that Trump is forcing it to "divert essential and limited sources" from its government watchdog role, forcing the organization to litigate the matter and educate the public unless a court stops him.   In a column for The New York Times this week, Norman Eisen and Richard Painter    former White House ethics lawyers who now serve, respectively, as CREW’s chairman and vice chairman    linked the emoluments case to the travel ban.
