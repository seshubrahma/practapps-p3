ISIS has been in control of Mosul since 2014, and the Iraqi civilians who have escaped say life inside is hopeless, that ISIS has destroyed education, culture and ways to make a living.   Theyâ€™re dug in enough with traps and explosives to make the fight a hard one for the Iraqi, American and international forces trying to push them out. ISIS frequently uses car bombs to attack, and until this year, U. S. and coalition forces had to hold back, to get senior military approval before calling in airstrikes.   That process has been sped up, and while a coalition victory appears to be in sight, the cost is hard to count.
