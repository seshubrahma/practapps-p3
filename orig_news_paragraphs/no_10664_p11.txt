Grant would have turned 23 this March. But he will never celebrate another birthday â€”  because of an evil murderer who was let loose by a complicit federal government. The federal government could have saved my son by simply enforcing the law instead, it let a criminal illegal alien who had been convicted of a felony go free to wait for a deportation hearing that never came. Even worse: the    directive came to the U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from our Commander in Chief.
