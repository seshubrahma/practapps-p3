As Forbes reported in 2004: Michael Huston figured his job at   in Cupertino, Calif. was safe. For seven years he had worked on software for big servers, complex stuff for which few people had the right skills. He was pulling in $110, 000 a year and had survived two big mergers  â€¦      In 1998 he had his first brush with offshoring when he and a boss spent a month training a few programmers visiting from India, advising them on spooling software used to send documents to printers.
