Former Senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum said: Judge Gorsuch has proven himself to be one of the great legal scholars of his generation. His rulings on the Circuit Court have shown that he understands our Founders’ intent and will rule with the strict constructionist legal mindset our nation needs. Justice Antonin Scalia was known for his robust legal rulings, and Judge Neil Gorsuch will surely follow in his footsteps. Carl Anderson of the Knights of Columbus said: We applaud the president’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.
