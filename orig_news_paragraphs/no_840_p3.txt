Market history shows how remarkable that performance is. The current bull run is now the second longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group, a research firm. It is surpassed in duration only by one that ran from December 1987 to March 2000. In terms of strength, it ranks third, well behind that   bull market, which had an   gain of 582 percent, but not very far from one that lasted from June 1949 until August 1956, in which the market rose 267 percent.
