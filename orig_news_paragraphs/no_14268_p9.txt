In the latest operation, US Marines aboard the USS Makin Island in the Gulf of Aden were standing by to assist and multiple   Osprey aircraft were sent to rendezvous with the Navy SEALs and help evacuate the wounded. But one of the Ospreyâ€™s suffered a technical malfunction at the landing zone and was forced to make a "" which resulted in three US service members being injured, none of them seriously. The aircraft was deemed unrecoverable and the military conducted an airstrike to destroy the Osprey in order to prevent its technology from falling into enemy hands. Secretary of Defense James Mattis was attending the Alfalfa Dinner, an elite social gathering in Washington, at the time of the raid and was informed that the US had suffered casualties during the operation.
