In a letter to Mr. Trump and congressional leaders this month, the two biggest hospital trade groups warned of "an unprecedented public health crisis" and said hospitals stood to lose $165 billion through 2026 if more than 20 million people lose the insurance they gained under the law. They predicted widespread layoffs, cuts in outpatient care and services for the mentally ill, and even hospital closings. Here in Pennsylvania, where the health law has brightened the financial outlook of hospitals statewide, many are scrambling to assess how repeal would affect their bottom line and the patients they serve. The stakes are particularly high for   hospitals like Temple, but even more prosperous hospitals face uncertainty after investing in new ways to deliver care under the law.
