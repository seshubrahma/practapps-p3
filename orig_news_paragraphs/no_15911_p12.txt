Not winning, "Even Mattis himself has acknowledged that the US is ’not winning’ the war against the Taliban, and the administration has not provided any explanation on how sending a few thousand more troops will reverse that course," Miles said.   He noted that Afghanistan’s problems    longstanding tribal and regional feuds, poverty, rampant corruption    remain unsolved after 16 years of war and considerable American blood and treasure, and likely can’t be resolved with a military response. That sort of larger strategic vision and a larger strategy is important, said Michael Eisenstadt, a former US military analyst and now director of the Military and Security Studies program at the Washington Institute.   Eisenstadt sees no problems with giving Mattis authority over troop levels.
