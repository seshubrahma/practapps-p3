In September, Facebook censored an iconic photograph that featured a naked    girl fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. Mr. Zuckerberg said the image, titled "The Terror of War," was rightly censored by Facebook at the time because the companyâ€™s content policies did not allow child nudity. Facebook users disagreed, arguing that the photograph was not titillating but rather illustrated the perils of modern warfare. The social network eventually allowed the image to be posted on its site, noting that it had inherent news value.
