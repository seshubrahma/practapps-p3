The anger and excessive panic among the American people after the   attacks allowed the Bush administration to violate the Constitution    by detaining people indefinitely without trial, conducting expanded and warrantless surveillance, authorizing torture and kangaroo military tribunals, and claiming dictatorial powers far beyond what the Constitution gave the president.   For example, Bush’s team disregarded parts of congressionally passed laws in the name of national security. Ironically, in an effort to allegedly protect our freedoms, the administration took measures that actually eroded American freedoms.   Fast forward to today, and the overblown furor over Trump’s inartful counterpunch has obscured the candidate’s momentous comments about terrorism at the Republican National Convention.
