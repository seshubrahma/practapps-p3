…      Our legislation is not a   or   proposition  —   we welcome input and ideas from Mr. Crane and other law enforcement officials as the Senate works to improve the proposal  …      Ultimately, we share Mr. Crane’s frustrations with the current, broken immigration system and his frustrations with the current Administration’s failure to enforce our laws. That is why we’re working to fix the system, and why we want law enforcement’s input.
