Washington (CNN)   Donald Trump’s transition team asked the government about the possibility of getting Donald Jr. Eric and Ivanka Trump, along with Jared Kushner, his   man and Ivanka Trump’s husband, permission to receive top security clearance, according to a transition source. But the inquiry, which was first published by CBS News, has not yet led to any action. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said no official request has been made.
