President Obama and Hillary Clinton has trouble figuring out what to do with him as his opponents had trouble dealing with him throughout the primary. I am in agreement with  Reince Priebus, it is difficult to understand what the electorate wants. I will tell you I got off a plane in Cleveland a couple days ago to give a commencement address and a senior executive came over and said, my wife is with Trump and I’m with Trump and don’t you talk down to Trump people because we want an earthquake.
