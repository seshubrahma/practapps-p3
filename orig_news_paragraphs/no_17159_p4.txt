" DeVos chairs the American Federation for Children, a group that promotes charter school education, and also served on the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a group led by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush    one of Trumpâ€™s GOP primary opponents    which promoted both school choice and the Common Core education standards.

DeVos insisted in the post on her website that she supports "high standards, strong accountability and local control."
