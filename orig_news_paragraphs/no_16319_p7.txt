ISIS has had to resort to inspiring attacks because they have difficulty reaching the faraway United States, which in any event has fewer unintegrated and radicalized Muslims. In contrast, countries in Europe    France, Germany, and Belgium    are a lot closer to Middle Eastern and African zones of conflict and have more directly felt the consequences of U. S.  military interventions in Iraq and Syria, in which they are also participating. France has had the biggest problem with blowback terrorism, which has led French President Francois Hollande to   attribute the attacks to Franceâ€™s reputation as a cradle of human rights and democracy. Yet the reality is that France, like the United States, has an interventionist policy in Islamic countries.
