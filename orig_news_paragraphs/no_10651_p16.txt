If Ford or another company announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone —   even though it’s not very presidential for me to be calling the head of a company, but it’s so easy. I will call the executives   …      [and] tell them that if they want to do that   …      we will charge a 35 percent tax when they try to ship their products back across what will be a very strong border.
