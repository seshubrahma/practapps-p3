In fact, in its   inwardness, progressivism is akin to philosophy, even theology. Yes, thatâ€™s a safe enough statement: In its   totality, progressivism is a kind of secular religion. And so just as Christians believe that everyone is a sinner, well, so do secular progressives. The difference, of course, is that a Christian seeks forgiveness from God, while a  a progressive might seek absolution by resolving not to think implicitly biased thoughts, and, of course, by  spending more tax money on immigrants.
