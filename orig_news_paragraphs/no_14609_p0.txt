 (CNN) An outgoing career ambassador urged his colleagues on Friday to defend the   world order in which the US supports a Europe "whole, free and at peace," a thinly veiled critique of the Trump administration, which has questioned the importance of the transatlantic alliance. Ambassador Daniel Fried, the outgoing coordinator for sanctions policy, did not mention President Donald Trump or speak directly to his policies, but the State Department officials present understood his meaning when he said "we are not an   with identity rooted in shared blood. " "The option of a white man’s republic ended at Appomattox," he said in a farewell address at the State Department, referencing the 1865 battle that led to the surrender of the Confederate army and ended the Civil war.
