11:28   —   New York Times names the guy who’s willing to spend a bunch of money on a Draft Ryan effort: Earle Mack, a   businessman and former ambassador under President George W. Bush, is the major force behind a "super PAC" that is attempting to draft the Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and speaker of the House, as the party’s presidential nominee. Mr. Mack said in an interview that he would spend up to $1 million on "The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan," which was formed last week, but has kept its backers secret until now.
