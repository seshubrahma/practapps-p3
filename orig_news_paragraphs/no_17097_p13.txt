Two people working with Rogers were also out: Matthew Freedman, a former DIA innovation adviser and former Bush transition official, was focused on the National Security Council, and Kevin O’Connor, a former Bush administration official at the Department of Justice, was working on DOJ.   Freedman was fired in part for using his company’s email address to make foreign contacts on behalf of the Trump transition, a source familiar said. O’Connor was said to be pushed out for his connections to the old transition leadership.   Energy lobbyist Mike McKenna, who had been tasked with the Energy Department was also out over leaks, according to a source.
