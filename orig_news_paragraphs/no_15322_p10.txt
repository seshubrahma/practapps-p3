The protest, dubbed "Corporate Backers of Hate," targets companies who have cultivated ties to President Donald Trump’s administration and stand to profit off his policies, said Daniel Altschuler of Make the Road New York, which helped organize the protest.   At least four members of the group, which focuses on workers’ rights, were among those arrested.   A NYPD spokesman later told CNN that a total of 32   arrest were made. Most of those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct, he said.
