A provision called the   Amendment, which has been included in every Foreign Operations budget act since 1985, already makes it illegal for US taxpayer dollars to fund groups that fund abortion. But President Donald Trump on January 23 signed an executive order that directed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to ensure that US tax dollars donâ€™t fund groups or programs that "support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. " Tillerson, who is cutting the State Department budget by 28% made a determination that the directive applied to UNFPA, which the US helped found in 1969.
