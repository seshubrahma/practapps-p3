The three Sunni Gulf countries    Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE    moved with Egypt to cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar, host to the one of the Pentagon’s largest military bases in the Middle East and a linchpin in the fight against ISIS.   Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking to reporters shortly before Trump’s remarks, said the Gulf countries’ land and air blockade of Doha is hurting the campaign against ISIS, an assessment Pentagon officials only partially corroborated.   " The blockade is hindering US military actions in the region and the campaign against ISIS," Tillerson said, without providing details.
