But the apology did not quell the firestorm. Several Republicans, including Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, formally pulled their support of Trump on Saturday morning. And the Republican National Committee put a temporary pause on its mail operations aiding Trump’s campaign in terms of messaging to assess the current situation and decide if they need to change their message on mailings and other     operations, a top RNC official told CNN. Republican sources say one option under consideration is ending the joint fundraising agreement between the party and Trump’s campaign so the RNC could focus its fundraising exclusively on critical   races and encourage donors who were opposed to Trump to continue to support the party.
