Wasserman Schultz, Benardo, and Renteria told the Post that they were never interviewed by the FBI on the matter. The Post claimed that the FBI provided Lynch with a "defensive briefing" on the alleged document in which she was reportedly cooperative, in contrast to a report from this week describing a very different kind of meeting with Lynch. The Post reported: About a month after Comeyâ€™s announcement, FBI officials asked to meet privately with the attorney general. At the meeting, they told Lynch about a foreign source suggesting she had told Renteria that Clinton did not have to worry about the email probe, because she would keep the FBI in check, according to people familiar with the matter.
