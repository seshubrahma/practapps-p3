Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump â€™s administration is drafting an executive order to investigate the extent to which the unfair dumping and subsidization of certain imports adds to the US trade deficit. If the results of the investigation show an impact, it could lead to more tariffs on imported goods, an administration official told CNN. The investigation could result in "everything from no action at all to the levying of supplemental duties," the official said.
