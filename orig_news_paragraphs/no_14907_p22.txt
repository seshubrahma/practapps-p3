Vice President Mike Pence met Friday afternoon with members of the Freedom Caucus at the Capitol Hill Club, a source familiar with the meeting said.

Essential health benefits and why they matter, "Weâ€™ve emboldened them," one White House aide said. Rep. Leonard Lance,   Jersey, said that without a doubt, the decision to concede the repeal of essential health benefits to the Freedom Caucus definitely moved some of his colleagues to "no."
