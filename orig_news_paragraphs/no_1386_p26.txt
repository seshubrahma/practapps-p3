Mr. Trump’s allies dismiss the criticism as politically motivated and historically suspect. The former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who has said he would consider being Mr. Trump’s running mate, said in an interview that he was "deeply offended" by what he called "utterly ignorant" comparisons. " Trump does not have a political structure in the sense that the fascists did," said Mr. Gingrich, a onetime college professor who earned his doctorate in modern European history.
