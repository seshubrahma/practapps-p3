Guterres "wishes a quick recovery to those injured and hopes that the perpetrators of this horrific terrorist act will be swiftly identified and brought to justice," said the spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric.   The US State Department also issued a rebuke, calling the bombings "barbaric attacks on Christian places of worship." "The United States will continue to support Egypt’s security and stability in its efforts to defeat terrorism," said acting spokesperson Mark Toner.   The bombings came days after US President Donald Trump welcomed Sisi to Washington and expressed his support for Egypt.
