Mr. Abdul Kareem said he believed that he was on the list because he had nearly been killed in airstrikes five times in the last year, at least one of them from a drone, according to court papers. According to Clive Stafford Smith, the Founder of Reprieve, Mr. Abdul Kareem was also informed by a Turkish intelligence official that the United States was seeking to kill him. Mr. Zaidan, who has both Pakistani and Syrian citizenship, thinks he is on the list based on documents from the National Security Agency leaked by Edward J. Snowden and published by The Intercept. The documents appear to be slides from a presentation about a technology that uses metadata from cellphones to identify couriers for Al Qaeda.
