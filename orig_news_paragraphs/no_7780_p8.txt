In 2008, Sen. Barack Obama (D. .) beat Sen. John S. McCain III (R. .) with 54 percent to McCain’s 44 percent. Inside the poll, there is a strong indication that Pennsylvania voters are looking for change.    percent of Pennsylvania voters polled said America is going in the wrong direction with 37 percent saying the country is going in the right direction. It is a result that lines up with when the respondents were asked if the next president should continue the policies of the Obama administration or make a change, 57 percent said change and 37 percent said to continue Obama policies —  an interesting twist for the man, who was the "Change" candidate in 2008.
