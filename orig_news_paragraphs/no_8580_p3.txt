The AP fails to put the   hate crime statistic into context, as Breitbart Texas did, showing that   are more than twice as likely to see hate crimes against them. In 2015, Jews saw 695 total offenses, while Muslims experienced less than half that amount with 301 reported offenses. The AP also failed to note that Americans of Middle Eastern descent saw far fewer hate crimes in 2015 than other   with 47 offenses reported by law enforcement. Additionally, the AP did not point out the FBIâ€™s data showing gay men, specifically, are more than twice as likely to be victims of a hate crime as Muslims, with over 750 offenses reported in 2015 alone.
