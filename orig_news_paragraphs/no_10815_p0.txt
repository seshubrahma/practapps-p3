The dismal May jobs numbers the Labor Department reported Friday "is unacceptable," according to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. ["This devastating jobs report showing the weakest hiring in five years is the latest indication we need to move away from the failed Obama policies Hillary Clinton is promising to continue," Priebus said in a statement. " The percentage of Americans in the labor force is the smallest since 1978, and last month 12 times more people gave up looking for work than found a job. "
