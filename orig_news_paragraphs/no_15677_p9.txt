In Saudi Arabia, Arab leaders praised Trump’s calls for a fiercer fight against terrorism    and welcomed the quickly vanishing human rights conditions on arms deals    but made no firm commitments about increasing their military effort in the fight against ISIS. And in Brussels, NATO leaders chafed at Trump’s lecture, which did not acknowledge member states’ recent increases in military spending nor did it include a reaffirmed US commitment to the alliance’s mutual defense pledge, in light of Trump’s disparaging comments about the alliance during his campaign. US alliance with Gulf states reaffirmed    and human rights take a backseat, Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia and his meetings with a slew of Middle Eastern leaders served to firmly mark the return to a foreign policy centered on alliances with Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states and away from a rapprochement with Iran.   To the delight of his hosts, Trump railed against Iran in Saudi Arabia and promised to work closely with partners in the region to combat the cloak of Iranian influence spreading throughout the Middle East.
