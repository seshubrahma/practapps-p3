How many voters really want four years of such   cronyism orchestrated out of the White House? Our true national scandal is not that Clinton has so far escaped indictment, it is that so many of our civic and political institutions have been corrupted by a misguided loyalty to the Clinton crime syndicate. From the board rooms of Wall Street to the editorial boards of local newspapers and the town halls of the League of Women Voters, the defense of the "progressive cause" has come down to defending the indefensible  —     cronyism, open borders  and national security breaches on a global scale. A full chronicle of Hillary Clinton’s crimes will someday fill a large shelf of books, if not a whole library.
