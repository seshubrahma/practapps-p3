SHANGHAI   —    President Trump appeared to follow through on Friday on his promises to get tough on trade with China, less than a week before he is to meet with President Xi Jinping of China. In two executive orders, Mr. Trump called for tighter enforcement of tariffs imposed in   and   trade cases, as well as a comprehensive review of the United States trade deficits  —   measures that reflect America’s economic tensions with China.
