Imagine George W. Bush appointing Karl Rove to the principals   committee. Or Barack Obama appointing David Axelrod. It would   never have happened. And even if it had happened, it would have   been far less disquieting than appointing Bannon, because Rove   and Axelrod are far more mainstream figures than he is.
