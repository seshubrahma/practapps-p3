Many of the documents WikiLeaks has published are classified, such as a C. I. A. tutorial on how to maintain cover in foreign airports. But what may be WikiLeaksâ€™ most intriguing release of secret documents involved what is, on the surface, a less sensational topic: trade negotiations. From November 2013 to May 2016, WikiLeaks published documents describing internal deliberations on two trade pacts: the   Partnership, which would liberalize trade between the United States, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim countries, and the Trade in Services Agreement, an accord between the United States, 21 other countries and the European Union. Russia, which was excluded, has been the most vocal opponent of the pacts, with Mr. Putin portraying them as an effort to give the United States an unfair leg up in the global economy.
