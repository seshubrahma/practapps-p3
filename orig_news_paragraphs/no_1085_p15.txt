In the interim, however, lawyers at Edelson PC, a     firm that has become notorious among tech companies for its prolific filing of privacy suits, have gone on offense with a lobbying campaign of their own. Firm lawyers have also helped found a new nonprofit group, the Digital Privacy Alliance, as an advocate for privacy legislation in Illinois and elsewhere. " We were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive," said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC.
