Richard W. Painter, chief ethics counsel under President George W. Bush, said Ms. Conway’s conduct would not have been tolerated in that administration. Recent events show that the president and the people close to him do not intend "to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business," he said. Of Mr. Trump’s aides, Mr. Painter said, "Instead of trying to push him back on this, they’re jumping in this and shilling for the businesses alongside him. "
