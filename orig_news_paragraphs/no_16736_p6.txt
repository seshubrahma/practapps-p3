What has changed, though, is the   nature of the coverage, its intrusiveness and the overexposure that tends to suck the aura of mystery away from our leaders. FDR gave four fireside chats during his first year, and Americans hung on every word. Barack Obama delivered more than 500 speeches and sets of remarks during his, and yet for all that effort it’s doubtful whether many people listened to more than a few.   It’s also stunning to consider that immediately after President John F. Kennedy addressed the nation during the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the networks (all three of them) returned to normal programming.
