No question, Streep’s emotional speech was delivered with tremendous dignity and made a very good point    one proven by Trump’s nasty reply: The man cast as the next president of the United States can be mean and petulant. Even if he’s innocent of parodying people with disabilities, he’s upset plenty of minorities in his campaign for the White House. Some Mexican immigrants, remember, are "rapists" and "killers," according to him. Black people should vote for him because they have nothing to lose.
