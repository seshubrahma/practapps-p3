Gen. James Mattis also cleared one early procedural hurdle in his confirmation as the Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of giving him a waiver to a law barring military officials from becoming defense secretary within seven years of their military service.   The Senate’s   vote, following the Senate Armed Services Committee’s bipartisan   vote, also signaled Mattis would likely face little opposition to his confirmation. Much of Mattis’ hearing focused on areas where Trump and Mattis might diverge in views.   At the top of the hearing, Mattis took a hard stance against Russia and Putin in answering a question from   hawk, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain.
