The state of Washington argued before Judge James Robart that the restraining order should be issued to stop any harm while it pursues its case. The state’s lawyers argued that it is likely to ultimately prevail in this case because the executive order violates the Constitution and federal law. Among the offended legal principles, they contend, are the Equal Protection Clause the Establishment Clause Due Process and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).   It offered detailed reasons why each of these were violated by the administration’s order, which blocks citizens of seven   countries from coming to the United States for 90 days, prohibits all refugees for 120 days and places an indefinite halt to admission of refugees from Syria.
