Richard Fontaine, former foreign policy advisor to Republican Sen. John McCain, and Michael Morell, who worked for both Obama and Bush, were also at the meeting. Clinton has pointed to her four years as secretary of state as one of her major qualifications to be president. Many of the participants at Friday’s meeting    including former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, former CIA Director David Petraeus and former director of the National Counterterrorism Center Matt Olsen    served with Clinton in the Obama administration. Clinton on Friday said when it comes to foreign policy, partisanship simply doesn’t work.
