That case was settled in May. In the settlement, Prevezon did not acknowledge any wrongdoing and the U. S. government agreed not to pursue the company in any further litigation tied to this case.   Another related asset forfeiture case is still ongoing in Switzerland where authorities have relied on evidence turned over by Alexander Perepilichny, a Russian expatriate who confessed to having been the principal money launderer for the Klyuev Group before he broke ties with it. The evidence showed Credit Suisse bank accounts in Switzerland where some of the stolen money had been deposited.
