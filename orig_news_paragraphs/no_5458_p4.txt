"Now more than ever, as   Islamophobia, racism, and other hatreds have exploded online, it’s critical that we are bringing    technology and resources to this fight. That’s why we will build this center in Silicon Valley, and why we are so grateful to Omidyar Network for providing seed funding for this effort," Greenblatt stated. " This is a natural extension of the   work ADL has been doing for decades and builds on the new presence we established last year in the Valley to collaborate even closer on the threat with the tech industry," Greenblatt added.
