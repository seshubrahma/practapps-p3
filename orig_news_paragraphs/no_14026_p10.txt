Trump gets to appoint 129 individuals on his own to the Executive Office of the President, while only 22 require Senate approval. There are other federal entities which also are overwhelmingly appointed without Senate approval.   All but one appointment to the Securities and Exchange commission are done without confirmation (though no more than three commissioners can be from the same party) as are all but one appointee at the Library of Congress.   Other agencies that primarily have appointments without Senate approval include the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, the Commission on Civil Rights, the Arctic Research Commission, and the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled.
