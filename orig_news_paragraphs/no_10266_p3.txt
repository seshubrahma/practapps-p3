I remember well how State Department offices were told by Powell’s and Armitage’s staffs not to share any information with Bolton and his staff about Iraq war planning. Looking back on this, Bolton believes Powell did him a favor. He says on pages   of his 2007 book Surrender is Not an Option: I played no significant   role on Iraq policy, because Powell and Armitage largely excluded me from these issues, no doubt fearing that my views would be similar to Cheney’s and Rumsfeld’s and not their own.   It was the greatest favor Powell ever did for me, utterly unintentionally, to be sure, and my   activities were only at the margins of the central decisions.
