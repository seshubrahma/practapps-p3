Where is the exit strategy if you buy into this [idea that one must vote for one of the major parties]? It means that in every election we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving Wall Street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy  â€¦      there is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. It means with each race we come closer and closer to the cliff. "
