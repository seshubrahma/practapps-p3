Trump must also disregard the Senate’s traditional "blue slip" process, which gives Senators a quiet veto over nominees to judicial seats in their states. Democrats used that process to push President George W. Bush to nominate progressive judges to   states during his eight years in the White House. One of Bush’s "blue slip" progressives judges blocked Trump’s Executive Order in Washington State by declaring that universities and companies can ask judges to override Presidents’ curbs on immigration. Trump and the GOP Senators "have to override that"   veto, Spakovsky said.
