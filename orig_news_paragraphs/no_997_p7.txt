A new weekly series, hosted by a leader of the Brexit movement, Steve Hilton, will focus on   populism. Mr. Napolitano, who keeps a residence in Manhattan at Trump International Hotel  Tower on Central Park West, did not respond to inquiries on Friday. But Mr. Johnson, who was himself once a Fox News contributor, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Napolitano called him on Friday and requested that he speak to The New York Times. Mr. Johnson said he was one of the sources for Mr. Napolitanoâ€™s claim about British intelligence.
