The     suggestion that I ever worked in concert with anyone to release     hacked emails or sought to undermine the interests of     the United States is false.    ’ ’      Despite the constant scrutiny and innuendo, there are no facts     or evidence supporting these allegations, nor will there be. I     am disappointed that anyone would give credence to allegations     made by individuals with clear political motives in a blatant     attempt to discredit me and the legitimacy of the election of     President Trump.
