That was how Thomas Jefferson became president in 1800. No candidate gained a majority, and the U. S. House eventually elected Jefferson on the   ballot, after weeks of debate. The Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution added one more condition: If the election goes to the House, the House may only consider the top three candidates from the Electoral College that resulted from the normal election process. The House cannot bring in any "white knight" who was not already running on Election Day.
