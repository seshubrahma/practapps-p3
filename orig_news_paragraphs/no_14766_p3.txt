Among other issues, the group does not like the part of the bill that changes the ratio for what insurance companies can charge customers based on age.   Under Obamacare, insurance companies can charge up to three times more for someone older    and more likely sicker    compared with their younger, and presumably healthier, counterparts.   The new legislation would allow insurers to charge older customers up to five times as much as younger customers. The bill gives states the latitude to change that ratio, so states like Vermont, which has a 1 to 1 age rating, can keep their arrangements.
