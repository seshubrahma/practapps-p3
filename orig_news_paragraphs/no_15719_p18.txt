I certainly hope that is true. A recent report from Climate Action Tracker, a research group, finds China and India    the other two of the top three global climate offenders    are doing so much better than expected at cutting their emissions that the agreement can survive and meet its goals without US participation, at least temporarily.   The risk remains, however, that the Paris Agreement falls apart without the United States.   A   partnership on climate action is the main reason the world agreed to this accord.
