Trumpâ€™s campaign had just $1. 3 million in the bank as of May 31, according to CNN. Clinton has dominated Trump in Hollywood fundraising, where she has raised more than $12 million from entertainment industry hotshots including Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katezenberg, Haim Saban, J. J. Abrams, Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand and Morgan Freeman. The presumptive Democrat nominee also counts the support of several   Hollywood bundlers like Howie Mandel (not the TV star) and CAA agent Michael Kives. Trump, meanwhile, has raised just $156, 000 from the entertainment industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
