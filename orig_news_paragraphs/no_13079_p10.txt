Mensch has not yet added an editor’s note to another Heat Street article contradicting the far left’s "white nationalism" narrative. Last week, contributor William Hicks posted a piece sarcastically calling pop stars Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj white supremacists for spreading Pepes on their social media accounts. This article was likely pushing back on the political left’s claim that Donald Trump’s son is a racist for posting a Pepe on his Instagram. Mensch is now putting the full force of her editorial authority behind that   narrative.
