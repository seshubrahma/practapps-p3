The electoral recriminations keep rolling in. A former Breitbart News reporter claimed last night on Facebook that he planted Clinton hecklers at her rallies, and has since deleted the post. The gunman who stormed a Washington pizzeria on Sunday confirmed that he was motivated by online articles that convinced him that the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, "was harboring sex slaves" and that he was "armed to help rescue them," according to documents released at his arraignment. After the suspect, Edgar M. Welch, "found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant," he surrendered peacefully, the documents said.
