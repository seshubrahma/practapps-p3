The former secretary of state stressed open communication between the Trump administration and Russia, acknowledging that she believes it "certainly looks" like relations between the United States and the Kremlin are at their worst levels since World War II.   " I do think it’s important to have a functional relationship with Russia, to tell them what’s acceptable and what’s not. I think the phone calls are fine," she said of Trump’s relationship with President Vladimir Putin.
