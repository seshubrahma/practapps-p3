In February, Culberson provided Attorney General Lynch with a list of more than 300 sanctuary cities compiled by the Center for Immigration Studies. From that list, the Department of Justiceâ€™s Office of Inspector General compiled a   list of sanctuary jurisdictions. Those jurisdictions receive about 65 percent of federal law enforcement grants managed by the DOJ he said. Those jurisdictions include the entire states of California and Connecticut Orleans Parish in Louisiana  New York City Philadelphia Cook County, Illinois   County, Florida Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Clark County, Nevada.
