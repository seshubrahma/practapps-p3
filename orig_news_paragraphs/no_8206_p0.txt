Facebook is developing a feature that will promote content in people’s news feeds from publishers specifically chosen by the company, according to a report from Business Insider. [The feature, which will be known as Collections, will reportedly promote news stories, videos, and other content from publishers "handpicked" by Facebook.   Business Insider, who say they have spoken to people involved in the project as well as seeing internal Facebook documentation, reports that Facebook are planning on approaching their preferred media companies in the coming weeks. As a result of the Collections system, partner companies chosen by Facebook will achieve a far greater reach to Facebook’s 1. 8 billion user base than they would normally.
