A few have said they want to have voice communications only over secure voice apps. How do you keep on top of President Trump’s Twitter? Having covered the White House since the beginning of 2009, I’m definitely having to adjust to a new rhythm. I have about a dozen Twitter accounts set to alert me to every tweet, including the @POTUS and @RealDonaldTrump accounts, as well as the president’s senior staff like @Presssec (Sean Spicer) @KellyannePolls and others.
