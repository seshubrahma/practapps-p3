At least one pedestrian is thought to have jumped into the Thames to escape being hit.   The suspects are then believed to have jumped from the van and proceeded on foot toward the nearby area of Borough Market, one of the capitalâ€™s most popular nightlife spots.   " Borough Market is in the heart of a strong, diverse and creative community, a community that supports each other and will pull together to show solidarity in the face of this callous attack, " Donald Hyslop, chairman of the Borough Market trustees, said in a statement.
