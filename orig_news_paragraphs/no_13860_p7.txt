The intelligence community also assessed "with high confidence" that the GRU provided WikiLeaks with the material they obtained from hacking the Democratic National Committee and top Democratic officials. US intelligence agencies also noted in the report that the Russian influence campaign was not limited to the cyberhacking and release of private documents that drew headlines during the presidential campaign. The report stated that the campaign blended cyberhacking intelligence operations with overt propaganda efforts carried out by   media outlets and paid social media users. The propaganda efforts included Russian   media outlets like Russia Today and Sputnik casting Trump as "the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets" as well as Russian propaganda officials casting Trump during the campaign as a victim of the US political establishment.
