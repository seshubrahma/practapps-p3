Some have questioned the legitimacy of the  ’s victory, noting that although Trump won the required number of votes in the Electoral College, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. Since Election Day, many have expressed fears of bigotry and racial violence against minorities, amid incidents of harassment, slurs and hate crimes.

As for the demonstrations against him, Trump has said reaction to them represents a "double standard" and blamed the media for inciting them.
