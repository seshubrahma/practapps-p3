Congressman Massie said that despite the contention of critics, such as Rep. Maloney, the Federal Reserve is not independent. He said: They say that the Fed needs to remain independent and frankly we have no idea if the Fed is independent between Wall Street and the Treasury. The Federal Reserve was set up to be a second treasury. Is the motivation for the Fed good monetary policy or is it to make Wall Street money?
