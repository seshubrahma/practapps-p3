Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly also supported the move. Iraq was removed from the revised travel ban executive order after intensive lobbying from the Iraqi government at the highest levels, according to a senior US official.   That included a phone call between Trump and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   on February 10 and an   conversation between Abadi and Vice President Mike Pence in Munich on February 18. Those conversations were followed by discussions between Tillerson and members of the Iraqi government about vetting measures in place that would prevent suspected terrorists from leaving Iraq and coming to the United States.
