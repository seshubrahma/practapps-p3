Among the fouler means the Remoaners have sought to use to get their way is to try to blacken the motives and character of anyone who voted Brexit, while claiming for themselves the moral high ground as ordinary decent people who represent the "British values" of tolerance and fairness and who are appalled by the supposed outbreak of   "hate crimes" in a country they claim not to recognise anymore.
