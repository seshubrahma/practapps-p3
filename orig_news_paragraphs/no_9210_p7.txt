Johnson opposes gun prohibition laws that disarm Americans, including gays, and Trump favors more vetting of immigrants from Muslim countries that practice terrorism including   genocide. Since Johnson’s nomination three weeks ago he has been endorsed by two elected officials: Nebraska state senator Laura Ebke, who switched parties from the GOP to the LP, and Paden, West Virginia Mayor Joel Davis, who was elected in June after having served on the city council. Much is riding on Johnson’s performance at the Town hall.   Among Libertarian Party activists, a number express hope that Johnson will mature and become more substantial at the Town hall and in the rest of the campaign, and that Governor Weld will provide an influence in that direction.
