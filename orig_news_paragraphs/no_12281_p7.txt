The analysis shows national competitiveness on Trump’s part, meaning that like Romney —  and better than Romney so far —   Trump can win everywhere in the country, rather than just regionally like Cruz. States and territories where Romney’s 2012 vote totals outperformed Trump’s 2016 totals were: Washington, D. C. Utah, North Carolina, Kentucky, Puerto Rico, Texas, Vermont, Wyoming, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U. S. Virgin Islands. It’s worth noting that D. C. went from a primary in 2012 to a convention in 2016, something that significantly decreases turnout.
