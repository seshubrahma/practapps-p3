Mr. Trump denied every allegation. When Ms. Zervos made her claim in October, saying that Mr. Trump had kissed and groped her without her consent during encounters at his office in New York and at a hotel in Los Angeles, Mr. Trump said he never met her "at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately," and accused Ms. Zervos and other women of lying, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in New York State Supreme Court. " But it was Donald Trump who was lying when he falsely denied his predatory misconduct with Summer Zervos, and derided her for perpetrating a ‘hoax’ and making up a ‘phony’ story to get attention," the lawsuit says.
