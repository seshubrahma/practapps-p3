Miller, a longtime Pentagon official who served on the National Security Council under Mr. Bush, said the Russian military may see the cruise missile as a way to expand its target coverage in Europe and China so it can free its strategic nuclear forces to concentrate on targets in the United States. " Clearly, the Russian military thinks this system is very important, important enough to break the treaty," Mr. Miller said.
