Another student at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) has hoaxed a racist hate crime attack, local police have confirmed. [More than a week after the 2016 Election, a man on the BGSU campus claimed he had been pushed to the ground and robbed, all while the two perpetrators allegedly called him a racial slur.   The universityâ€™s vice president for student affairs, Thomas Gibson, put out a statement based off a local police investigation where he confirms that the alleged attack did not actually happen, The Blade reported. It is still unclear whether or not the student will be charged for falsifying a police report.
