[Rashed is one of the top commentators in the Arab world. He formerly directed the Saudi television station Al Arabiya and was previously the    at Alsharq Alwasat, an international Saudi newspaper.   According to Rashed, the White House’s announcement that Trump will visit Saudi Arabia upon his first trip outside of the U. S. as president "sends a message that constitutes a change in priorities regarding his (Trump’s) foreign policy after relations between the countries in the Obama era and up until his (Obama’s) visit last year to Saudi Arabia, were the worst relations between the countries in 50 years.
