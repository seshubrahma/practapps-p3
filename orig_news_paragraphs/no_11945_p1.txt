Villanova University campus police say the student is now asking them to drop the investigation into the alleged incident as well. " It was hard to move forward, being that the student did not want to pursue the matter," a Villanova campus police spokesman told the local paper. The spokesman would not say why exactly the student would not cooperate with campus police and why she did not want to pursue the investigation.
