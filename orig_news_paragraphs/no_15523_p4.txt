The source said the President asked him about Kelly, who was not one of the eight candidates Sessions and Rosenstein interviewed at the Justice Department on Saturday. The source said he told the President he was concerned Kelly lacked federal experience. Kelly did serve as an undersecretary for enforcement in the Treasury Department, and later as the commissioner of the US Customs Service in the Clinton administration. A spokesman for Kelly declined to comment for this story.
