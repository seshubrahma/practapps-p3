On Saturday, as the USS Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group passed through the Strait of Hormuz, an Iranian patrol boat trained a   weapon on a U. S. Navy helicopter. [The Iranians did not open fire, but the Pentagon described it as the latest of over two dozen "unsafe and unprofessional" encounters with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in the past year.   " During a routine daylight transit of the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group through the strait linking the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, two Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy fast patrol boats tailed the CSG," two defense officials told USNI News.
