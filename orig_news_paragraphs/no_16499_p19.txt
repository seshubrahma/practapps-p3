Kasich is expected to deliver an endorsement of Chris Sununu, who is in a competitive GOP primary for New Hampshire governor. Chris Sununu is the son of former New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu and the brother of former New Hampshire Sen. John E. Sununu.   Both John Sununus were Kasich allies in the primaries Chris Sununu was officially neutral.   But the family believes a Kasich endorsement will be a boost, and GOP sources familiar with the conversations say John E. Sununu  â€”   the former senator    made a personal appeal to the Ohio governor.
