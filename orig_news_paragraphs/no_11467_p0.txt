With the recent rollout of Twitter’s Orwellian "Trust  Safety Council" some have started to question whether Twitter’s main goal at this point is to maximize profit. [Looking at the reactions of the userbase and media critics to recent changes, and then juxtaposing them with the company’s stock price, it’s clear that Twitter hasn’t been making good business decisions lately. My view is that the company is now more interested in political than commercial goals, and is gearing up to sway the elections.   The only question is whether these decisions were made with intentional neglect of Twitter’s duty to maximize profits for its shareholders.
