The issue saw renewed attention after Yahoo News recently reported that Trump administration officials began developing plans to lift sanctions almost as soon as they took office.

US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley emphasized last week the Trump administration has "stood strong" on the existing sanctions on Russia.
