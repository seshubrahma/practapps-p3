Event organizers claimed nearly 5, 000 people attended the march, but Sydney police estimate that the number was closer to 3, 000.   Chants from the crowd included "women united will never be defeated" and "when women’s rights are under attack, what do we do, stand up fight back."   A separate, smaller protest of approximately 30 people, in support of Trump also took place at Martin Place on Saturday.   The   crowd waved US and confederate flags in the air and shouted: "It’s all over lefty scum" and "drain the swamp," witness to the protest Eliza Berlage told CNN.
