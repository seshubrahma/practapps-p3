These tactical strikes make clear that the Assad regime can no longer count on American inaction as it carries out atrocities against the Syrian people. Resolving the   crisis in Syria is a complex task, but Bashar   must be held accountable and his enablers must be persuaded to change course. I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort. While the strikes were lauded as a stark change from six years of inaction on Syria under former President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration, some Americans expressed opposition to the move fearing it might provoke another ground war.
