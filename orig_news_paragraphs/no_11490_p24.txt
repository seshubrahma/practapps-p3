During an interview on Friday, Tulsa, Oklahoma radio talk show host Pat Campbell, talking with Dr. Everett Piper, President of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, on his program heard every week day on 1170 AM KFAQ, told his guest, "I’m of the belief, and I want to see if you’re in agreement with me on this, that Beck endorsing Cruz I think, actually is a negative," adding: I think Beck is just, I don’t know what it is, he’s too obsessed with Donald Trump and he’s almost blinded by that obsession. I think that having him go out in places like Utah and talking about, you know, how the white horse prophecy and all these other things out there, presenting Ted Cruz as some sort of savior. I’m not looking for a savior.
