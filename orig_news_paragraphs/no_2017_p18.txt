Mr. Renzi "doesn’t represent the zeitgeist of the nation, which did not follow him," he added. For Mr. Sechi, the Five Star Movement is the clear victor, even if the "no" campaign brought together divergent political forces. Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, said the outcome was less clear. Rejection of the constitutional changes was actually a reaction to Mr. Renzi’s "reformist program that in some way threatened a big part of the social political equilibrium," he said.
