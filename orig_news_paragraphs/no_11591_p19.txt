Today, when   Christians hold up posters at rallies that read, "Thank you, Lord Jesus, for President Trump," when they say they are sick of false promises from supposedly pious presidents on abortion or gay marriage and just want a strong man in the White House who can stop illegal immigration or keep us safe or just "smash things," what are they saying? They are saying that their political identity has trumped their religious identity. They are saying that they are conservatives first and Christians second.      â€¦
