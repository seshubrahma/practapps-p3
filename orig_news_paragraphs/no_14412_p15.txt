Trump has no interest in changing. As one article in Politico concluded, "In interviews, nearly two dozen people who’ve spent time with Trump in the three weeks since his inauguration said that his mood has careened between surprise and anger as he’s faced the predictable realities of governing."   While this might play extremely well with his base of support, it is a model of presidential leadership that is bound to run into trouble.   The courts have already offered Trump the first check and balance.
