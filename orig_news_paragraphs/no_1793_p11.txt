Clinton touched on a number of topics, from the   psychological effects of the internet on young people, to the challenges of running for president as a woman, to how her experience seeking the presidency this time differed from 2008. After our conversation, I asked her aides if they would allow me to put any of our discussion on the record. It was their prerogative to decide, given the    provision to which I had agreed. I sent large portions of the Clinton transcript in an email to Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director.
