Last week, two Russian bombers, flanked by a pair of fighter jets, were intercepted by stealth US   aircraft off the coast of Alaska. And during a stretch in April, Russian military aircraft were spotted flying off the coast of Alaska four times in as many days.   The fact that Tuesday’s encounter took place near Crimea adds an additional level of significance, as the two countries’ opposing views on the conflict in Ukraine have become a   issue between the sides. The Trump administration has said it opposes Russia keeping Crimea.
