I am always surprised when confronted with some of the vitriol that I and my fellow black conservatives face when addressing the black community. I have often wondered why it is ok for other groups to maintain a diversity of political viewpoints   —   whether they are Asians, Latinos, or Jewish Americans  —   but black Americans seem to believe that anyone who does not vote the party line is a traitor to his or her race. [Why is it that among African Americans anyone who does not support the Democrats or liberal causes is labeled a   or a ‘ ’ black person?
