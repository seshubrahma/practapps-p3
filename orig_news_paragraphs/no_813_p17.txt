Reporters who were on the Trump beat in 2016 will also offer inside looks at the campaign. In "My Year Covering Trump," the Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold will detail his eventful time writing about the candidate. Mr. Fahrenthold conducted a very public investigation of Mr. Trumpâ€™s charitable giving, enlisting the help of people on Twitter to find out whether donations had been made. He also exposed the video in which Mr. Trump made vulgar comments about women off camera with the "Access Hollywood" host Billy Bush.
