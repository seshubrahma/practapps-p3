The violence has been concentrated in the city’s poorer areas, but occasionally makes it to the suburbs, as it did in my home town of Skokie, where a swimmer on my old high school team was shot and killed in 2014. Bizarrely, the city’s violence has created a trendy "Chiraq"     which lives and breathes on social media   —   hence the Facebook live stream of a hate crime, accompanied by shouts of "fuck Donald Trump "  —   the refrain of a popular   song during the election.
