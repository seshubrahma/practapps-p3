Free Our Internet (www. freeourinternet. org) is a   citizen group whose mission is to educate the public about how leftist   and their powerful corporate allies in Silicon Valley have methodically used their wealth and political influence to erode the public’s internet freedoms and destroy alternative media. Our goal is to empower the public to fight back against the  ’s   war to control our means of communication, information, organizing, and mobilizing: the internet.
