In an ominous sign, an Integrity Watch Afghanistan survey published in December said 71 percent of those surveyed felt corruption had worsened in the past two years. Proponents of the more kinetic plan have modest expectations for the enhanced military effort, according to the Post. The expectations are that Afghan forces would at best be able to "hold the line" this year and begin to recapture some key terrain from the Taliban next year. Their goal is to make "incremental progress" in coming years in order to persuade the Taliban to make concessions that will lead to peace, according to the Post.
