Here is a sampling of the partyâ€™s elected officials: a constable in Arkansas, some city councilmen in California, a water and sanitation member in Colorado, a school board member in Minnesota, and a mayor in Texas. Not exactly a great record for a party that has been around for four decades. Can we really say that this is a party that should be taken seriously on the national stage? Or, better yet, should be taken seriously period?
