The DNC breach occurred around the same time as breaches of US government systems at the State Department and the White House. Analysts from the NSA and FBI investigators found signatures in those breaches that led them to other intrusions outside the government, including at the DNC.   Investigators have tracked the IP addresses and other data from the DNC hack and found they matched attacks around the same time at other federal agencies. Evidence points to at least one group of hackers that is familiar to US counterintelligence, officials said.
