The release today of the   poll that shows Trumpâ€™s lead has dropped to 5 points suggests that the blowout victory many have been predicting is not as certain as previously thought, even though that poll is possibly an outlier. Unlike in Iowa, where Ted Cruz dominated the ground game, both the Trump campaign and the Bush campaign are mounting an aggressive South Carolina ground game. Rubio, likewise, has a ground game, though not apparently as robust as the other contenders. Add to this the unusual participation of several Super PACs which have endorsed Ted Cruz in the ground game wars, and the possibility of   swings in voter support are increased.
