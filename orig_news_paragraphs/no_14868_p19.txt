" Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016," committee chair Richard Burr said. The same day, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN in an interview that he also hadn’t seen any evidence of a wiretap or a surveillance order against Trump Tower. On Friday, Rep. Tom Cole,   told CNN’s Manu Raju that Obama is owed an apology for Trump’s "reckless" comment on wiretapping.
