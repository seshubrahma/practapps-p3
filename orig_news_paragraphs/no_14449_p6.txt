The vessel is outfitted with a variety of    spying equipment and is designed to intercept signals intelligence. Fox News first reported on the shipâ€™s location. The official noted that this is not the first time the ship has been deployed off the coast of the US. Similar patrols were carried out by the Leonov in 2014 off the coast of Florida and in 2015, adding that such missions were much more common during the Cold War.
