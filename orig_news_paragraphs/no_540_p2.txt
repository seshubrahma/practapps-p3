Mr. Trump delayed his plan to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem after Arab leaders told him that doing so would cause angry protests among Palestinians, who also claim the city as the capital of a future state. And after meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan last week, Mr. Trump authorized a statement that, for the first time, cautioned Israel against building new West Bank settlements beyond existing lines. " There are some quite interesting ideas circulating on the potential for U. S.   discussions on regional security in which   issues would play a significant role," said Robert Satloff, the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
