Throngs of people were gathering Sunday afternoon outside the White House. Crowds also were forming in Bostonâ€™s Copley Square, at Battery Park in Manhattan and at airports in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Washington and Dallas, with more planned elsewhere. Top Democratic officials were involved in the protests, too.   In San Francisco, Democratic National Committee chair candidate Tom Perez was on Facebook livestreaming his participation in protests there.
