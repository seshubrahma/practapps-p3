There remained little question, for example, about whether Trump would push to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants. His increases in the number of border patrol and immigration officers    adding 10, 000 immigration officers to an ICE workforce of just 20, 000    raised the specter of Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportations.

The order also calls for a   increase in Customs and Border Protection personnel.
