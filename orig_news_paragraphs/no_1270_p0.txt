WASHINGTON   —    K. T. McFarland, the former Fox News commentator appointed by President Trump as deputy national security adviser, is expected to leave that position soon and may be nominated to be the United States ambassador to Singapore, according to officials briefed on the matter. Ms. McFarland’s departure had been seen as likely since the forced resignation of Michael T. Flynn, the retired   general who was Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser.
