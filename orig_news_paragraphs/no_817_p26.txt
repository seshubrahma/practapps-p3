At the beginning of every month, streaming services add a new batch of movies and TV shows to their libraries. Here are the titles we think are most interesting, from Hulu, Netflix, HBO and Amazon. Highlights include the 1974 Mel Brooks comedy classic "Blazing Saddles," the Australian New Queer Cinema cult film "â€˜The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," and newer fare like the Netflix original series "Love," a romantic dramedy produced by Judd Apatow. Have a great weekend.
