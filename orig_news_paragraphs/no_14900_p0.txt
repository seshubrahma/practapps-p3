 (CNN) A woman was arrested late Tuesday night after she allegedly attempted to gain entry to the White House, telling police she was there to speak to President Donald Trump. Secret Service officers observed the woman, identified as Marci Wahl, 38, walking and staring at the White House complex before discovering she had jumped a fence on the south side but had gotten stuck.   Officers found Wahl, of Everett, Washington, hanging from the inside of the fence by her shoelaces which were "caught on top of the fence," according to a police report obtained by CNN.
