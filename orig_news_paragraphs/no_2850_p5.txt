Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from Brooklyn, who is often spoken of as a potential challenger to Mr. de Blasio for   in 2017, said that because of Mr. Trump’s ties to New York a Trump presidency "may surprisingly yield less hostility than we’ve seen from other Republican administrations," especially on transportation and public safety.
