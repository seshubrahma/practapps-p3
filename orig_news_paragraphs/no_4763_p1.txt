the   women marchers in downtown Washington, DC, threatened to never leave the nation’s capital as they protest newly inaugurated President Donald Trump. ["We won’t go away, welcome to your first day," women marchers chanted near the White House.   It’s ironic that they’re threatening to never leave, since many of the protesters are actually leaving tomorrow or the next day after having been bussed in from around the country and even from Canada.   For them to actually stay and occupy Washington, D. C. would cost millions per day —  an unrealistic possibility.
