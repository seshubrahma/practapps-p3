Nancy Armour, writing at USA Today, believes Tom Brady has a lot of explaining to do this Super Bowl week for his friendship with President Donald Trump. Moreover, in the same article, she praises Colin Kaepernick for being "eloquent" in his criticism of law enforcement in America. [The San Francisco 49ers quarterback, who refused to stand for the Star Spangled Banner this season and wore socks with pigs dressed in police uniforms, is "eloquent in detailing his concerns over police brutality in minority communities. Heâ€™s sparked conversations and reflection in NFL locker rooms and beyond," states Armour.
