Washington (CNN) Recipients of Obamacare subsidies are seeking to intervene in a lawsuit that was originally brought against the Obama administration by the   House of Representatives.   The recipients, La Trina Patton and Gustavo Parker, fear that now that Donald Trump is poised to become President, he might settle the case with the House and leave standing a lower court opinion that went against the law. The House of Representatives sued the Obama administration in 2014 over the executive branchâ€™s authority to reimburse insurers for the   reduction authorized by Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act.
