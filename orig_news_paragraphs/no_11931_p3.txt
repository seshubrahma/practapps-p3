Protecting America’s national security can never be an afterthought. Our    has to be able to defend our country, not embarrass it, engage our allies, not alienate them, defeat our adversaries, not embolden them. When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture, that doesn’t make him strong, it makes him wrong. And yes, our next president has to bring our country together, so we can all share in the promise of America, we should be breaking down barriers, not building walls.
