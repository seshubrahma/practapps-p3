A total of 59 tomahawk missiles were launched from the Destroyers USS Porter and USS Ross in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. " The use of chemical weapons against innocent people will not be tolerated," said Pentagon Spokesman Captain Jeff Davis after the strike. According to McMaster, the strikes did not target sarin gas storage units, but rather the airport and aircraft that were used to launch the chemical weapon attack.
