Actor Richard Dreyfuss angered his fellow Hollywood liberals last week when he was photographed speaking with Sen. Ted Cruz at an Iowa rally for the Republican presidential contender. [But in an interview with TheWrap to clear up any confusion surrounding his political position, the    actor says he also attended events for Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina that day, will "most likely not" vote for Cruz, and dutifully called Republican frontrunner Donald Trump too stupid to be president and threw in a few jabs at Rubio and Cruz for good measure.   " I was [in Iowa] to hear any and all that I could hear, and I was hoping to meet or experience Trump," Dreyfuss told TheWrap.
