First, letâ€™s get this whole Bernie Sanders thing out of the way : He is not going to be the nominee, he was never going to be the nominee, and even if a house falls on Hillary Clinton (there is precedent) the DNC will find someone to nominate whose name is not Bernie Sanders. And please, stop yourself when it comes to Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren, okay?
