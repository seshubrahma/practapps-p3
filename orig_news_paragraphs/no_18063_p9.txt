He   also declined to comment on whether any current   administration officials are currently under FBI investigation,   and said he could not comment on whether   the intelligence community had found any evidence of direct   collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. " ’    "All I can tell you is what we’’re investigating, which includes   an investigation into whether there was coordination between the   Trump campaign and the Russians," Comey said, adding that there   was "no way to give a timetable" for when the investigation   would conclude.
