A Washington attorney who represents Manafort and Yanukovych didn’t respond to a request for comment.   The Podesta group issued a statement saying it hired lawyers to examine its relationship with a    organization linked to the ousted Ukrainian regime. " The firm has retained Caplin  Drysdale as independent, outside legal counsel to determine if we were misled by the Centre for a Modern Ukraine or any other individuals with regard to the Centre’s potential ties to foreign governments or political parties," the statement said.
