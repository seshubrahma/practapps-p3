Our crews are working around the clock,   to try to get as much rock as possible onto the damaged spillway before the next storms come," Cal Fire spokesman Josh Janssen said.   " We are feeling positive," said Al Duncan, spokesman for the response team.   Janssen said the lake level has been dropping about a foot every three hours    and that rate could improve.
