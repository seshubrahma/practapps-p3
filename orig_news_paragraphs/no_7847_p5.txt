Rubio did gather his first state win that night with Minnesota. He pledged to rally attendees that "We will win" in Florida. Rubio trails significantly with 151 delegates and is putting strong emphasis on the importance of winning his home state. Ohio Gov. John Kasich with just 37 delegates is banking on a win in his home state and making a strong push in today’s Michigan primary in hopes that his state’s close proximity will work to his benefit.
