Musicians Kid Rock and Loretta Lynn have both said publicly they’ll be voting for Trump in November, while actors Kirstie Alley, Stephen Baldwin, and Lou Ferrigno have also indicated their support for the candidate. Trump also has several sports figures in his corner, including Mike Tyson, Terrell Owens, and former NFL player and Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka. Of course, Hollywood has also mercilessly attacked Trump throughout the primary season, including after his big win in the South Carolina contest Saturday, when celebrities ripped the state’s voters as "racist" and took shots at Trump’s wife, Melania. In a soundproof chamber beneath Trump Tower, Donald is lowered onto a disinterested Melania for a   9 second Victory Rut.
