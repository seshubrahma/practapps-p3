Washington (CNN) Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi declared Tuesday she will not be "bullied" by Hillary Clinton, as the Democratic presidential nominee used a 2013 donation to Bondi to turn the tables on Donald Trump this week.   " I will not be collateral damage in a presidential campaign, nor will I be a woman bullied by Hillary Clinton," Bondi said on Fox Business Network.
