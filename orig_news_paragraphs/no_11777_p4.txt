Hawa’s Trump Café is not the only Texas restaurant making a political statement. Breitbart Texas reported on October 16 about Shrimp Boat Manny’s Cajun Seafood Restaurant in Livingston, Texas (northeast of Houston) where   signs adorn the business’ fences. Owners Manny and Nancy Rachal told Breitbart Texas, "As Christians and as small business owners, we are hoping and praying for Trump. " "We see Mr. Trump running the federal government as the business that it is," the Rachal’s continued.
