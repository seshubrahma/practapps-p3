Trump takes 50% of the vote, giving him a better than    advantage over Marco Rubio (16%) a   edge over John Kasich (13%) and a    margin over Texas Senator Ted Cruz (10%). Ben Carson, who earned 23% of the vote in an October 2015 Emerson poll, has faded to 2% in this recent survey. The poll was taken between Friday the 19th and Sunday the 21st, which means a third of it reflect Jebâ€™s decision to drop out. This is worth noting because the conventional wisdom from the Establishment is that Rubio can beat Trump as people drop out, especially Establishment types like Bush.
