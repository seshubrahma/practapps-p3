just 339 of those respondents. The problem is that even a tiny amount of response error among the 38, 000 respondents could have been enough to contaminate the results of the tiny group of noncitizens. Imagine, for instance, that 99. 9 percent of people respond to the survey’s citizenship question correctly. In such a big survey, even that high success rate would still imply that there were 38 respondents who answered incorrectly  —   enough to make up a big chunk of the tiny pool of 339 noncitizen respondents.
