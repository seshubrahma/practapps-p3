The document was authored by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump, raising questions about his partiality. Last month, Steele conceded in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified. Citing current and former government officials, the New Yorker reported the dossier prompted skepticism in the intelligence community, with the publication quoting one member as saying it was a "nutty" piece of evidence to submit to a U. S. president. Steeleâ€™s work has been questioned by former acting CIA director Morell, who currently works at the Hillary   Beacon Global Strategies LLC.
