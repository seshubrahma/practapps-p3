The raid involved elite US Navy SEALs and special forces from the UAE, with armed drones flying overhead in support, according to officials from several countries. But as the combined force approached the al Qaeda compound, it was detected and an intense firefight broke out that saw Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens receiving a fatal wound and three additional SEALs being wounded.   During the gun battle, which featured small arms fire, hand grenades and close air support strikes from US aircraft, al Qaeda fighters    including some female combatants    took up firing positions on the roof of a nearby building and the US troops came under fire, calling in an airstrike against the building, which likely led to civilian casualties, a US official told CNN. The civilian casualties were "caught up in aerial gunfire that was called in to assist US forces in contact against a determined enemy that included armed women firing from prepared fighting positions, and US special operations members receiving fire from all sides," US Central Command, which oversees military forces in the region, said in a statement Wednesday.
