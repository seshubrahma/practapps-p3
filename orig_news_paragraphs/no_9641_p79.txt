Fortunately, even as this government flounders, philanthropy is stepping up. It’s heartening that one Silicon Valley mogul, Sean Parker, recently committed $250 million to curing disease, and that another mogul, Mark Zuckerberg, has committed $3 billion. The rest of us can only hope that such big giving on behalf of cures —  surely, the ultimate form of enlightened   —  will continue, and that a new kind of virtuous   will take hold among the one percent. Yet in the meantime, we might further hope that the political system, too, can provide help.
