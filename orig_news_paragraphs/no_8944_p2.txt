I was disheartened to learn that you recently joined  progressives and Republican establishment elitists by attacking millions of activists like me that support Donald Trump by calling us low information voters. I would encourage you to climb down out of your Ivy League tower and find out just who we are and why we decided to support Donald Trump. You would find among Trump supporters freedom loving activists that share a deep love for our country   â€”   the same deep love Donald Trump has articulated in a very persuasive manner.
