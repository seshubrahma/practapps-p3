Officials are anticipating a failure of the Auxiliary Spillway at Oroville Dam within the next 60 minutes. Residents of Oroville should evacuate in a northward direction, toward Chico. Other cities should follow the orders of their local law enforcement. The emergency spillway, which is unpaved, was activated on Saturday morning to relieve the flow down the damâ€™s normal spillway, where a major hole appeared in recent days and began to widen.
