Other students claimed Ricciardi and Tomasso drove through the campus harassing   spitting, and yelling slurs at   students, according to the Boston Globe.   Ricciardi and Tomasso strongly denied the accusations, saying all they had done was drive through the campus shouting Trump’s "Make America Great Again" slogan and waving a Trump flag. The Wellesley College Honor Board has fully cleared the false accusations, announcing that they found no evidence to support that the two men had harassed or shouted epithets at other students. Immediately following the incident, the mainstream media ran with the accusations, reporting them as fact, which Ricciardi’s attorney say has taken a toll on the entire Ricciardi family.
