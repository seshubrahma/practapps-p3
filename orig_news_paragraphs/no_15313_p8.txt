Always a man with a chip on his shoulder, Trump has often seemed quite miserable in the office of the President, and it’s easy to imagine him alone in the White House (with his wife Melania living in New York) dialing up old friends to chat as darkness falls on Washington.   Except for being amused by the fact that he can press a button at his desk and suddenly receive a fresh glass of Coke, Trump has appeared quite grumpy as he struggles to get anything significant accomplished. His legislative failures on health care have been matched by multiple defeats in the courts in his effort to ban visitors from several   countries from our shores. Investigations into his team’s connection to Russia continue, and members of his staff make more headlines for their feuds than for their policy agendas.
