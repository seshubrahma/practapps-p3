During his first month in office, Trump has engaged with members of the military at least four times. He was sworn in on Jan. 20, and a week later on Jan. 27, he made his first trip to the Pentagon. There, he met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and attended the ceremonial swearing in of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. A few days later, on Feb. 1, he made a private visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, to receive the remains of Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens, a Navy SEAL who died of wounds during a mission in Yemen.
