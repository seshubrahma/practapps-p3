Hanham also said the fact that the missile’s   vehicle flew so high above the Earth put it under more stress than a warhead might undergo when fired on a more normal, flatter trajectory, North Korean engineers "may well be able to draw warhead   data from that which is applicable to their ICBM ambitions," said Euan Graham, an expert on North Korea at Australia’s Lowy Institute. " Given speculation over the past months about the possibility of military action by the Trump administration to prevent Pyongyang from acquiring such weapons, the possible testing of ICBM subsystems in this   manner may be a North Korean hedge against the possibility of such action," 38 North’s Schilling wrote. Differing assessments, US officials said the missile launched near the city of Kusong, in western North Korea, flew across the country and into the Sea of   Sea, hitting the water about 60 miles from Vladivostok in eastern Russia.
