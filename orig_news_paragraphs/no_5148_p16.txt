A second GOP congressional aide in another   Freedom Caucus office told Breitbart News their boss is against it as well, and that Ryan has "way more than 70 not with him. " These two offices and others that are not part of the Freedom Caucus but are opposed to the legislation told Breitbart News that the only reason they are not publicly coming out against the bill is because they do not wish to create more chaos around this legislation. If Ryan keeps doubling down, and forcing a vote on this, it will get worse, they say. A staffer in a third GOP office with a member not in the Freedom Caucus but opposed to the legislation even said staff is keeping the member off television to avoid getting connected to Ryanâ€™s Obamacare 2. 0.
