One of those officers was Vinson, who said he saw Scott rolling a marijuana joint and then showing a gun, according to a police statement Saturday. Police said the officers, who were in street clothes, went to another location and put on vests that identified them as police.   When they came back they ordered Scott to drop his gun. A uniformed officer who had arrived tried to break a window with his baton.
