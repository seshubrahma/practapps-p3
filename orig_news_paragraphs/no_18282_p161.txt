Let me tell   you what would be a really, really great project for all of us.    Why don’t we start mentoring kids? Whether we’re liberal or   conservative, why don’t we start going into the schools and   giving the kids a sense of their own purpose, their own     their future, and what they can learn from us? You   know, if we’re mentoring kids together, we might actually begin   to talk to one another again and listen to one another.
