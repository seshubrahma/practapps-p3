According to Dallas Police Chief David Brown, the gunman told negotiators that "he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers" and had been disturbed by "recent police shootings. " The ambush followed peaceful protests of fatal police shootings of Alton Sterling  in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, both of whom were black men.
