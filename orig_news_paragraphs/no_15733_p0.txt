 (CNN) The CIA, CIA inspector general and director of national intelligence will return their copies of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s massive   report on the CIA’s interrogation and detention program under the George W. Bush administration, a Senate aide confirmed to CNN on Friday. The decision means it’s highly unlikely the report    which concluded that interrogation techniques such as waterboarding did not elicit useful intelligence from detainees    will be made public so long as Republicans control the Senate and the White House.
