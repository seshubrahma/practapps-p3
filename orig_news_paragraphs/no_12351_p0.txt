Eagle Forum President Ed Martin joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about the passing of the Forum’s legendary founder, Phyllis Schlafly, and the final book he   with her, The Conservative Case for Trump. [Marlow praised Schlafly and the Eagle Forum for "the ability to fight with all your heart, and with all your soul, for what you believe in, and still keep dignity and grace. "   Martin agreed this was something of a lost art for the rest of society in the Internet era, pointing to the "vicious things said" about Schlafly online after her death, in addition to the "slurs" and "nasty stuff from the Left" that were   on the Eagle Forum building.
