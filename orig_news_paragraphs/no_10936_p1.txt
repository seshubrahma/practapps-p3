Look the terms up and talk to psychiatric professionals. A few have already written about this and spoken out. While, I want to be clear as do they, no one can officially diagnosis this with out private sessions, I have had more than one professional have laugh at me when I suggested in Trumps defense that, maybe he "wasnâ€™t a sociopath". I warn you with as much conviction as I warned in 1999 about Osama Bin Laden attacking NYC.
