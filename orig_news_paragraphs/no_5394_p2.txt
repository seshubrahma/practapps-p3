Madonnaâ€™s early years were previously the subject of a 1994 TV movie called Madonna: Innocence Lost, that starred Terumi Matthews as the pop superstar. Madonna released her latest album, Rebel Heart, in 2015 and followed it up with a world tour of the same name. The    singer has made headlines in recent months for her political activism, including her staunch opposition to President Donald Trump.
