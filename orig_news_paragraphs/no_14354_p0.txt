Washington (CNN) Top White House adviser Kellyanne Conway has apologized for citing a fake "massacre" in support of Donald Trump’s travel ban, in an interview on CNN in which she acknowledged that not all of the mainstream media can fairly be characterized as "fake news". Conway said "regretted tremendously" shaming the press for not covering the "Bowling Green massacre" an event that did not happen, when she was defending Trump’s immigration crackdown. During a   appearance on "The Lead with Jake Tapper" Tuesday, Conway criticized the media for sloppy reporting.
