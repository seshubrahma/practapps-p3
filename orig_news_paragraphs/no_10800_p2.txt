This is only the latest chapter in a series of dramatic events involving Wintrichâ€™s   show. Before being kicked out of the Pierogi Art Gallery owned venue, the   Joe Amrhein threatened to send all funds paid to the Clinton campaign. Amrhein also claimed that he thought the event was satirical, despite Wintrich providing Breitbart News with texts that show him marking down the event as "Trump Gallery Show" on paper. The venue realtor, Sam Reznitsky, has also threatened to sue Wintrich and "bankrupt" him in the lawsuit.
