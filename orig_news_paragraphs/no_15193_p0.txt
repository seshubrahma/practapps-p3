Paris (CNN) A deadly attack on a police bus in the heart of Paris has dramatically changed the course of the French presidential election campaign. The three main candidates canceled campaign events and instead made televised statements in which they competed to talk tough on security and vowed a crackdown on ISIS.   One police officer died after a gunman wielding a machine gun leapt out of a car and opened fire on the   Parisâ€™s most famous boulevard, as candidates were engaging in their final TV debate.
