The media is "cheering on Democrats" and doesn’t give   Donald Trump the respect he’s due, says incoming White House spokesman Sean Spicer. ["There’s some positive aspects here and there, but largely it still continues to not treat him with the respect that he deserves," Spicer told The Hill.   " I think for a lot of folks inside the beltway, and inside   they don’t fully appreciate the understanding that he has of where the American people are," Spicer added.
