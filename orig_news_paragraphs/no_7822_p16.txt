Of course, because this is Slate, we then get some egregious garbage about how Rubio’s "  past mixed with his heritage in the minds of bigoted Republican voters," which is not only insulting, but ignorant. Rubio’s "heritage" had absolutely nothing to do with the political fallout from Gang of Eight for Republican voters, but plenty of Democrats have taken to taunting him (and Ted Cruz) as "phony Hispanics," "race traitors," and so forth.    If Rubio’s race had any effect on the immigration protest, it was a disappointment that such a uniquely gifted rising conservative star, who was so   to make a strong case for security and rule of law, instead agreed to become the disposable pitchman for Sen. Chuck Schumer’s immigration bill. Rubio was the establishment’s ambassador to conservatism, not its conservativm’s representative.
