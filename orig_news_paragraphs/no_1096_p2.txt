Some skeptical fans are wondering if the quarterbacks who have landed jobs with teams have one significant asset that Kaepernick does not have: They all stood for the national anthem last season. Kaepernick knelt in protest against racism and police brutality. That decision was unpopular with a segment of N. F. L. fans, and perhaps a larger segment of traditionally conservative N. F. L. owners. It even drew a rebuke from Donald J. Trump when he was a presidential candidate and later as president.
