Wisconsinâ€™s 42 delegates are awarded on a    basis statewide and by congressional district. Trump has a massive lead in Arizona polling, though no new polling has been done since Rubio dropped out. Both he and Cruz are hitting the trail there this weekend. Cruz is holding a press conference on the U. S. border with Mexico and several events throughout the state on Friday, while Trump is set to hold rallies over the weekend in Arizona.
