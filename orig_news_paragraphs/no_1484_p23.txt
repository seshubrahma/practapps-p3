Tom Fereday, 28, an unemployed office administrator and a supporter of the far right U. K. Independence Party, said he was uncomfortable with the growing Muslim population in the city’s Pillgwenlly neighborhood. " I’m happy to go through hard times if it means we get our national sovereignty back," he said, adding, "To keep letting in thousands of   Muslim migrants is just complete insanity. "
