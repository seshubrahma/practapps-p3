The coalitions director of Donald J. Trumpâ€™s Iowa presidential campaign told Breitbart News Friday that both traditional and social media measures tell him the Hawkeye State is lining up for Trump, not for his Democratic opponent Hillary R. Clinton. ["The progress of the last month has been absolutely phenomenal," said Jamie Johnson, who as a talk show host supported Mike Huckabee, the winner of the 2008 GOP Iowa caucus, and worked as coalitions director for Rick Santorum,   of the 2012 caucus.   Johnson, who joined the Trump campaign July 26, said Iowa is "a yard sign state" and as he drives around the state, he sees Trump yard signs everywhere. "
