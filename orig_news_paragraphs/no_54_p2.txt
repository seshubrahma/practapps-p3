Mr. Trump’s announcement that he will remove his name from the organization is one of a series of steps that members of the Trump family are taking to address potential conflicts before the inauguration. Other steps include terminating planned Trump Organization projects in countries like Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia and Georgia. In addition to removing his name from his charitable foundation, Mr. Trump will no longer personally solicit funds for it, he said in several interviews with The New York Times. To further avoid conflicts, Mr. Trump said in an email this week, his    and a Trump Organization executive will step down from the foundation’s executive committee.
