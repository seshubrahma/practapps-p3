In particular, the case of Jeanette Vizguerra, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who has been in the country 20 years, has received widespread attention. The mother of four children found out this week that a stay on her deportation order would not be extended. Worried she’d be arrested, she sought refuge at a church in Denver.
