For someone making $25, 000 a year, premiums could go up to $7, 000 a year, according to the AARP’s analysis. Currently, a nonsmoker living in Phoenix who bought a silver plan is spending $1, 700 per year for premiums. That’s nearly 7% of income with current subsidies and age ratios, compared with 28% according to this analysis. And for a    whose   pay was even less, health insurance would become significantly more expensive, according to the AARP analysis.
