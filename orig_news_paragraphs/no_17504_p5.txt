Ford defeated Reagan, though barely, but Reagan brought into the party and energized conservatives who ordinarily had not voted in primaries like Texas.   In 2004, Vermont Gov. Howard Dean used pioneering social media technology to attract younger liberals into the Democratic selection process. Although John Kerry won the nomination, only to lose to George W. Bush in the general election, the groups Dean energized would be central to Barack Obamaâ€™s 2008 victory. Among the Republicans in 2015, Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz    both still long shots for the victory against a Jeb Bush or a Marco Rubio    have the possibility of reaching libertarian and social conservative Republicans who have become disaffected with the GOP over the past decade.
