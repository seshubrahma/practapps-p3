" Intelligence officials and private cybersecurity companies believe that the Democratic National Committee was hacked by two different Russian cyberunits. One, called "Cozy Bear" or "A. P. T. 29" by some Western security experts, is believed to have spent months inside the D. N. C. computer network, as well as other government and political institutions, but never made public any of the documents it took. (A. P. T. stands for "Advanced Persistent Threat," which usually describes a sophisticated   cyberintruder.)
