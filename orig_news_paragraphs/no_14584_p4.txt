The senior White House official said the desire to bolster the legal and public case that these seven countries pose a threat is a work in progress and as of now, itâ€™s not clear if DHS and DOJ will offer separate reports or a joint report. One of the ways the White House hopes to make its case is by using a more expansive definition of terrorist activity than has been used by other government agencies in the past. The senior White House official said he expects the report about the threat from individuals the seven countries to include not just those terrorist attacks that have been carried out causing loss of innocent American life, but also those that have resulted in injuries, as well as investigations into and convictions for the crimes of a host of   actions, including attempting to join or provide support for a terrorist organization. The White House did not offer an    comment for this story despite numerous requests.
