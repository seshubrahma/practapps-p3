The Clark County Fire Department was reportedly dispatched to the hotel at 2000 Fashion Show Drive, just after 5 p. m. on Wednesday after receiving reports of two separate, simultaneous fires. The firefighters reportedly found one small fire in a women â€™s pool deck restroom, and another in the hallway of the 17th floor. The fire did not activate the sprinkler system but it reportedly did activate the smoke alarms.
