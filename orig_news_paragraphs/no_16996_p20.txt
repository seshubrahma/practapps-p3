My mother was one of a handful of women to break a glass ceiling, going to medical school after she already had her three kids.   I know many young women are mourning the blow of a President Trump partly because of the rejection of a woman as the first president    which is yet another reason I argue we must remake the Democratic Party.   First, the Clinton machine must be rooted out of the party. A quarter of a century is enough time to understand that its ideology has failed the American people.
