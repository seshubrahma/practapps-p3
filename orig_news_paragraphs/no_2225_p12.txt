On Monday, Jonathan Greenblatt, the group’s chief executive, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s handling of the controversy over the posting did not pass muster. " The most appropriate response to the criticisms would be to address them   to apologize, and to articulate firmly and forcefully that bigotry of any sort has no place in this campaign, and that hate has nothing to do with making America great again," Mr. Greenblatt said. Mr. Trump seemed eager on Monday to move beyond the episode.
