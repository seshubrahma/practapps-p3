Last week, Mr. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, said that   of all the commercial airplanes it sold were for use in China, where Boeing is in a tense competition with Europe’s Airbus, its main rival. Like other major exporters, it is concerned that if Mr. Trump offends Chinese leaders or imposes tariffs against imports, China could retaliate by buying more planes from Airbus, which would reduce jobs at Boeing. Mr. Trump certainly understands that as president, he will no longer be flying his own,   Boeing 757. The Secret Service and the Defense Department would object.
