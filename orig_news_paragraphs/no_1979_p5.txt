I think President Trump and the new administration need to be wary of Russian promises," he told the BBC, reiterating the widely held view that Russia had carried out hacking during the United States election and blaming Moscow for the deteriorating situation in Syria. He said he had spoken with officials in Russia about the hacking accusations and had warned them that such activity would have adverse consequences. The United States should not "stoop to their level," he said, even as he emphasized that there were other means to make sure Moscow understood unequivocally that the United States would not tolerate such practices. He characterized the killing of civilians in Syria as "outrageous" and blamed the government of President Bashar   and Russia for the bloodshed, warning that Moscow had shown that it was willing to protect its interests with a reckless disregard for the people affected by its policies.
