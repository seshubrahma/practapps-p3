The campaign of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is speaking out to defend American war veteran and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council President Chris Crane. Over the weekend, Sen. Marco Rubio demeaned Crane, who’s critical of Sen. Rubio’s involvement in the Gang of Eight bill. ["This courageous ICE officer —   a man that Sen. Jeff Sessions has called ‘an American hero’  …     has served his country in so many different capacities: in the Marine’s uniform, as an ICE officer, [and] as a representative for all of America’s ICE officers," said Donald Trump’s Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller on Breitbart News Sunday.
