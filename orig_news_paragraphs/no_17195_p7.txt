And the shifts in vote totals after the recounts were very small. In the past 15 years, a statewide recount has reversed the winner from the   tally only three times    in the Washington 2004 governor’s race (a   shift) the 2008 Minnesota US Senate race (a   shift) and a 2006 election in Vermont for Auditor of Accounts, which initially had a   margin on election night that changed to a   win for the other candidate after the recount (a   change). FairVote, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for electoral reform, found that from   there were only 22 statewide recounts across the country, and the average shift in those recounts was just 0. 026%. But, a Clinton supporter might say, what if the machines were hacked?
