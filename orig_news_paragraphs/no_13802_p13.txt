Republicans are confident that they have solid support and will get help of many of the red state Democrats, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, to confirm them. So far, Rex Tillerson, the oil company CEO Trump tapped to serve as secretary of state, is the only pick who is raising some concerns with a handful of Republicans. They want more information about his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and how he will deal with myriad foreign policy issues where the US has tangled with Russia like Syria, Iran and recent cyberattacks.    Democrats are complaining that Tillerson, and many other Cabinet nominees, have been "very slow" in providing information to the committees ahead of the upcoming hearings that committee chairs are targeting to hold in the second week in January.
