Trump’s aides have insisted that, unlike the failed effort to repeal Obamacare, the tax code rewrite will be driven by the White House. President Trump claimed he would introduce a "phenomenal" tax plan at the outset of his presidency but has yet to do so, leading some to believe that there is an internal debate over portions of the new code, such as the controversial   tax, which would enact a tax on companies’ domestic sales and imported goods.
