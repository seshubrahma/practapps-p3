Clinton says the government has let Flint down and she will work with elected officials and double and triple check that the water problem is fixed in Flint. Cooper asks Clinton for specifics after her vague answer and she responds by saying she supports what President Obama is doing (getting accountability from the EPA and expanding Medicaid while ordering a Head Start program in the city.) Clinton says she supports the mayor’s program to pay people in Flint to deliver the water while we’re fixing the pipes.
