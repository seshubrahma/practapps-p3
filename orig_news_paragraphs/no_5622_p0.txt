White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that the media was downplaying the news revealing that former President Obama’s national security advisor Susan Rice unmasked the identities of Trump campaign aides during the 2016 election. ["I’m somewhat surprised in terms of the level of interest that I’ve seen from the press corps, one set of developments versus another set of developments," Spicer said during the White House press briefing on Monday.   Since President Donald Trump accused former President Obama’s administration of spying on his campaign staff, journalists have demanded evidence to back up his claims.
