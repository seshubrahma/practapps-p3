In an interview with CNN’s Victor Blackwell, Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said the campaign was concerned with potential election fraud, particularly over electronic voting machines, which security researchers have warned are vulnerable to hacking. Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claims that the elections would be "rigged" against him, and asked about making an unjustified assertion, Pierson said it was a concern over a hypothetical scenario. " There is no evidence because the election hasn’t occurred yet."
