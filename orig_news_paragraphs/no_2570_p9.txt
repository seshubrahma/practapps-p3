In two cases, former aides to the campaign have gone to work for super PACs that support Mr. Trump, despite "  periods" mandated by campaign finance laws when transitions like that take place. There is one super PAC supporting Mr. Trump that is run by a former aide to Ben Carson. Another proposed group, which would be backed by Tom Barrack, a financier and close friend of Mr. Trump, was created on Thursday, with more than $30 million in commitments, according to CNN. Another group is being advised by Edward J. Rollins, the strategist who was Ronald Reaganâ€™s campaign manager and has deep ties to the Republican Party.
