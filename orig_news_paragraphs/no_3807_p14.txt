Gen. Stephen Wilson, vice chief of staff of the Air Force, testified that his branch is the smallest it has ever been. The U. S. Air Force has become the "smallest, oldest equipped, and least ready in its history," the Air Force general told lawmakers. Gen. Glenn Walters, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told lawmakers that, under the current funding levels, U. S. Marines are expected to "experience increasingly significant challenges to the institutional readiness required to deter aggression and, when necessary, fight and win our Nationâ€™s battle. "
