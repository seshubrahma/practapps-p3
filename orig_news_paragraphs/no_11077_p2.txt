Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini also pointedly noted that Obamacare lacks honesty in how customers are informed about the way insurance really works. The massive changes will cause costs to rise up to fifty percent next year for those who have not lost their plans, and will also likely leave customers with fewer plans to choose from at costs that are much higher than they currently are. In addition, many doctors and hospitals will no longer be included in the networks for the   plans. The losses will mostly affect individuals who have purchased their insurance plans through the Obamacare exchanges, instead of receiving their coverage from their employers.
