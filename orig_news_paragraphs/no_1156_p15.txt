A   veteran of the Foreign Service, Mr. Shannon served in the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, where he became a favorite of Mr. Bushâ€™s secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. He also served as assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs under Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, a job in which he won the trust of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. " I am not the least bit surprised he is one of the last men standing," said Daniel Restrepo, a former senior director in the National Security Council who worked with Mr. Shannon.
