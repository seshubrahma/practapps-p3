Instead of grilling a potential nominee, Sessions himself will be the main course as he faces his former colleagues Tuesday.   A source familiar with his preparation says Sessions has been working hard since before Christmas on intense prep sessions and while he has spent time this week meeting with senators, he had a   "murder board" or mock hearing practice on Friday. Lawyers who have worked in the past for the Judiciary Committee are helping him get ready.   Democratic senators are likely to ask him about a broad range of civil rights and civil liberties issues.
