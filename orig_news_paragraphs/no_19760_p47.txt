LAX attracts people who have a political agenda," McGinty began. Their acts are intended as signs, symbols, statements. Think of the   Millennium Bomber, arrested trying to cross the U. S.  border in December 1999 with a car full of explosives his eventual target, McGinty reminded me, had been LAX. Or think of the man who targeted Israeli airline El Al in a combined    attack at LAX on July 4, 2002.
