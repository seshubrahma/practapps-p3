—   his 1987 Ritchie Valens biopic "La Bamba" was both a critical and   hit  —   but he’s still best known for "Zoot Suit," which broke Los Angeles theater records for ticket sales during its first run. The Taper, which also hosted the world premiere productions of "Angels in America" and "Children of a Lesser God," hopes to create a similar buzz this time around. Univision and Hoy sponsored a party at the theater to celebrate the first day of ticket sales, complete with   dancers and live swing music.
