Breitbart News recently reported that the leftist Silicon Valley "thought police" were attempting to retaliate against top venture capitalist Peter Thiel for following up his July speech in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention with a $1. 25 million campaign contribution. Led by the notorious Ellen Pao, who lost a 2015 gender discrimination and retaliation suit against the prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers, progressives moved to retaliate against Theil by starting a vicious Internet campaign to boot Thiel from his positions as a board member of Facebook and a venture capital partner of Y Combinator fund. Pao’s organization "Project" has also been calling on consumers, job candidates, partners, and other fellow progressive travelers to retaliate against Thiel’s friends and business associates by ending relationships with any organization that associates with him. But as the   of the wildly successful PayPal and Palantir, plus early stage venture capitalist in Facebook, Airbnb, Stripe, Spotify, SpaceX, Lyft, and many more, Thiel has mentored and made wealthy many of Silicon Valley’s top entrepreneurs.
