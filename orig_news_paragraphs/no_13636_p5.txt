Hennessy was elected after the Steinle murder, replacing Ross Mirkarimi. She stated that, "when people get arrested now, because of secure communities, their fingerprints go directly to the federal government and the federal government knows who’s in our jails and they request the notification on certain people when they get those fingerprints. " Hennessy said that she doesn’t want any blanket policy that would not allow her to speak with officials, including ICE.
