Well, a border tax adjustment is a   regularly used tool in international trade by countries who, if   they believe that another country is dumping products in their   country, they can impose a border tax adjustment to try and   equalize the price to make their domestic products competitive.    If President Trump pulls out of the Paris Agreement, and thus   does not bind himself to honor the U. S. target, it would be   perfectly reasonable for many other countries to impose border   tax adjustments on products coming in based on their carbon   content. I think it is quite likely that they would do so. ’ ’
