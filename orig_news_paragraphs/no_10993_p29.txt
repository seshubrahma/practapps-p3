A "unit rule" prohibited by this section means a rule or law under which a delegation at the national convention casts its entire vote as a unit as determined by a majority vote of the delegation. Haugland interprets this rule to mean that there is no such thing as a "pledged delegate," and that for all intents and purposes the primaries don’t matter and no state laws can trump that. The rule was apparently known as Rule 13 until the George W. Bush convention in 2000, when it became Rule 38, according to Haugland’s book. Haugland traces "The Unit Rule" in the Republican Party back to the 1860 convention, where Abraham Lincoln famously won as an underdog by working the delegates.
