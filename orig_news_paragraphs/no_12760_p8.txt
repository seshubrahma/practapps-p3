Cruz has been touting his wins in Utah, Colorado, Wisconsin, Wyoming and North Dakota, two of which did not hold primary elections, but rather chose delegates as the district assembly and state party convention levels. Wyoming held a mix of caucus and convention to decide how many delegates each candidate received. Cruz compared his win in Wisconsin to Trumpâ€™s win in New York: Last night in New York, Donald got fewer votes in New York than I got in Wisconsin.
