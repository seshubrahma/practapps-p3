The fiasco of Jeb Bush’s campaign illustrates that even with tons of money, advertising cannot get the public to buy a product it doesn’t want.   And the Sanders campaign shows that it is possible to run a grassroots campaign for a primary without relying on a Super PAC or the kind of traditional bundling that major party candidates have tried. Sanders lost because voters preferred Clinton, not because he was outgunned on the money front    at some points in the campaign, he was even spending more than Clinton. Thousands of small donations made Sanders competitive for months.
