The Obama administration amended its refugee quotas for the 2016 fiscal year in response to the growing migrant crisis, paving the way for at least 10, 000 Syrian refugees into the US. They ended the fiscal year at the end of September having admitted more than 12, 500 Syrians as part of this increase. The administration called for a further increase in the overall refugee admissions quota for the 2017 fiscal year, from 85, 000 to 110, 000. Officials have not offered a specific goal for Syrians, but plan to admit 40, 000 refugees from the geographic region that includes Syria.
