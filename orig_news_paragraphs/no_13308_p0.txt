["This election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward," Stein warned, explaining that Clintonâ€™s   militarism "is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. "   While Stein adamantly opposes a Trump presidency, she explained that the dangers posed by a Clinton presidency are "arguably even more immediate and intense. "
