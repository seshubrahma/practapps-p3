Serious global and regional challenges, which our countries have to face in recent years, show that the relations between Russia and the U. S. remain an important factor in ensuring stability and security of the modern world. I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America we will be able   —   by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner   —   to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level.
