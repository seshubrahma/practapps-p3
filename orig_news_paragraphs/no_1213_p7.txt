When damaging video footage of Mr. Trump bragging about sexual assault surfaced during the campaign, Mr. Trump called it "locker room talk" and apologized for the remarks. Mr. O’Reilly, on air that evening, allowed that the tape was "an embarrassment" for the Republican nominee. But he also criticized The Washington Post, the newspaper that published the footage.
