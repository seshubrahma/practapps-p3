Before the law was passed, insurance companies evaluated the health of each person applying for coverage before offering a policy, and priced the plan to reflect the possible cost of care. The companies wanted to minimize the risk of losing money by paying for costly medical care for too many of their customers. Often, insurers offered no options to people with   conditions, because they considered the potential costs to be too high. As a result, 35 states had   pools, the program again on the lips of top lawmakers, including Mr. Ryan.
