Hillary Clinton’s actions as Secretary of State "opened the Pandora’s box of radical Islam" even while she "refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam," Donald Trump charged in a broad rebuke of the presumptive Democratic nominee. [In a televised address from his hotel in New York’s SoHo neighborhood, Trump strongly criticized Clinton’s policies while she was Secretary of State, including her leadership role in advocating for the U. S.   NATO intervention in Libya.   Trump also spotlighted Clinton’s role in allegedly denying security requests to the fated U. S. Special Mission in Benghazi, her support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and for the rebels targeting Syrian President Bashar  ’s regime, and her involvement with the Iran nuclear deal.
