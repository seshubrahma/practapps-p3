Only about 15% of the roughly 400, 000 people who are removed from the United States each year ever go before a judge, according to Greg Chen, advocacy director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.   Under the Obama administration, the increasing reliance on expedited removals drew criticism from people on both sides of the immigration debate. Advocates for stricter immigration enforcement accused the Obama administration of using expedited removal simply to inflate deportation statistics. Immigrant rights advocates also slammed the approach, claiming it trampled the rights of vulnerable people    some of whom deserved asylum but never had the chance to make their case in court.
