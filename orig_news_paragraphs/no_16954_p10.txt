Avoid specific policy proposals, This was most evident at the end of the debate, when he was asked questions about future plans in Mosul and what to do in Syria or about Aleppo.   Trump pivoted to talking about how we got into this mess rather than how he’s going to get us out of the mess.   And after all of Trump’s criticism of NAFTA, the best he could muster in the debate was the generic idea that he’d somehow negotiate a "better" deal.   I generally don’t like this debate strategy of avoiding telling us your plans for the future Trump simply hasn’t shown that he has any specific proposals in many areas, especially foreign policy.
