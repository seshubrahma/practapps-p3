All major automakers previously voiced support for the more stringent standards. After the election of Mr. Trump, a group representing the nationâ€™s biggest makers of cars and light trucks urged a reassessment of the emissions rules, which the group said posed a "substantial challenge" for the auto industry. Automakers now complain about the steep technical challenge that the stringent standards pose. They have estimated that only about 3. 5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it, and that their industry would have to spend a "staggering" $200 billion by 2025 to comply.
