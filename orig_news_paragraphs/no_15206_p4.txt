This "complex" is a circle of people and organizations    inside the Democratic Party itself, as well as   organizations, lobbyists, consultants of very stripes and individual      who work mightily to maintain an iron grip on power and prestige.   This complex is run by   operatives and professional   leaders    who, funded by rich people and foundations, often earn significant   salaries and benefits that put them firmly in the one percent, and sometimes even in a better station.   Within the complex, failure does not disqualify people from future positions. Senior operatives who spend millions of dollars in losing campaigns, time and again, still get the call to do it all over again.
