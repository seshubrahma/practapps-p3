We had a positive and productive meeting this morning with Donald Trump. Donald asked me to speak at the Republican convention and I told him Iâ€™d be happy to do so," Cruz told reporters. The two men met Thursday with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters where Trump also met with several dozen other Republican senators on Thursday. The meeting marked the first time Cruz and Trump met in person since the Texas senator dropped out of the presidential race more than two months ago.
