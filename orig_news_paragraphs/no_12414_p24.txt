"During my five plus years of working with Breitbart, I experienced a serious illness resulting in complex heart surgery, and Steve Bannon stood by me when many employers wouldn’t have, including continuing to pay me during an extended period of time when I simply couldn’t perform my normal workflow. He was also quick to inquire as to how I was doing during those periods and to continue doing so as I eased my way back into work. I also have firsthand knowledge of his demonstrating the same type of compassion and consideration for more than one other individual associated with Breitbart News. I owe him a profound debt of gratitude for that and am absolutely convinced many employers would not have made the compassionate choices he did in my case.
