Bravo’s "Real Housewives" producer Andy Cohen maintains that casting someone who people love to hate is absolutely critical. This "love to hate" concept is an important distinction from plain old "dislike," given that Housewives who are thought of as sniveling, grouchy, boring, or simply rude eventually become universally ignored    by their castmates, by the audience and eventually by the network itself, which usually fires them after one dud of a season. If reality stars are going to make it big, they’ve got to amp up the drama    and by drama, I mean totally insane behavior.
