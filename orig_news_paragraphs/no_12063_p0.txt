Monday on MSNBC’s "Andrea Mitchell Reports," Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker said the only chance Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) have to defeat party   Donald Trump would be to combine forces and go after Trump jointly.   Parker suggested the two focus on showing that Trump is not for the "little man" to a core demographic of Trump supporters that she described as "high school educated" and "blue collar. " "I’ve come back to this sort of concerted effort to show people who are taken with his emotional appeal to see clearly who he really is," Parker said.
