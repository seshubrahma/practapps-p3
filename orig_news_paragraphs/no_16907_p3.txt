Michelle Obama denounces Trump for ’bragging about sexually assaulting women’ It was the second time this year Obama has captured her audience and driven home an   message in a way no other surrogate    or, for that matter, Clinton herself    has been able.

Her voice quaking with fury, the first lady said Thursday that Trump’s comments about using his celebrity to grab and grope had affected her powerfully, occupying her thoughts since the tape emerged late last week.
