—   Michael Caputo (@MichaelRCaputo) June 20, 2016,   Later on Monday, Caputo resigned in a statement to Paul Manafort, who has replaced Lewandowski as campaign manager, according to CNN. I regret sending out a tweet today alluding to the firing of Corey Lewandowski. In hindsight, that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move. I know this is a distraction from the kind of campaign you want to run, so I’m resigning my position as director of communications for caucus operations at the 2016 Republican Convention.
