Donald J. Trump’s campaign schedule is being driven by his   needs, prompting him to appear in heavily Republican states like Georgia and Texas and diverting his attention from battlegrounds where Hillary Clinton is spending her time. Mr. Trump’s aides, scrambling to raise money to compete against Mrs. Clinton’s cash juggernaut and extensive donor network, have scheduled   in places like Georgia, North Carolina and Texas this week. The private events for donors were often scheduled first, followed by his campaign rallies, according to two people involved in Mr. Trump’s   who insisted on anonymity. Even some of Mr. Trump’s appearances in battleground states have been tied to  : A New Hampshire rally on Monday night was planned in conjunction with a   in Boston, but both events were canceled after the deadly shooting in Orlando, Fla. on Sunday.
