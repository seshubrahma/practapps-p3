Washington (CNN) Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are boycotting   Donald Trump’s inauguration, particularly after revelations of Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election and his rebuke of civil rights icon John Lewis. No senators have yet said they are boycotting, though Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has left open the possibility. Some members have said they will be protesting in Washington and in their districts instead.
