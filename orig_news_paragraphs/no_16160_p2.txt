From the moment that Pence had hosted Trump at his Indianapolis home for breakfast Wednesday, he told his team he had a strong premonition that he was going to be the vice presidential pick. Trump had dined with Pence the night before, and then because of a popped tire on his plane, was captive in Indianapolis. That gave Pence, and more importantly Trumpâ€™s children and his advisers, an extra day to convince him. As late as Tuesday, advisers say, Trump had been leaning toward Christie, his longtime friend and now trusted adviser.
