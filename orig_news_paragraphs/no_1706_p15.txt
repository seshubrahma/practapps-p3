Mr. Adelson’s $5 million will go to yet another group, called Future45, which was set up and funded last year by the Ricketts family, Mr. Singer and Mr. Griffin to test lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton. Future45 and a sister nonprofit group, now being run solely by Mr. Ricketts’s team, are hoping to raise more than $25 million. The Ricketts family has provided $1 million, according to a Republican strategist involved in the effort. The hope is that a round of fall advertising aimed at Mrs. Clinton could help soften her support in states that also feature competitive House and Senate races, aiding Republican candidates in those contests.
