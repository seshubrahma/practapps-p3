Trump leads big among white men, 64% to 24% while Clinton holds a   edge among white women, 49% to 39%.   And Trump is faring worse among the stateâ€™s white voters than Mitt Romney, who carried the group by 24 points in his 2012 race against Barack Obama. It is yet more grim polling news for Trump, who has endured a rough stretch of the campaign after accepting the Republican presidential nomination in Cleveland last month.   Since then, poll after poll has shown Clinton with widening leads both nationally and in crucial swing states.
