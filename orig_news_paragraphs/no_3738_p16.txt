Facebook last month explained it will work with "    organizations" that are signatories to the code of principles crafted by the International   Network (IFCN) which is a project of the Poynter Institute. Facebook says that if the "fact checking organizations" determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged as disputed and, according to the Facebook announcement, "there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. "
