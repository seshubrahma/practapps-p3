Hillary Clinton’s husband Bill Clinton in their propaganda videos and monthly magazine publication Dabiq. A video titled "No Respite" which was released by the Islamic State just before the holidays features Bill Clinton, labeled as a "fornicator," and attempts to recruit people based on their hatred of his extramarital affairs and the marriage rights of American homosexuals. President Obama is also featured in this latest video, which alludes to the scandal over cooked intelligence reports currently rocking the Obama White House, which has been accused of falsifying and doctoring intelligence to make Obama’s   strategy look more successful.   Obama has also been featured on the cover of Dabiq’s 11th issue ("From the Battle of   to the War of Coalitions") in a   position engaged in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
