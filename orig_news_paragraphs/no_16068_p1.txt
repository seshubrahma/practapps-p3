Just two months ago, the same poll showed Clinton up 11 points.   The poll also found high interest in the election    though much of what Americans are expressing is concern.   It found 61% said they are alarmed by the 2016 presidential race, while 23% are excited    and just 9% are bored.   When Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein were factored in, Clinton’s lead was 39% to Trump’s 35% with 8% for Johnson and 3% for Stein.
