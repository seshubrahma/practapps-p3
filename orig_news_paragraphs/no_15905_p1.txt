The memo included stinging criticism of the FBI director’s handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email.     Shortly thereafter, the President shocked the nation with the announcement that he had fired the controversial FBI director he had only recently praised. The White House press office immediately pointed to Rosenstein’s detailed memo as the justification for Comey’s surprise termination. Later, that position was contradicted by the President himself, in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, when he stated that he had made up his mind to fire Comey before he had even seen  the Rosenstein memo.
