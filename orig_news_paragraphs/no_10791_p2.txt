Hillary Clinton is calling off plans to visit the West Coast on Monday and Tuesday following a health episode at the   memorial. Clinton abruptly left the anniversary ceremony on Sunday morning and needed to be held up by three people before she appeared to stumble off a curb and was helped into a van. Several hours later, her campaign revealed she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday and advised to rest. Her doctor said Sunday evening that Clinton had become overheated and dehydrated at the event in lower Manhattan.
