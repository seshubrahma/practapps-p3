Last month, outside a rally in Asheville, North Carolina, a woman wearing an oxygen mask and protesting against Trump claimed she had been punched in the jaw by a Trump supporter. As Breitbart News reported, video of the altercation makes clear that the woman pursued the Trump supporter (in spite of her oxygen mask) and likely touched him first before the man, who has poor vision due to cataracts, turned around. He may have knocked her down by accident his attorney told Breitbart News he was innocent and was considering a defamation lawsuit against the woman. She showed no visible signs of injury.
