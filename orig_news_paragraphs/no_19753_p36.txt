They are doubling CO2, letting that change the temperature, rainfall, etc. and seeing what that does to the AMOC in their model. Itâ€™s been more than 35 million years since we had that much CO2 in the air, and sea level was more than 200 feet higher then. If we (humanity) are so stupid as to double CO2, you can count on the AMOC to shut down much faster than 300 years. "
