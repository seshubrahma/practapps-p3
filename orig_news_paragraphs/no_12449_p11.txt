Shakur has also been lionized by ’60s radicals like the Weather Underground’s Kathy Boudin, who had named her son Chesa after Shakur’s real name, JoAnne Chesimard. BAJI has also employed another high profile Black Lives Matter activist named Tia Oso, who put herself in the national spotlight when she took to the stage at the 2015 Netroots Nation conference and helped shut down appearances by two Democrats running for President, former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Her biography does not mention that Ms. Oso is a convicted felon who took money from another community group she worked with. As the Phoenix New Times reported : While working as the business manager for the Arizona Citizens for the   Action for the Arts in 2007 and 2008, a job she includes in her online résumé, Oso issued checks to herself, made unauthorized withdrawals and made personal charges on the organization’s credit card.
