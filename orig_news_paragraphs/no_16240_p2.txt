The app also provides daily quizzes about policy aimed at disseminating Clintonâ€™s positions on major issues and contrasting them with Republican nominee Donald Trump. Completion of those tasks are rewarded with "stars" that can be used to buy items for the "office" or even real items from the campaign store. (With 350 stars users get you a signed card from Clinton, herself.) Friends who download the app can compete to see who completes the most challenges.
