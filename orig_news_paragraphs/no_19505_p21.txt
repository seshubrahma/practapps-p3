: This is something that     Trump needs to understand: if he pulls out of this agreement, we   lose a seat at the negotiating table. And, indeed, we will not be   able to shape these rules and procedures and the successor to the   Paris Agreement the way that we would be able to if we stay in. I   think he may find that there are significant diplomatic   consequences to pulling out. This is a   issue for many   other countries.
