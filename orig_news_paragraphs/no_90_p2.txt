Mr. Blumenthal asked: "How can Americans have confidence that you’re going to enforce   laws if you’ve accepted awards from these kinds of groups and associated with these kinds of individuals and won’t return the awards? " Mr. Sessions said he does not necessarily share the views of every political donor or organization he has received an award from. Mr. Sessions came of age in the Justice Department at the height of the crack epidemic. He has described himself as a lieutenant in the war on drugs, said he was "heartbroken" when President Obama compared marijuana to alcohol, and criticized the administration for not enforcing drug laws in states like Colorado that have legalized marijuana.
