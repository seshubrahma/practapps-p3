An investment group that U. S. authorities say is run by Russian mobsters and linked to the Russian government sent at least $900, 000 to a company owned by a businessman tied to Syria’s chemical weapons program, according to financial documents obtained by CNN. According to a contract and bank records from late 2007 and early 2008, a company tied to a   Russian mafia group, according to U. S. officials, agreed to pay more than $3 million to a company called Balec Trading Ventures, Ltd   —   supposedly for   "furniture."   Wire transaction records seen by CNN confirm that at least $900, 000 was transferred.
