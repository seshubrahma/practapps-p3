Taormina, Italy (CNN) President Donald Trump on Saturday concluded a   swing through the Middle East and Europe that marked his first foreign travel as president    a significant milestone for a head of state also considered the leader of the free world. Trump’s first foray on the international stage saw him engage in a series of powerhouse diplomatic sessions in which he touched on the most pressing global issues: from terrorism and the   conflict to the state of US alliances and the global economy.   He returns to Washington now to find the US capital much the same as he left it    engulfed in the latest revelations about the federal investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russia and with questions about the future of his presidency still swirling.   What’s less clear is how Trump will confront those issues with the fresh perspective of his foreign travels, if at all.
