There were Russian troops at the airbase, although itâ€™ is not clear if they were still there during the strikes. Davis said the U. S. struck an area where Russian and Syrian troops were not located. " In this case in particular, every precaution was taken to execute these strikes with minimal risk to personnel at the airfield," Davis said.
