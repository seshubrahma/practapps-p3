Trump has spoken to the leaders of Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, Israel, Turkey, India, Japan, Australia, the UK and South Korea. A working relationship with Turkey’s head of state, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, may be the most difficult yet necessary to develop, as Turkey has   its way into playing a role in fighting the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.    Abe’s conversation with Trump in part attempted to assuage the fears of many Japanese people who have expressed concerns about Trump’s   policies during the course of the campaign. A whopping 88 percent of Japanese voters preferred Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump, the South China Morning Post reported, many concerned that Trump would scale back military involvement in the   region, leaving Japan vulnerable to an increasingly belligerent China.
