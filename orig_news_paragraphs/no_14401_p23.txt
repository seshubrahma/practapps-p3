The shouted questions, emotional pleas and raucous protesters of the evening crystallized the GOP’s tough political road. In suburban Salt Lake City, local police estimated that some 1, 000 people packed into a high school auditorium to see Chaffetz as hundreds more waited outside. For 75 minutes, the congressman confronted a crowd that fumed with resentment of Trump and accused Chaffetz of coddling the President. They jeered and chanted "Do your job!" when Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was pressed on why his panel spent months investigating Hillary Clinton’s emails but has not yet launched inquiries into Trump’s taxes (Trump has declined to release his tax returns).
