On February 3, Trump’s pick to be Secretary of the Army, Vincent Viola, withdrew his name from consideration, citing Defense Department rules concerning his business holdings.   And on February 18, CBS News reported that Trump’s pick to be Secretary of the Navy, Philip Bilden, is "on the verge of withdrawing," citing, again, DOD rules.    We should note that within moments, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer strongly refuted the report, saying that Bilden is "100% committed" to the Navy post.   So we can leave it at that, even as, of course, there’s now a cloud over Bilden, and   MSM will likely zero in on his case.
