In April, blogger Mike Cernovich, Bloomberg, and Fox News revealed that Rice had requested to "unmask "  —   or unveil the hidden names of  —   Trump transition officials who were caught up in surveillance of foreign targets.

However, government consumers of the intelligence can request to have their names unmasked if it is important to understanding the communications.
