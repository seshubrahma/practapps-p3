The documents indicate Clinton told investigators she either does not "recall" or "remember" at least 39 times  —   often in response to questions about process, potential training or the content of specific emails. Much of the report reiterated what FBI Director James Comey testified in open hearings before Congress, including that more than six dozen email chains contained classified information at the time they were sent and that there appeared to have been hacking attempts on her server, though there is no evidence they were successful.
