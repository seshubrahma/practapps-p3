Just like in 2009, when Obamacare was before Congress and Democrats spread out across America to try to sell the law to their constituents, theyâ€™ll hold events back home starting this weekend to try to fight Republican plans to dismantle it. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley,   York, is leading the charge in the House, encouraging members to hold events in their districts this Saturday, January 7, in order to highlight what Democrats warn are the risks of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Next, Democrats are branding January 15 a "National Day of Action" among Democratic senators, House members and   organizations. In his closed door pep rally with congressional Democrats, President Barack Obama even encouraged his party to use tea party tactics to galvanize Americans to urge Republicans not to dismantle the health care plan    which happens to be the cornerstone of his legacy.
