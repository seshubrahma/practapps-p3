Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser, also said Sunday those currently detained who are not deemed threats would be released. " I am told by the officials that anyone who’s being detained, if there’s no further threat, if they’re not dangers to this country, they can expect to be released in due course    as most of them have already," she said on "Fox News Sunday."
