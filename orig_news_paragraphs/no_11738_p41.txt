Add It Up, This data shows that universities have effectively outsourced 125, 000 prestigious university jobs to foreign professionals, with the full support of the federal government, and amid the complete obliviousness of the U. S. media industry. The 125, 000 total is a reasonable accumulation of 90, 000   workers, 30, 000   Green Card recipients and applicants, plus just 6, 000 workers via the OPT,   spouses or the   "academic training" visa avenues. Of course, this 125, 000 total is only about   of the roughly 1. 2 million foreign, professional   holding jobs in the United States. That broader estimate is based on a population of 95, 000   at universities, 550, 000   professionals at   companies, 120, 000 OPT graduates, 350, 000   holders, plus many other professionals with     and O visas.
