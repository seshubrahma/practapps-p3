As Breitbart News previously reported, Colbert is set for two full weeks of live coverage beginning with the Republican National Convention this week and continuing with the Democratic convention in Philadelphia later this month. Colbert will remain at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York while Late Show correspondents will be on the ground in Cleveland and in Philadelphia. Special guests planned for the   live coverage reportedly include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, actors   Key and Jeff Daniels, fellow   host John Oliver and former Congressman Anthony Weiner. The move to add Stewart to the proceedings could be an attempt to shake The Late Show out of its   ratings slump, which hit a new low in June with Colbertâ€™s   week ever.
