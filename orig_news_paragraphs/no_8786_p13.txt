The Supreme Court in Heller did not say that the 1792 law’s definition of "militia" is somehow different from the Second Amendment’s. Instead, the Court used the statute ’s definition to confirm to the Court what meaning the Framers of the Constitution were using when they adopted the Constitution. And where such contemporaneous congressional acts shed this light, courts do not conclude that Congress’s meaning is trumped by ancient English or European laws to the contrary.
