It is too late for Republicans like Jeff Sessions or Mike Pence to suddenly express shock.   The person on the "Access Hollywood" tape is very much the candidate that the party chose in 2016.

And even now, "sickened" by Trump did not necessarily mean he would revoke his endorsement of his partyâ€™s presidential candidate.
