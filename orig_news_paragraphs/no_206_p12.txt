Fla. Prosperity gospel is a theological world that has seen some abuse from the misuse of financial donations given to speed the arrival of Godâ€™s blessings. The   practices of Ms. White and other televangelists were investigated by the Senate Finance Committee in 2007, but no wrongdoing was found. On her website, Pastor White sells a range of spiritual   products like books and DVDs and also exhorts followers to make a "first fruits" donation to her ministry, a gift she says is "mandated by God.
