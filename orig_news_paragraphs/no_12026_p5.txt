" The majority of the TEA   Groups in Ohio will be aligning with the National Rifle Association in an effort to elect Donald Trump as the next President of the United States," a statement from "We the People Convention" said at the time. Tea Party for Trump is a project of the Ohio based Freedom for All PAC and is organized by fourteen Founding Members, all of whom were original Tea Party organizers in their local communities when the movement launched in 2009. Its purpose is to help the existing partnership the "We the People Convention" has with the NRA in Ohio, and expand it to other key swing states.
