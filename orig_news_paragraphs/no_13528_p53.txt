Yeah, and I don’t see an AI doing that. I see an AI simply answering questions from a very technical point of view. And when you really get down to what we would want a president for, we want it to, technically, bring about the greatest amount of prosperity and happiness and health for the country as a whole. In many ways, these are very mathematical questions, and that’s where I think an AI president could exceed many expectations.
