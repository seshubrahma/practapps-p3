The bullies are the politicians who are sending your jobs overseas. The bullies are the corporate special interests who support open borders just to get a little bit extra cheaper labor. The bullies are the media executives and television personalities who mock and demean the good and decent people in this room. The bullies are people like Hillary Clinton who donâ€™t care about any of you or anyone else, people like Hillary Clinton who have no empathy for the American worker.
