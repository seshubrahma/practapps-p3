Veterans, Trump’s team is heavily comprised of military veterans, including its director of caucus operations, Ryan Price, who served as an Army Ranger. Price is a longtime GOP campaign operative, and former director of operation for the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa.   Price will be assisted by David Urban, a West Point grad and Army Gulf War veteran who had worked as chief of staff for former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter.
