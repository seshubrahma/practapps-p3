Chasing   political gains, the GOP missed a lot of chances to fight the hateful currents that now threaten to overwhelm it. The talking point that Americans are   or hostile to immigrants is the typical slander employed by the proponents of mass migration like Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and Paul Ryan, who believe there should be no pause or cessation in record migration even if it means more crime, overcrowded schools, and depressed wages. The editors do not seem to consider the possibility that Trumpâ€™s popularity stems from the fact that the Republican electorate is tired of its leaders taking marching orders from cosmopolitan commentariats like The Boston Globe, who see no problem with the social, economic, and cultural effects of mass migration. Indeed, while GOP Party elites have a long history of pushing trade and immigration policies opposed by its base, Trump himself has explained that his success is a result of his position on those two issues.
