Sam Fischer has issued a proposed resolution  —   set for a vote at the convention   —   declaring that the state party will refuse to support any Republican officeholder who opposes the GOP presidential nominee or agitates for a   candidate. Though the measure doesn’t name Sasse, the junior senator is clearly the target. He has become the most prominent elected Republican to embrace the "#NeverTrump" movement and call for a conservative candidate to join the field.
