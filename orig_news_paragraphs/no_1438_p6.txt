" We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer," he said in his speech Monday after the killing of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando by a gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Although the gunman, Omar Mateen, was a    American who was born and raised in the United States, Mr. Trump focused his ire on Mr. Mateenâ€™s parents, who came here from Afghanistan more than three decades ago.
