By contrast, only one Republican    Dean Heller of Nevada    represents a state that Hillary Clinton won last November. Only one other   state    Arizona    was even marginally competitive in the presidential contest. The lopsidedness of the 2018 playing field makes the relatively modest   gain Democrats need to win back Senate control seem far more daunting. Even if all goes right for the party and they win Arizona and Nevada next November, they would have to find a way to win one more seat from these states: Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
