In the years when most of Europe was overrun by the Nazis or fascist dictatorships, the   allies were the last hope of freedom, democracy and internationalism. I grew up in the world they shaped. My native country, the Netherlands, was freed in 1945, six years before I was born, by British and North American troops (with the help of some very brave Poles). Those of us with no direct memories of this had still seen movies like "The Longest Day," about the Normandy landings.
