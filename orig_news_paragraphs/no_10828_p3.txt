Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) issued a statement, warning: This provocative action by the United Nations is an outrage and must be dealt with sternly and forcefully. As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I oversee the United States assistance to the United Nations. The United States is currently responsible for approximately 22 percent of the United Nations total budget. If the United Nations moves forward with the   resolution, I will work to form a bipartisan coalition to suspend or significantly reduce United States assistance to the United Nations.
