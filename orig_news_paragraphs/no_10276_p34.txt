The supreme court we know today is best described by the dearly departed Justice Antonin Scalia, who said: "This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected commit tee of nine, always accompanied by extrav agant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most im portant liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves. " Scalia was a national treasure, and one of my favorite American political figures along with Reagan and of course now Daddy. He was an originalist, which means he believed the constitution said what it says, and does not go out of its way to address the petty whims of trannies, homos, bronies, and whatever other special interest group is trending on Twitter this week.
