Hillary Clintonâ€™s mission remains turning out the Obama coalition (African Americans, Latinos, young people, single women) in record numbers    especially in states where the demographics of higher turnout among those groups can really alter the outcome such as Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida and doing so in Pennsylvania and Ohio as much as possible in order to block Trump from making significant inroads among   graduate whites. The current CNN battleground map gives Hillary Clinton 236 electoral votes from states that are either solidly or leaning in her direction compared to 191 electoral votes for Donald Trump in states that are solidly or leaning in his direction.   That leaves 111 electoral votes up for grabs across 8 battleground states.   The political conventions provide each candidate the perfect opportunity to set the stage for the fall campaign blitz    both in terms of the negative frame they are building around their opponent and in terms of fleshing out their own positive attributes that get lost in the daily distortion and oversimplification that is presidential politics.
