The drama has clearly weighed on Clinton’s support in crucial electoral battlegrounds. A Quinnipiac University poll last month found that by margins of between 8 and 14 points, voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania are skeptical of Clinton’s trustworthiness.

He also argued that the fact that Clinton’s lawyers had allowed her to sit with the FBI meant it was unlikely that they believed she had any genuine legal exposure.
