Accused in her slaying is Juan Francisco   who had been convicted of felonies seven times and deported five times, most recently in 2009.    Federal immigration authorities say they might have deported the suspected killer yet again but say that the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department failed to tell them he was being released. In reality, better bureaucratic decisions would have prevented   from ever being in a San Francisco jail he’d been serving time in federal prison, and a pending removal order by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was in effect.   But instead of handing him over to ICE, the Federal Bureau of Prisons transferred him to San Francisco to face prosecution for a    marijuana possession charge.
