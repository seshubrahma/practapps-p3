Mr. Trump appealed and in 1984, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that the city’s action had "impermissibly erected a barrier to the benefit," and Mr. Trump was entitled to the tax abatement. Mr. Trump said at the time that the abatement was worth $7 million to $10 million over 10 years. The Finance Department, however, said in its recent analysis that the value of the benefit totaled $22. 5 million. Mr. Trump later got an additional $15 million tax break under a separate program for renovating the tower’s commercial space.
