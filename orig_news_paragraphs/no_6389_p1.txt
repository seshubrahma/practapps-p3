The lake dropped below its maximum height of 901 feet above sea level, and was continuing to subside, officials reported.   However, water was continuing to flow into the lake behind the dam at a rate of 40, 000 cubic feet per second, the result of runoff and snow melt from weeks of heavy precipitation after five years of drought. As a result, the dam would need to be drained as quickly as possible over the next 72 hours. The maximum release rate is about 150, 000 cubic feet per second, though officials are reluctant to release water down the main spillway at that rate because of the risk of structural damage.
