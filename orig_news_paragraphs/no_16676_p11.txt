I think you’re making things up based on facts as they are not reported in this story, which also uses a lot of conditional phrasing, I’d like to point out," Conway said. Conway also added that Trump frequently is "signing checks privately to help people" from his own bank account separate from the foundation, "You can only imagine how many people have asked Mr. Trump for his time and his resources and his connections and his money privately, and he does that and he doesn’t have cameras in there, it doesn’t go through foundations," she said. Burnett pointed that the public could verify those donations if Trump released his tax returns, to which Conway didn’t directly respond.
