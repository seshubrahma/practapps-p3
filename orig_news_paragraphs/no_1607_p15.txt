The death of Mr. Breitbart, at age 43 of heart failure, was a shock to his reporters and fans. Mr. Bannon threw himself into the    management of the site, opening branches in Los Angeles and London and leading   conference calls during which he issued directives on what stories to pursue. His business acumen has paid off: Breitbart received 18. 3 million unique visitors in July, according to data from comScore, up about 40 percent from the year prior. The site has outpaced conservative rivals like The Daily Caller, and Breitbart executives say that monthly traffic has increased by 16 times since the year Mr. Bannon took over.
