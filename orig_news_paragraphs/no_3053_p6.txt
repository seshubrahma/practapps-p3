CNN’s termination of its relationship with Griffin is the latest in the continuing fallout over the image. On Wednesday, ADT  —   the largest home security company in North America   —   announced it would pull its advertising from CNN over the photo, while the Route 66 Casino in Albuquerque, New Mexico announced it had cancelled Griffin’s upcoming performance, which had been scheduled for June 16. The U. S. Secret Service is also reportedly investigating the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot.
