Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana has so far played the role of Donald J. Trump’s translator to conservatives, character witness to evangelical Christians, and clarifier in chief, issuing explanatory statements after Mr. Trump has committed a variety of unforced political errors. By now, he had hoped to add another line to his 2016 political résumé: surrogate in chief, stumping with and raising money for Republican Senate candidates. But, especially among vulnerable incumbents, the reception has been tentative at best. The problem is not Mr. Pence, strictly speaking: He is largely viewed with respect and appreciation by fellow Republicans.
