Her uneasy role as a feminist who only fights for women who don’t threaten her stature and grasp of power makes her, at best, a controversial role model. At worst, it makes her the exact opposite of the kind of women we say we want to be    women who support each other. The way for women to get ahead isn’t at the expense of other women. I just hope the young girls looking up to the first female nominee know that.
