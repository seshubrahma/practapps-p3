Washington (CNN) The US director of national intelligence has denied that the intelligence community leaked claims that Russia holds compromising personal and financial information on   Donald Trump. In an unusual statement on Wednesday evening that highlighted tensions between spy chiefs and the incoming president, James Clapper, a key adviser to the US President on security and intelligence, rejected a suggestion by Trump that the agencies were responsible for the story going public. Clapper said he told Trump that intelligence agencies made no judgment about the reliability of the allegations.
