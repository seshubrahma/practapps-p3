Trump’s National Policy Director, Stephen Miller, wrote in a statement to Mediaite: Indeed, Kaine’s statement suggesting that Sanctuary Cities do not exist is particularly remarkable given that Tranchant lost his daughter as a direct result of   Kaine’s support for lax immigration enforcement. Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly commented on Tranchant’s death at the time, and noted that Governor Kaine did not "seem to care" about stopping illegal alien crime. O’Reilly said: Once again, a sanctuary city policy has killed Americans. As we reported last night,    Allison Kunhardt and    Tessa Tranchant were killed by an illegal alien drunk driver in Virginia.
