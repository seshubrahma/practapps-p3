Kushner was a private citizen at the time, not a US government official. Raising more questions about the nature of the communication, Kushner allegedly suggested that the conversations take place at Russian diplomatic facilities to remain outside the reach of US intelligence agencies, according to the Post report, which cited US officials briefed on intelligence reports. Trump officials will respond that there is nothing untoward about what happened. They will argue that Kushner was attempting to create a secret back channel with an adversary to ease relations and to conduct constructive negotiations.
