But House Minority Whip, Rep. Steny Hoyer,   released a statement saying he was "deeply concerned" about McCarthy moving ahead with a plan to repeal the law with no strategy to address those who could lose coverage.     "Democrats will strongly oppose these efforts, and we will continue working to ensure that affordable health coverage is accessible to all Americans," Hoyer said. McCarthy, like other GOP leaders, declined to give a detailed time line on when the House will vote to repeal Obamacare. But said he expected to use a budget procedure called "reconciliation" as a vehicle for the issue because that allows the passage of the legislation in the Senate with a simple majority, making it harder for Democrats to stymie the effort.
