Nearly a dozen news organizations, including two of Russiaâ€™s last independent newspapers, Vedomosti and Novaya Gazeta, had collaborated in tracing the money. But WikiLeaks seized on the contribution of just one: the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. In a series of Twitter posts after the revelations about Mr. Roldugin, WikiLeaks questioned the integrity of the reporting, noting that the project had received grants from the Soros Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development. Mr. Assange, in an interview with Al Jazeera, reiterated the suggestion that the consortium, with a   agenda, had   the documents it chose to release.
