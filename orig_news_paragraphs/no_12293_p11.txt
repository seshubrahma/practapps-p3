How many criminal aliens does each state have? That information is not readily available but can be found through diligent sifting through government documents, especially the annual reports by the US Department of Justice on reimbursement grants to state and local jails under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). It is astonishing how many newspaper reporters have never looked at those annual reports and reported on the number of criminal aliens in local jails. What the state CDOC data do not reveal is that local jails in Colorado also receive annual SCAAP reimbursement grants for partial reimbursement of the costs to county taxpayers.
