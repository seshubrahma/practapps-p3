Washington (CNN) The FBI has asked to examine the cell phones of a small number Democratic Party staffers as it investigates a possible hack, law enforcement and Democratic sources told CNN Tuesday. The development comes on the same day Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told lawmakers that 18 states have asked for help in warding off cyberattacks on their electronic voting systems.   Law enforcement officials have reached out to the staffers individually about "imaging" their phones to search for evidence of hacking, such as malware.
