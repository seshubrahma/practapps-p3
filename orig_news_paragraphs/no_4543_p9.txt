But when it comes to U. S. employment and manufacturing, Muskâ€™s companies are near or at the top as the   players. From a base of just 899 Tesla employees in 2010, Tesla now has roughly 25, 000 U. S. workers   SpaceX has 4, 000 U. S. employees   Gigafactory expects to hire 6, 500 American workers when completed and his development stage Hyperloop One has 200 employees. The Trump   Musk charm offensive has been a home run for Tesla.
