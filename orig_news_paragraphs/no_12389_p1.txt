Rivas told   that since the incident, she has received harassing phone calls at her and husband Jorge’s Mexican restaurant, vulgar comments on both her and the business’ Facebook pages, and received malicious restaurant reviews on Yelp for Sammy’s Mexican Grill in Catalina.   Rivas has been shocked by the backlash from her Trump sign, according to the report. However, Rivas said she received no such response from Trump supporters after taking a similar sign to the Tucson Bernie Sanders rally. Mrs. Rivas told the local news outlet that she has the right to say what she thinks and can listen to Trump or Bernie or Hillary Clinton if she chooses.
