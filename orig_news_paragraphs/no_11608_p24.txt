In a large profile in the Minneapolis StarTribune, his mother Fadumo Hussein was described as "heartbroken" and portrayed as having her "home" being "shadowed" by "the question of terrorism" for years. The local newspaper paints the FBI agents who raided their home as jackbooted thugs who disrupted their life. " On Sunday morning, that question once again stormed into her life, when FBI agents crashed through the door of her south Minneapolis house in search of her youngest son, Guled Omar," Paul McEnroe wrote in the Star Tribune on April 21, 2015, adding: Rousting her from sleep, the agents had surrounded the house about 9 a. m. and then stormed in to arrest her    son.
