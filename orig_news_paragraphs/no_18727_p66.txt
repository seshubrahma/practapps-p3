The vast machinery of American governance might in many ways keep an outlandish President Trump in check. But there’s not much to prevent Trump’s White House press shop from resembling his press shop now: capricious, inscrutable, vindictive, insulated. I’m imagining President Trump communicating solely via tweets and   to cable news shows. I’m imagining the New York Times —  a paper that Trump says "allows dishonest reporters to totally fabricate stories" —  getting barred on a whim from the White House briefing room.
