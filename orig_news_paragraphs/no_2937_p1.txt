In Wisconsin’s statehouse, a heckler shouted, "We’re all going to go to war and die thanks to you," during the formal meeting of the Electoral College. And in New York, an elector by the name of William Jefferson Clinton cast his vote for his wife and then came out to make plain that he believes Donald J. Trump won the presidency only because of outside interference in the election. " We had the Russians and the F. B. I. and she couldn’t prevail against that, but she did everything else and still won by 2. 8 million votes," Mr. Clinton said, his determined smile belying his fury.
