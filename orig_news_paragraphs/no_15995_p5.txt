Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post earlier this spring that many of the emails deemed "classified" were only done so by intelligence agencies after they were sent. Because she didn’t knowingly and intentionally send state secrets on an unsecure server, there isn’t really much of a case to lead her away in handcuffs to a federal courtroom.   As for the substance of the 296 emails rolled out by the State Department last May, roughly a dozen were from Sidney Blumenthal   a writer, lobbyist and longtime Clinton ally   sent to Clinton’s email account during her time as top diplomat, and they have also raised eyebrows.    Blumenthal was barred from working for the State Department in 2009 because he regularly blasted Barack Obama during the 2008 election.
