Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who had been under fire for comments last summer criticizing Trump, was the only justice to write separately. She made a point of saying that she voted to deny the Democrats’ request because the laws in Ohio already forbid voter intimidation.   After her comments last summer, there were some who argued that if the Supreme Court were to ever hear Trump v. Clinton type case after the election  she would have to recuse herself.   Although the final vote count may never be known, Ginsburg’s statement also highlights that the   court was not deadlocked in a case presented to it a day before the election.
