No ransom, Obama also forcibly denied that his administration had effectively paid a ransom to Iran after delivering $400 million of a $1. 7 billion payment to settle a   dispute over an arms deal on the same day that four US prisoners were freed in January. Obama dismisses Iraq hostage ransom claim, "We do not pay ransom. We didn’t here and we won’t in the future," Obama said, adding that he had been open about the deal at the time and that recent reports about it simply offered new details about the transfer, carried out with a plane ferrying palettes of foreign currency.
