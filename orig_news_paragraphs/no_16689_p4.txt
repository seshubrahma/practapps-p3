Trump did meet Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   during which the two discussed "the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt," according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.   Clintonâ€™s meeting with Poroshenko took place just a few minutes before Trump met with el Sisi a short distance away. Before that meeting the Democratic nominee said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily "the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression. "
