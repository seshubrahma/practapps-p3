The Los Angeles Times paid a visit to Donald Trump’s Southern California headquarters in Long Beach on Monday and was stunned by the diversity of volunteers who are committed to seeing him win the Golden State and the presidency. ["It was as if the whole thing had been staged, in Cambodia Town, no less, to belie the notion that Trump’s appeal is largely limited to older white males," the Times‘s Steve Lopez wrote. In Long Beach, one of America’s most diverse cities, that same diversity was reflected in Trump’s supporters at his Southern California headquarters.   Lopez spoke with a woman and millennials of Filipino descent, a   and a Jewish man, and saw the "names of volunteers from the   Hispanic and Asian communities" written on blackboards adorning the names of volunteers.
