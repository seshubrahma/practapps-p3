Government lawyers asked the court for a delay "because of the federal governmentâ€™s change in administration." "The United States requires additional time to brief the new leadership of the department on this case and the issues to be addressed at that hearing before making any representations to the court. This motion is made in good faith and not for the purposes of delay," the government lawyers wrote. CNN contributor Steve Vladeck points out that on the surface, the filing suggests something obvious: the new administration is working to get its legs under it.
