Earlier in the day, Judge John Mativo said in a ruling that closure of Dadaab violates the country’s constitution. The government’s closure and repatriation plans are "arbitrary, discriminatory and undignifying and hence a violation of Articles 27 and 28 of the constitution and consequently the same is null and void," Judge Mativo declared.   The government has long held the view that Dadaab has been used as a base by the   terror group. The camp began to grow with the outbreak of instability and violence in Somalia in the early 1990s and is currently home to approximately 260, 000 people.
