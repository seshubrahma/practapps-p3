A future that sees us restore our parliamentary sovereignty and national   and to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit. A future that sees us take back control of the things that matter to us   —   things like our national borders and immigration policy, and the way we decide and interpret our own laws   —   so that we are able to shape a better, more prosperous future for the working men and women of Britain.
