The heaviest applause was saved for Trump himself, when he immediately attacked Clinton as a "vessel" for the establishment. " Hillary is a vessel for the corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and ruining the sovereignty of our nation," he said in the opening moments of his rally. When asked by Breitbart News about the recently unveiled Access Hollywood audio from 2005 showing Trump making lewd comments about women, attendees shrugged it off and said he "was still better than Hillary" or that "Clinton had done much worse" while serving in government.
