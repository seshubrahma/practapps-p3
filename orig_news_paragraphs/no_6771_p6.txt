In their own statement, LaBeouf, Ronkko and Turner wrote that the museum failed to consult them when it staged a political rally at the exhibit in January, and accused the museum of "bowing to political pressure" in closing it. " It is clear, therefore, that the Museum of the Moving Image is not fit to speak of our intent as artists," the group wrote. As of Saturday, the exhibit had moved to the El Rey Theatre in downtown Albuquerque.
