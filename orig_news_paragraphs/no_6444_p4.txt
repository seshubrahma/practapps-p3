Much of the executive order was already blocked by another group of progressive judges in Virginia, who claimed that it is unconstitutional because of Trump’s   criticism of Islam. The California court did not bring up Trump’s campaign comments or claim religious animus, but repeatedly emphasized that Trump needs support from agency reports and the courts before he can rewrite the nation’s immigration policies. To justify its claim for a greater bureaucratic and judicial role in national immigration policy, the court had to deal with a 1952 law giving the president   authority over immigration policy. According to the court: In the INA of 1952, Congress delegated some of its power to the President through Section 212( f) which provides: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
