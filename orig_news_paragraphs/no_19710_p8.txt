there appears to be at least some bipartisan support for the idea of free college. Democrats have long framed the matter of free college as a way of giving all students equal access to educational opportunities no matter their backgrounds, while Republicans have argued that free college benefits local economies. Cuomo touched on that argument when he said he hoped the New York proposal would be "a   call to this nation" if the United States wants to be competitive globally. In recent years, the United States has fallen behind other countries in the percentage of students who complete degrees, and there are sizable gaps in college completion between white students and students of color, who make up a growing portion of the nationâ€™s young people.
