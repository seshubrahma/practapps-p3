Trump is expected to hire attorney Marc Kasowitz to represent him as part of a team on matters related to the inquiry into his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, according to a senior administration official and a person close to Trump. A source with knowledge of the matter told CNN the hiring process is not over and there are internal discussions on building out a team. Trump and his aides have also discussed establishing a crisis communication effort led by advisers outside and inside the White House to combat allegations, sources tell CNN. Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s controversial former campaign manager, has been seen in the White House to discuss possibly becoming the administration’s top adviser on crisis management as part of a broader effort to prepare for a   crisis related to the special counsel’s investigation, sources said.
