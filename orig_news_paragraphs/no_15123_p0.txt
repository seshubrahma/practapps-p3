Aurora, Colorado (CNN) Republican Rep. Mike Coffman faced angry constituents at a town hall Wednesday night, in an early sign of the political price he and his colleagues might pay for supporting President Donald Trump’s policies, including the repeal of Obamacare. A moderate hailing from a swing district, Coffman fielded more than 40 questions from Coloradans for almost two hours. Health care overwhelmingly dominated the at times raucous evening, as the congressman’s constituents demanded to know why he backed a bill to gut Obamacare before it was yanked from the House floor.
