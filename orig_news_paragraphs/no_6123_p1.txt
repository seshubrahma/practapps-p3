Coulter was invited to speak by the Berkeley College Republicans, Young America’s Foundation (YAF) and a student dialogue group called BridgeCal. The event was set for April 27, but the UC Berkeley administration canceled the event. It offered alternative dates, ostensibly because they would be more manageable from a security standpoint. But Coulter refused to bow to the "heckler’s veto"  —   or, more accurately, "rioter’s veto"  —   over when she would speak.
