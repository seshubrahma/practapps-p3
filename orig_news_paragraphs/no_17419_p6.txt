America needs a new unified vision for the Arctic    underpinned by integrity, imagination and integration. This renewed vision ensures the physical security and economic prosperity of our people and interests, and promotes our values at home and abroad. To advance this, America should commit to achieving the goals of constructing a new maritime trade route, sustainable energy development and building a new northern naval fleet over the next decade.   This bold initiative demands a national pledge to develop a new web of deep water ports, airports, roads,   networks,   rails and oil and gas pipelines
