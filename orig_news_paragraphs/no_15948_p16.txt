" If we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with a broad brush and imply that we are at war with an entire region, then we’re doing the terrorists’ work for them," Obama said on Tuesday. He also laid into critics like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani who contend that his reluctance to use the phrase "radical Islamic terrorism" is proof that he does not understand the nature of the threat, let alone how to confront it. That language too, he argued, can be   as it plays into terrorists’ desire to see a civilizational struggle with the West and see the alienation of Muslims in America.
