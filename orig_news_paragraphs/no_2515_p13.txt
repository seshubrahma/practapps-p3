In 2012, led by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, Congress overwhelmingly passed more sanctions tied to Russian human rights abuses. Last week, Congress passed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act as part of the broad defense bill, continuing a longstanding bipartisan focus on human rights and anticorruption efforts. " I have found Congress on both sides of the aisle to be entirely robust on the issue of Russia," said William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital, noting that the Senate passed the 2012 measure 92 to 4.
