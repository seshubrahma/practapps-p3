"  The ADL’s entry of Pepe the Frog into the Hate Symbol Database is accompanied with various modified images, portraying the cartoon frog as a Nazi, a Ku Klux Klan member, a negative stereotype of a Jew, and a black person. Hate on Display, otherwise known as the Hate Symbol Database, was launched as a definitive collection of some of the world’s most hateful icons and symbols. It currently includes such entries as the Nazi swastika, the burning cross, "1488" the Blood Drop Cross, the Confederate flag, the iron cross, Ku Klux Klan robes, a noose, the   South African flag, SS lightning bolts, and Stormfront’s logo.
