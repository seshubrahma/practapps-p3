British PM Theresa May for not taking a more   approach in response to the Nice attack. Mike Hookem MEP, the partyâ€™s defence spokesman, said: "My thoughts go out to the friends and families of those who died and of course it is heartbreaking that there are young children involved but these terrorists have no limits to their murder. " Once again this highlights the foolishness of open borders with not only 1. 8 million migrants coming in but free movement of weapons probably including those which were found in the cab of the lorry.
