 (CNN) President Donald Trump’s budget director said Friday that Republicans’ health care bill would shift decisions such as whether to cover maternity care to states    and if voters don’t like them, they should change their state laws. " States not only have the ability to require those services    many of them already do," Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said on CBS’s "This Morning."
