Washington (CNN) The execution of an Iranian nuclear scientist accused of spying for the US is reverberating from Tehran to the presidential campaign trail. Critics, including opponent Donald Trump, are slamming former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for having received emails mentioning him on her controversial personal email server. Trump took to Twitter on Monday to link Clinton to Shahram Amiri’s death, writing, "Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U. S. because of Hillary Clinton’s hacked emails."
