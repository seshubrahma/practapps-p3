Progressive Americans view Trump through a lens of race because race is a primary lens in their view of all reality. Traditional Americans may not like Trump’s comments on race or women, but their primary lens is   security and liberty, so they focus on his statements regarding those matters. Traditional Americans are not all racists. Many tune out Trump’s disconcerting traits because they genuinely believe he can keep all Americans safe, including minorities.
