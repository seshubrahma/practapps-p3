Costello was quick to break with Trump on some issues. He called a   border wall impractical, said Trump’s budget doesn’t have "any chance of passing" the House and criticized the President for seeking to cut health research funding.   When asked how he could condone the US bombing of Syria but turn away those fleeing violence there, Costello broke sharply with Trump over his decision to stop admitting Syrian refugees.   "Good question," Costello said.
