CORRECTION: The previous description for this article mistakenly claimed that Cal Poly SQE had partnered with The Satanic Temple to host their event. The Satanic Temple have since reached out to clarify that they have nothing to do with the event, and reject Cal Poly SQEâ€™s celebration of the shutdown of MILO at UC Davis.
