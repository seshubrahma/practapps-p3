Trumpâ€™s chief assignment Sunday night was to stop a crisis. Ahead of the debate, running mate Mike Pence was bailing, members of Congress were denouncing him en masse and the Republican National Committee was considering cutting him off.

Afterward, a   instant poll of debate watchers found that Clinton had won, 57% to 34%.
