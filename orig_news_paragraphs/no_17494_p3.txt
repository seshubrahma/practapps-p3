"Safe to say, the 2016 Republican presidential primary is anyone’s race. With no frontrunner and identical numbers for the top five contenders, it’s a horserace which can only be described as a scrambled field    at least so far," Tim Malloy, assistant director of the poll, said in a statement. While Bush, Walker and Rubio have traditionally led most polls, Carson and Huckabee are newer entrants to the field’s top tier. The pair joined the race during the first week of May and their rise may reflect a   bump as much as it does any durable groundswell that will carry them to the GOP nomination.
