At a show in New York City in October, Schumer addressed an incident that occurred the previous night at a show in Tampa, in which a large number of people in the audience (reports estimated 200) walked out on her after she began mocking   presidential candidate Donald Trump. In response, she proceeded to mock the frustrated audience members too. " Dearest Tampa," she read aloud from an open letter on the stage in Madison Square Garden.
