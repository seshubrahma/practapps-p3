Trump essentially returned the issue of school bathrooms to the states. Obama’s transgender bathroom policy was actually halted in August of 2016 by a U. S. district judge who said the former president had overstepped his authority in issuing the directive. The order comes "in light of an action yesterday by the Trump Administration to roll back federal guidelines that protected transgender students in public school," states the press release from the governor’s office. The governor said in a statement: Discrimination, harassment, and bullying have no place in our classrooms or at our schools.
