A top student and athlete, Edwards, 15, was shot to death when a police officer fired his rifle into a car in the Dallas suburb. The officer was later terminated.    This comes as the Justice Department has refused to charge two police officers in the July 5, 2016, convenience store shooting of Sterling. A bystanderâ€™s video showed police pinning Sterling to the ground before shooting him.
