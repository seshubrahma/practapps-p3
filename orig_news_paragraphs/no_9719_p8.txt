The fire investigator who interviewed Moore looked at surveillance video from another location and positively identified the man leaving the mosque as the same person he spoke to at the scene of the fire on December 25. On December 28, another investigator showed Saleem Memon, a member of the mosque for eleven years, a surveillance photo of the man leaving the mosque. He positively identified the man as Gary Nathaniel Moore. On December 29, a search warrant was executed for Mooreâ€™s residence, and officials found a backpack and clothing that appeared to be the same as Moore had on when at the mosque.
