—   Trump’s Latino vote will fall between 9. 5% and 20. 5%,"   Justin H. Gross, the chief statistician at Latino Decisions and   assistant professor of political science at   said   in a statement. ’ ’    " Furthermore, support for   candidates seems to be   lagging behind the electorate at large this election season,   making it extremely likely that we will see Clinton’s share of   the Latino vote surpass the 71% Obama earned in 2012 and the 72%   Bill Clinton earned in 1996," he continued.
