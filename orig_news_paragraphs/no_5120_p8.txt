Despite commenting as graciously as I could on media coverage of yesterday’s shooting, alas, today a perversely biased media’s   blame game is attempting to destroy innocent people with lies and more fake news. As I said yesterday, I’d hoped the media had collectively matured since the last attack on a Representative when media coverage spewed blatant lies about who was to blame. There’s been no improvement. The NYT has gotten worse.
