They think the GOP needs a policy mix to address income inequality and promote redistribution —  albeit to the middle class —  rather than aiming for faster growth. This raised the ire of Ross Douthat at the New York Times, who thinks the Journal pushing Ryan into battle against both Trumpism and the reformicons is "some ripely delusional stuff": Ryan has to appear neutral because Trump is threatening riots? I’m old enough to remember when the Journal editorial page opposed appeasement! Ryan shouldn’t risk any kind of rupture because if Trump is the nominee a Republican civil war might cost the G. O. P. the House?
