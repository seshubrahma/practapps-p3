LaBeouf is inviting the public to participate in the project by saying the phrase, "He will not divide us," into the camera.   " In this way, the mantra ’HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US’ acts as a show of resistance or insistence, opposition or optimism, guided by the spirit of each individual participant and the community," read a description of the installation on LaBeouf’s website.   Actor Jaden Smith was among the people visiting the project on Friday.
