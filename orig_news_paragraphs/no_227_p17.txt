The authorities began enforcing a soft and a hard perimeter in central Washington in the early hours of Friday morning, and other road closings around the region followed. Only local vehicles were allowed within the soft perimeter. No civilian vehicles could pass inside the hard perimeter, where federal security forces were screening anyone hoping to enter by foot. To assure security, many items, including backpacks and posters, are prohibited on the Capitol grounds, along the parade route and at the inaugural balls.
