I understand that visual symbols of solidarity are important, but when meanings are ascribed to these colors, as they are, we run into peculiar and often misleading interpretations of history. From the time Hillary Clinton appeared in a white pants suit for a presidential debate and then for her acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, observers went haywire. Every major news outlet, presumably relying on snippets found on Google, proclaimed that white was the color of the suffrage movement and that Clinton’s wardrobe was "a nod" to that long ago fight for the vote. A few commentators discovered that earlier women’s movements were as conscious as we are of colors as symbols.
