One protester wearing a Donald Trump wig also wore lipstick and danced around to the rap song "F**k Donald Trump" while holding dollar bills, brandishing his middle fingers, and appearing to occasionally grab his crotch. For the most part, protestersâ€™ signs did little more than insult Trump over his looks, compare him to Adolf Hitler, and call him as stupid bigoted. Nearing the end of the rally, three young people came out of the building, announcing that they had been kicked out.
