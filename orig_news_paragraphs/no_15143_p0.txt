Washington (CNN) WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange responded Friday to criticism from CIA Director Mike Pompeo, calling Pompeo’s remarks "dangerous" and an attempt to "stifle speech. " "Director Pompeo’s statement sought not only to threaten Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks, but to definitively subvert the First Amendment and fundamental notions that are intrinsic to American democracy," the statement said. The statement went on to compare Pompeo’s "attempts to demonize" Assange as on par with Syrian President Bashar  .
