After   comedian Kathy Griffin posed with a bludgeoned   severed head of President Donald Trump, social media has exploded with reactions to the controversial photo. [The image of Griffin, obtained by TMZ, depicts a gory, severed version of Trumpâ€™s head, as the former Fashion Police host stands with a cold expression on her face.   Now, social media users have gone online to express their disgust for the image: Of course CNN will probably keep Kathy Griffin on the payroll for their annual New Years Eve coverage, cuz they want Trump dead too.   Sad.
