Runs more than 1, 100 miles, Dakota Access and pipeline supporters say the $3. 7 billion pipeline project would be an economic boon.   The developer estimates the pipeline would bring $156 million in sales and income taxes to state and local governments and will add 8, 000 to 12, 000 construction jobs. The pipeline will stretch 1, 172 miles through four states    from North Dakota into South Dakota, winding through Iowa and ending in southern Illinois    moving 470, 000 barrels of crude oil a day across the Midwest. It is completed, except for the contested portion under Lake Oahe.
