The Republican Party has our largest majority in the House of Representatives since 1928, and a majority in the Senate holding President Obama accountable. We need a Republican president to bring things full circle and finish the work of restoring American greatness. Cleveland is the perfect setting for us to show the American people we are the only party prepared to restore security, prosperity and liberty to our country.
