All the polls from the March 1 states are too old to tell us much, but most of them have Trump way out in front: Trump +21 percent in Alabama Trump +4 in Alaska Trump +9 in Georgia Trump +5 in Oklahoma. He’s close in a bevy of other states, including Texas, where he trails Ted Cruz by five percent as of late January. In the debate, Trump will likely be attacked on two fronts: lack of conservative values, and   values. He’ll fight back against Cruz on the Christian values point by going personal, driving home Cruz’s lack of charitable giving and accusing him of   campaigning, a tactic that seemed to work decently given the tacit help of Carson in New Hampshire.
