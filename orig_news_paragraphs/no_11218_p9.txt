In a letter to Carey, Patterson demanded and requested that ORR comply with the Refugee Act of 1980 and initiate consultations with Oakland County prior to the resettlement of any refugees there. Carey, in essence, told Patterson in his response that neither he nor the ORR intended to comply with the Refugee Act of 1980â€™s requirements to consult with local county governments. The huge influx of unwelcome refugees to Michigan and the strong grassroots opposition to the federally imposed program, is a key factor that now places the state in play in the November contest between GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Most recent polls in the Real Clear Politics average, conducted between August 22 and September 7, indicate that Clinton leads Trump in Michigan by 5 points.
