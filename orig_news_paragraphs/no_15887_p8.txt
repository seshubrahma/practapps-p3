SESSIONS: I think, in retrospect, as all of us begin to look at that clearly and talk about it, as perspectives of the Department of Justice, once the director had first got involved and embroiled in a public discussion of this investigation, which would have been better never to have been discussed publicly, and said he     it was over. Then when he found new evidence that came up, I think he probably was required to tell Congress that it wasnâ€™t over, that new evidence had been developed.
