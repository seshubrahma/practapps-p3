This is the legally sanctioned practice of abortion. The rate of abortion among blacks is far higher than among whites, with 365 black babies aborted for every 1, 000 that are born. While blacks account for roughly 38% of all abortions in the country, they represent only 13 percent of the population, statistics that have led black Christian leaders to speak of a "black genocide" occurring at the hands of abortionists. In New York City, for instance, in recent years there were more abortions among black women in the city than there were black babies born.
