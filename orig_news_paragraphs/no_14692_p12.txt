In an interview Tuesday evening with EE, an environmental   news outlet, Pruitt said he is concerned about cuts to grants and that he has spoken to Mulvaney about them. " I am concerned about the grants that have been targeted, particularly around water infrastructure, and those very important state revolving funds," Pruitt said. Pruitt was previously the Oklahoma attorney general and led lawsuits against the EPA during the Obama administration.
