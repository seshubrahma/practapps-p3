This is obviously not what happened in my case, but given the   revealed in the leaked    I can see how the uninitiated might get that impression. Politicians in fact go "off the record" with reporters with some frequency. As soon as the reporter grants the    provision, he is effectively allowing "veto power" over that material. That part of the conversation remains private unless he or she says otherwise.
