Itâ€™s not as if most of these players have huge upsides. Kaepernick is 29, Sanchez is 30 and McCown is 37. The 49ers will try the    Brian Hoyer, who had a decent year with the Bears, to replace Kaepernick, with Matt Barkley (career adjusted yards per attempt 4. 7) as backup. The website Spotrac, which evaluates sports contracts, sees Kaepernick as still having significant value.
