The party began enacting voter ID laws that rolled back early voting options that people of color were most likely to use and made it harder to register new voters. It adopted the ugly "illegals" term to demean fellow human beings. It excused racists within the party or pretended they didn’t exist, disrespected the nation’s first black president in multiple ways    and then topped it off by making the country’s most prominent birther their standard bearer. The party seems incapable of treating people of color with a basic level of respect and decency, let alone adjusting policies to make room for such voters.
