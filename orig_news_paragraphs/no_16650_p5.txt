" She continued: "If a candidate is erratic and threatening if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fears and lies on the trail if a candidate has no clear plans to implement their goals if they disrespect their fellow citizens, including folks who made extraordinary sacrifices for our country let me tell you, that is who they are. That is the kind of president they will be, trust me.
