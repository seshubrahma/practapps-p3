Clapper said he told Trump that intelligence agencies made no judgment about the reliability of the allegations. The claims were summarized in a   synopsis prepared for Trump and Barack Obama ahead of a national security briefing last week. Clapper’s statement amounted to the first public confirmation from a US official of CNN’s story that the synopsis existed and had been put together for the President,   and eight Congressional leaders. In his first news conference as   on Wednesday, Trump railed on the US intelligence agencies, suggesting they were responsible for leaking the "nonsense" to the media.
