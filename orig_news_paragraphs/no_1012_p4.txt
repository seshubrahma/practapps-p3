Today, San Diego is the   city in the country, but at the turn of the 20th century, its population stood at under 20, 000. That changed after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when the military expanded San Diego’s naval operations, and the city hasn’t stopped growing since. People know about San Diego’s surf breaks, but fewer know that it has the largest concentration of military personnel in the nation, with around 100, 000   members. I drove into town from the Salton Sea in my $   rental from Hertz as the last leg of a fun Southern California road trip.
