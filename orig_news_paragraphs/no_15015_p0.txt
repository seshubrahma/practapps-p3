 (CNN) As Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, descended into Baghdad on Monday, the   passenger aboard his military aircraft was neither a seasoned Iraq hand nor even someone who’d visited the country before. It was Jared Kushner, the    commercial real estate magnate, whose marriage to President Donald Trump’s eldest daughter has thrust the otherwise inexperienced diplomat into the center of US foreign relations    and seemingly every top issue facing the administration. Kushner was visiting Iraq at Dunford’s invitation to receive briefings on the military campaign against ISIS, and planned to meet with US and Iraqi officials.
