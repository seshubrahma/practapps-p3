The launch prompted South Korean security officials to call for the early deployment of an advanced American missile defense system that has provoked China. The missiles took off from   in northwest North Korea, and flew an average of 620 miles before falling into the sea between North Korea and Japan, said Noh   a South Korean military spokesman. The type of missile fired was not immediately clear, but Mr. Noh said it was unlikely that they were intercontinental ballistic missiles, which the North had recently threatened to test launch. During a meeting of the National Security Council, Hwang   the acting president of South Korea, called for the early deployment of the American missile defense system known as Thaad, or Terminal   Area Defense.
