Walter M. Shaub Jr. the director of the ethics office, said in a letter to Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, that he did not know when Ms. DeVos would be cleared by his agency as this was "dependent on the nominee to provide needed information, respond to questions and accept the terms of an ethics agreement. " Republicans have vowed hearings for as many nominees as possible before Mr. Trumpâ€™s inauguration, so that they can be cleared to served immediately, particularly those posts associated with national security. "
