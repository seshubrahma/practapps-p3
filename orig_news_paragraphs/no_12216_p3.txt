Lewandowski argued that Fox News was trying to use the event to promote its own employees, not the issues that mattered to voters. " What Fox wants to do is they want to have 24 million people tune in to watch Donald Trump so that their anchors can have the story about them," he said, pointing out that Trump could see it was a "bad deal" to appear at the debate. Lewandowski previewed a Trump event in Des Moines, saying he would be raising money for wounded veterans, and said in an interview on Morning Joe that other campaigns had phoned them for details of the event.
