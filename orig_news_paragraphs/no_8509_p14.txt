The only reason you will never see anything but a still photo of Serge is so that the media can trick the public into believing he has something like cerebral palsy.

We also have proof that the media know they are lying about Trump mocking a disabled man. In the "Comments" section to a Washington Post article pushing this lie, someone posted a perfectly respectful response that included the Catholics 4 Trump videos  â€”   of Trump doing the exact same imitation of a general and of Serge being interviewed.
