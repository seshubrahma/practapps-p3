Democrats, long worried about protecting conservative lawmakers and being viewed as soft on crime, have reversed course and now see an electoral advantage in moving to the left on guns. During the Democratic primary, for instance, Hillary Clinton routinely criticized Bernie Sanders for siding with the National Rifle Association, leading the Vermont senator to modify some of his positions. And in a break with his party, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump has scrambled the   divide with an apparent openness to some new gun measures directly aimed at terror suspects.   That didnâ€™t stop him from attacking his presumptive Democratic opponent as well as President Barack Obama on the gun issue Thursday night.
