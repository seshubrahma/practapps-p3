Washington (CNN)   Donald Trump unveiled plans Monday for his first 100 days in office, including proposals related to immigration, trade deals and defense policy, using a video published online to briefly outline his proposals. Trump promised to withdraw from negotiations on the   Partnership trade deal, cancel environmental restrictions put in place by President Barack Obama, ask his national security team to buttress against infrastructure attacks, have the Labor Department investigate federal worker visas and impose broad new bans on lobbying by government employees.   The six items Trump detailed Monday are all somewhat easy lifts inside Washington    because they can be done with a simple signature by Trump and do not require congressional approval.
