One concern is that THAAD’s advanced radar system could be used to spy on China’s activities, rather than monitor incoming missiles from North Korea, according to Mark Tokola of the Korean Economic Institute of America. China also worries THAAD would undermine its ability to respond to an attack on its own soil, says Tokola, a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Seoul. Beijing’s displeasure has reportedly been felt by South Korean businesses, particularly Lotte, the South Korean conglomerate which signed off a land swap deal with the government to provide a site for the THAAD launch systems in late February.   In a   commentary published by China’s official news agency, Xinhua, said the Lotte board would "hurt the Chinese people" and the "consequences could be severe" if it went ahead.
