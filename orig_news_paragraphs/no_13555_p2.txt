The Obama administration has asked Congress for budget authority to resettle 110, 000 refugees in the country during FY 2017. Congress, however, has not authorized that level of spending under the interim budget for FY 2017 that will continue into March 2017. Authorized spending simply continues at the 85, 000 annualized refugee levels. If the current level of refugee resettlement continues for the remaining nine months of FY 2017, more than 100, 000 refugees will be resettled, even though how the resettlement agencies would fund the additional 15, 000 refugees who are not in the interim budget remains unknown.
