While Pew data shows that 92% of the GOP electorate —  and 83% of the American electorate overall —   wants to see immigration levels frozen or reduced, Ryan has pushed to expand immigration into the United States. In 2013, Ryan worked with Luis Gutierrez to advance President Obama’s immigration expansion agenda, and in 2015 Ryan championed an omnibus spending bill that fully funded Obama’s open borders agenda. In fact, Ryan has a two decade long history of pushing open borders immigration policies —  dating back to his days as a Capitol Hill staffer when he worked to derail the bipartisan immigration curbs inspired by Civil Rights leader and   Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. Ryan was also a part of the crusade in the   against California’s Prop 187, which would have cut off state benefits to illegal immigrants.
