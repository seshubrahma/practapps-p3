The team was able to use this threshold to distinguish between deadly and   heat waves in the historical record, and then use the same threshold to observe how these conditions will play out in the future using climate models run with different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Future of deadly heat, The study allows us to peer into the future for any location on Earth and see how many days per year, on average, that location will cross the potentially deadly threshold the group has identified.   A web application was also developed so you can view any location under any of the potential emission scenarios.   For example, New York City, which now sees about two days per year that cross the threshold, rises to about 50 days per year by 2100.
