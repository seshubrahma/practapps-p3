Mr. Trump’s son Eric appeared at a   this month for Great America, while another son, Donald Jr. was the special guest at an event for Rebuild America Now less than a week later. While Mr. Trump has enjoyed success for a Republican presidential candidate in raising small contributions, the same qualities that have fired up his   supporters have turned off many wealthier Republican contributors, making it difficult for both Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee to keep pace among larger donors. Mr. Adelson at one point appeared to be the biggest potential backer in Mr. Trump’s corner. This spring, he published an   article endorsing Mr. Trump and urging other Republicans to get behind him, and in August he donated $1. 5 million to the Republican convention, where Mr. Trump was formally nominated in July.
