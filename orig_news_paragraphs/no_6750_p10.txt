" The US introduces into the Korean peninsula, the world’s biggest hotspot, huge nuclear strategic assets, seriously threatening peace and security of the peninsula and pushing the situation there to the brink of a war. This has created a dangerous situation in which a   war may break out any moment," said a statement from the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s Institute for Disarmament and Peace. The NBC report noted that South Korea’s government remains confident it would be consulted before any actions are taken against North Korea.
