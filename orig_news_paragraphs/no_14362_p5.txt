The IRGC is also a powerful economic player, with control over many Iranian industries. For years, the US has imposed tough sanctions on individuals and groups with links with the IRGC, and several administrations have considered the group a terrorist organization in previous executive orders. Most recently, the Trump administration announced sanctions on individuals who support the Qods Force on the heels of Iranâ€™s ballistic missile test last week. But it is unclear whether as a state entity, the IRGC would meet the legal criteria to be designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
