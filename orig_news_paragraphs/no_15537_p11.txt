He worked for 12 years in the US attorney’s offices, serving for some time as chief of the criminal division in the Northern District of California in San Francisco, and also working as an assistant US attorney in Boston.   He worked for a time in the private sector before moving back into government as an assistant to the attorney general in 1989, moving quickly to run the department’s criminal division.   As chief of the criminal division, Mueller saw the creation of the agency’s first   unit, putting himself on the leading edge of a field of crime fighting and national security that has only grown more important.
