I asked someone involved in the   effortto rank the Republican panic on a scale of one to ten, and he said 11. But harnessing that panic requires politicians and party regulars to organize themselves quickly, and there’s no leader in this effort. It requires them to take a big risk. Normally they don’t like to be on the wrong side of public opinion.
