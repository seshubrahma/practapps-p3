In a March hearing before the House intelligence committee, Comey publicly confirmed that the FBI and the Department of Justice had an open investigation into potential collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign.   The judiciary committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism announced earlier this week it had scheduled former   General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to testify at a May 8 hearing as part of that committee’s investigation into the Russia matter. The subcommittee is led by GOP Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina. The Senate and House intelligence committees also have open investigations into the matter.
