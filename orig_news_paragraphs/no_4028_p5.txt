If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. They were connected to, as we now know, the 1, 000 Russian agents who were involved in delivering those messages. Clintonâ€™s claim that voters were influenced by   fake news contrasts with a study titled "Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election,"   by economists Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University and Hunt Allcott of New York University. The research utilized web browsing data, a database of what the authors claimed were fake news stories and a   online survey about news trends.
