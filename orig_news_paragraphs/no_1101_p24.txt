In 1998, cattle ranching on the island ended for good. But some vestiges of the islandâ€™s ranching past still remain. Alana Ayasse, a graduate student studying geography at   Barbara, took the above picture on the island in September, while volunteering for a week with Channel Islands Restoration, a nonprofit that helps tend to the health of plants and animals in the park. She came across the horses while walking back to a field station one evening.
