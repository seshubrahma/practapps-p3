Camarota explained that these figures are just part of the larger immigration expansion that would take place under a President Clinton, who could potentially add as many as 10 million new immigrants to the country â€”   not including the millions of illegals to whom Clinton would grant amnesty. " Census data shows that each year the U. S. adds 1. 5 million legal and illegal new arrivals. If a President Clinton were to add 65, 000 Syrian arrivals on top of that number, then you could potentially see more than 6 million new immigrants added during her first term alone," Camarota explained.
