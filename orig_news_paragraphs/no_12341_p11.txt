Huma Abedin was raised in Saudi Arabia and worked for a publication sponsored by the Muslim World League, the specific organization that Clinton herself said was funding terror in the 2009 memo published by WikiLeaks. Now we have Sen. John McCain  —   with a nonprofit bearing his name taking $1 million from Saudi Arabia  —   springing to the defense of Mr. Kahn, just as he sprang to the defense of Huma Abedin when her security clearance was questioned. Donald Trump has become the bane of two political dynasties connected personally and financial to the Saudi Arabians   —   the Bushes and the Clintons.
