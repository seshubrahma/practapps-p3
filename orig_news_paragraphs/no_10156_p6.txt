In total votes cast, Democrats are down 221, 060 votes in Oregon compared to the 2008 contest, when Obama beat Clinton 59 percent to 41 percent, 375, 385 to 259, 825. The dropoff in Democratic turnout belies the mainstream media narrative that Democrats are motivated to defeat Trump and to participate in a vibrant primary contest. While Republicans consolidate behind GOP presumptive nominee Donald J. Trump, the Democratic race continues on two tracks. On one track, Clinton has 2, 294 delegates to Sanders with 1, 523, bringing the former New York senator within reaching distance of the 2, 383 threshold for nomination.
