Joe Luft, the executive director of the Internationals Network for Public Schools, which operates 15 high schools in New York City that specialize in teaching new immigrants, said losing people like Mr. PÃ©rez could adversely affect the students who had come to confide in him. " I really fear what that does to their sense of hope, which can be tenuous to students anyway," Mr. Luft said. According to an immigration lawyer, Stephen   Mr. Trump could still cancel the program immediately, or let the existing   work permits simply expire.
