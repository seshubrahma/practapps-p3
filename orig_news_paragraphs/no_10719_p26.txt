Let’s be honest enough to admit that all those    subsidies liberals love to promise are exercises of compulsive force, too  …     and not just against the people who are forced to pay for them at gunpoint.   Subsidies are compulsion against those who receive them, too.   Actions that would forfeit the subsidy become undesirable, or even unthinkable.   As with Trump’s example of playing hardball against Ford Motors, you’re not really "free to choose" if all but one of your free choices involves paying a fine, or giving up a subsidy you have been taught to depend on.
