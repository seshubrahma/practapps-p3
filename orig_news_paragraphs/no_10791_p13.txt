" UPDATE 4:03 P. M. ET, From Breitbart Tech: Twitter’s Trending section has not included any phrase regarding Hillary Clinton’s collapse outside New York City’s   memorial service Sunday morning, despite capturing the attention of reporters across the political spectrum and spawning multiple hashtags. UPDATE 3:31 P. M. ET, CNN’s Dylan Byers reports on the frustration from Clinton’s press pool that they were shut out of covering exactly what happened this morning: With less than sixty days until the election, neither Clinton nor Donald Trump has allowed for what’s known as a "protective pool," a rotating group of reporters that travel with a candidate in order to provide a    account of their activities. Without a protective pool, Clinton was able to leave the memorial site without reporters, travel to her daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment without reporters, and leave New York City for her home in Chappaqua, New York, without reporters.
