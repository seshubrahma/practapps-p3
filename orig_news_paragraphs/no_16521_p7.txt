The law requires voters to present any of eight different forms of identification. It reduced early voting from a   period to 10 days and it eliminated the stateâ€™s "preregistration" practice, which allowed    to preregister even if they would not be eligible to vote in the next election. In court briefs, challengers to the law had argued that the appeals court opinion would not disturb the election because the state had already taken steps to implement the decision including an online posting detailing the appeals court decision and reiterating that no photo ID would be required in the election. The groups and the Obama administration said the lower court opinion had been carefully crafted, and urged the Supreme Court to leave it undisturbed for now.
