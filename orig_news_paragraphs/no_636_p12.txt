Earlier in the week, some had seized on the Russian ship as a symbol. Representative Joe Courtney, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said on Wednesday on the House floor and in a statement that the presence of the Russian "spy ship" about 30 miles from the Groton submarine base was one of several "destabilizing" actions by Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. " This unacceptable, aggressive action, combined with the buzzing of U. S. Navy ships in the Black Sea yesterday, are clearly testing the resolve of a new administration," Mr. Courtney said in the statement on his website.
