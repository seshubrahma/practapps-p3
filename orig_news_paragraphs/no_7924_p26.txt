Ulukaya explained that Syrian refugees "bring flavors to the community just like in  …     Twin Falls, [Idaho]" where Ulukaya’s yogurt factory is based. As Leo Hohmann has previously reported, "the state of Idaho, despite its reputation as a mostly white, conservative farm state, has been a popular destination for refugees in recent years" —   in large part due to Ulukaya’s efforts to import refugees to work in his yogurt factory. " Ulukaya opened the world’s largest yogurt factory in Twin Falls about two years ago, and the plant now employs 600 people with about 30 percent of those jobs filled by foreign refugees shipped to the U. S. from United Nations camps in the Middle East and Africa," Hohmann writes.
