Wednesday on the "Tom Joyner Morning Show," while discussing President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch,   activist Al Sharpton quoted a James Brown song to urge Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to give the Republicans the "big payback," for refusing to give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing.   Sharpton said, "As I watched last night President Trump nominate Judge Gorsuch be in the Supreme Court  —   first of all let’s be clear, Gorsuch is a very conservative, go by the Founding Fathers kind of interpretation of how you deal with Constitutional law and would sit on that court and would rule in a way that would be against the interests of those of us that clearly when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, was not considered full human beings and full citizens. So when you deal with the mentality and the legal profile of Judge Gorsuch, it is not a good one. But even beyond that, let us not forget he is not sitting, and being nominated to sit in Scalia’s seat, he’s being nominated to sit in Garland’s seat.
