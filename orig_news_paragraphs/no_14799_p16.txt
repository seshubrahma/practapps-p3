Nothing was seen or heard from Park   on Friday.   Park has now lost presidential immunity, just days after special prosecutors recommended sheâ€™d be indicted as a bribery suspect, alleging she helped an unelected confidant to extort money from big business.   Park has denied any wrongdoing. But for these protesters, Friday was a day to celebrate, a day they believe they saw people power toppled a president.
