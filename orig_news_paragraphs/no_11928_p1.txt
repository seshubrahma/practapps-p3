Vafalay Massaquoi, an African American male, stands accused of fraudulently registering voters when he worked for the   New Virginia Majority advocacy group. Massaquoi filed the fake voter registrations with the Alexandria office but authorities caught the fraud and canceled the registrations before they could be used. Massaquoi was extradited from the Philadelphia area where she had moved earlier this year and is currently being held without bond in Alexandria. In the Sunshine State, two separate suspects were charged with voter fraud, one of whom is a    white woman from Westchester, FL.
