Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told CNN’s "New Day" on Friday that while he doesn’t "believe (climate change) is a hoax," he was unable to answer whether Trump agrees. " I do not speak for the President," Zinke said, later adding that he had not asked him. At no point was Zinke able to shed light on Trump’s climate change views.
