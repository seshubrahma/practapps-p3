I met people who defied neat categorization: a black woman in her 20s who worked at a record label in Miami a Japanese Uber driver in Las Vegas a Guyanese doorman in Queens, N. Y. At a rally in the campaign’s final week in Michigan, a Rust Belt state that would prove central to Mr. Trump’s victory, I saw how the candidate connected with crowd. When he spoke, it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his ear, listening for the smallest murmur of applause, which he would seize upon and amplify. It reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians I’d seen during my years based in Pakistan.
