This should be a very serious blizzard, one that everyone should take seriously," New York’s de Blasio said. The snow is expected to begin after midnight in New York City. The period of greatest accumulation should be between 6 a. m. and noon Tuesday, with a possible 2 to 4 inches per hour and whiteout potential during that time, de Blasio said. Baker provided similar details about what’s expected in Massachusetts, saying the state expects sleet, rain and extremely cold temperatures along the coast.
