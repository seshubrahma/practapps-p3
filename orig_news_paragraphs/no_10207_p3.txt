uninspired GOP have all contributed to this. In Donald Trump, they now have a quarterback who can throw a long ball, has a run game, can fill a stadium, read a defense and win. But instead of getting out in front and providing him a great offensive line, the GOP have become part of the corrupt defense trying to take him out! We have a man who is the most exciting political figure in decades, and his overall   message is America First.
