It is not uncommon for the presidential nominees of major parties to have contact with foreign leaders, or to meet with foreign government officials. During the campaign, Mr. Trump traveled to Mexico to meet with President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, and Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton met separately with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in September. Mrs. Clinton also met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt during the United Nations General Assembly session in October a spokesman for her campaign said there were no communications with Russia. But the possibility that Russian officials would be in touch with a candidate in the United States was a particularly sensitive one, because Russia has been accused of trying to interfere with the election.
