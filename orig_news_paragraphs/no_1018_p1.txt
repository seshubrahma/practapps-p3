The change is at the heart of a   of the National Security Council’s role under its new leader, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and reflects Mr. Trump’s belief that the N. S. C. should focus less on military operations and tactics and more on strategic issues. A guiding precept for the president and his team is that the balance of power in the world has shifted against American interests, and that General McMaster should focus on developing foreign and economic policy options in concert with the Pentagon, State Department and other agencies to respond to that challenge. The new approach to managing military operations was evident this month when a Marine artillery battery and a team of Army Rangers  —   some 400 troops in all   —   arrived in northern Syria.
