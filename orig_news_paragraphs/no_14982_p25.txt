Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a top campaign surrogate, failed to disclose during his confirmation hearings that he’d met before the election with the Russian ambassador    twice. He later announced he would recuse himself from any probe related to the 2016 campaign.   Jared Kushner, Trump’s    and senior aide, had two December meetings, one with the ambassador and Flynn, another with a Russian banker, neither disclosed until media reports made them public. The list goes on.
