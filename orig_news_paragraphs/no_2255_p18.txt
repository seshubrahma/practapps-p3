Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said the disappointing gross domestic product report makes a move by the Fed in September a bit less likely, but it could still be on track if the government issues strong jobs reports for July and August. Julyâ€™s data will be released by the Labor Department next Friday. " The domestic side of the economy looks O. K. Not stellar, not fantastic, but enough to keep us on a modest growth path," Mr. Gapen said.
