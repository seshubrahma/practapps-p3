We march to the beat of a different drummer. We don’t like government telling us what to do, let alone foreign governments or   like The Pope. We don’t take orders from foreign religious leaders. As a matter of fact, we would rather do the opposite of what a foreign leader tells us to do, than take orders from an outsider.
