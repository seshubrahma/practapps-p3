 (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired the man leading the federal investigation into his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia.   James Comey was dismissed from his post as FBI director, the White House said, on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. They cited Comey’s handling of the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, a controversy that many believe helped Trump defeat the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election.
