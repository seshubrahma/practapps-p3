Adams, best known for his syndicated comic strip, is also a trained hypnotist and expert in the field of persuasion. Long before the world of political pundits took Trump seriously as a candidate, Adams wrote that his superior persuasion skills would help him win the presidency   â€”   as early as the first Fox News debate. Now, Adams predicts that Trump will beat Clinton in a "landslide" come November.
