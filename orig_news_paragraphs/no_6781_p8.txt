U. S. President Donald Trump will continue to enforce a 2014 executive order by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, barring discrimination against LGBT people working for federal contractors, the White House said. The statement marked a break with the Republican Party’s traditional stance, but advocates said they feared Trump could still take executive actions allowing discrimination under the guise of religious exemptions. These fears are in spite of Trump’s actions as both presidential candidate and president, including Trump’s many statements about supporting equal protection for all Americans. Trump also had gay business leader Peter Thiel speak at the GOP’s 2016 convention and made him an active part of the Trump transition team.
