75 billion, IBM invented the IBM 5100 Portable Computer, weighing 50 pounds in 1975, modeled after the 5100 desktop computer but as compact as the IBM typewriter. In 1981, after further development, the IBM personal computer was available for $1, 565 and could process information faster than computers twenty years earlier, which cost $9 million and required a staff of 60 people to keep them running. After a consumer demand for a more portable computer, IBM began its development of the laptop. Through six years of development, IBM created the ThinkPad Brand, enabling the company to flourish through the 90’s and early 2000’s.
