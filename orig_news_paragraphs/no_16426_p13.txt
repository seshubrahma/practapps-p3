The State Department has not said whether it will release these emails to the public, as it did with the nearly 55, 000 pages of   emails Clinton provided last year. Comey said last month that the agency found "thousands" of emails from Clintonâ€™s server that were   and deleted and had not been turned over to the State Department. State will conduct its own review to determine whether any of the emails are personal, and any that are will not be released. Personal emails are not deemed "agency records" and therefore are not subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act.
