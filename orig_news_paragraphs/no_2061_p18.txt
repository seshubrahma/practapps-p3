The federal investigation, involving the F. B. I. and the intelligence agencies, has been going on since the Democratic National Committee first called in a private cybersecurity firm, Crowdstrike, in April. Preliminary conclusions were discussed on Thursday at a weekly cyberintelligence meeting for senior officials. The Crowdstrike report, supported by several other firms that have examined the same bits of code and telltale "metadata" left on documents that were released before WikiLeaks’ publication of the larger trove, concludes that the Federal Security Service, known as the F. S. B. entered the committee’s networks last summer. The G. R. U. a competing, military intelligence unit, was a later arrival.
