Clinton has a campaign designed with a beginning, a middle and an end. There is no doubt that John Podesta and others on her team have designed a strategy along with budgets, ad buys and messages that will all build toward Election Day. Plus, the Clinton campaign is well underway in building a ground game in key states, while Trump is not. It is safe to assume that Clintonâ€™s organizational efforts will give her a     advantage.
