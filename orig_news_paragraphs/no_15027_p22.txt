Speaking at a   meeting in Belgium on the future of Syria, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson blamed the Syrian regime. " All the evidence I have seen suggests that it was the Assad regime who did it, in full knowledge they were using illegal weapons in a barbaric attack on their own people," Johnson said.    Assadâ€™s military has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and consistently blames "terrorist" groups when chemical attacks are reported.
