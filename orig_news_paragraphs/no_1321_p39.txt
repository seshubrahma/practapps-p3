Is Texas "injured" if the federal government refuses to deport undocumented immigrants on Texas soil even though no specific Texan is? Is an injury that is general to all Texans "individualized" to Texas? Maybe or maybe not. In the 2007 case Massachusetts v. E. P. A. the Supreme Court tried to clear this up.
