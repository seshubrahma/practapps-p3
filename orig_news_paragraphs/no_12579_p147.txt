My office is in close contact with the local authorities on the ground and we will be offering to provide whatever support we can to help in assisting the victims and bringing the perpetrators to justice. I encourage anyone with information about the suspects to contact the Dallas Police Department at (214)  . Update 8:52 a. m.: Heartbreaking, graphic video captures the moment one killer shot an officer at   range.
