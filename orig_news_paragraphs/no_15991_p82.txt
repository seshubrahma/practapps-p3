Because State Department officials were deemed responsible for not adequately responding to security concerns and because Clinton was secretary of state at the time    even though there is no evidence that Clinton was directly responsible for the inadequate response     Trump said it was "Clintonâ€™s State Department" that ignored the requests not Clinton herself. However, because Trump overstates his claim and says "all" requests were refused and because he later implies that Clinton herself "denied him the security he asked for," we rate this claim as false. Trump also made the assertion that Clinton attributed the attack to an online video that was critical of Islam: "To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death," Trump said.
