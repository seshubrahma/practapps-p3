After meeting with Judge Gorsuch, conducting a thorough review of his record, and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is   among his peers," Donnelly said in the statement. Five more Democrats need to cast a yes vote to reach the 60 needed to break a potential filibuster attempt to confirm Gorsuch and 35 Democrats have said they will vote no. If the 60 votes arenâ€™t reached, the GOP could decide to change the Senate rules on Supreme Court nominations to a simple majority or 51 votes. Donnelly also said in that statement that he supports keeping the current   threshold for High Court nominees, Reuters reported.
