The outcry has grown to the point where Mr. Burnett, who rarely comments on political matters, felt compelled on Wednesday evening to issue a forceful denunciation of Mr. Trumpâ€™s presidential bid, saying he rejected "the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign. " Mr. Burnett issued his statement on the same night that several women came forward to say they had been groped or assaulted by Mr. Trump, a flood of accusations that continued on Thursday. Their accounts followed a video released last week from 2005 of Mr. Trump and the television host Billy Bush engaging in vulgar talk about women.
