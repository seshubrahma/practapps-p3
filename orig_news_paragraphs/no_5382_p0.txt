The White House again hit former National Security Adviser Susan Rice for refusing to testify to Congress regarding allegations that she "unmasked" the identities of Trump campaign aides during the 2016 election. ["I do think that it’s sad that she has chosen not to be transparent in this process," White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters during the press briefing on Friday.   Sanders added that it was up to Congress whether or not they should subpoena Rice, but that the White House was confident in the investigation. Rice declined a request from the Sen. Lindsey Graham to testify in the investigation into interference in the United States presidential election.
