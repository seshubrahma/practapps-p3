Fox claimed that Trump would take America over the edge and that Hillary Clinton would be the one person who could shut him up. Despite his tough talk against Trump, Fox seems to forget that he is at least partially responsible for the unending wave of violence that has taken over Mexico.   Fox, a member of the National Action   PAN, served as Mexicoâ€™s president from 2000 to 2006 when he made history for being the first president who was not part of the historically corrupt Institutional Revolutionary   PRI.   According various excerpts from "Mexico: Narco Violence and a Failed State?" by the late author and prestigious university professor George Grayson, the PRI had ruled over Mexico like a monarchy for more than 70 years turning a blind eye to smuggling activities unless they got out of line.
