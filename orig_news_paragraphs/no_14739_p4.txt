Trump has requested 5, 000 more agents be hired, and McAleenan said the agency is already struggling with attrition. Given current staffing levels, CBP needs to hire 6, 743 agents to reach Trump’s new goal.   But McAleenan said attrition was 6% a year, meaning it would take 2, 729 border patrol agents being hired annually to reach full staffing in five years.    If there were no attrition, based on CBP’s projections, it would take more than five years to hire the nearly 7, 000 additional agents at the optimistic rate, and CBP does not suggest it can do more than slow attrition.
