Clinton says potentially moving the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem is something that has to be looked at in a potential   solution. She says she favors using the U. S.â€™s veto power in the U. N. to protect Israel. She says she was the last person who brought Netanyahu and Abbas together. She says she got more encouragement to pursue a   solution after listening to that meeting along with George Mitchell.
