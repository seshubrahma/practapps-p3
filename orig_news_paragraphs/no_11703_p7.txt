Rubio chose to stand          with Chuck Schumer, as an American Marine was forced to suffer the indignity of being removed from Marco Rubio’s Gang of Eight press conference. That’s the story I want to tell today. Miller’s retelling of the event is as follows: I would love to tell a story for the first time to your incredible listening audience that I think gives some important insight into Mr. Rubio that I’ve never had a chance to tell before  …      I want everyone to step into a time machine and go back to 2013 and remember what it was like.
