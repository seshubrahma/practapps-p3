But too many of the #NeverTrump brigade are really #NeverTed. They don’t want to look at the math, they don’t want to look at the road ahead, they don’t want Ted Cruz. They’d rather lose with Rubio and stay home in November than ally with Ted Cruz and even have a shot in November. That is genuinely unfortunate and will either guarantee Trump is the nominee or guarantee the Republican Party is destroyed.
