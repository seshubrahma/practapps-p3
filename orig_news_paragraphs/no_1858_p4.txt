The New York Times is rethinking its own Metro coverage as the paper seeks to lure global audiences. Mr. Meyer, in the interview, said the decision to close The Observer’s print edition was a natural outgrowth of the paper ’s shift toward a national audience and the decline in print advertising that has afflicted the industry. Mr. Meyer, who is Mr. Kushner’s    said the decision had been two years in the making and was not related to Mr. Trump’s election this week.
