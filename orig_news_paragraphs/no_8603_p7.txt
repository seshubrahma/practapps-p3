Trump’s comments, made in a lengthy interview that lasted about a half an hour late last week, came in the wake of the Brussels terror attack. Trump argued that the attack proves the "terrorists are totally winning" their war on the West under the leadership of President Obama, much of which Hillary Clinton is responsible for given the fact she was Secretary of State at the time. Trump noted that Clinton’s weakness on terror policy puts her at risk in the general election. Trump said in that part of the interview, which Breitbart News published last week: The terrorists will cause Hillary Clinton to lose the election.
