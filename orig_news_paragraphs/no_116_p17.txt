Several of those charged on Wednesday played management roles in the development of the diesel engines that were equipped with   defeat devices   â€”   software intended to mask excess emissions by cranking up pollution controls whenever a car was being tested on rollers in a lab. Others have been accused of concocting excuses for the excess emissions and trying to prevent regulators from discovering the truth. Volkswagen also admitted that its employees destroyed emails and other evidence in 2015 as it became clear that regulators would soon learn of the illegal software.
