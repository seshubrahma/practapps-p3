So long as neither Trump nor Hillary wins a landslide of the remaining states, these   candidates could result in no candidate receiving 270 Electoral College votes, sending the entire matter to the House. Then the House could elect the   Republican as the   president of the United States. While the list is still being finalized, sources tell Breitbart News that the states being looked at include Ohio, Colorado, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Texas. The organizers are looking primarily to "favorite sons" in those states who they expect could carry the state against both the Republican and Democratic nominees.
