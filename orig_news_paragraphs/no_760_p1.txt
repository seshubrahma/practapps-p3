" The government owes my son an investigation," the father, William Owens, told The Miami Herald, referring to Chief Petty Officer William Owens, 36, a member of the Navyâ€™s SEAL Team 6. The death of Chief Owens on Jan. 29, in the first Special Operations raid approved by Mr. Trump, came after a chain of miscues and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious   firefight with Qaeda militants in a mountainous village in central Yemen. Three other Americans were wounded, and a $75 million aircraft was deliberately destroyed.
