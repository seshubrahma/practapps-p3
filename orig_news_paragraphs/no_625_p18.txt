_ 6. The police in Malaysia detained a woman holding Vietnamese travel documents and were looking for other suspects in what appears to have been a lethal poison attack on the half brother of North Koreaâ€™s leader, Kim   at the Kuala Lumpur airport. The brother, Kim   had pleaded for his life in a letter to the leader in 2012, but a South Korean official said there had been "a standing order" for his assassination since Kim   took power in 2011. Researchers say Mr. Kim has ordered more than 300 executions.
