As acting attorney general, Ms. Yates picked the fight of her life on Monday when she ordered the Justice Department not to defend President Trump’s executive order blocking refugees and restricting immigration to the United States. Ms. Yates became convinced, based on the president’s own statements, that he had intended to unlawfully single out Muslims, senior officials said. " We have comments from the president about what this is supposed to do," Ms. Yates said in one meeting on Monday, according to two people involved in the discussions.
