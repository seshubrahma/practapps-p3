I donâ€™t think it was ridiculous to be in a party that I disagreed   with on a lot of national issues. Change is made through party   coalitions, and I thought the Republican Party was where I   was more likely to be able to improve ideas at the margin in   the long run. Being a member of a party does not obligate you to   vote for its bad candidates in the meantime.
