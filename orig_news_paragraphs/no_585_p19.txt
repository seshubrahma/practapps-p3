Mr. Obama had begun attacks on Libya and was conferring about the military operation. Two years later, Mr. Obama held a dinner with President Xi Jinping of China at the Sunnylands resort in Rancho Mirage, Calif. But the dinner between the leaders was out of sight of members of the public, in a private dining room. Mr. Trump and White House aides who joined him and Mr. Abe for dinner on Saturday, including Stephen K. Bannon, the presidentâ€™s chief strategist, did not relocate the discussion to a secure location.
