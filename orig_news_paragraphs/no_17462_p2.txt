Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ordered that the lawsuit filed against Obamacare by lawyers for the House be put on temporary hold until after Trump’s inauguration.   Lawyers for the House noted in legal briefs that a temporary stay would provide the Trump administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or maybe reach a settlement, to which the court agreed. But Trump’s election prompted Patton and Parker, who receive subsidies from the law, to file an emergency motion with a federal appeals court on Tuesday in the hopes the court can rule on the motion to intervene before Trump’s inauguration on January 20.   If the court grants the motion, it will be lifting its temporary hold in the case long enough for the parties to brief on the motion to intervene.
