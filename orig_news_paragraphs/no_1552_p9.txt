In the 2015 biography "The Truth About Trump," the author, Michael Dâ€™Antonio, described interviewing Mr. Trump, who at one point slipped off a loafer to display a tiny bulge on his heel. And during a news conference last year, Mr. Trump could not recall which heel had been involved, prompting his campaign to release a statement saying it was both. Mr. Trump, who has hailed his health as "perfection," said the heel spurs were "not a big problem, but it was enough of a problem. "
