The Brotherhood is a group that declared war against the U. S. in 2010 —  and has since been designated an Islamic terrorist organization by several U. S. allies. Ideologically it seems, the Brotherhood believes "Only Muslim Lives Matter" and in the global domination of sharia. This clearly leaves anyone adhering to its ideology as a dangerous threat to American freedoms. Despite Ellison’s affiliation with both hate groups, he was endorsed earlier this month for the DNC chairmanship by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.
