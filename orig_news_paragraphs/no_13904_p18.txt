An aide to Sen. Jon Tester of Montana noted that the state has a   border with Canada and said Tester would focus his questioning on northern border issues. Tester plans to ask Kelly about combating visa overstays, the aide said. While Tester has not yet decided whether he will vote to confirm Kelly, the aide noted that Tester walked away very impressed  after the two met privately. Kellyâ€™s designation for the Cabinet post was also met with warm words by several Democrats on the committee, including Carper.
