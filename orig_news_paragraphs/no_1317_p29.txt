La Guardia, J. F. K. Newark Take a long stroll in Manhattan, and you may walk past a building that an American president once called home. During the city’s brief reign as the nation’s capital, George Washington and his family lived at 3 Cherry Street in Lower Manhattan. In Kips Bay, a townhouse at 123 Lexington Avenue was the home of Chester A. Arthur and where he took the oath of office in 1881. A few blocks south, a townhouse at 28 East 20th Street (now a replica) was the childhood home of Theodore Roosevelt, the only president born in New York City.
