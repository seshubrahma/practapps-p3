The polls will no doubt change as a result of the election campaign. Still, Trumpâ€™s lack of coattails in Republican primary contests suggests that incumbent Republicans will be able to run campaigns seperate from the Presidential battle. After all, incumbent Republicans have easily dispatched primary challengers even while the electorate engages in a primal scream all around them. If they are immune to an electorate where around half the voters say they feel "betrayed" by Republicans in Washington, they can probably withstand whatever forces are aligned against them in the general election.
