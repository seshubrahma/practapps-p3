Outside her plane after a speech in Tampa, Fla. a few days earlier, Clinton stopped for a few minutes under a wing to chat and take pictures with the photographers in her press entourage. This produced a classic     scene: Clinton posing for pictures with the photographers who normally photograph her, while the rest of her media contingent stood along the stairs photographing her posing for photos with her photographers. In her conversation with the photographers, Clinton talked about how the phenomenon of "selfies" has transformed her encounters with voters. She was always adept at drawing quick connections with people she met on rope lines.
