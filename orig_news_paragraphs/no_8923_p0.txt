Thursday in Indianapolis, IN at the Carrier factory he recently announced would be keeping 1, 000 jobs in the United States,   Donald Trump vowed a border wall would be built.   In discussing companies moving jobs out of the country, Trump said, "They will be taxed very heavily at the border if they want to leave, fire all their people, leave, make products in different countries and then think theyâ€™ll sell that product over the border. Which by the way, will be a very strong border, very strong border. Believe me.
