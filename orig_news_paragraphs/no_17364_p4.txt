Earlier this year, Aydin Dogan was personally indicted by a Turkish prosecutor for allegedly participating in a   scheme.    In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for the company called the charges absurd and characterized them as a political witch hunt in response to at times unfavorable news coverage by Dogan’s news outlets, which includes CNN Turkey.   Trump’s dealings in Turkey have already pushed him into the middle of the controversy between Dogan and the Turkish government in at least one instance. After Trump proposed a ban on Muslims entering the US in 2015, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, criticized Dogan Holding and called for the company to remove Trump’s name from the Istanbul towers.
