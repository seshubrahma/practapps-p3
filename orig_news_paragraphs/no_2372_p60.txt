Today’s pack is distinct in fundamental ways: There are many more women and minorities in the group (as in, there are more than almost none) there is considerably less drinking, and no one smokes and while reporters 40 years ago paid their dues and scrapped like hell to cover a presidential campaign, many of today’s cast members are in their first journalism jobs. They are competitive but collegial. Their tech savviness is astounding (actually it made me scared).
