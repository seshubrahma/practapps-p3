At that point, the anger that many of the commenters had directed at me began to be directed at President Trump. Some of the comments were completely delusional, such as describing the Sarin gas attack as a "false flag" operation, sometimes going so far as to accuse Trump of ordering the Sarin attack himself in order to have an excuse to bomb Syria. Probably the angriest comments were some variation of the delusional "false flag" claim. At the other end of the spectrum were comments that were very thoughtful.
