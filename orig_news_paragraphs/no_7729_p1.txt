" The more volunteers that come in, the quicker we can get people taken care of," Buresh told USA Today. Buresh is pleading for not only more volunteers, but for Americans to donate to disaster relief efforts for the state, a gesture that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump gave national attention to when he was taped unloading supplies he donated to flood victims in the region. Brad Kieserman, the vice president of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the American Red Cross told USA Today that the flooding crisis is the largest natural disaster since Superstorm Sandy.
