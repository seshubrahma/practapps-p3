Well, what happened is obviously Saturday night, the debate went the way it went and then the media coverage over the last 72 hours was very negative about it and so forth. So the last thing that voters heard before going into the booth or yesterday was, you know, something bad happened on Saturday night. So it made it very difficult for us to get any other message across. Rubio spun his finish as only a difference of a "couple thousand votes" which is why his campaign was so disappointed.
