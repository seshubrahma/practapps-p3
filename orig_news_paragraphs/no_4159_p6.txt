Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!" Eminem raps. In the song’s music video, Eminem cast a Palin    for a raunchy sequence in which the scantily clad woman is splayed out on an office desk wearing a skirt and bustier, and Eminem is seen rapping the aforementioned lyrics and dressed as Palin’s husband, Todd Palin. Eminem also praises Black Lives Matter on the new song.
