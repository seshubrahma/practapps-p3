In addition, Obama’s push to end sexual privacy by forcing normal students to accept transgenders in their bathrooms and locker rooms is opposed by 57 percent of man and 46 percent of women, by 53 percent of black, 36 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of political independents, 56 percent of married people, 55 percent of people earning $30, 000 to $50, 000. In contrast, Obama’s plans for transgender,   bathrooms is opposed by at least 51 percent of the Rasmussen respondents, and likely more, given that many of the people who support Obama’s   policy prefer the debates and decisions to be made at the state and local level. The Rasmussen poll complements other polls which show broad public sympathy for people who think they are members of the opposite sex   —   and growing public opposition to the ideology being pushed by Obama and the   groups.
