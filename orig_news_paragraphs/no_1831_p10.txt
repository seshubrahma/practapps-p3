A majority of New York City primary voters chose Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. The Times published an interactive map that showed how each neighborhood and block in the city voted, from Staten Island landslides for Mr. Trump to one Upper West Side precinct where Mr. Sanders received no votes (and Mrs. Clinton got one). Polls are influential in a presidential campaign, but their results often depend as much on the pollsters as on the science of survey methodology. That’s because the results depend on the poll’s design, which depends on human decisions made behind the scenes.
