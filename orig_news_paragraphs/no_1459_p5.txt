Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump won a combined 25 million votes during the primary season, compared with 16 million for Mrs. Clinton. And while many of Mr. Sandersâ€™s supporters are expected to support her in November, she has not recalibrated her message to try to tap into the anger that he and Mr. Trump channeled. Nor does Mrs. Clinton have any plans, advisers say, to take cues from the Brexit campaign and start   her support for globalized markets, or denouncing porous borders, illegal immigrants and the lack of job protections in   agreements. Much distinguishes the presidential contest from the British fight, of course, including a    matchup between   candidates, a sharply different economic context, and a long and proud history of immigration.
