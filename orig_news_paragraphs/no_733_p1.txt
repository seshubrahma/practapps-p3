President Trump brought the fight. A day after his secretive chief strategist laid out a   new definition of conservatism animated by attacks on "the administrative state," globalism and the "corporatist media," Mr. Trump delivered a visceral gut punch of a speech that executed almost all of the tactics that define the   philosophy of the   West Wing. Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, Mr. Trump launched what was easily the most blistering attack on the media and corporate elites of his already bellicose and eventful presidency. His speech also included a promise to throw undocumented immigrants "the hell out of the country" and a recitation of his    campaign promises.
