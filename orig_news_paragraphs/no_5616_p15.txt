With God’s help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. At the same time, we pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East   —   and maybe, even all over the world. But this future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it.
