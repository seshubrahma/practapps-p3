A stark white background. Unfamiliar faces.   phrases reducing women to their body parts. Priorities USA, the Democratic "super PAC" supporting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, is kicking off its advertising for the general election on Wednesday with a new ad, titled "Speak," that uses Donald J. Trump’s own statements against him to depict him as a misogynist and unworthy of the White House. It is strikingly similar to a commercial broadcast in March by Our Principles PAC, a Republican group that sought unsuccessfully to derail Mr. Trump’s march toward the party’s nomination.
