Yet part of the problem is simply the nature of social media, which is increasingly where Americans obtain their news. Social media should theoretically make it easier for us to communicate with, and understand, one another. In practice, social media makes it easier to talk to people who already agree with us, and ignore or attack those who disagree. (The divisions among Republicans over Trump, for example, are probably far worse than they would have been in the absence of social media.)
