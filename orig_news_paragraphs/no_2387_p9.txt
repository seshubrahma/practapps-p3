Priorities USA has shared the cost of some major campaigns with Emilyâ€™s List, the leading progressive group aimed at electing Democratic women. The super PAC has also given smaller groups access to its digital and video creative studio or shared its own television spots with other organizations to run under their own names. In early October, for example, a super PAC controlled by the Service Employees International Union began a $3 million   campaign targeted at Latino voters in southern Florida and Nevada. The ads, which featured Hispanic families and accused Mr. Trump of bringing "hate, divisiveness and disrespect into our homes," was originally produced by a team at Priorities USA.
