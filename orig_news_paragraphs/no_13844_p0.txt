Washington (CNN) A push by Republican congressional leaders to defund Planned Parenthood could threaten passage of their   legislation to repeal Obamacare because of opposition to the   provision by two key GOP senators.   House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Thursday that Republicans will move to strip all federal funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the process they are using early this year to dismantle Obamacare. Congressional Republicans have tried for years to zero out all federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortion services.
