Broaddrick says Clinton raped her at a hotel when she was a nursing home administrator volunteering for   Attorney General Bill Clinton’s 1978 gubernatorial bid. She told NBC’s Dateline that she resisted when Clinton suddenly kissed her: Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip   …      He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him.
