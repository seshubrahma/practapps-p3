Rosensteinâ€™s decision came after Washington exploded into speculation Tuesday over the New York Times report that a "Comey Memo" showed that President Donald Trump had suggested in a private conversation that    Director James Comey "let it go" with regard to   National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Rosenstein explained in the press release accompanying the appointment that "unique circumstances" led to his determination that the appointment of a special counsel was in the public interest: My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted.   I have made no such determination.   What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.
