Still, freedom of expression is one of the greatest found in principals this nation was built on. We should never take it for granted, and we should really be careful about trying to undermine that freedom. I understand each person ’s situation is unique, but when it comes to something like limiting expression, making laws based on being offended, or needing a ‘safe space,’ I think our ultimate goal should be to each have our safe space be inside of us.
