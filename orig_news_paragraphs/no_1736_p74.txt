A week after Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican presidential race in early May, Will and his wife, Mari, a Republican political consultant, gave a catered dinner party for Cruz and his wife, Heidi. The other guests were conservative donors, activists and journalists, along with their spouses. The Wills have been hosting these    encounters with political celebrities at their Maryland home for decades. In early 2009, Willâ€™s fellow conservative columnists gathered there to meet Obama a week before his inauguration.
