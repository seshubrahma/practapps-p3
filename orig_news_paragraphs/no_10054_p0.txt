Billionaire donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer react to the lewd audio of Donald Trump that was released yesterday. Complete statement below:[If Mr. Trump had told Billy Bush, whoever that is, earlier this year that he was for open borders, open trade, and executive actions in pursuit of gun control, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him. If he had admitted to Mr. Bush that he had profited privately by allowing the sale to Russia of 20% of US uranium deposits or that he had amassed his personal fortune not by hard work in the private sector but by selling favors to foreigners on the American taxpayersâ€™ dime, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him.
