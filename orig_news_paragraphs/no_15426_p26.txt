You might have seen that name in elevators.   He invented a clamping mechanism, when the ropes used to hold up an elevator went slacked, his clamps would grip the elevatorâ€™s guide rails, keeping it from crashing down. The machine was invented in 1853.   It was installed in the Haughwout Building a few years later.
