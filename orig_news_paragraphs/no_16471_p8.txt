Asked by CNN’s Anderson Cooper after the rally about Trump’s apparent policy shift on deportations, Clinton brushed off the remarks, calling them part of a "shuffle" and his "third different position" on the matter. " Somebody has told him, I guess, the latest people he’s consulting, how damaging his statements have been, how terrible his deportation plan is, how offensive his views on immigrants have been from the very first day of his campaign," Clinton said. Echoes of primary opponents, Trump’s apparent suggestion to offer some undocumented immigrants a form of legal status resembles positions offered by other Republicans during the primary fight    stances Trump cited to vanquish his opponents.
