Two additional senior White House officials said the Vatican was very "strict" on the number of people who would be allowed to join the talks. But previous administration officials who helped orchestrate meetings between US presidents and the Pope said that   Catholic staffers who expressed interest in attending the papal sessions were regularly accommodated. During his two equivalent sessions at the Vatican with Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict, President Barack Obama was joined by his press secretaries, Jay Carney and Robert Gibbs, along with   national security and West Wing aides. Trump has demonstrated a vastly different management style in his West Wing, one that favors loyalty and blood ties over title or rank.
