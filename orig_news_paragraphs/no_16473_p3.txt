Trump has previously delivered his message to mostly white audiences in predominantly white suburbs, drawing criticism. On Wednesday night, however, Trump will hold a rally in Jackson, Mississippi, a city that is roughly 80% black, according to Census data.   Trump has also discussed openness to "softening" his tone on immigration, after a   position that put him to the far right of the spectrum helped buoy his candidacy in the primaries.   That change in tone is interpreted as a move to try to improve his standing with Latino voters, a growing demographic.
