My mother sent me a check for my birthday and, on a lark, I bought a Google Home. The     is in my kitchen and I’m hoping that it becomes a new tool that everyone in my family  —   including my wife and two teenagers  —   find useful. So far, I use it as a timer when I cook. I find it much easier to simply say "Hey, Google, set a timer for 30 minutes" than to use the   timer on my oven.
