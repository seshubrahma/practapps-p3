The reason for the change now, he said, was that the administration "exhausted every effort to pursue a   solution through negotiations," alluding to the   push by US Secretary of State John Kerry to reach a   agreement in a   time frame, as well as other efforts since 2009. While Rhodes recognized "the Palestinians have missed plenty of opportunities under this administration, as well," the crux of his argument seemed to be that the Israeli governmentâ€™s   policies were mostly to blame for the U. S. abstention. Israel has offered the Palestinians a state in much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with a shared capital in Jerusalem numerous times. These offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, and more offers were made in 2008.
