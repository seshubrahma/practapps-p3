According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen’s agreement: Stone would option the novel   —   if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client. I first spoke to Stone in June 2015, after reading that he was in the midst of shooting a film based on Kucherena’s novel. He said he would be traveling to Moscow again that week to shoot Snowden and agreed to let me tag along.
