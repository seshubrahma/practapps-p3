OCR’s 2014 harassment guidance generally imposes liability on institutions even if they correctly discipline those who engage in sexual harassment or sexual assault, if they do not also "prevent its recurrence" and "remedy its effects," and it warns that even punishing the harasser "likely will not be sufficient" to comply with Title IX. Bader continues to Breitbart News that, in a February, 2015 letter to Congress, two members of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights noted that OCR:   …    has all too often been willing to define perfectly legal conduct as unlawful. Though OCR may claim to be underfunded, its resources are stretched thin largely because it has so often chosen to address violations it has made up out of thin air. Increasing OCR’s budget would in effect reward the agency for frequently overstepping the law.
