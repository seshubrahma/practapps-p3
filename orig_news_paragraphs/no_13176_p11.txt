Even if Trump runs the tables in the primaries winning a plurality in virtually every state the rule can be tailored by a controlled Rules Committee to prevent a Trump nomination. Rule   used to require a majority in six states but when Congressman Ron Paul met that goal it was quickly changed to eight states. Under control of the insiders the number of states required can be amended to any number to block Trump. Also, the goal of the extended nomination process will be to make it so either no one gets to eight states (or what ever number the establishment changes it to)
