At any moment, there are roughly 900 U. S. nuclear warheads    all of which are far more powerful than the weapons that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945    that can be launched within minutes of an order by the president. (The United States is estimated to possess a total arsenal of approximately 7, 100 nuclear warheads.)   The president has the sole authority to launch nuclear weapons, and in some scenarios would only have minutes to confirm an incoming nuclear attack and give the order to strike. To date, every president has retained the option to use nuclear weapons first    even if the United States or an ally has not suffered a nuclear attack.
