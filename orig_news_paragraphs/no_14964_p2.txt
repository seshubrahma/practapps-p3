Yates was scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee about   Security Adviser Flynn’s communications with the Russians, but the hearing was mysteriously nixed. GOP committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes    who has been the White House ’s best friend lately    canceled her appearance without much of an explanation. She was to be part of a   triumvirate    including former CIA Director John Brennan and   of National Intelligence James Clapper    bringing news about potential Russian connections to the Trump transition.
