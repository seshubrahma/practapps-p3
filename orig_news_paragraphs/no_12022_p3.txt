" The disclosure that Clinton Chair John Podesta transferred his shares in   Joule Unlimited to an anonymous holding company when he joined the Obama Administration is extremely concerning," said Donald Trump Senior Communications Advisor Jason Miller in a statement. Podesta failed to fully disclose his position on Joule Unlimited’s board of directors and include it in his federal financial disclosures, as required by law, before he became President Obama’s senior adviser.
