Either way, I thought the party’s establishment could count on these voters, and instead they were among Mr. Trump’s strongest backers in the end. There’s an important lesson here: These aren’t liberal or moderate Rockefeller Republicans. These are voters who showed a surprising tolerance for Mr. Trump’s extreme comments on immigration, women and other issues. I didn’t consider myself that much of a "party decides" disciple at the beginning of the race, but I was sure of one thing: It would be extraordinarily hard to win if a candidate were deemed unacceptable by the party’s elected officials, donors and operatives.
