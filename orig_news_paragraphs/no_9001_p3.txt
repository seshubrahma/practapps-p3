According to the newspaper:  Hillary Clinton is hanging onto a narrow   lead over Donald Trump in Michigan heading into the last weekend before Tuesday’s election, with a new Free Press poll showing clear momentum for the Republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the Democrat. The poll, done exclusively for the Free Press by   of Lansing, shows Clinton’s support steady at 42%   —   up a point from where it was late last month. But it also clearly shows Republicans and some independents rallying around Trump in the waning days of the campaign season, with his support up four points from two weeks ago to 38%.
