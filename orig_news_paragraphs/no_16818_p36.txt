So why the large discrepancy? Pence was likely referring only to the charitable grants the Clinton Foundation has awarded to outside groups, as opposed to the charitable work conducted by the Clinton Foundation’s own programs.   According to Clinton Foundation tax forms    in 2013, for example    the foundation reported total revenue of almost $149 million, and awarded external grants worth a total of nearly $9 million    or about 6 cents on the dollar. But most Clinton Foundation work is implemented by the foundation’s own program staff, and is also considered charitable work.
