Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said that Mr. Trump, whom he has advised, had an opening to present himself as a stern leader and an agent of change for minorities. Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Gingrich said, was vulnerable to being tagged as part of what he called a "wing of American intellectual culture" defined by the concept that the "police are dangerous, and if only we didnâ€™t have any guns, nobody would get hurt. " But Mr. Gingrich also encouraged Mr. Trump to acknowledge directly that blacks faced "a steeper hill to climb. "
