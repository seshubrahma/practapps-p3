In a highly symbolic move Monday, after Nunes canceled a planned committee meeting, House Intelligence Republicans and Democrats still met in the same, classified briefing space in the Capitol where they typically meet but they gathered separately, plotting their own game plans.   Democrats believe Nunes is too close to the White House to lead a thorough investigation into Russia    including ties between the Trump camp and Russian officials    an assertion firmly rejected by the GOP. " I don’t think he can just recuse himself and still chair the committee," Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the panel, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo Tuesday on "New Day."
