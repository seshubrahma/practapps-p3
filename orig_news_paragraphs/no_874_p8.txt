Some technical experts pointed out that while the documents suggest that the C. I. A. might be able to compromise individual smartphones, there was no evidence that the agency could break the encryption that many phone and messaging apps use. If the C. I. A. or the National Security Agency could routinely break the encryption used on such apps as Signal, Confide, Telegram and WhatsApp, then the government might be able to intercept such communications on a large scale and search for names or keywords of interest. But nothing in the leaked C. I. A. documents suggests that is possible. Instead, the documents indicate that because of encryption, the agency must target an individual phone and then can intercept only the calls and messages that pass through that phone.
