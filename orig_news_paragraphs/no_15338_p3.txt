The FBI used some materials from the dossier in its successful request for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to conduct surveillance on Trump associate Carter Page. Steele was hired through an American firm that was paid by Republicans during the primaries, then Democrats seeking to stop Trumpâ€™s candidacy. He wrote 16 memos during the presidential campaign and says he stopped working his sources after the election. But he "continued to receive unsolicited intelligence" and felt compelled to write another memo on December 13, the court filing says.
