He said that he and many political operatives didnâ€™t take Trump seriously, because he had already previewed a run for president multiple times before choosing against it. But that began to change when Trump appeared at the   Iowa State Fair and began attacking Jeb Bush for being a "puppet" controlled by lobbyists. Miller recalled: I remember sitting in front of my computer watching a livestream of him land his helicopter and do a press conference for a thousand media members at the Iowa State Fair where he was just unleashing into Jeb in the kind of personal terms that no other candidate would feel comfortable doing, and you know at that point we kind of realized we had kind of a monster on our hands and we had to deal with him differently. Miller admitted that Bush was perhaps the imperfect messenger to attack Trump, pointing out that he was always going to be seen as a spokesman for the Republican establishment.
