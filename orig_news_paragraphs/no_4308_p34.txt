So tonight, we ask an important question. Why has there been hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours of media coverage about the   conspiracy if there’s zero evidence?

Now, I ask my questions based on the comments of the only one person on this earth who actually knows for sure the source of the DNC   to Wikileaks.
