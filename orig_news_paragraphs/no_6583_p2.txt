Saturday on Fox News Channel â€™s "Bulls  Bears," conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, who was also a White House aide during the Nixon administration, was skeptical of the possibility of President Donald Trump having a recording device.   Many have argued he alleged having such a device in a tweet about his interactions with   FBI Director James Comey. James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
