NBC said it was scheduled for competitive reasons, because Jones had been booked to appear on ABC’s daytime show "The View" next week. A representative of "The View" said Jones had canceled his appearance there and he will not be rescheduled. Lack noted that he had suggested approaching Jones for an interview to David Corvo, the NBC News executive who supervises the network’s newsmagazines. He said there’s nothing new about putting people on the air even if they’re unpopular or have views that are deplorable to many.
