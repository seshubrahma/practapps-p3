The first reaction I had was one of passionate disappointment. You see, every few years an article like this is written, and it doesnâ€™t change the prevailing narrative namely, that conservatives in Hollywood are fearful of being blacklisted and unable to find work due to their political beliefs. But something more important is revealed this time, and that is this: Conservatives in Hollywood simply lack balls. I want to say I have deep respect and affection for all, but conservatives must no longer walk around like the character Ted Levine played in Silence of the Lambs, with his manhood hidden between his legs (of course, I am not referring to female conservatives, so no sexism here).
