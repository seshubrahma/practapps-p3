One of us left the Republican Party in 2015, not in protest over Donald Trump’s lack of a credible track record on issues conservatives care about, but over the Republican establishment’s betrayal of the party’s principles, platform and unwillingness to oppose Obama’s unconstitutional power grabs. The other was a pledged Ted Cruz delegate to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, who supported the floor walkout over RNC hijinks on convention procedures and rules, and has since expressed serious doubts over Donald Trump’s temperament, history and policy  . We still have many of those doubts about both Trump’s fitness and the Republican Party’s commitment to carry out Trump’s promises, especially on border control, Islamic terrorism, and Supreme Court appointments.
