In the World’s Ugliest Dog Contest, where there were more beasts than beauties, it was hard to beat a wrinkled,   bony Chinese crested Chihuahua named Sweepee Rambo. The dog  —   17 years old, blind in both eyes and, at four pounds, not much bigger than two hands put together   —   was a crowd favorite at the contest, which was held on Friday night at the   Fair in Petaluma, Calif. The audience went wild for the   dog, with some people carrying signs that read, "Sweepee for President," said the fair’s marketing director, Karen Spencer.
