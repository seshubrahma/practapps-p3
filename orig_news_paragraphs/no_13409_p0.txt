A Reddit thread reporting on the recent firebomb bus attack in France was shut down after users made "too many violations" of the subredditâ€™s "hate speech" rule. ["This thread has been locked due to too many Rule 8 violations," stated a moderator on the popular    subreddit shortly after it went viral. The thread, which had received nearly 5, 000 upvotes, was shut down just two hours after being published.   The majority of the comments in general criticized Islam and the negative effects of the recent influx of   refugees into Europe.
