[Rep. Earl Blumenauer ( ) Rep. Ted Lieu ( ) and Sen. Al Franken ( ) are among several of these Democrats, according to The Hill. Franken reportedly said "a few" Republican colleagues have expressed concerns to him about Trump’s mental health, and Lieu plans to introduce legislation that would require the presence of a psychiatrist or psychologist in the White House.   Breitbart News previously reported that Rep. Karen Bass ( ) had launched an online petition to force the Republican Party to submit   nominee Trump to a psychiatric evaluation. Last week, Rep. Blumenauer used baseless allegations about Trump’s mental health as a springboard to invoke the 25th Amendment in a floor speech.
