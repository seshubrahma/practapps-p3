Mr. Romney is the preferred choice of Vice   Mike Pence and some business leaders from whom Mr. Trump has heard. But contention over him being chosen has led Mr. Trumpâ€™s aides to open the process to other names, such as Mr. Corker. Typical of the pushback, L. Brent Bozell, a conservative media critic, said in a statement: The   camp is doing its own pushback. A person briefed on the process, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive conversations, said that Mr. Romney had not sought consideration for the secretary of state, and was initially contacted by Mr. Pence.
