To start, a number of states made it more difficult to vote or vote early. In North Carolina, where the state legislature openly sought ways to drive down minority turnout, raw totals crept up a bit from 2012 but basically flatlined as a percentage of the voting population.    In October, a Trump campaign official told Bloomberg that operatives had made "voter suppression" a focus of their   efforts, using online ads to target Clintonâ€™s base. The goal was not win them over but to keep them home on Election Day.
