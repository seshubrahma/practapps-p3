In 2008, the Eighth Circuit heard Planned Parenthood v. Rounds, a challenge to a South Dakota law that required abortion providers to tell their patients that abortions terminate "an existing relationship" with an "unborn human being" and that abortions lead to an increased risk of suicide. They donâ€™t. Nevertheless, Colloton joined an opinion which reinstated the law after a panel of his court ordered it halted. Think Progress points out that the Eighth Circuit is the only federal appeals court to strike down the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.
