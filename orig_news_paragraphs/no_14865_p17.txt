Apart from the domestic political storms that are battering the White House, the news conference and Merkel’s visit to the White House are coming at a crucial moment for   relations. The German chancellor is trying to forge a relationship with Trump despite suspicion over his political views. She congratulated the President after his election win in a statement that also contained a defense of Western values amid concern in Germany that his stances on issues like immigration run counter to the principles that have sustained the Western alliance. Germany, the most powerful political force in the European Union, has also been deeply concerned by Trump’s criticisms of NATO and deep skepticism inside the White House about the EU itself.
