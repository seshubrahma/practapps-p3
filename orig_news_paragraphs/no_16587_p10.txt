" Meeting with security officials, Clinton’s campaign, in an effort to paint Trump as a national security risk, has kept close tabs on former defense officials who have endorsed the former secretary of state    particularly those who worked in Republican administrations.   At Friday’s meeting, which the campaign dubbed a "working session," Michael Chertoff    who served as President George W. Bush’s final secretary of homeland security, sat at Clinton’s side.   Richard Fontaine, former foreign policy advisor to Republican Sen. John McCain, and Michael Morell, who worked for both Obama and Bush, were also at the meeting.
