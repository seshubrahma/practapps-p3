About a quarter don’t have an opinion. When asked to assess the responses of the presumptive nominees for President, Americans are divided on Hillary Clinton’s response to the attack, while ratings of Trump are more negative. 51 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is responding to the Orlando attack, while just 25 percent approve. Most Democrats (62 percent) approve of Clinton’s response, while just half of Republicans (50 percent) approve of Trump’s.
