On the advice of his brother, who also is a DACA recipient, Ramirez declined to answer more questions. ICE agents took Ramirez to a Seattle processing center where he told them that he had a work permit. Ramirez was told by one of the ICE agents, "It doesn’t matter, because you weren’t born in this country," according to the lawsuit.   Ramirez remains in ICE’s custody in Tacoma, according to court documents filed by his lawyers.
