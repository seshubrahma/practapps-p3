Friday’s letter to acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan asks for a briefing on how Customs and Border Protection is implementing the President’s immigration executive orders, which have ordered a beefing up of border security measures, including a wall and hiring surge, as well as expanded the discretion and deportation power of immigration officials.   " We have received troubling reports from all over the country that the implementation of these two executive orders has resulted in significant changes in how U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents operate at the U. S.  border, in border communities, and at ports of entry, specifically airports," the lawmakers wrote.   The CHC members also said they found recent guidance on implementation for the orders from Kelly "to be dangerous and troubling.
