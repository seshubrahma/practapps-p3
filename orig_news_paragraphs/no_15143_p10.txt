As CIA director speaking at CSIS on Thursday, he was considerably less outspoken about his issues with the Iran deal, but did say Iranians were "on the march" and cited missile launches, their support of the Houthis in Yemen and military involvement in Iraq in the past two years. " The list of Iranian transgressions has increased dramatically since the date that the JCPOA was signed," Pompeo said. Pompeo said he viewed working with both European and Middle Eastern allies as integral to countering Iran, but also said the USâ€™ recent cruise missile strike on Syria likely sent a message of US strength to Iran.
