In a tweet announcing her decision, DeGeneres didn’t explain her reasoning. I suspect, though, she understood she was under no obligation to "tolerate" someone who questions her core worth, even if that person does so because of a religious belief.   Unlike Burrell’s, Civitello’s story was compelling because he sincerely asked for a way to change, which is why McGhee’s response was pitch perfect. Burrell believes it’s DeGeneres who needs to change, which is why DeGeneres’ was pitch perfect as well.
