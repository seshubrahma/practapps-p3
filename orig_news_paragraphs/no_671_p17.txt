Determined to avoid the delays and ballooning costs that were common as plants were built in the 1970s and â€™80s, federal regulators had devised a new licensing process. Under the old system, companies received construction permits based on incomplete plans and then applied for an operating license, often leading to rebuilding and lengthy delays. The idea for the new system was that companies would submit much more complete design plans for approval, and then receive their operating licenses as construction started. That way, as long as they built exactly what they said they would, the process could move more quickly.
