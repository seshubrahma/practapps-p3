After meeting with leaders of HBCUs in February, DeVos ignited   controversy  that called HBCUs "real pioneers when it   comes to school choice. " ’ ’    She implied that HBCUs and school vouchers, of which DeVos is a   fierce supporter, similarly afforded students better options. ’ ’   HBCUs "are living proof that when more options are provided to   students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality,"   she said.
