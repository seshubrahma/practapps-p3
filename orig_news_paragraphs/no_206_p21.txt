Bishop Jackson hosted Mr. Trump at his Detroit church and interviewed him on his network last September, a decision which drew criticism from other   spiritual leaders because of the  ’s comments about minorities. In the interview, the bishop asked Mr. Trump how he planned to heal the country’s racial divide if he won the presidency. Mr. Trump attributed that polarization to a lack of "spirit" and   poverty and promised to create jobs. Bishop Jackson defended his visit with Mr. Trump to The Detroit Free Press in August.
