On Friday, authorities arrested a man from Manchesterâ€™s Rusholme neighborhood. Then, two more men were arrested early Saturday, police said in a statement. The men were taken into custody after officers carried out a controlled explosion to enter a home in the Cheetham Hill area of central Manchester. Those actions brought the total number of people arrested in the investigation to 13, with 11 still in custody.
