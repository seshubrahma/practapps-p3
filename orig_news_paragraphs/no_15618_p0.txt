 (CNN) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos sharply criticized opponents of school choice on Monday, calling them "flat Earthers" who have "chilled creativity" and held American students back.   DeVos provided no details of the administration â€™s plans to promote school choice, an expansive term that includes expanding access to and promoting   education options, like charter schools or voucher systems.
