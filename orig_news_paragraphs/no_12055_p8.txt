After his party was wiped out in the 1994 midterm elections, President Bill Clinton insisted that even he felt he raised taxes too much. In 1995 Clinton made what the media called "an offhand confession" "Probably there are people in this room still mad at me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too much, too," Bill Clinton said at a fund raiser in Houston. But this was far less an "offhand confession" than it was the first step in a   campaign built on a Reaganesque economic policy that set the economy booming again after it had begun to slow due to his bad tax policies during his first term.
