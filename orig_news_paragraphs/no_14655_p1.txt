" Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last weekâ€™s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms," the President said. The President was referring to the toppling of dozens of Jewish headstones in cemeteries in two cities and the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas February 22 by an assailant who reportedly shouted, "Get out of my country!"
