Now the media has dutifully weaponized the speech to attack him. In an interview with Maureen Down of the New York Times, and again with former Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, Trump was asked to respond to the speech, which Khan’s father gave while his mother stood silently. He told Dowd, "I’d like to hear his wife say something," referring to the subordinate status of women in Islam. Trump said the same to Stephanopoulos, adding that Khan’s father, Khizr Khan, "looked like a nice guy to me," and defending his own "sacrifices"* for America.
