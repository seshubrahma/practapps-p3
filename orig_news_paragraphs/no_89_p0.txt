WASHINGTON   —    Senator Jeff Sessions,   Donald J. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, pledged on Tuesday to "say no" to Mr. Trump if he tries to go beyond the law, and he spoke out against torture, a ban on Muslim immigration and other ideas that had been floated by Mr. Trump. Mr. Sessions, a deeply conservative Republican from Alabama who was an early Trump supporter, appears headed for confirmation after completing more than nine hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
