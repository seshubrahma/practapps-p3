The otherwise barred claim must then be asserted within three years of the victim becoming conscious of the abuse and injury.   Cosbyâ€™s California attorney, Martin Singer    sometimes described as a "pit bull" defender of Hollywood celebrities    argued that the Huth case should be dismissed and that the claim of repressed memory, which was revived within the last three years and neatly slips into the statute of limitations loophole, is absurd.   The Cosby defense team has claimed that Huth had in fact threatened to leak the story of her alleged 1974   Playboy Mansion encounter with Cosby to the media in an attempt to obtain a payoff from Cosby approximately 10 years ago, demonstrating that the claim of a recently revived memory is a fraud.
