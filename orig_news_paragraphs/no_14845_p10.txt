House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes admitted that he doesn’t believe Obama ordered a physical wiretap or other surveillance activities of Trump Tower, but added, "we want to make sure that no surveillance activities were used for political purposes. " Nunes had said Wednesday that it was possible that Trump aides were surveilled via "incidental" collection.   But when asked Thursday if lawmakers have evidence to suggest that anyone in the Trump orbit’s communications had been collected incidentally, Nunes pointed only to the leak of fired national security adviser Michael Flynn’s communications with a Russian ambassador.
