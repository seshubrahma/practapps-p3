Well, Jake, first off, we donâ€™t believe at this time that there is evidence connecting it to the attacks in New York or Minnesota.   The FBI is leading the investigation, along with the New Jersey State Police and our Office of Homeland Security. We have some promising leads, but no suspects at this time.
