In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, two people were arrested    one for disorderly conduct and a second for striking a state police horse, said Troy Thompson of Capitol Police. " The protesters were a bit rowdy," Thompson said.   No violence was reported in New York City, where about 500 people gathered in Foley Square, the New York chapter of the Council on   Relations said.
