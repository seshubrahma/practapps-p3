By all means, let’s have a great national discussion about how all taxes, regulations, and barriers to market entry are forms of compulsion, and discuss just how much compulsion from their central government a "free" people should put up with, especially when precious few of the Beltway elites knows the first thing about how to run a business. While we’re at it, let’s be honest and admit supposedly "benevolent" regulations are exercises of destructive compulsive force.   For example, as Murray Rothbard pointed out in 1988, the minimum wage is "compulsory unemployment," because it effectively "outlaws" jobs that employers would otherwise be willing to offer, and employees might voluntarily accept. Let’s be honest enough to admit that all those    subsidies liberals love to promise are exercises of compulsive force, too  …     and not just against the people who are forced to pay for them at gunpoint.
