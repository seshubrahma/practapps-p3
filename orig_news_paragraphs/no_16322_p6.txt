His public Ryan endorsement was seen as evidence of a split between Trump and Pence    but several sources with knowledge of the relationship between the two men who share the Republican ticket said this is how theyâ€™ve operated all along, with Trump giving Pence wide latitude to say what he wants to say on Ryan, the parents of the slain Muslim American soldier that Trump engaged in a war of words with or any other thorny issue that Trump dives in on.   The sources said there are open lines of communication between the two teams. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort got a heads up, for example, when Pence wanted to release a statement on Khizr Khan, father of the slain soldier    and had no problem with Pence taking the stance that the Indiana governor wanted.   Trump and Pence, the sources said, had discussions early on in their relationship about how they would disagree on certain issues    and that such disagreements would be fine.
