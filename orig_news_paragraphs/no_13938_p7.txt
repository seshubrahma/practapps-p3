And who do we want fathers and husbands to be? Is the only "real man" an alpha male, one who denies his own vulnerability    sometimes denying it so forcefully that he mocks or denigrates (or maybe just sneers at) those he sees as less than perfect, as too vulnerable, as insufficiently tough and guarded? Might it be that in this day and age a major part of what it ought to mean to be a man is an ability to admit that we are vulnerable, to be as tender as we are tough, to live with our hearts open and to refuse to be ashamed about it?   I am grateful to live at a time when a man    the most powerful man in the world, no less    can model what it means to let life affect him to the point where tears come.
