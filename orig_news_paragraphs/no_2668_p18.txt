This is particularly true in the case of Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, who is in what many believe to be the tightest   race in the country. Ms. Ayotte, who has awkwardly bounced between distance from and acceptance of Mr. Trump, found herself in scalding hot water last week by suggesting during a debate with her opponent that Mr. Trump was a role model. " It is beyond comprehension how Senator Ayotte could continue to support this man for the highest office in the land, let alone call him a role model," said Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is challenging Ms. Ayotte for her seat.
