  graffiti reading "Fucc Trump" was spotted on Friday on Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles. It was only one of dozens of incidents of vandalism sweeping the nation in the wake of   Donald Trump’s victory last Tuesday. [The particular vandal responsible for the graffiti above, however, seems to have had no idea how to spell one of the most common expletives in the English language. (Perhaps he, or she, ran out of K’s scrawling "KKK" on other walls, elsewhere.)    protests continued on Saturday evening in Los Angeles and other cities.
