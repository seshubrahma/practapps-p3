The Obama administration, which has resisted greater involvement in what it sees as an intractable conflict, welcomed the news. " Any effort that stops the violence, saves lives and creates the conditions for renewed and productive political negotiations would be welcome," said the State Department’s deputy spokesman, Mark C. Toner. If the agreement holds, it may solidify Mr. Assad’s grip on the country’s western ridge and lead to a joint effort by Russia and the United States against Islamic State militants.
