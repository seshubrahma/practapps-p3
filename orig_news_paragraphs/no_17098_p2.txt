S. Attorney Christie convicted Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, on a variety of charges including tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign contributions.   The elder Kushner got the maximum sentence of two years in prison, in part because Christie wrote a tough memo calling Kushner’s actions "fiendish. " Jared Kushner regularly visited his father during the year he served behind bars    and years later, reportedly helped kill Christie’s chances of becoming Trump’s   running mate.
