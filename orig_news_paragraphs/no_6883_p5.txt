The fact that Luntz would compare Ryan’s predicament inside the Republican Party to disgraced former Speaker John Boehner —  who resigned amid a revolt from members in his own party back in 2015 —  is remarkable.

When Boehner refused to enact the agenda of the American electorate, a group of more than 30 Republican members banded together and threatened to depose him from the Speakership.
