Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed on Thursday night that President Vladimir Putin was not given advance notice of the United States’ decision to strike a Syrian target with missiles. ["No contacts were made with Moscow, with President Putin," Tillerson told reporters during a briefing with National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster at Trump’s    estate in Florida.   He blamed the Russians for failing to prevent the use of chemical weapons in Syria, calling them "complicit or incompetent," which is why the United States took action. According to the Pentagon, Russian ground forces in the area were given a "deconfliction" notice prior to the attack.
