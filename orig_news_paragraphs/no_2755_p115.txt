Ms. Greenidge’s daringly abrasive debut novel begins with an absurd premise: What if the members of a black family agreed to move to a very white part of the Berkshires and, for scientific purposes, raise a chimp named Charlie as one of their children? That family, the Freemans, lands at a large gated pile called the Toneybee Institute and is much too warmly welcomed. This happens in 1990, but the book also has a section (and a brave heroine) at Toneybee in 1929   —   and it’s here that Ms. Greenidge’s ferocity breaks through.
