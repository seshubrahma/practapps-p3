Now a new study, considered to be the most rigorous to look at the question in the United States, undermines that claim. Researchers followed nearly 1, 000 women who sought abortions nationwide for five years and found that those who had the procedure did not experience more depression, anxiety, low   or dissatisfaction with life than those who were denied it. The findings come as the abortion debate intensifies in the United States, with   Donald J. Trump promising to nominate an abortion opponent to the Supreme Court after taking office next month. The question of the effect of the procedure on womenâ€™s health, both physical and mental, has been an effective argument in recent years, used by states to enact a number of regulations and restrictions, and is likely to be a continuing part of the debate.
