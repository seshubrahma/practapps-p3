On Friday, Mr. Spicer was among the group of Mr. Trump’s senior aides temporarily banished from Air Force One after Mr. Trump erupted at his staff in frustration during an Oval Office meeting. Mr. Trump’s West Wing is awash in palace intrigue, and people in and around the administration noted that two other representatives  —    Mr. Spicer’s deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and the White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway  —   appeared on morning television shows on Monday to speak on the president’s behalf. The president has also privately expressed frustration with the performance of his press office.
