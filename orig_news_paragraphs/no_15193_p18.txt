Molins said Cheurfi was investigated by counterterror officials in late Febrary because of alleged threats he made to kill police officers. He was briefly placed under house arrest and investigators discovered knives and masks in his home but no evidence linking him to terror groups, Molins said.    Despite his long criminal record, Cheurfi was never placed under what is known as a "Fiche S" surveillance file, Molins told reporters.
