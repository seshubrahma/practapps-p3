Despite mounting calls from members of his own party that he step down, the governor won a significant battle Friday afternoon when a local judge granted a   temporary restraining order Mr. Bentley had sought. The order effectively blocks impeachment hearings that were set to begin Monday in the Legislature, which is dominated by Mr. Bentleyâ€™s own party. In many other ways, it was a very bad week for the governor. On Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause that he had violated ethics and campaign laws, and referred the case to a local district attorney for possible criminal prosecution.
