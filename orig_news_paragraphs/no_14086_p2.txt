Three   deaths also were reported in California and one person died in Pennsylvania, increasing the total nationwide to 23.   Chris Cohilas, the chairman of the Dougherty County Commission in southwestern Georgia, said storms slammed his county early this month and these latest twisters compounded the agony.   He implored the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get "boots on the ground" to help the community since the storms on January 2 and warnings of more to come. So far, he said, FEMA has not been responsive and he aired his frustrations with the agency.
