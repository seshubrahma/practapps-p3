Let me explain what our culture is based on. I think   the greatest tragedy of mankind is that people have ideas and   opinions in their heads but don’t have a process for properly   examining these ideas to find out what’s true. That creates a   world of distortions. That’s relevant to what we do, and I think   it’s relevant to all decision making.
