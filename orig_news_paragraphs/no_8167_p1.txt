Although Hillary Clinton brought out the first family for numerous campaign appearances, the country voted for   Donald Trump. The presidency wasn’t the only place that saw a partisan change since Obama took office in 2009. Democratic U. S. Senate seats dropped from 55 to 46, their share of House seats fell from 256 seats to 194, and Democratic governorships fell from 28 to 16, according to figures from Ballotpedia. Over the Obama years, Democrats lost 958 state legislative seats in the Tea Party wave of 2010 and the new movement that’s coalescing around Trump that has yet to be defined.
