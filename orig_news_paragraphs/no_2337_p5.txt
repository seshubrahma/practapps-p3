The leaders of both chambers, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, have said they expect the override vote to be successful, which requires a   majority. Mr. McConnell’s office said it would consider the veto message "as soon as practicable in this work period," essentially ruling out the possibility, pressed by opponents of the measure, that the vote could be delayed until after the elections, when lawmakers might feel less political pressure to support the bill. Still, pressure is building on Congress to reconsider the measure, whose passage underlined the lasting political clout of the   families that have long demanded it   —   and the diminishing standing of Saudi Arabia and its supporters in Washington.
