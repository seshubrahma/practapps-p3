Rep. Trent Franks ( ) is reading AG Lynch the relevant statutes re: Clintonâ€™s email scandal. When asked to walk the Reps. through her   process with respect to the statute, she says it is not appropriate for her to go into that level of analysis and accepted the recommendations of the team. Again, she punts and deflects. Franks is not going to try and go through the dog and pony show.
