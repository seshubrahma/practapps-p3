From 2001 to 2015, there were 2, 545   incidents targeting 3, 052 Muslims, according to the FBI.   Last year,   hate times surged 67% reaching a level of violence not seen since the aftermath of the   attacks, and many Muslims believe hate crimes are underreported by victims and not pursued vigorously by police and prosecutors. This year, the FBI has begun counting   incidents as well.   Politicians have claimed that 85% of mosques are controlled by Islamic extremists and that Islam is a political system, not a religion, and thus not protected by the First Amendment.
