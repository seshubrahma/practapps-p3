Thursday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh reacted to commentary that aired on CNN following former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.   In that segment, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin declared that based on this testimony, we now "know" President Donald Trump is under criminal investigation. Limbaugh questioned that statement and went on to question the mental of those at CNN. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com)
