I donâ€™t believe in litmus tests for judges," he said. Asked about Roe v. Wade, Judge Gorsuch said, "I would tell you that Roe vs. Wade, decided in 1973, is the precedent of the United States Supreme Court," saying that "all of the other factors that go into analyzing precedent have to be considered. " Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the committee, also pressed Judge Gorsuch for his views on precedent generally, naming a few cases, including a Second Amendment case and the matter of Bush v. Gore.
