We have a president whoâ€™s incompetent," Trump said. Trump made similar comments on Wednesday. He tweeted Friday morning that he was referring to a plane he was on TV that was carrying the hostages in Geneva, not the $400 million in cash. The Washington Post reported that the tape Trump had seen was included in a Fox News report about the $400 million transfer on Wednesday, but that the executive jet displayed appeared to be in Geneva that day, not Iran, and did not show the transfer of cash.
