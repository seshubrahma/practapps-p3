She said she could understand talk of lingering collective guilt over the "legacy of slavery" to black Americans but found it absurd to hold America responsible for grim conditions across the Third World, especially when the United States has been so generous with foreign aid and disaster relief. She also strongly rejected the notion that Americans are so guilty and culturally inferior that they lack the standing to criticize the Leftâ€™s preferred victim groups. " We have to treat every Third Worlder living off the American taxpayer as if this is an American black we owe for the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow," she said.
