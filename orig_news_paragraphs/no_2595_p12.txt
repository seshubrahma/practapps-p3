The Republican Governors Association, which has already spent money on television commercials for Mr. Pence, has been drawing up contingency plans in the event he withdraws from the race, according to people familiar with the committee’s preparations. Officials with the group have been in touch with several candidates who could replace Mr. Pence on the ballot, including Eric Holcomb, the lieutenant governor, and Brian C. Bosma, the speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives. Mr. Trump’s advisers see Mr. Pence as a decidedly safe choice   —   a disciplined public communicator with ties to Washington.
