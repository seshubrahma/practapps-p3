Trump is supposedly holding a rally in Indiana next week, and those with knowledge of the situation tell Breitbart News that the advance staff is holding nothing back —  and that Trump’s entire family is expected to be there —  for this   rally. A key focus of Trump’s campaign both in the primary and in the general election has been trade policy, and given that Pence’s home state —  which delivered Trump the final knockout blow against Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich that he needed to wrap up the nomination —  is ground zero on that front gives Pence a boost. Pence’s Indiana is for now home to Carrier Corporation, which Trump mentions almost every rally since its executives in an extraordinarily offensive way warned factory workers that the company was shutting down U. S. operations in 2017 to reopen in Mexico. Pence had voted for Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) during the primary, but did not come out against Trump, and would therefore be seen as an extra boost to party unity after a    primary.
