Thus, career lawyers played an important voice in recommending against the prosecution of former Bush administration officials for their role in the torture of terrorism suspects early in President Barack Obama’s tenure, and similar opposition might also arise from efforts by the new attorney general to pursue a prosecution. There is also important historical precedent for even political appointees in the Justice Department to stand up to the President    most notably the "Saturday Night Massacre," when the attorney general and his deputy both resigned rather than comply with President Richard Nixon ’s order that they fire the special prosecutor investigating Watergate. On the trail, Trump has also called for appointment a special prosecutor    which might allow him to sidestep the career lawyers in the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.
