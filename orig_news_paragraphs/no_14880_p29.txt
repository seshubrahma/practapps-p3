Muslim Iranians tend to look to Zoroastrianism with pride.   But when my father sought to gild my identity with a Zoroastrian name, it wasn’t out of simple pride it took me years to realize that maybe he thought it was protection from all sorts of futures. When he’d hush my late grandmother as she recited Quran verses in public, maybe it wasn’t out of shame for his actual cultural origins     maybe he just didn’t trust Americans to hear it.
