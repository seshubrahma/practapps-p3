The national security adviser’s comments Thursday, which were first reported by The New York Times, and a separate email to all staff on Wednesday have buoyed the low morale at the agency, which has been largely sidelined in recent weeks because of the questions surrounding Flynn’s conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kilsyak.   The retired lieutenant general resigned last week after it became public that he did not tell Vice President Mike Pence that conversations he had with the Russian ambassador included discussion about US sanctions. Career staff have described the NSC as a dead zone, with little activity while Flynn was in the throes of the controversy.   Flynn’s deputy, K. T. McFarland, was present Thursday when McMaster spoke to NSC staff, the source said.
