Forty years ago, I felt a similar pride as I sat at home in Louisiana and watched as the late Rep. Barbara Jordan delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention   —   the first woman, and the first   to do so.   I have felt such moments of pride at many points in recent history for the achievements of Shirley Chisholm, Patsy Mink,  Sandra Day O’Connor, Condi Rice, Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Mikulski, Sonya Sotomayor, Loretta Lynch, and so many others.   years after Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman to land on a major party ticket, we have reached a major milestone. It’s been a journey.
