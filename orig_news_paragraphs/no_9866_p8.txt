â€”   Erika Cervantes ( @Erika3Cervantes) September 29, 2016, A longer version of the full video shot by the victim himself shows that prior to being chased and beaten, he was harassed and called a "white supremacist" by Black Lives Matter protesters specifically because of his hat. Police arrived to protect Jabro, and he explained to them that he had a First Amendment right to be at the community vigil wearing his hat without fear of violence.
