Dear Ms. Mallon: You recently published an article naming my client Milo Yiannopolous a white supremacist. We are demanding an immediate correction to this statement as he has NO association with white   and has always condemned these groups. You all offer no proof of any such affiliations, thus you might want to consult with the AP Style Book on that. We demand an immediate correction to the language used in your article based on a false narrative, or we will pursue legal options against you, Glamour Magazine, and Conde Nast to remedy the problem.
