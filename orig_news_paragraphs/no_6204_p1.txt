[In written testimony on Venezuelan drug connections prepared for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Thursday, Dr. Shannon O’Neil Nelson from CFR noted:  In terms of security, Venezuela’s willingness to permit drug traffickers, organized crime networks, potential terrorists, and other nefarious actors within its borders affects U. S. national security as well. Reports show that Colombia’s Bandas Criminales (BACRIM) Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and National Liberation Army (ELN) all operate in the country, as do Mexico’s Sinaloa and Zeta cartels.
