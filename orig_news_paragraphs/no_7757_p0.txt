Sen. Rand Paul ( ) told Breitbart News exclusively on Tuesday that most American companies would not take the risk of hiring former President Bill Clinton in the wake of sexual assault and rape allegations from a litany of women including Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey, and more. ["I think most company policies in most American corporations wouldn’t even hire someone like Bill Clinton because of his threat to the young people in the workplace," Paul told Breitbart News in the exclusive phone interview. " As CEO in any company in America, his behavior with an intern would be so unacceptable that he’s really not someone that any company in America would hire. "
