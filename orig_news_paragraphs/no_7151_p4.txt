In his interview with Tagesspiegel, published Sunday, the former UN commissioner also lashed out at President Donald J. Trump, describing his having become president of the U. S. as "a permanent nightmare". However, Ziegler said Trump’s presidency has highlighted what he sees as positive aspects of American society. He praised "the totally spontaneous mobilisation of ‘the resistance’ and the women’s movement," speaking of supposed grassroots movements which are reported to have close links to globalist billionaire George Soros. A survey last week showed that a large majority of young people in the Visegrad group nations, the four countries upon which the Swiss former MP demands punitive measures be imposed, are totally opposed to the idea of being forced by Brussels to take migrants.
