Trump was initially set to sign an executive order looking into the alleged voter fraud on January 26, a few days after taking office. Reporters and photographers were summoned to the West Wing to document the signing, but waited for about 30 minutes amid confusion from aides. At the time, Spicer said the President "got jammed up on some meetings that needed to occur" and that the order would be signed in the next day or two. In February, one aide said the President was waiting until   Sen. Jeff Sessions was confirmed as attorney general before launching an investigation.
