The decision "could have devastating effects on the health of vulnerable women and girls and their families around the world," said   Antonio Guterres through a spokesman. Guterres "deeply regrets the decision by the United States to cut financial support for the UN Population Fund (and) believes that the decision is based on an inaccurate perception of the nature and importance of the work done by UNFPA," said his spokesman Stephane Dujarric. In Syria, UNPFA said it has helped an estimated 48, 000 women with safe childbirth, some 74, 700 individuals with   violence outreach, and offered health services and psychological support. It has created 64 womenâ€™s centers and safe spaces.
