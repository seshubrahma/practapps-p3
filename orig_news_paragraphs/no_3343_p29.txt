But the Goldman report also does not mention the J visas or the Optional Practical Training visas, which together deliver almost 200, 000 foreign college graduates to work in the United States, according to EPI. The EPI study ignores the fact that President Barack Obama allowed the spouses of   workers to get jobs. The Goldman report says that roughly 500, 000 spouses of   workers are now allowed to get jobs in the United States. The Goldman report does not say how many of the   spouses are working in skilled   jobs, but if that number is only   of the resident   spouses, then the number of foreign   contract workers would climb by up to 100, 000 people.
