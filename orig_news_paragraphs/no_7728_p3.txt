The march was announced shortly after Trump had been elected. March organizers say they have now secured a permit to gather at the intersection of Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the U. S. Capitol, the Guardian reported. Planned Parenthood has even become an official partner of the march. Organizer for the march Fontaine Pearson said the march is not a protest against Trump, but more of a way to highlight womenâ€™s issues such as workplace discrimination and sexual assault.
