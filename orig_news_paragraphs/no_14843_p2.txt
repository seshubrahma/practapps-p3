Greg Spriggs, a nuclear weapons physicist at the laboratory who’s in charge of the project, says the films were decomposing "to the point where they’ll become useless."   The film is made of organic material and each film canister he cracked open gave off a strong odor of vinegar, he says, indicating the decomposition had already begun. At 89, he works with granddaughter to prevent nuclear doom, Jim Moye, a film expert with four decades of experience in the motion picture industry who was brought on to the project, says  the films are remarkably well preserved, given that they weren’t stored particularly carefully. About 65% of the films have been located from the various   bunkers where they were stored, and of those, more than   have been scanned.
