In contrast, Obama’s demand that   bathroom policy should be set and enforced by central government in Washington D. C. is backed by only 36 percent of Democrats, by 22 percent of political independents, by 23 percent of women, by 31 percent of blacks, and by 18 percent of   minorities, according to the Rasmussen poll.    In fact, Obama’s    approach is only backed by half of people who agree with his goal of allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of the opposite biological sex, the poll said.   The poll of 1, 000 adults also asked respondents "Do you favor or oppose allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of the opposite biological sex?"   percent opposed the goal, 16 percent declined to answer, and only 33 percent supported the notion of "allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of the opposite biological sex. "  But half of that 33 percent prefer the decisions be made by state or local governments.
