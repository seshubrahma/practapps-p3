Anyone who doesnâ€™t work in health care may be surprised to learn just how much American medicine, ranging from the Cleveland Clinic to your own local hospital, relies on physicians from abroad. International medical graduates represent an essential influx of talent that supplements our own domestic medical school trainees, who are in too short supply to treat everyone who needs care in our communities.   Our training hospitals posted job listings for 27, 860 new medical graduates last year alone, but American medical schools only put out 18, 668 graduates. International physicians percolate throughout the entire medical system.
