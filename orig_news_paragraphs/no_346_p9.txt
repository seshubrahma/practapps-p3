Jennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said that a challenge to the executive order based on the later lawâ€™s   principles was the most promising line of attack. In an opinion article in The New York Times, David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian group, said Mr. Trump had at least violated the spirit of the later law. " Even if courts do find wiggle room here, discretion can be taken too far," Mr. Bier wrote.
