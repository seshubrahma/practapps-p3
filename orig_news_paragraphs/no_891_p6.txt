Mr. Trump is expected to present the budget this month, although it already is viewed as a largely aspirational proposal created by the Office of Management and Budget of the White House and individual departments to set priorities for Congress. A spokesman for the Homeland Security Department said he could not comment on the deliberations, and John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the budget office, said it was "premature" to discuss any proposals before an official budget blueprint was released. " The president and his cabinet are working collaboratively as we speak to create a budget that keeps the presidentâ€™s promises to secure the country and prioritize taxpayer funds," Mr. Czwartacki said.
