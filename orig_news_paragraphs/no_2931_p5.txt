Ms. Park suggested that she intended to fight her impeachment, telling cabinet members hours later that she would "calmly" prepare for the court deliberations and giving no hint that she would resign. " I am gravely accepting the voices of the people and the National Assembly, and I sincerely hope that the confusion will come to a satisfactory end," she said in remarks broadcast on national television. Ms. Park has been accused of allowing a shadowy confidante, the daughter of a religious sect leader, to exercise remarkable influence on matters ranging from choosing top government officials to her wardrobe, and of helping her extort tens of millions of dollars from South Korean companies.
