CIA Director James Woolsey said last week that Flynn met with Turkish officials last summer to discuss Turkeyâ€™s   extradition of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused of masterminding the July coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.   Woolsey claims he walked into the middle of a conversation between Flynn and Turkish officials in New York, in which the idea of staging a covert operation "in the dead of night to whisk this guy away" was discussed. Woolsey has variously described this conversation as either "startling and illegal," or "naive" and without "credibility. "
