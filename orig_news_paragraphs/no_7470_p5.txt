Phillips says his new data shows "a chasm" opening between Muslims and   on fundamental issues such as marriage, relations between men and women, schooling, freedom of expression and even the validity of violence in defence of religion. He notes  —   echoing an article on Breitbart London just two weeks ago which reveals a growing disparity between older and younger Muslims in Britain   —   that "the gaps between Muslim and   youngsters are nearly as large as those between their elders". And while he is cautious to note that many Muslims in Britain are grateful to be here, and do identify with role models such as Hussain and Farah, there is a widening gap in society with many Muslims segregating themselves.
