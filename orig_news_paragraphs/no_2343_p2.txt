On Monday, for the first time in federal court here, Mr. Wildstein explained the origins of the lane closings at the bridge in 2013, a scandal that would help to sink the presidential ambitions of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. He also said Mr. Christie’s former campaign manager, one of the governor’s closest confidants and now a top adviser to Donald J. Trump, knew about the scheme to close the lanes before it occurred and that the plan was meant as political retribution. The bridge manager explained to Mr. Wildstein that the lanes were used to ease congestion from traffic flowing though the town of Fort Lee. They were the result of a deal between a   mayor of the town and a former governor of New Jersey.
