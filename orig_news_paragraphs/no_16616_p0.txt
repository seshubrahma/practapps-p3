Washington (CNN) There is "absolutely not" any illness in Hillary Clinton’s medical records that hasn’t been disclosed, her campaign manager said Monday. Robby Mook told CNN’s Jake Tapper it was the fault of Clinton’s staff that the press wasn’t told for 90 minutes where the former secretary of state had gone when she left a   commemoration ceremony early after "overheating" and having to be helped into a van after faltering Sunday.
