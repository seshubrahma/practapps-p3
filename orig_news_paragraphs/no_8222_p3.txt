This is not a Marco Rubio effort, I have not talked to anybody in that campaign since the day I sat down with Sen. Rubio in Birmingham Alabama," he said, referring to his meeting in early 2015. The millionaire campaign donor has supported many political causes and candidates over the years, however his only 2016 donations have been to Rubio. According to FEC records, Pate made a donation in January 2015 and a donation in March 2015 to Rubio. A Rubio spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
