Based on its past actions, Kaltbaum thought the Federal Reserve was more likely to address the current downturn by printing more money  …     only to discover that particular tactic has lost its effectiveness, after years of using easy money to goose a sluggish economy. If the   trick doesn’t work this time, he predicted it would lead to a   crisis of confidence in central bankers. Kaltbaum saw little reason to be confident that anyone in the political class, on either side of the aisle, understood the magnitude and complexity of the new worldwide financial crisis, or had a good plan for dealing with it. He was disappointed neither Republican nor Democrat presidential debates included tough questions from informed moderators on the subject.
