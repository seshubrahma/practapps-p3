MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina   —    The South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention is underway, and event organizers tell Breitbart News that they’ve been overwhelmed by an unexpectedly high level of interest among activists statewide.   The event is sold out and the main ballroom, which seats more than 700 people, isn’t large enough for the full crowd.
