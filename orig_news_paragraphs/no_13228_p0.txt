Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump linked rival Hillary Clinton’s    policies to President Barack Obama’s ongoing release of many federal prison inmates, slamming her as "Heartless Hillary. " [Clinton wants to strip   Americans of their right to bear arms, while also freeing dangerous felons who will victimize more people, Trump said.   " Hillary wants to disarm vulnerable Americans in   neighborhoods: Whether it’s a young single mom in Florida, or a grandmother in Ohio, Hillary wants them to be defenseless," Trump said at the National Rifle Association’s   Leadership Forum on Friday, where the gun rights organization endorsed him for president.
