On Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Deputy Assistant to President Trump, said the firing of FBI Director James Comey was an example of how "incredibly decisive" the president is. ["The recent testimony of the director added that last straw to the camel’s back and proved that he’s unfit to serve, and that he’s lost the confidence not only of the president but of the agents that serve under him," Gorka said of Comey.   " Before I came into the White House, I spent many years training and educating FBI agents, so I have lots of connections with them," he said.
