Mr. Sessions, whose 1986 nomination as a federal judge was rejected by the   Senate because of testimony from colleagues that he was a racist, is likely to push for wholesale changes at the Justice Department by imposing conservative positions on immigration, terrorism, crime, drugs and guns. He is almost certain to reverse   efforts to confront civil rights violations, sentencing disparities and police abuses. Mr. Carson, a surgeon who has no experience in housing or running a large government agency, has already put housing advocates on notice that he does not think much of current programs for the poor. Mr. Puzder, who owns   chains and is opposed to raising the minimum wage, is a longtime critic of his departmentâ€™s approach.
