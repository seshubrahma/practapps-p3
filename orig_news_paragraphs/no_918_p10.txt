" It seems that as the travel ban becomes featured in the news cycle, regardless of whether it’s in favor or against the travel ban," said Patrick Surry, the chief data scientist for Hopper, "it may be reminding travelers that there’s a lot of uncertainty around whether international travelers are welcome in the U. S. and flight search demand then drops. "
