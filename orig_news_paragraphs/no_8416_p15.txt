What Moghed does not say and the entire NPR article fails to address is that Islamists view Mohammedâ€™s behavior in Medina as an example for establishing Islam as the dominant political system, at the expense of the Jews, which Islamic historiography identifies as being massacred and expelled. Moghed herself can scarcely be unaware of this, seeing as ISPU is itself a   think tank include numerous Muslim   thinkers. What makes matters worse is this bottom line: Our ignoring, downplaying or misrepresenting the virulent hatred felt by   Muslims towards those of us in what they call the Dar al Harb, or House of War (i. e. the   world) is seen by the jihadists not as "political correctness" or diversity sensitivity.
