James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, has suggested that the increase in violence in some urban centers may be the result of police officers’ being less aggressive in confronting potential crime as departments have been subjected to intense scrutiny over questionable shootings that have been captured on video and watched by millions on the internet. Mr. Comey’s remarks have been disputed by police chiefs and criminologists, who say there is no reliable data that supports his premise. The F. B. I. report said that about 1. 2 million violent crimes occurred in 2015, up from 1. 15 million in 2014. In 1996, when cities experienced a wave of violent crime, there were about 1. 7 million violent crimes, according to the data.
