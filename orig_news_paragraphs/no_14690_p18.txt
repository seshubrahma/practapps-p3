Immigration rights activists have criticized Trump’s policy of targeting most of the unauthorized immigrants as opposed to the Obama administration’s focus on violent offenders.    On Wednesday, Daniela Vargas, 22, was arrested after sharing her family’s story    including the arrests of her father and brother last month by ICE officers    during a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi. Moments before ICE picked her up, Vargas spoke out publicly for young people who, like herself, were brought to the United States illegally as children but later qualified for a temporary reprieve from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA.
