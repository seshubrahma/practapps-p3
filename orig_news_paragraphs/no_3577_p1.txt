Secretary Zinke is to report his findings on June 14, which will then start the   regulatory clock that would lead to amending or rescinding designations. Attorney General Becerra warned Zinke in a letter, "National monument designations protect the irreplaceable natural and cultural heritage that belongs to all Americans, ensuring that the haste or greed of one generation does not squander those gifts at the expense of future generations. " Becerra warned that any such move would be unlawful and he would "take any and all action necessary to protect the American heritage which has become part of our monument lands," according to the Highland Community News.
