we’ll have an interactive map of every single   hiking trail in the state of Colorado. Everything there is.    You’ll be able to go out and, while you’re hiking, you can meet   up with other people on the trail, you can see other people’s   photographs. You can come back 20 years later and click on the   map and see all the pictures you took.
