Alas, there are dangers. The current Chinese leadership is certainly not inclined to take military action against Taiwan, as long as Taiwan does not make any explicit moves toward formal independence.

If a Trump administration directly or tacitly encourages President Tsai to push her luck, China may feel compelled to attack.
