The Democratic Party is essentially a legal   entity for individual and corporate donors, especially in presidential years when the party’s nominee dictates the flow of money. Big donors don’t care about   at the local level they care about being attached to national brands. Astonishingly, at a time when people abhor the buying of elections by the rich, the party at its recent national meeting approved taking in large corporate donations. A   Democratic operative who worked on the 2016 campaign recently told me that when the Clinton campaign was told it needed to invest in local grassroots efforts, which support   races, it was hostile to the idea.
