HERNDON, Va.   —    Stung by the recent Supreme Court decision that overturned Texas abortion clinic restrictions, leaders of the country’s largest   group are redoubling their efforts for restrictions on abortion that they claim will prevent fetal pain and that they believe can fare well in the public eye and, they hope, in the courts. The group’s leaders said they remained confident in their strategy of undermining Roe v. Wade one step at a time, with their main focus less on rules for clinic safety of the kind that were just overturned, and more on what they call the "humanity of the unborn child," based on assumptions about fetal development that are sharply disputed by mainstream scientists.
