Mr. Trump’s decision to scrap the   Partnership, or T. P. P. reversed a   strategy adopted by presidents of both parties dating back to the Cold War, and aligned him more with the political left. When he told a meeting of union leaders at the White House on Monday that he had just terminated the pact, they broke into applause. " We’re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it’s going to be reversed," Mr. Trump told them, saying that from now on, the United States would sign trade deals only with individual allies.
