The deduction is available for taxpayers who take the standard deduction as well as itemize deductions, and will be capped at the average cost of care for the state of residence. Individuals earning more than $250, 000 (or $500, 000 if filing jointly) will not be eligible for the deduction. For a family earning $70, 000 per year in the 12 percent tax bracket with $7, 000 in child care expenses, the deduction would reduce taxes by $840 per year.â€¢ The plan will offer child care spending rebates to   taxpayers through the existing Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
