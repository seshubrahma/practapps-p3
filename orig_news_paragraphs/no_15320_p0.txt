 (CNN) The Moore family knew they would be having a mystery guest over for dinner but, still, they were surprised when Mark Zuckerberg walked through the door.   Zuckerberg, the   and CEO of Facebook, surprised the family at its Newton Falls, Ohio, home as part of his yearlong tour of the United States.   Daniel Moore said members of Zuckerberg’s staff reached out to him to see whether he wanted to host a mystery dinner guest, but kept Zuckerberg’s identity a secret until just before he arrived.
