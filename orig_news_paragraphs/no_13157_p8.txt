There was another transfer of another dozen documents by email to Patel on Oct. 26, 2008. Moncrief told Breitbart News that ABC News received and acknowledged receipt of the documents that spelled out specific instances of collusion between the Obama campaign and named individuals at ACORN and Project Vote. Among the documents were internal correspondences with Moncrief’s name, which she said she included to prove that she was who she said she was. Moncrief told Breitbart News the Obama campaign passed to ACORN and by extension to its sister entity Project Vote the campaign’s full donor list, which included all donors and fuller descriptions.
