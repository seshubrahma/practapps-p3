The impact of Trump’s tax plans on The Donald himself?   We cannot tell, because we do not have his tax returns. What returns we do have, from the 1970s and 1980s (and a hint from the 1990s) show that Trump paid little to no taxes, taking advantage of tax breaks available to real estate dealers. Trump’s plan doesn’t appear to address any such breaks.
