Frustrations, Caputo’s departure comes amid frustrations over the campaign’s lack of hiring so far of a traditional communications team to handle the high volume of media requests that comes with being a nominee for president, according to two sources in and around the campaign.   Trump’s convention team is currently in the process of trying to refine Trump’s message    building out its surrogate team ahead of Cleveland under John Wagner, the deputy director of communications for surrogate media. One convention source said they have already added 100 new surrogates, a number that will increase to 250 by the time of the convention.   Wagner has a long list of credentials as retired U. S. Army public affairs officer where he served as an analyst for CENTCOM, an operations officer for NORTHCOM and a media official in Baghdad during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
