After years of being ignored in the media, family members whose relatives were killed by illegal aliens first received national attention after Steinle’s death, when Trump met with several family members in Los Angeles, California. A Breitbart News analysis of when Trump’s campaign took off showed that he rocketed from seventh to first in the field of Republican presidential candidates within a week of bringing together this group of grieving Americans, whom he noted were victims of lax government policies. Trump brought a host of these families on stage during his immigration speech Wednesday. That action essentially forced mainstream media outlets to cover the "angel parents," from whom some networks had cut away during the prime time broadcast of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.
