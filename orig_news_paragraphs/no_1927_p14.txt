Ms. Park has never been considered a champion of women’s rights, either as the president or as a legislator before that. According to Kim   a leader at the Korean Women’s Associations United, gender inequality has actually worsened under Ms. Park, with sex crimes on the rise and a growing wealth gap taking a harder toll on women. Her presidential campaign was aimed at securing the support of older conservatives who still revered her father, the military dictator Park   for leading the country out of poverty in the 1960s and ’70s. Many saw in Ms. Park a modern version of her charismatic father.
