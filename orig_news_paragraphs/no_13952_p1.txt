Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad," Trump tweeted Saturday, which happened to fall on the weekend of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday. Trump later doubled down on his criticism    though he did not take aim at Lewisâ€™ district    tweeting Saturday night: "Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested   of the U. S. I can use all the help I can get!"
