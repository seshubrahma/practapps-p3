As of late September, more than 500 people had been killed in Chicago so far this year, passing the city ’s total for all of 2015, and more than 3, 000 people have been shot. Officials in Chicago have struggled to explain the uptick in killings. The law enforcement authorities point to a rising number of increasingly splintered gangs on the city’s South and West Sides, as well as an abundance of guns and what they view as weak penalties for gun violations.
