The difference between the usual Trump spoofs and McCarthy’s take on Spicer is that hers was actually hilarious.     A   McCarthy plays on Spicer’s rocky start at the White House    his oratorical stumbles, his new,   scorn for critical press, his equally Trumpian      with a   ear for his tics and tone.     Exaggerating a White House spokesman might sound like    kind of humor that average viewers won’t appreciate or find funny. But in the theatrical,   era of Trump, everyone around him is a character, too.
