While Trump is in   for the Republican nomination, the Quinnipiac poll exposes serious weakness in a general election campaign. Trump runs worse against both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders than either Cruz or Kasich. Almost    Republicans say they will not support Trump in November and 54 percent of Independents say they will not support him. Trumpâ€™s unfavorable rating among all voters is 61 percent, the worst of any candidate for President.
