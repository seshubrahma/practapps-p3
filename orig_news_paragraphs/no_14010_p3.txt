But it’s just his determination to come in, recognizing that we have a terrible relationship with Russia right now and to explore the possibility of improving that relationship," Pence said. Asked whether the incoming administration needed to punish Russia’s hacking to ward off similar moves from other countries, Pence demurred. Instead he knocked President Barack Obama’s administration for its failed reset with Russia and for not abiding by the red line Obama set with regards to the Syrian conflict.   Pence said those moves "eroded the respect for our country" and stressed that other countries will "see America’s strength in the Oval Office" with Trump in office.
