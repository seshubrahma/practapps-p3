"Trump isn’t signing it to actually improve education for American students, he is doing it to put a fake point on the board within his first 100 days because he doesn’t have any accomplishments of significance," said Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. The executive order is the 28th Trump has signed since taking office in January, more than any president in the last 72 years. " Previous administrations have wrongly forced states and schools to comply with federal whims and dictates for what our kids are taught," Trump said Wednesday.
