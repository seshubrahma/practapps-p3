For example, although expanded background checks are the law of the land in California, that state witnessed the May 2014 Santa Barbara attack at the hands of Elliot Rodger and the San Bernardino terror attack on December 2, 2015. Such checks are also the law of the land in Colorado, but that state witnessed the Planned Parenthood gunman on November 27 and a   gunman on Halloween day. Expanded background checks are also the law of the land in Washington state, but four people were killed by an unnamed gunman on February 26, 2016. Yet Clinton, Moore, and other gun control advocates are pressing for these checks to be instituted nationally as a way to reduce gun violence.
