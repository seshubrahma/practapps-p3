While it’s true that you do n’t need a TV license to listen to the radio , it’s also true that Radio 4 is a   beneficiary of the BBC’s   domination of Britain’s airwaves. It has virtually no competition in the field of   features on the radio, firstly, because it has dominated the medium for so long and secondly because it is so massively subsidised (hence the lack of irritating adverts!)
