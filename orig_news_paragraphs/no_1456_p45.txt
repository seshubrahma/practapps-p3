Nate My optimistic take: If each party is split between populist and affluent wings, there might be more room for compromises and bipartisanship than there has been over the last decade. That room for compromise could exist on either level   —   whether it’s the   trade deal and tax reform among each side’s corporate elites, or more populist efforts to expand the   tax credit, or something else.
