Some Dutch voters said they took Mr. Trump’s sometimes bellicose tone seriously, and consciously voted for parties that supported the European Union because they believe that Europe is stronger together and better able to stand up to the United States under Mr. Trump. For similar reasons, some said, they did not favor Brexit. " I don’t like Brexit, it weakened the system, it weakened the European Union and indirectly the Netherlands," said Max den Voort, 19, a student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in Delft.
