President Trump has dismissed the United Nations as a social club and suggested the United States could cut its funding of the organization’s efforts. His "America first" pledges have raised concerns among diplomats at the United Nations about his commitment to international cooperation. The administration’s antipathy toward the United Nations has been sharpened since a Security Council resolution last month condemning Israeli settlements. Mr. Trump and Ms. Haley have criticized the Obama administration’s decision not to veto the resolution.
