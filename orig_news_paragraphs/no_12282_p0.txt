The Department of Justice does not appear to see any problem with news that Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik sent a presidential campaign a "heads up" on upcoming federal government actions through a private email address.

Kadzik gave Podesta a potential timeline for the State Department to post work emails   —   which Clinton sent and received over an unsecure, homebrew email server  —   that she turned over years after leaving her position as Secretary of State.
