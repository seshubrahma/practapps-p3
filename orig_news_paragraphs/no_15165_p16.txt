Democrats, meanwhile, saw Handel    whose 55th birthday was Tuesday    as the Republican against whom they would fare the best, in part because of her conservative stances on social issues and attacks on Planned Parenthood.   Handel lost a 2010 race for governor and a 2014 Republican Senate primary and was accused of overspending as a county commissioner in a 2017 jungle primary attack ad from the conservative Club for Growth. She was hammered by Republican foes in the runoff who aligned themselves with Trump    raising the prospect that those Trump voters could skip the runoff entirely.   Handel’s efforts as secretary of state to purge Georgia’s voter rolls by requiring voters to prove their citizenship led to fights with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.
