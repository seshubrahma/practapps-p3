Another group is being advised by Edward J. Rollins, the strategist who was Ronald Reaganâ€™s campaign manager and has deep ties to the Republican Party. That group has faced scrutiny over its   practices, although it has donor meetings planned with prominent figures such as the financier Julian H. Robertson Jr. But in a recent meeting with Mr. Trump, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III was critical of Mr. Rollins, according to two people briefed on the exchange. Mr. Rollins and Mr. Baker were rivals during the 1980 primary race between Mr. Reagan and the elder George Bush.
