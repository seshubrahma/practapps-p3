Police arrested the immigration activist for allegations of criminal mischief after an investigation into acts of vandalism which occurred between December and March. The tagger reportedly used a paint marker and a spray can. The Courant reported that officers arrested   after university police viewed surveillance cameras and learned that he had used his UConn swipe card.   reportedly gave police a written statement that said, "I did the graffiti," and "I am open to entering into a conversation about restitution," reported the local publication. The University expended $4, 255 to remove the graffiti and clean up the damage.
