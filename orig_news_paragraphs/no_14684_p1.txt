Many Democrats are calling for Sessions to outright resign. Others are merely saying he must recuse himself from ongoing investigations into Russiaâ€™s alleged interference into the presidential election. Republicans are more split: Some agree with their Democratic colleagues that Sessions should recuse himself, but a large group of GOP lawmakers are either evading questions from reporters or instead trying to wade through the choppy political waters without taking a clear position.   None have yet called on him to resign.
