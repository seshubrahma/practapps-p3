The survey of 1, 000 American adults was conducted on Feb.   2017 by Rasmussen Reports. Other polls show that Americans want legal immigrants to integrate into the U. S. culture, and they oppose Americans’ integration into foreign cultures. In June 2016, for example, a poll showed that 56 percent of Americans want to exclude migrants who believe in Islam’s sharia law, which requires that democracy and civic norms be subordinated to the Islamic scriptures. In contrast, only about 20 percent of Americans told the pollster that they did not oppose the immigration of people who believe in sharia law.
