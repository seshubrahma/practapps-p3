know exactly what details were discussed in the meeting.    There was a statement released by U. S. government officials, though.   It said the Trump administration sees North Koreaâ€™s pursuit of nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles as an urgent security threat and that the president wants to increase pressure on North Korea to stop these programs.   The White House says it wants to do this peacefully with the help of allies like South Korea and Japan, but that the U. S. is also prepared to defend those allies, as well as itself.
