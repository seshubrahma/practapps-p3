Pennsylvania, long an afterthought in presidential primary stakes, may emerge as a key player in crowning this year’s Republican presidential nominee.

As a result, Pennsylvania’s April 26 statewide primary election is relatively meaningless  —   a beauty pageant. What is meaningful, however, is whom primary voters will select to send to Cleveland as the 54 uncommitted delegates.
