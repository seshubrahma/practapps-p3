During the 1952 Senate campaign in Massachusetts, the Kennedys brought in an old New Dealer to woo the state’s Jewish voters, who were quite understandably appalled by Joe. The new aide tried to draft a statement in which JFK would denounce both Communism and Sen. Joe McCarthy, not knowing that McCarthy was so close to the Kennedys that he was the godfather of Bobby’s first child. Joe Kennedy began screaming at the New Dealer: "You and your sheeny friends are trying to destroy my son!" But JFK won, and by 1959 was preparing to run for president, in yet another campaign that would be overseen by his father.
