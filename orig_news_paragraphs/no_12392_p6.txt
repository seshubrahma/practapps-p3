Those who rail against the Republican Establishment as the ineffectual housepets of the Left  —   content with their status as   perpetual losers who slowly consolidate the Left’s blitzkrieg advances across the American political spectrum   —   will go into convulsions before they get halfway through the HuffPo article.

Are any of the folks who complain about the corrupting influence of billionaires on American politics going to denounce this meeting, or is it OK for billionaires to work    with party leadership, provided they’re plotting the demise of a leading Republican presidential candidate?
