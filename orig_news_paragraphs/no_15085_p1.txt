President Barack Obama, also an avid golfer, waited months before playing a round when he first entered office. His first documented golf outing came April 26, 2009, just shy of the   mark in his presidency. He later quickened his pace, racking up 333 rounds of golf over his two terms in office, according to Mark Knoller, a CBS News reporter and unofficial presidential historian. Obama didnâ€™t avoid recreation when he first entered office.
