Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had his own foreign policy research and risk analysis staff as CEO of ExxonMobil, along with UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, all sounded a tougher note on Russia than the President did, pointing out the ways that Moscow works to counter US interests around the world.   " They were all sounding much tougher on Russia, much more like the Obama administration, and the outlier was the White House," said Angela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University.   The US missile strike was an exclamation mark establishing that Trump, for the time being at least, has come to see Russia in more conventional US foreign policy terms.
