Chaffetz has been an outspoken critic of the Secret Service, which has been rocked recently by   security breaches. Secret Service staff members  —   inspectors from the agency’s internal affairs office who examine possible misconduct among employees   —   sat in on interviews with some of the more than 40 agents and officers questioned about the unauthorized disclosures, the people said. In some cases, the Secret Service inspectors contacted witnesses directly and questioned them along with investigators from the DHS Inspector General’s Office headed by Roth, who is responsible for examining alleged wrongdoing across the breadth of Homeland Security.
