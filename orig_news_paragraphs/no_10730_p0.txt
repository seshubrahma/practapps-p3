Thursday on the Fox Business Network, Katrina Pierson, the national spokeswoman for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, explained to Fox Business Network’s Charles Payne that Breitbart was right to stand by its reporter Michelle Fields in the wake of the controversy involving her being allegedly assault by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.   However, she was skeptical of the assaulter having been Lewandowski and suggested it might have been another reporter. " [Breitbart] should stand by their reporter, because if she says someone grabbed her, he probably did grab her," Pierson said.
