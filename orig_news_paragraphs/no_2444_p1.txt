It was a remarkable concession from a real estate mogul who derides legal settlements and has mocked fellow businessmen who agree to them. But the allegations in the case were highly unpleasant for Mr. Trump: Students paid up to $35, 000 in tuition for a programs that, according to the testimony of former Trump University employees, used   sales tactics and employed unqualified instructors. The agreement wraps together the outstanding Trump University litigation, including two federal   cases in San Diego, and a separate lawsuit by Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general. The complaints alleged that students were cheated out of thousands of dollars in tuition through deceptive claims about what they would learn and   sales tactics.
