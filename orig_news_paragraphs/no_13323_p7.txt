Rubio’s latest statements come in addition to previous comments he made last year in which he seemed to lend his personal support to the rhetoric of the   Black Lives Matter movement, suggesting that the issue the controversial protesters are fighting is "legitimate" and that the growing "resentment" of law enforcement was understandable. Rubio’s comments prompted Black Lives Matter’s DeRay McKesson to reach out via twitter to Sen. Rubio and request a meeting.
