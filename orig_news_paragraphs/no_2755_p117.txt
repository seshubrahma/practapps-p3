‘IQ’ By Joe Ide (Mulholland Books). This is the start of a   comedic crime franchise with a bright future. Isaiah Quintabe (IQ for short) is an unlikely Sherlock, an incongruously polite cogitator operating out of gangsta turf in East Long Beach, Calif. The commercially savvy Mr. Ide has cast this book well: It features a hugely famous but   rapper IQ’s sidekick, a petty crook named Dodson Dodson’s loudmouthed girlfriend and IQ’s dead older brother, who serves as his conscience and really, really loved Motown.
