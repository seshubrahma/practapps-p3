But in a warning for those users concerned they might commit macro aggressions: the users must guard against generating environmental "bad energies" by allowing their virtual HRC campaign "HQ" office plants to wilt because the user failed to visit the site several times a day to virtually water virtually defenseless plants. Once the Hillary16 user finally moves into to    virtual office,    must be vigilant by constantly checking    iPhone, because the user never knows when there will be a game warning on the site that virtual Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is about to stop by. Users must immediately then invite all their Facebook Friends so they can celebrate hosting a virtual HRC campaign office grand opening. Each day, Hillary16 app users will be given "four things" they must do to help Hillary win in November, and a counter will track if they complete the tasks in time to win points.
