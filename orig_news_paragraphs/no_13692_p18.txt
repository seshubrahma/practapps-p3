Or, if elected in a landslide where Obama’s voter coalition turned out in force (after his   campaigning on taxpayers’ dime) my guess is a 50 percent chance based on her enthusiastic reaction back in January. However, Obama would likely be Clinton’s third or fourth SCOTUS appointment, providing adequate time for him to adjust to his   life after being inundated with job offers. Remember that President Taft was appointed to the Supreme Court eight years after leaving the White House. Then one must consider that Obama turns 55 this month, still young for a former president.
