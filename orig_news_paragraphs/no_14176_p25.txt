" A source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump’s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a    base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. The suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump’s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. Alshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss.
