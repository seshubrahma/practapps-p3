Clinton’s lawyer: Not happening, Marc Elias, the Clinton campaign’s top lawyer, has assured campaign manager Robby Mook and other senior Democrats that there is no way Republicans can remove Trump from the ballot, according to a Clinton aide. Elias told Mook and others that it is too late into the process for that and the campaign’s top aides, based on Elias’ assurances, are confident that Trump will be their opponent    no matter what happens in the next month. Clinton’s campaign watched on Friday as reporters and other political watchers cited RNC rules as proof that Trump could be replaced on the top of the ticket should the fallout from his lewd sexual comments lead to that. But Elias, who handles election law for most top Democrats and is currently suing a number of states to restore early voting and stop voter ID laws, told Clinton aides that it is state ballot laws that matter, not RNC rules.
