Mr. Terry said that the Old Post Officeâ€™s "historic integrity has been restored, and the wasting asset is now being put to productive use. " The ruling was criticized by ethics watchdog groups and certain House Democrats, who pointed out that with Mr. Trump in control of the federal government, he in effect controls the General Services Administration.

Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Peter DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement.
