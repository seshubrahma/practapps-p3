He later added: "Any staffer who contacted or potentially contacted a Russian agent or a Russian official has done so on their own accord and not at the direction of the campaign, the President or anybody else in the administration."   Lewandowski was responding to CNN reporting that   advisers close to   nominee Donald Trump    including Manafort    were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence, according to multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials. Lewandowski and Manafort were considered part of two rival power centers in the campaign during the time they overlapped. Manafort took operational control of Trump’s campaign after Lewandowski’s dismissal    only to resign two months later, in part due to Manafort’s role as a political adviser in Ukraine.
