Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions said Obama was acting like an "emperor" in 2014 when he issued an executive order on immigration. Sessions, now Trumpâ€™s most vocal immigration proponent as his attorney general, has praised the President for acting on immigration through executive order. " Such policies cannot continue," Sessions said last month when the Justice Department followed an executive order with action on cities that decline to enforce some federal immigration laws on immigration.
