TEL AVIV  —   President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a waiver that delayed the fulfillment of his campaign promise to move the U. S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express "disappointment. " [The White House said the decision does not affect the U. S.’s strong relationship with Israel and added that Trump still has every intention of moving the embassy in the future.   " While President Donald J. Trump signed the waiver under the Jerusalem Embassy Act and delayed moving the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, no one should consider this step to be in any way a retreat from the President’s strong support for Israel and for the United   alliance," the White House statement said.
