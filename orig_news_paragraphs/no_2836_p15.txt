Polling before and after   debates has shown that they do not have much effect on the overall race. A Gallup analysis before the 2012   found that the median change in polling after the   debates in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2008 was one percentage point. The 2008 debate between Ms. Palin and Mr. Biden was the most watched ever, seen by nearly 70 million viewers, more than for any of the presidential debates that year.
