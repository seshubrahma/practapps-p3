A Monmouth poll of Florida released on Monday shows Rubio trailing Trump in his home state of Florida by eight points a little over a week from election day there on March 15 —  next Tuesday. While that has him closing the gap from Quinnipiac and PPP polls in late February that had Trump up 16 points and 20 points over Rubio, respectively, it’s still a mountain to climb at home. " Most of the senator’s advisers agree he does not have a path to the nomination and some are advising him to get out ahead of the March 15 primary," Gangel and Kolpan wrote for CNN.
