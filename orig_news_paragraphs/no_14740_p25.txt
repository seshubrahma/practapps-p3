Many Republican governors have criticized the plan because it does not preserve the   expansion of Medicaid introduced under Obamacare, putting the health plans of millions of Americans at risk. " Phasing out Medicaid coverage without a viable alternative is counterproductive and unnecessarily puts at risk our ability to treat the drug addicted, mentally ill and working poor who now have access to a stable source of care," said Ohio Gov. John Kasich in a statement. The Medicaid issue could also be a stumbling block for the President since many of his Rust Belt   voters were able to access health care under the expansion.
