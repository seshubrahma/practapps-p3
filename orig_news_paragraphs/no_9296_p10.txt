The United States  —   along with China, Pakistan, and Afghanistan   —   have formed the Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QCG) to try to bring the Taliban to the peace negotiation table with the Afghan government, but the effort has failed. According to a U. S. watchdog group appointed by Congress, security conditions in Afghanistan are deteriorating as the Taliban continues to seize territory. The Obama administration has admitted that the Afghanistan war is "tipping in the Taliban’s favor," according to The Washington Post.
