Today, the news becomes palpable. We all spend part of our days looking at our social media feeds, seeing images, hearing reactions, listening to the voices of the people most directly affected by world events, with complex algorithms that magnify their power. The more interested we and our friends become in an event, the more comments and information we receive the more intensely we feel, the more personal it becomes. Join us on Facebook. .
