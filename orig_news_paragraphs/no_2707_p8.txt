In the days before her party leadership met on Sunday, several Christian Democrats said that the next parliamentary elections would be difficult to win with Ms. Merkel, but impossible to win without her. As she entered the atrium of her party headquarters on Sunday, she was applauded by about two dozen people on a   balcony. While Ms. Merkel mentioned several times that her ability to continue would be contingent on good health, she showed little weariness and gradually became almost feisty as she outlined the challenges to German industry and citizens in the 21st century. Germans should stick to their tried and tested concept of "social market economy," a blend of welfare state and capitalism, as they navigate this new world, Ms. Merkel said.
