That’s an increase of 1, 572, 694 people. But that data includes agricultural workers, and many economists prefer nonfarm payroll data, which shows that Texas had 10, 529, 900 nonfarm employees in December 2007 and 11, 749, 500 nonfarm employees in December 2014. That’s an increase of 1, 219, 600 people. Texas did add 1. 5 million jobs in seven years, but because that measure may not be the best gauge of employment, we rate Perry’s claim as Mostly True.
