Mr. Pence flew from Indianapolis to a   event in Rhode Island, where he told supporters that the election was about more than "one man," said Joseph A. Trillo, the chairman of Mr. Trump’s campaign in the state. Over hors d’oeuvres in a Newport mansion, Mr. Pence offered a pep talk without making direct mention of the day’s dire events. " He used the terminology that it’s a movement and it’s bigger than Donald Trump," Mr. Trillo said.
