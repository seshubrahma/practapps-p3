" The study, titled "Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election," was   by economists Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University and Hunt Allcott of New York University.   The paper utilized web browsing data, a database of what the authors claimed were fake news stories and a   online survey about news trends. The study concluded: Our data suggest that social media were not the most important source of election news, and even the most widely circulated fake news stories were seen by only a small fraction of Americans.
