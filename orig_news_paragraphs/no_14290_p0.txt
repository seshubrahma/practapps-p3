 (CNN) Defense giant Lockheed Martin has agreed to sell 90 new   fighter jets to the US Defense Department for $8. 5 billion    a deal that amounts to more than $700 million in savings over the last batch of aircraft delivered.   Lockheed Martin credited President Donald Trump for helping to "accelerate negotiations" and "drive down the price" of what is already the most expensive weapons program in history. The cost of the   Joint Strike Fighter program found itself in Trump’s crosshairs on several occasions in recent weeks and Trump called for a review of whether a modified version of the older    aircraft could replace the Navy’s costly   variant.
