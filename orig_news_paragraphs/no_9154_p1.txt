This means that today the U. S. already has a larger Muslim population than does Kuwait, or Brunei, or Bahrain, or Djibouti, or Qatar. Under current policy, Pew projects the number of Muslims in America will outnumber Jews by 2040. However, under a President Hillary Clinton it’s possible that date could come much sooner. Under two terms of a Hillary Clinton presidency, the U. S. would have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany’s Muslim population of 4. 8 million.
