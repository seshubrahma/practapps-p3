During the call, Senator Cruz agreed that he needed to speak with Glennâ€™s audience himself as many in his audience campaigned for the Senator during his run for President. While many who, view, listen, read and follow Mr Beck are now supporting the GOP candidate, many are voting their conscience by looking outside the party nominees. Senator Cruz will be on The Glenn Beck radio program Monday between 9am and 12n eastern.
