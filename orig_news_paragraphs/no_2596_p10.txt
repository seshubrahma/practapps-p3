On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has been focused on winning over independents and   women who are turned off by Mr. Trump, exuding confidence that the young voters and liberals who backed Mr. Sanders will get in line and support her when faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency instead. But behind the scenes, her senior campaign aides have been in frequent contact with Sanders advisers while also trying to build bridges to a wing of the party skeptical of Mrs. Clinton and the brand of moderate politics her husband advanced. Since she clinched the number of delegates needed to secure her party’s nomination on June 7, the campaign has reached out to Mr. Sanders’s supporters, dispatching three top staff members  —   the campaign manager, Robby Mook director of states and political engagement, Marlon Marshall and the top policy adviser, Jake Sullivan   —   to states that Mr. Sanders won, including New Hampshire, Wyoming, Vermont and Washington.
