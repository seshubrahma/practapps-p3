Meanwhile, the US waded again into military action, dropping a    Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) the US military’s largest   weapon, on an ISIS hideout in Afghanistan, the first time this type of weapon has been used in battle, according to US officials. Two days later, at an annual military parade in Pyongyang, the North Korean regime showed off a bevy of new missiles and launchers at its annual military parade. Part of the display were two new   canisters as well as North Korea’s   ballistic missile, and a   version of the same for the first time, according to analysts.
