In April, when Bolivia requested a   session of the UN Security Council in the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, Haley denied the request. " Any country that chooses to defend the atrocities of the Syrian regime will have to do so in full public view, for all the world to hear," she said, also blasting the "empty words" of other members of the council. Haley foreshadowed her defense of the U. S. policy in an   last week for The Wall Street Journal.
