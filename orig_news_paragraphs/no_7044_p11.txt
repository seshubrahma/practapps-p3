There is another factor distinguishing the Vietnam war from the turmoil in Syria if U. S. ground forces were to be involved. While China and Russia’s interests opposed America’s in Vietnam, U. S. ground forces never confronted the ground forces of any other nation state as Hanoi was fully committed to providing its own manpower to do so. In Syria, Iran already has its own ground forces actively involved, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, thus making a direct confrontation with our main adversary much more likely. During the early 1960s, several military advisors informed Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson Vietnam was not the right place at the right time to confront communist aggression.
