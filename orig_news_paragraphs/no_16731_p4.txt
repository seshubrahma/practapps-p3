It is. It is a factor because, in my experience, police officers tend to make snap judgments based on very limited information and prejudicial stereotypes. The officer in the helicopter in Tulsa certainly made a snap judgment when he said, "That looks like a bad dude,"  despite the fact that the officer knew nothing about Terence Crutcher other than his size and skin color.   Why would these officers say that Terence Crutcher was a "bad dude" and that it was "time for a Taser?
