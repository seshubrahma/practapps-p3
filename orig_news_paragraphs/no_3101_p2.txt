Trump has repeatedly called attention to FBI leaks to the media about the investigation into his campaign for any collusion with Russia in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. Sanders said that director Comey had "essentially taken a stick of dynamite" to the Justice Department after commenting publicly on the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email investigation. When asked if the president was prepared to fire more officials from the Justice Department, Sanders replied, "Not that I’m aware of today. " Sanders described a gradual "erosion of trust" surrounding Comey since Trump was inaugurated, and that the president wanted to give him a chance despite the reservations he had about the director.
