Trump, on the other hand, is bashing Sen. Marco Rubio as "weak" on immigration, some congressional Republicans are vowing to act on the idea of cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities, and the issue promises to figure prominently in the upcoming August 6 Republican presidential debate.   The sound bites and debate talking points will all distract from the core, politically unpalatable truth:  Without serious and comprehensive reform    including a reasonable path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people currently in the United States     we will continue to see local governments resort to   policies and other workarounds as a flawed but necessary substitute for a national will to fix our broken immigration system.
