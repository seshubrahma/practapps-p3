So I’ve got a   full brief case, and a wheelie   bag that I carry   as my suitcase when I’m gone for a week or two. " ’ ’ "    I have different routines around sleep on flights depending on   where I’m going. If I’m going to Europe, which is typically an   overnight flight, I’ll have a bite to eat and then immediately go   to sleep.
