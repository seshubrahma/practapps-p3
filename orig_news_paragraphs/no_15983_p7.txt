Neither presumptive nominee has wrapped up universal support within their own party. Among Republican and   voters, 51% say the party should nominate Trump, 48% would prefer someone else. On the Democratic side, 55% of Democrats and   say they’d pick Clinton as their party’s nominee, 43% say they would pick Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. That latter divide is about the same as the split between Obama and Clinton backers in   2008, when 43% said that if Clinton were still running, they’d prefer her as the party’s nominee.
