We know this for a fact because the candidate himself told a series of objective lies about Breitbart News during an interview with Fox News late last month. Matthew Boyle’s reporting was solid, sourced, and featured    quotes. When confronted with the story on Fox News, among other lies, Rubio attacked us as a "conspiracy" site (when he had contributed a piece to us just two weeks earlier) said his campaign never credentialed our reporters (it does) and misinformed viewers about our lead source’s role with ICE. This wasn’t the   political spin on Rubio’s part.
