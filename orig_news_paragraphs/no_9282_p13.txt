" Trump said there is often "no one to refute" people like Beck when they lie and said he has discovered "how smart the public is, how caring the public is" while taking on the lies that Beck and the mainstream media have tried to disseminate. Beck has had it out from Trump since Trump started leading the the 2016 presidential polls. Beck has gone on   National Public Radio to slam Trump as a "progressive" just like he did against Newt Gingrich in 2012 when Tea Party supporters started to support Gingrich over Mitt Romney.
