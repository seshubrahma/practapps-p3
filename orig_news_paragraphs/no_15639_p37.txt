But in the wake of Republicansâ€™ initial failure to repeal the law and polls showing record popularity for the Affordable Care Act, Quist has made Obamacare a centerpiece of his campaign, holding health care town halls, visiting American Indian health care centers and sharing his own story about how a bungled operation left him financially strapped. The House eventually passed a bill repealing and replacing Obamacare weeks later, but the Senate has yet to take up that proposal or unveil their own.   Quist has blamed a   debt history that included unpaid property taxes and other bills reported on by the Billings Gazette and The Associated Press earlier this year, on health problems. When asked about his   of financial problems, Quist argues it is just further proof that Americans need better access to affordable health care.
