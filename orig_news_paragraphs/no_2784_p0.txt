So far, Donald J. Trump has said very little about climate change and energy policy beyond his Twitter posts on the issues. He has called global warming a "hoax," for example, and claimed that the Chinese fabricated climate change (just a joke, he later said). And in an interview this week with Reuters, he said that he was "not a big fan" of the Paris climate accord, and that "at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements. "
