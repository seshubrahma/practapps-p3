Reines has spent more time playing "Presidential Trump" than "bombastic Trump," according to a source with knowledge of the prep. Reines, in an effort to prepare Clinton for a more polished Trump, has even ad lib an opening statement heralding the milestone of Clinton becoming the first woman nominee of a major presidential party, the source says. What Donald Trump shows up has been a key concern for Clinton’s top aides, including that small group of advisers who have been inside her debate prep. According to the source, the aides expect Trump to be a more polished, reserved candidate than the boisterous and    candidate that has been seen across the country on the campaign’s trail.
