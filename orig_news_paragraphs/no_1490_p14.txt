In 2009, Ms. Carlson contends, she complained to the network about her   on the popular "Fox  Friends" morning show, Steve Doocy, saying he belittled her on the set, openly mocked her among colleagues and once tried to shush her during a live broadcast by pulling down her arm. Mr. Ailes, the lawsuit states, responded by calling Ms. Carlson a "man hater" and saying "she needed to learn to ‘get along with the boys. ’ " Ms. Carlson claims that because of her complaints, Mr. Ailes eventually reassigned her from "Fox  Friends," in 2013, to a less prestigious slot.
