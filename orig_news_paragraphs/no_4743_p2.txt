So far we have handed over to the federal government more than 7, 500 criminal illegal aliens," Stewart told Breitbart News, referring to his time as a Prince William County Supervisor where he first came to national notice for his introduction of a county policy requiring police to look into the immigration status of those they arrest. Stewart continued his pitch for serious immigration enforcement, focusing on the transnational criminal gangs that have been terrorizing Virginia, committing a string of gruesome crimes evocative of their central American origins across the state. Stewart said: I am determined to put in place the toughest statewide crackdown on illegal aliens in the country in Virginia, especially rooting out and destroying  . I am going to do that through the 287( g) authority, which would mandate that every locality, every jail in the state will check immigration status   …     and hand inmates over to the federal government if they’re here illegally.
