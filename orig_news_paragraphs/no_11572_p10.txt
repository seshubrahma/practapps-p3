An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of America’s white   men. In 2000, white men with less than a college degree accounted for about   of all white men living in the county. By 2014, their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. But while this group’s share of the population held relatively steady, the earnings of white men with   jobs had fallen dramatically.
