 (CNN) Jerry Falwell, Jr,  the president of Liberty University, the largest Christian University in the world, is standing up for   Donald Trump’s choice for secretary of state after a major evangelical leader criticized the pick. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council,  doubled down Thursday on his criticism of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, writing, "He must have the courage to stop the promotion of this     agenda, which is very much a question mark given that he capitulated to activists pushing to liberalize the Boy Scouts’ policy on homosexuality when he was at the helm of the organization.
