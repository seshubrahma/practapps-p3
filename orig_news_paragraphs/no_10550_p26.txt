Cantor was defeated in a crushing primary election due to his support for mass migration. During the CNN panel, Heye  —  whose former boss pushed immigration policies that would have resulted in greater violence against American women   —   made clear that what really offended him morally was the idea of supporting Donald Trump for President: "I’ll never be a Donald Trump supporter," Heye said. During the panel discussion, Miller further addressed the economic effects of immigration and highlighted how Trump’s position on immigration and trade differs from that of Sen. Ted Cruz: In 2013, Sen. Cruz pushed an amendment to the Gang of Eight bill which would have actually doubled immigration including Muslim migration.
