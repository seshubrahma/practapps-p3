Donald Trump is not accepting big donations from Wall Street or big banks, so he will not be indebted to big donors whose interests sometimes conflict with average Americans. I am convinced Trump will fight for the best interests of Main Street   â€”   not Wall Street. He has already stood up during his campaign to the special interests that have corrupted the political process.
