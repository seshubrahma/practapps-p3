In a statement, Schumer’s spokesperson denied that there was a heated encounter at the restaurant. "[He] and his wife ate at the café on Sunday, engaging in unremarkable conversation with patrons who approached their table. There were no heated exchanges with ‎anyone," the spokesperson said. Schumer has railed against the Trump administration, saying Sunday that President Trump’s proposal for a border wall will not get votes from Republicans or Democrats.
