Under Cruzâ€™s   scenario, according to Breitbart California analysis, Cruz could win 118 delegates, nearly 70% of the total, though that is very unlikely. What is likeliest at the moment is a narrow loss to Trump, or possibly a narrow Cruz victory. Either one would likely deny Trump an outright majority of delegates. At the moment, Kasich is a minor factor, though he could win a dozen or more delegates if he concentrates efforts in a few liberal districts.
