Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another of Trump’s vanquished rivals who he went even harder against to defeat, has broken his pledge to the Republican Party and is refusing to endorse Trump for president. Several others in the Bush family, including Jeb’s father former U. S. President George H. W. Bush and the senior Bush’s granddaughter Barbara, are reportedly supporting Clinton for president. His campaign in the state here has shaken itself up post primaries, with Karen Giorno —   his state director during the primaries who delivered a successful election night back on March 15 —  moving up to New York City while Susie Wiles has taken over the state’s efforts in the general election.
