The Israeli company that built a border wall around Gaza saw its shares soar when   Donald Trump won the presidency. [Magal Security Systems Ltd. had been hoping for a Trump win because of his plan to finish the border wall between the U. S. and Mexico, the Independent reported.   Trump made it a point throughout his campaign that he would build a wall between the U. S. and Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants, although it is unclear whether his plan is to replace the   border wall that exists in urban areas or add on to it. The company has experienced some gains over the years after it expanded from the Gaza strip to Egypt, Somalia, and other countries in Africa.
