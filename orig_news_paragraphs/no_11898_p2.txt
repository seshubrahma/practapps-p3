@thesenuts365) November 28, 2016,   The   contest ended in a   victory for OSU after a controversial first down ruling in favor of the Buckeyes in a second overtime period. Jacob, who incorrectly referred to the tragic campus incident as a shooting, defended the despicable tweet as no worse than some of   Donald Trump’s tweets during his campaign against Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump said way worst shit than whatever I’ve said about the state of Ohio.
