Trump says we have to replace the current policy of "globalism" with a "new policy of Americanism" to fix all of the country’s ills. He again says he’s running to be the president of the United States of America and not the president of the world. He speaks about his plans to reduce poverty for   and Hispanic communities. He tells the Hispanic community that he will protect their jobs, build up their schools, and give them safety, which also means protecting them from radical Islamic terrorism.
