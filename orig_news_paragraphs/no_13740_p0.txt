Thursday on CNN’s "The Lead," while discussing the    attacks of sexism between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Bill and Hillary Clinton, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile declared Trump to be one built around attacking certain groups.   Brazile said, "Well, in the context of Donald Trump built his campaign on mocking women, attacking immigrants of course and smearing Muslims, I’m not surprised Donald Trump has decided to go into what I call the sleaze basket to try to bring up anything that would keep him from having a real conversation about issues that matters to the American people. When it comes to sexual assault, violence against women, I think Democrats and liberals and progressives have a good history on ensuring that women are able to tell their truth and to ensure that there are laws properly on the books to allow victims of these crimes and abuses to have their day.
