For one thing, the battle to liberate the ISIS stronghold of Mosul, Iraq    now into its seventh month    has underscored just how hard it is to defeat the extremists. Since the push in the western part of the city began in February, both the   coalition and Iraqi forces have been bombarding ISIS as promised, using much heavier firepower than during the battle for west Mosul in the waning months of the Obama administration.        But the tactic has come at a high cost in terms of civilian casualties, brought home by what US officials concede was probably a   airstrike on March 17 that mistakenly killed almost 150 civilians. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are still in western Mosul, often exploited by ISIS as human shields.
