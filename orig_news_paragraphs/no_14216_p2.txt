The New York Democrat, citing the Trump’s controversial travel ban order, announced earlier Monday that he would oppose Mick Mulvaney for Office of Management and Budget, Scott Pruitt for the Environmental Protection Agency, Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Betsy DeVos for the Department of Education and Andrew Puzder for the Department of Labor.   Meanwhile, the Senate voted   on Monday to end a Democratic filibuster of Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, allowing a final confirmation vote for the former ExxonMobil CEO to take place this week. Despite widespread Democratic opposition, Trump’s picks are expected to be confirmed.
