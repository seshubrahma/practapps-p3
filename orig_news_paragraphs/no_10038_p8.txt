As I document in my book The Clintons’ War on Women , Bill has allegedly attacked,   bit, raped or exposed himself while in a state of arousal to Eileen Wellstone, Juanita Broaddrick, Carolyn Moffet, Liz Ward Gracen, Becky Brown, Helen Dowdy, Paula Jones, Kathy Fergusen, Christy Zercher, and Kathleen Willey among dozens of other alleged victims. This is documented by my book The Clintons’ War on Women, which is 445 pages long and backed up with 586 footnotes and a bibliography of 157 books.
