Similarly, as a U. S. Senator, Sessions has led the fight to defend the jobs and wages of American workers —  in particular, those of black American workers. A full two years before Trump eventually heeded Sessions’ call and proclaimed that under his leadership the GOP would become a "worker’s party," Sessions urged the Republicans to "becom[e] the Party of Work" by advancing America first policies —  particularly on the issues of immigration and trade —   that would prioritize and advance the interests of the working American men and women of all backgrounds and legal immigrants already here. Sessions led the fight against the Paul   controversial expansion to the   visa program, which a 2015 Buzzfeed exposé revealed is being used to disproportionately lay off and replace black American workers.
