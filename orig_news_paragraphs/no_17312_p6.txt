The infamous former FEMA chief Michael Brown (he became a household name) who led the agency at the time of Katrina was a political appointee    not a subject matter expert, save his stint (described by some as an internship) as "assistant" to the city manager of Edmond, Oklahoma, population 35, 000, at the time. Brown was appointed by his friend to the top lawyer job at FEMA. The friend, incidentally, served as FEMA director after managing George W. Bushâ€™s presidential campaign. From that role, Brown was promoted a couple of times before landing the FEMA administrator job.
