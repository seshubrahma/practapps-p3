A New York sheriff has announced that it will be reversing its sanctuary policy just ahead of   Donald Trump’s inauguration. [Suffolk County Sheriff Vincent DeMarco announced that his county will no longer demand a judge’s order before detaining an illegal immigrant wanted by federal immigration officials, a major shift away from its previous sanctuary city policy, according to Newsday.   DeMarco said his policy reversal is not because of the incoming Trump administration’s expected legal fight against sanctuary city policies.
