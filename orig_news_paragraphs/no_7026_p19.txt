As of March 23, 38, 453 refugees have been resettled in the country, so under current budget appropriations, there is money to resettle only an additional 10, 448 refugees in the country for the balance of FY 2017. " Because HIAS is a   resettlement organization that has a cooperative agreement with the federal government on a   basis for each refugee served, and because the Department of State asked HIAS to increase its capacity from the 3, 884 refugees resettled in federal fiscal year ("FFY") 2016 to 4, 794 refugees in FFY 2017, HIAS would be denied crucial funding as a result of the March 6 Order, which bans all refugees for 120 days, bars all entry for the six   countries for 90 days, and limits the number of refugees to be admitted in the current fiscal year at 50, 000, which is less than half the number the Department of State told the resettlement agencies to collectively plan to resettle," the complaint continues.
