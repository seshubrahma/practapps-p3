Wednesday on "CBS This Morning," former "Face the Nation" host Bob Schieffer speculated on what could happen at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer if GOP presidential   Donald Trump doesn’t secure a majority of the delegates at the end of the primary process.   Schieffer explained to   Charlie Rose and Gayle King that if Trump isn’t selected on the first ballot, he anticipates the delegates could select House Speaker Paul Ryan as this year’s GOP nominee. " All that makes it a possibility is all that says is that they can block Trump getting the majority of delegates before they get to the convention," Schieffer said.
