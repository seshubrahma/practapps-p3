Williams lost his slot as anchor of the NBC Nightly News after he made up scores of accounts, passing off completely fabricated stories as journalism. In fact, back in early 2015, Breitbart News presented a list of at least 32 times that NBC News let Williams present such fake news to the American people —  lies and disputed stories —  including his false claims about being in a helicopter that was hit by an RPG. Williams also made up stories about Seal Team 6, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Pope, Hurricane Katrina, quitting college, rescuing a puppy from a house fire, and more.
