" On the other hand, the commitment to spending 2 percent on defense is meant to be about the long haul, and about genuinely readjusting national budget priorities, and I donâ€™t see this plan as moving European NATO members much closer to that goal," he said, adding that much of the plan was based on debt financing. Jyrki Katainen, a vice president of the European Commission, said the timing of the plan had "nothing to do with American elections" since it had been in the works since 2014. A longstanding goal was to avoid duplication of effort in military procurement, which is mostly done on a national basis, and to improve the compatibility of the various military hardware that European countries acquire, he said.
