The turkeys usually stay in a swanky hotel room at places like the Willard InterContinental Hotel in downtown Washington before the event. But there’s only one place for a big league (or "bigly," depending on where you come out on that Trumpism Rorschach test) turkey worthy of a Trump pardon: Trump International Hotel, located just blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. Maybe he’ll let them spend a night in the Presidential Suite.
