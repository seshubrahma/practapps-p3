Black voting rights for men protected by the 15th amendment were then thwarted during an orchestrated campaign of racial violence, ensuring that most blacks could not freely exercise voting rights until after 1965. Black voting power grew in the   rights era but profound obstacles remained, including numerous   efforts to diffuse, deny, and denigrate black voting power through gerrymandering of congressional districts, the enactment of voter ID laws, and the closing of polling places in predominantly black and brown communities.    Barack Obama’s watershed presidency witnessed a high point in black voter participation, yet this moment of maximum opportunity precipitated an enormous backlash as evidenced by candidate Trump’s blunt talk of voter fraud taking place in "inner cities" across America.   Blaming black voters for Clinton’s loss ignores the structural constraints placed on that vote while denying black voters’ individual agency.
