MA plans are able to achieve higher satisfaction and better outcomes for an equal or lower cost because they better manage care and effectively negotiate costs for everything from doctors and hospitals to prescription medicines. The   of MA plans also has positive,   effects on traditional Medicare.   A recent study in the journal Health Affairs found that the greater the penetration of Medicare Advantage in a particular market, the lower the costs for traditional Medicare patients there.   Some have suggested that government needs to play a bigger role in negotiating prices for health care services and goods, such as pharmaceuticals.
