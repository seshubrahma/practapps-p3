Gorsuch hits back at claims made by former student, Gorsuch sharply denied accusations made by a former student that he suggested in a law class last year that women unethically use companies for maternity benefits. Jennifer Sisk, a former student in Gorsuch’s ethics class at the University of Colorado Law School, wrote a letter to the committee saying Gorsuch asked for students’ opinions about a hypothetical scenario, in which, a woman applied for a job at a large law firm and planned to start a family with her husband in the near future. " He asked the class to raise their hands if they knew of a female who had used a company to get maternity benefits and then left right after having a baby," she writes.
