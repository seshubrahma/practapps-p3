Opponents say Sessions may have perjured himself by not   mentioning those two conversations with Kislyak. " "   Kislyak was also the person with whom former National Security    Adviser Michael Flynn was found to have communicated with before   the election, leading to Flynn’s resignation as national security   adviser after Trump said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence   regarding the content of that communication. " ’ Sessions said   he did not meet " with any Russians at any time to discuss any   political campaign, and those remarks are unbelievable to me and   are false.
