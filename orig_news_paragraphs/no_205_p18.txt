Scientists have calculated that the heat accumulating throughout the Earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the energy that would be released by 400, 000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day. It is true that at the Earthâ€™s surface, the warming seems to be proceeding in fits and starts. " The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep," said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the   Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
