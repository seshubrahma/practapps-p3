Clinton tweeted twice about her health Monday evening, saying: "Thanks to everyone who’s reached out with well wishes! I’m feeling fine and getting better."   Then, in the second tweet, she said: "Like anyone who’s ever been home sick from work, I’m just anxious to get back out there. See you on the trail soon."
