The bill expands protections for immigrants at a time when the Trump administration has expanded who is considered a priority for deportation. The legislation prohibits any state or local law enforcement agency from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations. Under the legislation, county jails would not be able to allow officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to work inside the jails or notify them when a prisoner is being released. After the bill came under fierce criticism from the California State Sheriffsâ€™ Association, it was amended to allow local law enforcement officials to notify ICE of the release date of serious and violent felons.
