A new   poll shows Clinton leading Trump 52% to 43% in a    matchup. He has again put leaders of his own party in a no win position    and that could be a problem if it comes to a point later on when they face a decision of whether to cut the nominee loose in a bid to preserve congressional majorities. Once again they have been forced to choose between rebuking a nominee who destroyed the most talented GOP primary field in a generation and won the votes of millions of Republicans they need to show up in November or of tarnishing their own political brands. That’s why, when House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell issued statements on Sunday, they implicitly condemned Trump’s comments but did not mention their nominee by name.
