Sen. Cory Gardner,  . plans to renew his   push to create a   committee to investigate cyberattacks by introducing legislation on the issue next month, his spokesman said. Several other Republicans who have been tough on Russia didnâ€™t respond to inquiries Monday if they would back such a panel    a sign that opposing the creation of the committee could be a politically difficult vote.
