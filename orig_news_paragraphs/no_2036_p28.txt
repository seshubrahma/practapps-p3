A few days ago, Ms. Delekta and two fellow Republican students sat down at a local restaurant, Savaâ€™s, to talk about the campus mood with several students with   views. The conversation soon grew tense as the students were unable to agree on almost anything. Ms. Delekta described how she had been offended when a classmate wondered why as a "white female," she had not voted for Hillary Clinton. She resented what she saw as identity politics on campus.
