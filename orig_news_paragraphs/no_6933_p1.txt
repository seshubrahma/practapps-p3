Christian has a history of erratic behavior and a long criminal record, including being convicted and jailed after he held up employees at a convenience store with a gun in 2002, CBS News reported on Tuesday. In 2010, he was charged with theft and felon in possession of a firearm, according to The Oregonian. But Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, is creating a connection between the tragic event that led to the deaths of Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, 23, and Ricky John Best, 53, and   events, including one that Christian tried to attend last month   â€”   though organizers say they rejected him and video exists of demonstrators kicking him out.
