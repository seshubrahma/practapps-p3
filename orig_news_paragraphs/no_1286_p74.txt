_______ POETRY Tyehimba Jess , "Olio" Mr. Jess’s second book of poems is a kaleidoscopic and formally ambitious collection about   artists between the Civil War and World War I, and the ways in which they both fought against and tried to make creative use of the cultural pressures of minstrelsy. Scott Joplin plays a prominent role in the book ’s imagination, as do less   figures, most but not all musicians.
