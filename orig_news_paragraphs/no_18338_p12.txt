"   Rosenstein also criticized Comey’s handling of his October   28 letter to congressional leaders announcing a reopening of the   Clinton investigation based on emails recovered from former   Rep. Anthony Weiner’s computer. Weiner was married to top   Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who the FBI said forwarded two email   chains onto his computer for printing purposes. " ’   Citing Comey’’s testimony last week, Rosenstein said Comey made a   false assertion that his only choice was to either "speak" on or   "conceal" what he uncovered. The information later turned   out to not be sufficient to move forward with the investigation   and led to a subsequent FBI announcement days before the November   election that the investigation would remain closed.
