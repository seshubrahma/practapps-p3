Some prominent Democrats are already asking whether he may have crossed ethical lines by investing in companies that stood to benefit from legislation he helped shape. Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Louise Slaughter of New York and other Democrats have called for investigations into Mr. Priceâ€™s trades. On Wednesday, Mr. Price, who as health secretary would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, filed papers with the federal government saying he would divest himself of interests in several health care companies, including Innate. Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the presidential transition, said that Mr. Price took "his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously," and that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an "exhaustive" review of his financial holdings.
