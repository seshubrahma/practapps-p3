For Israel’s ally to be acting in this way was "unthinkable," the officials were quoted as saying. A second TV report, on Israel’s Channel 2, said the leak "came directly from the White House," and noted that "this is not the first time" that the administration has compromised Israel by leaking information on such Israeli Air Force raids on Syrian targets. It said some previous leaks were believed to have come from the Pentagon, and that consideration had been given at one point to establishing a panel to investigate the sources. In 2012, Israel suspected the Obama administration had leaked information to prevent the Jewish state from striking Iran’s nuclear facilities.
