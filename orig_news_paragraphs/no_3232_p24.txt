That makes sense for the foreign workers because many hope to get the hugely valuable   prize of citizenship from the U. S. government after perhaps ten years of work. The citizenship bonus can also be duplicated for their parents, siblings, children ad grandchildren. The deal is also rational for U. S. employers because they pay   rates and also don’t have to pay the citizenship bonus to the   workers. That good for many U. S. companies because it means they can get subcontracting work done for cheaper and because it also lowers the marketplace salaries for all U. S. professionals.    are hired by many   companies, displacing Americans who want jobs with Microsoft or Facebook, Caterpillar or   Goldman Sachs or McDonald’s.
