Senator Cruz won two congressional districts with a majority vote and received all three delegates in those districts. Those districts were: the first congressional district, the seat held by Tea Party favorite Louie Gohmert and the 29th congressional district, a seat held by Democrat Gene Green. The total delegate count, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s website, is 104 delegates for Cruz, 48 for Trump, and 3 for Rubio. As the dust settles on Super Tuesday’s massive primary election day, Trump takes a lead of ninety delegates over Cruz, according to Politico.
