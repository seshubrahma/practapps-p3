A Democratic intelligence committee source told CNN that Nunes’ move to postpone the hearing on Friday was a "suicide bomb" that signaled Nunes was effectively trying to destroy the Russia investigation.   Nunes said he was only postponing the hearing    where former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates were slated to testify    to a later date. But Democrats accused him of canceling it. Democrats were already seething over Nunes’ decision Wednesday to brief the White House and tell the media that he had obtained intelligence suggesting President Donald Trump’s communications may have been intercepted by intelligence agencies    before telling his own committee members.
