(emphasis added) HIAS and IRAP fail to acknowledge in their complaint that the "earlier proclamation setting a limit of 110, 000" refugees to be resettled in the United States in FY 2017 was not a Constitutionally authorized executive order, or even a "proclamation," but instead was the statutory "presidential determination" for FY 2017 made by former President Obama on September 22, 2016. Under the statute, the Refugee Act of 1980, such a "presidential determination" of maximum refugee resettlements must be made prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year (in this case October 1, 2016, the beginning of FY 2017) and merely sets a top limit of refugees authorized but not funded for the coming year. Congress actually sets the funding level for the number of refugees to be resettled when it passes a budget for a fiscal year. "
