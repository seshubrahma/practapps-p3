If there’s one thing Republican voters are fed up with, it’s ineffectual leaders who talk about all their great ideas, but never actually do anything.   In Ryan’s case, what he’s actually done is deliver an omnibus bill so obscene Democrats were actually cackling with glee, with a side order of the     insanity GOP voters hate. The Wall Street Journal also took a shot at "reform conservatives" for going too hard on Ryan: On the other side are a cast of conservative intellectuals who don’t like Mr. Ryan because he continues to believe in the Ronald   Kemp vision of a     GOP that focuses on economic growth. They think the GOP needs a policy mix to address income inequality and promote redistribution —  albeit to the middle class —  rather than aiming for faster growth.
