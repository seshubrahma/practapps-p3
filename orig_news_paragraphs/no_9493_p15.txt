Without a trade blueprint to guide negotiations, the Chinese or others might move toward balanced trade by buying more scrap metal, waste paper, and soybeans, but could still leave us more dependent on them for advanced technology goods. The U. S. must know which industries and technologies are crucial to our national security and economic future. Whatever objections one might raise to a Trump nomination, it is folly to dismiss    his critique of, Americaâ€™s dismal place in the current imbalanced global trading system, and argue instead that the status quo is fine, including   trade deficits.
