If it was, the US armed forces would be placed on what is known as Defcon 2, according to Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.   Schuster said such an announcement would be formal and public. The US military would also step up training inside its borders and send a second aircraft carrier to East Asia    and carriers don’t move quickly.   US Pacific Command has said the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group is expected to be off the Korean Peninsula by the end of April, but it has not announced any other carrier movement.
