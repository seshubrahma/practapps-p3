The meetings helped Rubio to write his book "100 Innovative Ideas For Florida’s Future," but they also helped him to deliver his "American Exceptionalism" speech that Rubio finally trotted out before a national audience when he accepted victory in his November 2010 Senate race in Florida. Rubio has subsequently returned to themes from that speech in many of his public statements. Luntz was hired by Rubio’s team, but the insider did not remember whether Luntz was paid by Rubio personally or by the Republican House leadership organization in Florida, which Rubio at the time controlled. This all raises serious questions about Luntz‘s credibility and also about Fox News’ role in favoring Rubio over the other candidates.
