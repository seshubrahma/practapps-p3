Protesters in Caracas  —   participating in a march the opposition called "We are Millions "  —   demanded elections on Saturday, as well as an end to the military violence against unarmed protesters that has left 47 dead since protests began in late March. The protest spanned from the main Francisco Fajardo highway to the Ministry of the Interior in the capital. Francisco Fajardo has been home to some of the most violent clashes between protesters and the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) which Maduro has permitted to use tear gas, rubber bullets, and armored tanks to killed protesters.
