TV hosts (Colbert, Maher, Bee, Meyers etc.)   TV in the   to the election was a veritable wasteland of     predictions and naked scorn. Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, Bill Maher and Seth Meyers were perhaps the worst offenders Colbert got some blowback when he drew a swastika on a chalkboard in a bit denouncing Trump’s "" and later bombed spectacularly on his live Election Night Showtime special when it became clear that Trump was going to win and all of his   jokes went out the window. Meanwhile, Maher was comparing Trump to Hitler, joking about his assassination and insisting he would vote for "dead Hillary" over Trump, while Bee blamed white people for Clinton’s loss and later bonded with Glenn Beck over their mutual hatred for Trump. Over on NBC, Seth Meyers outright banned Trump from his show before ultimately relenting, though Trump didn’t visit Late Night after that.
