Sanders and Clinton are statistically tied in a new California Field Poll released on Thursday. That poll shows California Democrats divided between the two, with 45% for Clinton and 43% for Sanders, and with a 3. 2 percent margin of error. As Breitbart News reported Thursday, this is the third poll within a week to show a similar result. Clinton opens her California scramble with a campaign event in San Diego on Thursday.
