Sunday on CNN’s "Reliable Sources," Glenn Greenwald said Democrats who "suddenly love leaks" about President Donald Trump ’s administration thought people who leaked to the media during the Obama administration were "villains," "traitors," and "they ought to go to prison. "   Greenwald said, "The problem is if you look at the last eight years, there has been a very concerted war on not just sources and whistleblowers, but also journalists, implemented by not Donald Trump but by the Obama administration. More sources prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act than in all previous administrations combined.
