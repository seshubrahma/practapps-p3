The group then marched Macy’s Herald Square and began chanting within the department store. In a separate protest, a dozen people were arrested outside the Park Avenue office of JPMorgan Chase   Co. for civil disobedience, said New York Police Department Sgt Lee Jones. The protest, dubbed "Corporate Backers of Hate," targets companies who have cultivated ties to President Donald Trump’s administration and stand to profit off his policies, said Daniel Altschuler of Make the Road New York, which helped organize the protest.
