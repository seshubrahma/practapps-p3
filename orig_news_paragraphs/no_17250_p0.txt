Washington (CNN) Paul Ryan and   Donald Trump, at odds for much of the 2016 campaign, now speak "about every day," the House speaker said in a   interview aired Sunday.   The Wisconsin Republican told interviewer Scott Pelley on the CBSâ€™s "60 Minutes" he often calls the incoming President on his cell phone to discuss the legislative agenda in 2017. That includes tackling health care and immigration, Ryan said.
