An airstrike killed 15 civilians, including four children, in Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib on Saturday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The monitoring group said the strike on the village of Urum   was suspected to have been carried out by Russian planes, which operate in support of the Syrian government. Syria’s Civil Defence volunteer group, also known as The White Helmets, said the death toll was 16, with 20 people injured. A   coalition also has long been conducting airstrikes in Syria, against ISIS targets in the country.
