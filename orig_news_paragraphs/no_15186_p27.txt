Instead he pointed to Indiana as a state that reformed its health care system under the guidance of the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services director Seema Verma.   The Healthy Indiana Plan did not do more with less instead, it used the money it was given for Medicaid to create benefit packages for   adults that were modeled after   health plans.
