But the White House, still smarting from a disastrous defeat on Friday, appeared uncertain on the path forward. President Trump predicted that "Obamacare will explode" and offered no plan to stop it, but his was not the only voice from the White House. The president "wants to make sure that people don’t get left behind" in the search for affordable, quality health care, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on "Fox News Sunday. " "I think it’s time for our folks to come together," Mr. Priebus said, adding that it is time to "potentially get a few moderate Democrats on board, as well" as they try to bring down premiums and stabilize insurance markets.
