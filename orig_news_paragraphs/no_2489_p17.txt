A spokesman for Mr. Trump’s transition said Monday that several cabinet announcements and White House staffing decisions were "likely" this week, following the  ’s recent picks to oversee the Education, Health and Human Services, Justice and Commerce Departments. Last month, Mr. Trump announced that he had chosen Betsy DeVos to lead the Education Department. Ms. DeVos, a longtime Republican   has spent nearly 30 years pushing for families to receive public funds to send their children to private and parochial schools, usually to the consternation of teacher unions. She is certain to challenge the approach that Mr. Obama and his administration have followed, often with the support of those same unions.
