When the former United States secretary of state, John Kerry, came up with a proposed framework accord defining the principles of a comprehensive   agreement after months of negotiations in 2014, Mr. Abbas did not respond. Since then, Israel has approved plans for thousands of new settler homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and has moved to retroactively legalize settler outposts that were built throughout the territory. The measures have further entrenched the occupation, now in its 50th year since Israel captured the territory from Jordan in the 1967 war. A growing number of   Israeli ministers, including from Mr. Netanyahuâ€™s Likud Party, are pushing to annex the settlements that Israel intends to incorporate within its borders under any future deal.
