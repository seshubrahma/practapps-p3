From Niall Stanage writing at The Hill:  One hundred days from now, either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be elected president. In such a volatile political year, the outcome is anyoneâ€™s guess. Clinton and Trump are hampered by the worst favorability ratings for nominees in modern times, though both have committed, fervent supporters. The electoral map and the shifting demographics of the United States appear to favor Clinton, particularly because Trump is struggling mightily to attract support from minority voters.
