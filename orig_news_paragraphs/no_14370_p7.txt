Reportedly among the dead was the    the daughter of Anwar   the late   cleric who directed attacks against the United States. Awlaki was killed in 2011. Reprieve, a   nongovernmental organization, and a   human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the January attack. One of the Yemeni officials said that Yemen did not want to lose the United States as a key ally, "but their actions and killing of innocent civilians are putting us in the hot seat in front of our people."
