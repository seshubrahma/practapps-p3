Some Republicans who responded positively to the idea of a leader who breaks the rules to do what’s right are merely asking for leadership that fights on Obama’s terms, or accepting that Obama’s actions have permanently redefined the role of the President.   Conversely, very few Obama supporters would agree that his "breaking the rules to set things right" makes him an authoritarian. If the   contest leads to a great national bipartisan conversation on the evils of authoritarianism, it will have a silver lining. Take all the responses from the PRRI poll together, and we might form a hypothesis that much of the "wrong track" feeling that grips American voters stems from their sense of helplessness, their anger at a   system that doesn’t represent their interests, or grant them the independence to make their own decisions.
