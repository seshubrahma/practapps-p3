Michael Hartnett suggests that liberals are beginning to understand that Silicon Valley’s globalist digital technology firms’ business model has been spectacular for a handful of CEOs and venture capitalists, but left the vast majority of Americans economically behind. Harnett calls attention to the fact that Apple, Alphabet (Google) Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook now have a market capitalization of $16. 1 trillion. That is about $1. 2 trillion greater than the entire GDP of New York City, and twice the GDP of Los Angeles. And one fact illustrates the potential that tech companies have to dominate the United States government: each one of America’s five largest tech companies now has a market capitalization that exceeds the GDP of Washington, D. C. B of A believes that the divergence between the spectacular technology   stock market gains on the one hand, versus the continued weak global economy on the other hand, will ultimately be unsustainable.
