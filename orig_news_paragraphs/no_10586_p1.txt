President Obama’s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies of allowing Jews to build in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem for the decision by the U. S. to abstain from yesterday’s vote on an   United Nations Security Council resolution. [The resolution called for a halt to Israeli construction in the West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem, and the text referred to those lands as "Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. "   " Netanyahu had the opportunity to pursue policies that would have led to a different outcome today," Rhodes told reporters on a conference call on Friday, after the U. S. abstained thereby allowing the measure to pass.
