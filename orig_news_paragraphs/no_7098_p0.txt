The 2017 March for Life saw thousands of   demonstrators rally at the National Mall in Washington, DC, spurred on by encouraging messages from   President Donald Trump and appearances by his top surrogates. Vice President Mike Pence became the first VP ever to address the crowd, while Trumpâ€™s winning campaign manager Kellyanne Conway headlined the event.   Reporters from Breitbart News were also in attendance at the 44th annual March for Life, capturing scenes from the crowd.
