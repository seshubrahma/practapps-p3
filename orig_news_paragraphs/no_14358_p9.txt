These plans offer seniors a holistic solution to their care, combining medical and drug coverage into an integrated private health care plan. And they often include benefits that traditional Medicare does not, such as wellness programs, as well as routine vision and dental care. As a result, an increasing number of seniors are choosing MA over traditional Medicare and have a variety of choices of competing private plans within MA to choose from. MA plans are able to achieve higher satisfaction and better outcomes for an equal or lower cost because they better manage care and effectively negotiate costs for everything from doctors and hospitals to prescription medicines.
