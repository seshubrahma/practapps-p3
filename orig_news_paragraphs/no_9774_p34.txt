He could have addressed American workers in all communities —    class workers who thought they would have at least the same   lifestyle their parents had, black communities that have been decimated because factories and plants in their communities have closed due to bad trade deals, Americans of Hispanic and Asian descent who are having trouble finding jobs because of illegal immigration, and   Americans of all backgrounds who are worried that cheaper,   foreigners will be brought in to replace them while they are forced to train them. Instead, he spent most of his press conference attacking irrelevant Lindsey Graham, pointing out that Charles Krauthammer finally acknowledged that he did well (why the hell should he care what he thinks?) settling scores with Mitt Romney, blasting bad polls from the Wall Street Journal and incessantly giving       accounts of     minutiae that no regular voter gives a damn about except for someone like Trump who seems obsessed about reading every story written about him (to be fair, Trump’s insatiable appetite for all news about him does make him a better candidate than those whose advisers keep in a bubble because he knows what the political conversation is on any given day. He should keep reading all that is written about him but he seems small when he feels the need to constantly comment on every poll, every criticism, every bad story, etc. ). Trump was all over the map.
