Buzz Jacobs, a Republican political consultant who worked on John McCain’s campaign in 2008 and on Marco Rubio’s run this year, said Mr. Trump would benefit from the Republican Party’s     effort. But he was puzzled by Mr. Trump’s comments on the Obama field operation. " If it’s true that the campaign is going to disregard data wholesale, that would be alarming, and would leave them way behind the Clinton campaign, then we’ll lose," Mr. Jacobs said.
