Trump joked that the press would focus on that remark. Before Trump spoke, Kate Quigley, sister of Benghazi hero Glen Doherty, addressed the audience, who listened to her story in rapt, and even tearful, silence.   She spoke about how Hillary Clinton had told her family that a YouTube video was responsible for the attack, and how the only person at the memorial who told the truth to her about the attack was the Libyan ambassador to the U. S. Audience listens, rapt  tearful, as sister of #Benghazi hero Doherty talks to #Trump rally #Atkinson #NewHampshire pic. twitter.
