However, a US official told CNN that Haley’s remarks were misunderstood. The official said the US ambassador was not giving Assad a free pass, and she called Assad a "war criminal" in an appearance Wednesday at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City.   The official explained to CNN that the priorities of the administration now are not exclusively about Assad, but also defeating ISIS, stopping the spread of Iran’s influence, protecting US allies in the region and trying to end the Syrian civil war. If the US does definitively abandon the policy of requiring Assad’s departure    a position articulated by the Obama administration    it would put its policy closer in line with Russia, which supports Assad, and at odds with allies in Europe and in Turkey, where Tillerson downplayed frictions that are already straining that alliance.
