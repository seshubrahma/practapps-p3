" Oakland County leads Michigan in refugees resettlement and Michigan leads the nation, so we are right in the middle of this fight," Patterson added. More than 1, 000 of the 4, 000 refugees resettled in Michigan in FY 2016 were placed in Oakland County, an affluent suburban Detroit county with a population of 1. 2 million. According to the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration interactive website, 465 of the 1, 321 Syrian refugees resettled in Michigan in FY 2016 have been resettled in Oakland County.
