The Security Cabinet on Thursday also advanced plans to construct 2, 000 homes inside existing settlements. These homes are part of a plan approved two months ago to grow settlements by more than 5, 500 homes. The plan was approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government shortly after US President Donald Trump took office. PLO Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi immediately blasted the announcements.
