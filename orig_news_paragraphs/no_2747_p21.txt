Exxon has various joint ventures around Russia with the   oil giant Rosneft, and has contributed to social programs in education and health. Western sanctions prohibiting certain energy development activities have posed a hurdle to Exxonâ€™s investments in Russia, particularly a joint venture with Rosneft that was supposed to start drilling for oil in 2014 in the Kara Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean. Mr. Tillerson has spoken out against sanctions in part because the company is unable to collect revenues from an investment in an oil and gas consortium to which Exxon belongs that operates off Sakhalin Island.
