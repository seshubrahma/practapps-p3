Some mayors and governors have said they intend to carry on with the agreement in their cities.   But now, some of those liberal enclaves are expressing their support for the accord by turning their buildings green as a sign of their environmentalism. In New York City, Boston and Washington D. C. buildings turned green at the behest of the citiesâ€™ liberal politicians. City Hall shines green tonight because New York City will honor the goals of the #ParisAgreement.
