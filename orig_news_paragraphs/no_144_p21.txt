Unusually, only one member of the Volkswagen management board attended the North American International Auto Show, a major industry event that is underway in Detroit. Herbert Diess, head of the unit that produces Volkswagen brand cars, who joined the company shortly before the scandal came to light, was the highest ranking company executive in Detroit. Volkswagen said in a statement that the smaller presence was the result of "a critical assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness" of its car show activities. Volkswagen had hoped to use the Detroit auto show to reconnect with American consumers.
