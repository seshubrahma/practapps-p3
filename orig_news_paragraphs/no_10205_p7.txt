For his part, Zogby, one of the leading advocates of the   BDS movement in the U. S. has equated the "plight of the Palestinians" with the Holocaust. This comparison is grossly offensive to the memory of the millions of innocent people murdered by the Nazis and reveals a willful ignorance of history, blinded by hatred of Israel. These are the people who will be writing the platform for the Democratic Party. What hope does Israel have of receiving fair treatment in such an environment?
