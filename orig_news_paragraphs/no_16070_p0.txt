 (CNN) Rep. Chris Collins,   York, said Tuesday he agrees with FBI Director James Comey’s decision to not recommend charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server at the State Department. Collins, the first member of Congress to back Donald Trump, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" that on the FBI’s decision, he agrees with Comey    not Trump.    "Director Comey is one of the better appointments that President Obama has made and I accept what he said that while her actions may not have been intended, it shows extremely poor judgment," Collins said.
