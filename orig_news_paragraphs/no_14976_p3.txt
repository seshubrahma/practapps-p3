" Watts himself became the target of a cyberattack in 2015 after a post he wrote about the research, which prompted the FBI to notify his organization, the Foreign Policy Research Institute, about the attack, he said during his testimony. Since then, Watts and his colleagues have "watched and tracked the rise of Russiaâ€™s social media influence operations witnessing their update of an old Soviet playbook known as Active Measures," he added. He now works as a consultant and does training and research programs for a range of military, intelligence and law enforcement entities, his biography said.
