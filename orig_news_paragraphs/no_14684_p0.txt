Washington (CNN) Capitol Hill has been dominated Thursday by a disagreement over what, if any, steps Attorney General Jeff Sessions should take after it surfaced that he spoke with the Russian ambassador to the US during last yearâ€™s campaign. Sessions, a top surrogate at the time for Donald Trump, did not disclose the private meetings in his confirmation hearings in January. Many Democrats are calling for Sessions to outright resign.
