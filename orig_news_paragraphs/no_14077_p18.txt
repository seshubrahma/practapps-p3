Throughout his campaign, the president blasted the Obama administration for being too timid against international security threats.   He criticized the administration for refusing to take forceful action when terrorists struck and for not doing enough in Syria to put down the ISIS forces fighting against the Assad regime. All eyes are now on the White House to see whether the president employs military force to respond to these security concerns. He will reverse much of what Obama has accomplished by putting diplomacy and international alliances front and center.
