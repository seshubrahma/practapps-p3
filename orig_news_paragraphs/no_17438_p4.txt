US abstains as UN demands end to Israeli settlements, The United States on Friday allowed a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction to be adopted, defying significant pressure from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu â€™s government in alliance with   Donald Trump. The Security Council approved the resolution with 14 votes, with the US abstaining. Trump soon after tweeted, "things will be different after Jan. 20th," and on Friday, a senior Trump transition official told CNN the transition team was "all hands on deck" in working to kill the UN resolution.
