Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been restored after it was destroyed in a   attack last month   —   and according to one report, the star is getting    protection to prevent further vandalism. [Law enforcement sources told TMZ this week that two Los Angeles Police Department officers and at least one vehicle will patrol the area around Trump’s star 24 hours a day, in what the outlet described as a "Secret Service" level of protection.   In addition, a security camera will reportedly be trained on the star at all hours, and private security guards working nearby will also keep an eye out.
