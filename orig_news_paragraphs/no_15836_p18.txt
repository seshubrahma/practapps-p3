Achin District is the primary base of operations for ISIS in Afghanistan and has been the site of multiple joint   counterterrorism missions. A US Army Special Forces soldier was killed fighting the terrorist group there in early April.   The district is also where the United States dropped one of its most powerful bombs, killing close to 100 ISIS fighters, according to Afghan officials. Beginning in 2016, Afghan security forces backed by US military advisers launched a major offensive against ISIS.
