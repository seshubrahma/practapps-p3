Trump’s dislike of being lampooned is so sincere that even his own family is apparently aware of it. Over the weekend a comedian friend of mine, Mo Amer, found himself seated next to the  ’s son, Eric, on a long flight.   During their conversation, Amer mentioned that he’s the opening act for Dave Chappelle’s comedy tours, which caused Eric to reportedly comment that he hoped Chappelle would "take it easy" on his father. Amer responded the same way any comedian would, by telling Eric that comedians will not "take it easy" on a President Trump, just like we wouldn’t take it easy on any president.
