I’ve lost a good friend (I think) as I have not heard from him since he was jolted by the   punch of Trump’s victory and my decision to join Breitbart. Even my own dear sisters, one of whom campaigned for Barack Obama in 2008, had to retreat to their own respective safe spaces for awhile after November 8. They still love me, so that’s a hopeful sign for humanity that there’s still something thicker than politics. But the obstacles facing California’s Trump supporters, conservatives, or just anyone opposed to the Democratic agenda are no joke.
