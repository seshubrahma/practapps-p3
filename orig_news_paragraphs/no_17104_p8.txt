Pompeo met with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Pence, the leader of Trump’s transition, at the Capitol Thursday. He declined to comment on their meeting as he left.   The Kansas Republican becomes the first member of the House tapped by Trump, although Republican Reps. Jeb Hensarling and Tom Price both met with the   this week and are being mentioned for other Cabinet positions. One of Pompeo’s close friends and mentors on Capitol Hill was Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence panel.
