Jason Chaffetz, the Republican congressman whose district includes the new monument, castigated the president on Wednesday for "[politicizing] a   conflict. " " The midnight monument is a slap in the face to the people of Utah, attempting to silence the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes," he said. He promised to try to undo the monument however he could.
