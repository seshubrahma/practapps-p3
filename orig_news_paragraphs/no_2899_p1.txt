For months now, reporters have noted that Ms. Trump, who grew up in the small Slovenian town of Sevnica, did not obtain an undergraduate degree in architecture from the University of Ljubljana, as her professional website claimed she did. Instead, she left after her first year to pursue a modeling career in Milan. As recently as a week ago, Ms. Trumpâ€™s website stated that she had obtained a degree before going on to become a philanthropist and skin care entrepreneur. On Wednesday, The Huffington Post noticed that the site had been entirely scrubbed of its content.
