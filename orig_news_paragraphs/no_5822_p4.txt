Moore’s calendar features a wide variety of upcoming   demonstrations, including those planned for President’s Day on Monday, in what opponents of the president are calling the "Not My President’s Day" protests. Users are encouraged to submit their own events for addition to the calendar, and can spread the word about demonstrations using social media. In a   Facebook post, Moore said he hoped the calendar would help energize the "already MASSIVE resistance to Trump, to the Republican Congress, and, yes, to many of the spineless Democratic politicians out there.
