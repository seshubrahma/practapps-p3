[Former Alaska Governor Palin spoke of the growing "movement" that picked Donald Trump as their champion. Palin’s opening message before presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump addressed the Western Conservative Summit took aim at "the GOP wing of the good ol’ boys club" and their plans to "throw in for Hillary against the will of the people in their own primary" or "stay home instead of vote because their guy didn’t win this time around. "    "It doesn’t matter to the beltway bubble boys and girls which side actually wins elections as long as they get to keep their titles and their ratings and their power and their purses full, they win and we lose," explained Palin.
