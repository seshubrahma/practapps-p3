Saturday on CNNâ€™s "Smerconish," former Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Jennifer Lin recounted a telephone conversation she claimed to have had with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 1988, who took issue with one of her stories.   According to Lin, Trump unleashed an angry tirade on her and her boss at the time, Craig Stock. " Michael, I was working in the Wall Street office of the Philadelphia Inquirer and I got a phone call," Lin said.
