But in court filings, the Obama administration asked Judge Lamberth to reconsider, making two arguments: Preserving it would interfere with   branch relations, and giving a copy to the court was unnecessary in part because of Mr. Obama’s archived copy. It also suggested that the executive branch would appeal if the judge did not change his mind. On Thursday afternoon, Judge Lamberth refused, saying in a terse,   order that the court was "obliged" to protect Mr. Nashiri’s possible right to access the report and saying that nothing had changed since he issued the original, "crystal clear" order. He threatened to hold the executive branch in contempt if it did not comply, although he did not set a specific deadline.
