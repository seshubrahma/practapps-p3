The Obama administration â€™s economic projections were constructed by economist Christina Romer, the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Romer assumed GDP would grow by 3. 2 percent in the second year of the administration, followed by 4. 0 percent and then 4. 6 percent. As it turned out, growth never rose above 3 percent during the administration.
