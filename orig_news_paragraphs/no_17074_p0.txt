 (CNN) Anyone who is surprised at the appointment of   guru Steve Bannon as the Donald Trump administration’s chief strategist and counselor has been living in an alternate universe, the universe in which   Trump would "pivot" into something resembling a mainline GOP conservative.

Above all, they’ve forgotten the cardinal rule of Trumpworld: attachment to profit and the Trump brand is a means of increasing influence and power over others.
