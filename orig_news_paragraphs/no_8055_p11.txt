By contrast, Trump has had no organization to speak of in California, only hiring a staff person a couple of weeks ago. He is still trying to fill out a delegate slate, and seems to hope he can finesse California with a   campaign. (And of course there really is no Kasich campaign here at all, unless you count an endorsement from Arnold Schwarzenegger.)
