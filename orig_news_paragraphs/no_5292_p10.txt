Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike’s experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia’s answer to the CIA and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence. Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald     former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike’s president of services.
