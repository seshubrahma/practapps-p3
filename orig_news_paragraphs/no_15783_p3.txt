Comey speaks, Axed FBI Director James Comey will break his silence on Thursday in sworn testimony before the Senate intelligence committee to address his firing and allegations that Trump asked him to kill the federal investigation into his former national security adviser, putting the Russia controversy that has hampered the GOP agenda front and center once again. White House officials and the President’s allies on the outside have begun crafting a plan to counter the Thursday testimony, but those efforts so far appear jumbled. As Trump embarked on the   of his first foreign trip, senior White House officials began crafting plans to create a war   structure to get a grip on the incessant salvo of   blockbusters.   But just two days before Comey’s testimony, that war room has yet to materialize and multiple sources said its creation is effectively on hold until Trump fleshes out his legal team to represent him on the matter with a DC counsel to work with New   attorney Marc Kasowitz.
