Justice will be served, but justice is small solace for the families left behind. We mourn for the families of the fallen, for the law enforcement community and for our nation. Respect for our law enforcement officers must be restored in our nation. The badge every officer wears over his or her heart is a reminder of a sacred trust, a commitment, a contract with each of us.
