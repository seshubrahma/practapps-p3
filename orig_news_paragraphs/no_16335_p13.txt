The Washington Post reported that the tape Trump had seen was included in a Fox News report about the $400 million transfer on Wednesday, but that the executive jet displayed appeared to be in Geneva that day, not Iran, and did not show the transfer of cash. Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not return requests for comment on the video. The billionaire has frustrated Republicans in recent days with the lack of discipline at his campaign appearances and may have again stepped on his message by talking about a tape rather than the wider issue of why the United States was sending millions of dollars to its longtime foe. The Obama administration has repeatedly rejected GOP accusations that the cash    part of a $1. 7 billion agreement to settle a   arms deal dispute    was meant to grease the release of four US prisoners who were freed in January when Tehran implemented a landmark nuclear deal.
