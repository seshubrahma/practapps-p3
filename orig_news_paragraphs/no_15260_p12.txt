Several GOP governors in states that expanded Medicaid to   adults were pushing representatives to revise these provisions in the House bill. Another concern is the estimate that millions of people would lose their health care coverage as a result of the bill. The Congressional Budget Office projected that 24 million fewer people would be covered under an early version of the Republican bill, which did not include later changes to insurance reforms.   Moderates are also cognizant that many of their older constituents would not be happy with the bill, which allows insurers to charge higher premiums to those in their 50s and early 60s.
