" There was an agreement between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort to provide investment consulting services related to business interests of Mr. Deripaska which now is a subject to legal claims," the spokesman said in a statement. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that Manafort pitched a plan to Deripaska to "greatly benefit the Putin government" and was subsequently paid millions of dollars, according to business records obtained by the AP and interviews the news outlet conducted with sources familiar with the matter. It is just the latest report pointing to a link between Manafort and Russian interests.
