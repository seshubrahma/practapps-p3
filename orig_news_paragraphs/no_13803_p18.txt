Trump also provided more detail about his bid to reduce the costs of the new Air Force One. He said that when he met with US military brass following the election, they informed him that a new aircraft would cost in the $4 billion range  —   a price he deemed unacceptable. Trump had made the claim previously, though hadn’t identified where the price figures came from. US officials, including at the White House, have suggested the $4 billion is inflated.
