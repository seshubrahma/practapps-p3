Industries that employ immigrants and people of color must become more active in civic society and raise their voices against discriminatory policies that affect their employees and families, as many technology companies did in response to the Muslim ban.   All Americans must play a role, whether this means intervening when peers use racist and xenophobic language, reaching out to neighbors and   from different backgrounds, or demanding inclusive and equitable policies from school boards and city councils. These are the actions that will go much further than mere words to curb hate violence.
