In 1987, for example, a joint committee uncovered the ways in which top members of President Reaganâ€™s administration used the money from arms sales to Iran to finance the Nicaraguan Contras, despite a congressional ban on doing so. Congress, of course, reserves the power to impeach the president, and it has exercised that power several times in US history, most recently with President Bill Clinton. Even though the Republicans control Congress, the congressional minority still has a bully pulpit and can exert pressure on the GOP to deal with issues that emerge. They will have to show the same kind of tough stance that Republicans adopted between 2007 and 2011, when they were in the minority.
