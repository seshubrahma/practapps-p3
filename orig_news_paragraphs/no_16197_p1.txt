Trump has climbed four points in the market since the first day of the RNC Clinton was at 71% while Trump was at 27% at the beginning of the week. CNN’s Political Prediction Market is an online game, administered by a company called Pivit, that functions like an online market and allows Internet users to predict the outcome of the 2016 election. It is not to be confused with polls from real voters. At no point in the last two months have Trump’s odds been higher than Clinton’s, although her odds are nowhere near their   high.
