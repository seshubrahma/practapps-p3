 (CNN) President Donald Trump further reorganized the National Security Council on Monday after he came under sharp criticism for ousting the countryâ€™s most senior intelligence and military officials as regular members of the Principals Committee    and installing one of his top political advisers on the key panel. On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer announced that Trump will reinstate the director of the CIA as a regular Principals Committee member. But the President will keep his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, as a regular committee member    a move that came under fire    while the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will not be regular attendees.
