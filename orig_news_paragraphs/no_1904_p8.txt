Mr. Giuliani had rules about keeping his remarks private, as a contract "addendum" to which organizations that invited him to speak had to agree makes clear. Mr. Giuliani stipulated that his remarks could not be recorded, nor could "general press or other media coverage" of the remarks be allowed without his explicit permission. He also had some elaborate demands, including that if he traveled by private plane, it be a Gulfstream IV or bigger, a plane that costs about $40, 000 for a   trip within the United States. Some members of the Senate, which will hold hearings and vote on his nomination if Mr. Trump selects him, are already saying they want to learn more about Mr. Giulianiâ€™s work in the years since he left City Hall.
