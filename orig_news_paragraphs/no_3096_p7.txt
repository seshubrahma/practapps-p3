Gest responded to Breitbart ’s questions by doubling down, saying immigrants can replace American consumers, workers, and children, and also that expert advice will soothe American communities during their   exit: Declining towns need immigrants to reinvigorate their markets, take on unwanted labor positions, and add youth to aging demographies. Once these communities understood the benefits immigrants bring and were consulted about the terms of their integration, they would feel more comfortable with their arrival. Breitbart asked if Americans’ communities can be strengthened by   curbs on immigration or trade, but Gest, a strong advocate for globalism, offered only a series of additional government programs to offset the current   policies of cheap labor and cheap imports.
