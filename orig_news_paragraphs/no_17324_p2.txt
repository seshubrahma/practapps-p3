A Tillerson nomination would also exacerbate concerns about the level of formal foreign policy experience in Trump’s outsider administration. On the other hand, he’s arguably better acquainted with world leaders than a potential pick for the secretary of state job who has spent decades toiling in traditional,   diplomatic posts. Any attempt to block Tillerson would ally Democrats critical of his Big Oil worldview and potential conflicts of interests with Republican Russia hawks with the stature to defy the nascent administration. For John McCain, who branded the Russian leader a "thug and a murderer" in a CNN interview Saturday, Tillerson’s cordial ties with Putin, whom the Arizona Senator considers a US enemy, are a red flag.
