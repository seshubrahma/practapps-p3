WASHINGTON   —    Documents released Monday in the Hillary Clinton email investigation show intense disagreement last year between the State Department and the F. B. I. over whether some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails should be considered classified, including a discussion of a possible "quid pro quo" to settle one dispute. The new batch of documents indicated that in one particular case, a senior State Department official, Patrick F. Kennedy, pressed the F. B. I. to agree that one of Mrs. Clinton’s emails on the 2012 Benghazi attack would be unclassified
