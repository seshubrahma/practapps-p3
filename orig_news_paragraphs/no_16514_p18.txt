GOP State Party Chairman Rob Gleason said he thinks the candidates "will help each other" and that it all comes down to "a tale of two Pennsylvanias"    his way of describing the disparate nature of the stateâ€™s electorate. Poll: Clinton has comfortable lead in Pennsylvania, Gleason believes Trump could give Toomey a boost in the northeastern and central parts of the state, areas where the nominee is currently polling far ahead of Hillary Clinton 58% to 28% in a new Monmouth poll. But, Gleason says he sees Toomey with an advantage in the Philadelphia area and in the Lehigh Valley    where Republican Congressman Charlie Dent has already said he has "no plans" to vote for Trump.
