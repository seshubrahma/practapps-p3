In general, a more diverse pool of undecided voters helps the candidate in the lead, since it makes them less likely to break one way. There is mainly upside for Mrs. Clinton among the disaffected young idealists, who are unlikely to break for Mr. Trump but who could be lured back to her from a   candidate or from the ranks of the undecided. Mrs. Clinton’s weakness among young voters is undermining what many assumed would be her biggest strength against Mr. Trump: Hispanic and black voters. Nonwhite voters are disproportionately young, and her weakness among young voters is a major reason Mrs. Clinton is not quite matching Mr. Obama’s margin among nonwhite voters in national surveys despite Mr. Trump’s appeal to racial and ethnic resentment.
