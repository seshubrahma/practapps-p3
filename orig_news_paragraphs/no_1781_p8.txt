Their stories echoed a 2005 recording on which Mr. Trump boasts of being able to sexually assault women because of his celebrity. Other news organizations, including The Palm Beach Post, BuzzFeed and People magazine, also reported on women who had troubling encounters with Mr. Trump, who said at the debate Sunday that he had never acted on his "locker room talk" in the 2005 recording. In a series of messages posted on Twitter on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump called the Times article a "total fabrication" and denied charges by the People magazine writer, Natasha Stoynoff, that he had forced his tongue down her throat while she was working on an assignment about his first anniversary with his wife, Melania. But at his rallies in West Palm Beach and later in Cincinnati, Mr. Trump also unveiled a new campaign strategy, beseeching his supporters to view him as a political martyr for their cause and stick by him in the face of ugly accusations about his personal conduct.
