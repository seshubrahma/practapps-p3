The Center Party had been kept at arm’s length because of its alleged links to Moscow, but has recently sought to recast itself as a mainstream force that supports NATO and recent decisions by the alliance to establish battalions of 800 to 1, 200 troops in each of the three Baltic states and in Poland. The stationing of these NATO troops in their country had been strongly opposed by many   Estonians, who, echoing a view promoted by   Russian news media, see it as a needless provocation of Russia. Vladimir Petrov, the chairman of the Union of Russian Citizens, a group in Narva that lobbies on behalf of Russians living in Estonia, said it was "laughable" to think that Moscow had any interest in attacking Estonia, so there was "absolutely no need" for NATO troops. Moreover, he added, a few hundred British and other NATO soldiers will hardly stop Russia’s military.
