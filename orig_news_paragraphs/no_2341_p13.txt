The law enforcement authorities point to a rising number of increasingly splintered gangs on the city’s South and West Sides, as well as an abundance of guns and what they view as weak penalties for gun violations. Community leaders identify more profound roots for the violence, including disinvestment in neighborhoods, poverty and unemployment. Last week, Chicago officials announced efforts to try to slow the violence, including the addition of nearly 1, 000 officers who are expected to join the Chicago Police Department, which is already the nation’s   municipal police force. Relations between the Chicago police and residents have grown especially tense since late 2015 when city officials made public a video showing a police officer shooting Laquan McDonald, an   teenager, 16 times.
