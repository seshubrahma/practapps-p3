In ordinary years, this is no swing district. Former Rep. Tom Price    whose departure to become Trumpâ€™s health and human services secretary opened the seat up    won by at least 23 percentage points every time he was on the ballot since 2004. Mitt Romney carried the district by 23 points in 2012.   The only reason Democrats have even an inkling it could be competitive is that Trump collapsed here, besting Hillary Clinton by just 1. 5 points last fall.
