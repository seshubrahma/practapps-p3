Those are serious allegations that the former administration is likely going to have to explain to Congress. But if the Obama administration did order surveillance of the Trump campaign during the election and if Obama or any other White House officials knew about it (or created a "plausible deniability" scheme to allow such surveillance while preventing themselves from knowing about it directly) then there is an even bigger problem. It would then seem that the "Russia hacking" story was concocted not just to explain away an embarrassing election defeat, but to cover up the real scandal. Joel B.
