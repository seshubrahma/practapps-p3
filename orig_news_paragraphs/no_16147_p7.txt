At the crucial moments, when Trump was narrowing in on his choice of a vice presidential pick, his family was by his side. And sources say they may have convinced him to go with Pence rather than making a "gut" level call to choose Christie or Gingrich.

They were worried that their father was torn and unsure about what to do and was maybe leaning in a direction they didn’t favor.
