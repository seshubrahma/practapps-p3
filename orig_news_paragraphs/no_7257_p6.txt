If Mrs. Clinton wins, Bill and Chelsea Clinton should both end their operational involvement in the foundation and its affiliates for the duration of her presidency, relinquishing any control over spending, hiring and board appointments. The Boston Globe declared Aug. 16 that the foundation should be shuttered. Although the charity founded by former President Bill Clinton has done admirable work over the last 15 years, the Clinton Foundation is also clearly a liability for Hillary Clinton as she seeks the presidency. The     first family will have plenty to keep them busy next year if Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump in November.
