The president played 55 rounds of golf last, according to Mark Knoller of CBS. Obama remains on pace to complete more than 300 rounds for his presidency when he leaves office early next year. Critics complain that the president engages in his favorite recreational pastime when various problems emerge, such as when he played two rounds of golf during a holiday weekend this fall as the Syrian refugee crisis reached a boiling point. But Trump seems fine that Obama plays if not with whom he plays.
