Mr. Cruz put $6, 000 into the firm, and ultimately left with $25, 000 in cash and a $75, 000 promissory note from Mr. Panton that Mr. Cruz had never cashed in. In 2013, Time magazine revealed the venture and noted that Mr. Cruz had failed to disclose the profit on two years of Senate ethics forms. Mr. Cruz called it an oversight. Days before the Iowa caucuses this year, The Washington Post published an unflattering report on the   Caribbean investment fund Mr. Panton founded with Mr. Cruz.
