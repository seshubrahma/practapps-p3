The Left’s attempt to crack down on your freedom of speech is hardly limited to college campuses. In Europe, without the Constitution’s protections, you can be arrested for quoting Churchill or writing a poem about a foreign leader. Already here in America, Democrats are kicking in the doors of political opponents, jailing those who do not believe in gay marriage, and most recently subpoenaing think tanks for climate change apostasy. Donald Trump is now all that stands between you and a Hillary   justice who would create a Supreme Court majority of "Interpretivists," the legal school of thought reacting against the Court’s restrictions on the New Deal which teaches that the Constitution means whatever Leftists believe it should.
