Cleveland (CNN) Ivanka Trump pitched her father, Donald Trump, to the nation’s female voters Thursday night, revealing a softer side of the billionaire businessman in a way that almost no other convention speaker has done so far. His    daughter regaled the crowd with childhood stories about Legos and his favorite adages, rounding out the image of the sometimes   politician that’s emerged over the campaign. And in the     speech, she made a direct appeal to women, who are breaking in polls for rival Hillary Clinton.
