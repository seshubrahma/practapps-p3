Neil Gorsuch was sworn in as the 113th justice of the Supreme Court of the United States just after 11am Monday at the White House’s Rose Garden. [Justice Anthony Kennedy, under whom Gorsuch clerked upon graduating law school more than two decades ago, administered the oath of office to   Gorsuch, until now a judge of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Gorsuch’s ascendance will give the Supreme Court its full compliment of nine justices for the first time since Justice Antonin Scalia, a pole of the Court’s conservative wing, passed away last February.   In attendance were President Donald Trump, other top administration officials, and all eight sitting justices of the Supreme Court.
