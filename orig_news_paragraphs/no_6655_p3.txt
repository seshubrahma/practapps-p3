The Bachelor led all network programs Monday night with an average of 6. 6 million viewers and a 2. 2 rating in the key demo. The premiere of the   Apprentice  —   which features celebrity contestants including Boy George, Jon Lovitz, WNBA star Lisa Leslie and Jersey Shore alum Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi  —   drew mostly poor reviews. In his review of the   first episode, New York Times television critic Mike Hale wrote that Schwarzenegger’s "cautiousness and rigidity make him a poor fit" for the show.
