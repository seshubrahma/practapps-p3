Trump signed the executive orders in the Oval Office after swearing in Attorney General Jeff Sessions. One of the orders, aimed at "reduc( ing) crime and restor( ing) public safety," directs Sessions to establish a new Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety. The Task Force will develop "strategies to reduce crime, including, in particular, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and violent crime," propose new legislation, and submit at least one report to the President within the next year. A second executive order, aimed at combating transnational drug cartels, prescribes steps for various federal agencies to "increase intelligence" sharing among law enforcement partners.
