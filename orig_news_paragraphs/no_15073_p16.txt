Obama, who has commuted the sentences of 1, 000 inmates to date    more than the past 11 presidents combined, made criminal justice reform more of a focus during his second term in office, promoting new initiatives to rehabilitate former prison inmates, commuting sentences of   drug offenders and becoming the first sitting president to visit a federal prison.   Jeezy told CNN in November 2015 that while he would have "gone much further" on issues like criminal justice reform, Obama’s efforts are "better late than never." "I think that’s a great gesture by Obama . .. and that’s the beginning of some type of slight change," he added.
