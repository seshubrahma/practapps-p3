In the 2012 cycle, several candidates with a penchant for making headlines with their controversial claims    such as businessman Herman Cain and former Rep. Michele Bachmann and even Trump himself (though not an official candidate)    also garnered top spots in early polls only to crash to Earth as the campaign dragged on. Trump, as well, is a deeply polarizing figure in the Granite State     49% of respondents said they had an unfavorable opinion of him, while only 37% viewed him positively. Despite New Hampshire Republicansâ€™ negative impressions of Trump, few want to see him left off the debate stage in August.
