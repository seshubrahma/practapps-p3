February 15, 2017,   Puzder was expected to face a nomination hearing Thursday, Feb. 16, at the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, where at least three of 12 Republicans have announced they have yet to decide if they will support or oppose Puzder. The committee has 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so any loss of support means that the nominee would be rejected by the oversight committee. If Puzder is rejected by the committee, top GOP leaders can still hold a floor vote in the full Senate for Puzder, but he’s unlikely to win that vote.
