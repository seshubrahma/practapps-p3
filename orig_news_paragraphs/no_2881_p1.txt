An intense manhunt is on across Europe for a young Tunisian man whose identity card was in the truck that rammed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, Germany’s worst terrorist attack in decades. The authorities said they had been watching him on suspicion of plotting an attack and almost deported him in June. The attack has rendered Chancellor Angela Merkel, the prime defender of the European Union and one of the bloc ’s last bulwarks against   populism, even more vulnerable as national elections approach in 2017.
