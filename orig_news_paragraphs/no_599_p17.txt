In the past year, the Mexican government has made a number of improvements to its asylum system, including increasing its staff and modifying the screening process to ensure that eligible migrants have a chance to apply, officials said. The Mexican authorities have also begun releasing asylum seekers from detention while they await the resolution of their cases, a process that often takes three or more months, and have improved applicantsâ€™ access to humanitarian aid and psychological and legal counseling, advocates said. " The Mexican government has recognized that this is increasingly a refugee situation," said Mark Manly, the Mexico representative for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
