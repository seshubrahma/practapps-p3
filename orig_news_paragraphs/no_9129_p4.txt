Who paid for the travel of Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and six siblings, from Dallas, Texas to Columbus, Ohio on June 28, 2014? It is not surprising that the Artan family would want to resettle in Columbus, Ohio, which has the second largest Somali community in the United States, estimated to be about 45, 000 in total. (Minneapolis, Minnesota, has the largest Somali community in the country, estimated to be around 70, 000 in total.) It is surprising, however, that a   family of eight Somali refugees without any known resources would have the funds to travel from Dallas, Texas to Columbus, Ohio.
