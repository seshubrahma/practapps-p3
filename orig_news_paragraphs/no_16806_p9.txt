I haven’t heard major disagreements that she’s had with Secretary Clinton so who’s going to step up for the people of New Hampshire?"   Since Trump launched his campaign last summer, he called some Mexicans "rapists" during his announcement speech, said Sen. John McCain isn’t a "war hero" because he was captured, proposed a temporary Muslim ban, mocked a disabled reporter during a campaign rally, repeatedly made harsh comments about women, and attacked the Khans, a Gold Star family, for their comments at the Democratic National Convention. And at a rally in Pennsylvania this weekend, Trump hit Clinton on her "stamina," said that Clinton is not "loyal" to her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and called her an "incompetent" and "sarcastic woman."   In the past, Ayotte has been heavily critical on Trump’s controversies, including his attacks against the Khan family.
