Vandals have drawn large "X"es, a mute button, and at one point, a swastika over the star, but this is the first instance in which the star has been outright destroyed. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce previously refused to consider activists’ pleas to remove Trump’s star from the Walk, with CEO Leron Gubler telling Breitbart News last year that once a Star is added, "it is considered a part of the historic fabric" of the landmark. The Chamber of Commerce has never removed a star from the Walk. In a statement to Deadline Wednesday, Gubler said that he hoped the perpetrator "would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark. "
