WASHINGTON   —    Giants in telecommunications, like Verizon and ATT, will not have to take "reasonable measures" to ensure that their customers’ Social Security numbers, web browsing history and other personal information are not stolen or accidentally released. Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will not be punished, at least for now, for not collecting extra money from customers to cover potential losses from certain kinds of   trades that helped unleash the 2008 financial crisis.
