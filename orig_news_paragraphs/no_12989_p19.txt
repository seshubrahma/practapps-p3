" We look forward to working with Twitter to make presidential debates more accessible to millions of Filipinos, and on a larger scale to increase voter participation and political transparency throughout the Philippine presidential elections," Bautista told a press briefing.    As the Comelecâ€™s partner, Jaitly said Twitter will be providing premium inside data and visualizations that help represent the pulse of the country, the pulse of viewers with respect to what is top of mind, with respect to audience during the debate. Twitter wants to become the de facto, worldwide platform for politicians to reach the masses, usurping broadcast media.
