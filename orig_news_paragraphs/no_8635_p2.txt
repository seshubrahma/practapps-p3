While in Los Angeles this month, Clinton will also attend a dinner fundraiser at the Beverly Hills home of billionaire entertainment mogul and Democratic Party   Haim and Cheryl Saban. The guest list for the August 22 event is said to include Disney CEO Bob Iger, outgoing DreamWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, superagent Casey Wasserman and producer Jon Vein. Saban and Wasserman supported Clinton in her 2008 primary battle against Barack Obama. But Katzenberg was one of Obamaâ€™s top Hollywood bundlers, raising more than $6 million for him between 2008 and 2012.
