This story is false. The president only discussed the common threats that both countries faced," added Dina Powell, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, who also attended the meeting. The current and former officials told the Post that Trump shared information with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak that was obtained by a U. S. partner through an   agreement and was so sensitive it was withheld from U. S. allies and restricted within the U. S. government. The officials said Trumpâ€™s disclosure risked cooperation from an ally that had access to the inner workings of the Islamic State, which they then shared details of with the Post.
