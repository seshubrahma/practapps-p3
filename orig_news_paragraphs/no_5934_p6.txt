In early March,   asked the teenage girl â€™s mother to meet him at a bank so that he could give her some money they had been arguing over. The mother, identified in court records as "O," left Delgado and her baby at home while she went to meet him at the bank. Instead of meeting "O" at the bank,   went to the house and shot the   pregnant girl twice, killing her and her unborn child.
