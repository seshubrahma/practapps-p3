" As weâ€™ve made clear, the negotiations over the settlement of an outstanding claim at The Hague Tribunal were completely separate from the discussions about returning our American citizens home," State Department Spokesman John Kirby said, referring to the $1. 7 billion payout that the $400 cast installment was part of. " Not only were (the) two negotiations separate, they were conducted by different teams on each side, including, in the case of the Hague claims, by technical experts involved in these negotiations for many years," he said.
