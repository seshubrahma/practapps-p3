the rush by a bevy of   Republicans to denounce him over the   locker   banter —  comes as Trump stays strong in the polls and prepares for the next debate on Sunday night in St. Louis, Missouri. Meanwhile, WikiLeaks just dropped a bombshell on Clinton’s campaign —  more two thousand emails from Podesta, which include scores of controversial remarks she made in private paid speeches before   crowds —  but ironically the Chamber of Commerce’s national political director Rob Engstrom called for Trump to drop out of the race and give the GOP nomination to his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Trump should step down immediately tonight, yielding to Governor Pence as the GOP Nominee.   —   Rob Engstrom (@RobEngstrom) October 8, 2016,
