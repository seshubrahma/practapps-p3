Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold, Arizona Senator John McCain, Texas Senator John Cornyn, Arkansas Rep. French Hill, and even Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump are all on the long list of leaders who recognize the importance of reaching to actual Border Patrol agents through the NBPC. Texas grassroots Tea Party leaders even brought Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza from Laredo to speak to the Texas Senate on border security, a service he could only perform due to his role in the NBPC. Still, say Border Patrol agents, Senator Cruz has never reached out to them or even returned their repeated calls to him. Catherine Frazier, a spokesperson for Senator Cruz, disputes this claim.
