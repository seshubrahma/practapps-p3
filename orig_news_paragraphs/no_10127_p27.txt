As William Jacobson reported at Legal Insurrection in May 2012: We now know (again last night after The Globe found documents) that Warren was listed for the   academic year as Native American in Harvard Law federal filings. We now know that all these federal filings were false. There is no evidence that Elizabeth Warren is Native American, and substantial evidence she is not. Making a false federal filing potentially was a crime.
