America’s main interest overseas is in maintaining liberal (small "l") systems of trade, investment and navigation that allow American companies to flourish, and in spreading associated values of liberal (small "l") democracy that help keep the peace. Russia’s main foreign policy interest is to overcome the geographic disadvantage of largely being cut off from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans by maintaining a network of client states with better access to either. The liberal international order that the U. S. seeks to advance often threatens Russia’s privileged relationship with those states. In addition, the Russian government uses an aggressive foreign policy to bolster its domestic priorities.
