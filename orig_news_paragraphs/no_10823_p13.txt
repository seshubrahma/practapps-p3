In 1896, the Socialist Labor Party was gaining significant political strength, mainly sapping votes from the Democrats. So the Democratic Party nominated populist William Jennings Bryan, who moved the party to the left. Gov. William McKinley of Ohio sensed an opening, and the Republican nominee positioned the GOP as a mainstream   party. The result was an electoral massacre of the Democrats, as Republicans solidified control of the U. S. House, U. S. Senate, and many state governments.
