Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s   immigration plan, revealed in his immigration speech in Arizona on Wednesday evening, includes one of the issues that first propelled his campaign: the passage of a "Kate’s Law," named for a young California woman who was killed at the hands of a   deported illegal alien. [On July 1 of last year, the illegal alien  —   who had also been convicted of seven felonies  —   shot and killed    Kate Steinle while she was walking at a San Francisco pier with her father.   Trump said in his immigration speech Wednesday: Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300, 000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn’t have been politically correct.
