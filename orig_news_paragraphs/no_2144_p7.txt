A   between the Syrian government and rebel groups tentatively took hold, with scattered reports of clashes, shelling and airstrikes. The truce, brokered by Russia and Turkey, was announced a day earlier and excludes the Islamic State and Al Qaedaâ€™s Syrian affiliate. Russia said seven opposition groups had signed the agreement, which calls for peace talks in Kazakhstan next month. The largest group of rebel fighters denied doing so.
