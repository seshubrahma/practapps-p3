And I shared a meal with Dawud Walid, the executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on   Relations. We ate and had deep talk about how Muslims are often heroes in the Black American community. And we also talked about how narratives of white supremacy often turn white Christians who kill people into "mentally disturbed people," but then turn Muslim people who kill people into terrorists. It was a lot to cover over lunch.
