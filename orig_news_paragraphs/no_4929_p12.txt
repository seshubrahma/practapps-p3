Carl Anderson of the Knights of Columbus said: We applaud the presidentâ€™s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. From his writings and his record it is clear that he will interpret the Constitution as it was written, including our first Amendment right to religious freedom, and the right to life of every person. Judge Gorsuch was confirmed without opposition to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006, and has received a "unanimously well qualified" rating from the American Bar Association. It is hard to imagine a better, and more qualified, candidate.
