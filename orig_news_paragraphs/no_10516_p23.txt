Clinton again slammed the state legislatures for choosing to build more prisons instead of providing more funding for universities so that students can reduce their loan debt. " The more you invest in higher education, the more prepared the work force will be," Clinton said, promising to let the federal government take on a greater role in funding college. Clinton also pushed her goal of achieving a National Service force of volunteers, much like a civilian National Reserve, and said that those who volunteer to serve will be granted student loan forgiveness.
