Stanley A. McChrystal and Gen. John R. Allen, and the Special Operations commander who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Adm. William H. McRaven.

S. custody," and they noted that waterboarding and other "enhanced interrogation techniques" are illegal under domestic and international law.
