Also on the   list, though in a more classical mode: Emma Stone, in     (pink was a trend) Valentino, metaphor obvious but still undeniably enchanting Brie Larson, in strapless red Rodarte with a draped and beaded bodice, matching lips and Veronica Lake hair Natalie Portman, in â€™  chartreuse Prada maternity gown, a little "Jackie," but not too much and Viola Davis in sunshine yellow   sequined Michael Kors, so bright she gave off her own light.
