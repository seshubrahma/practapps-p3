According to Blaine Harden, author of "The Great Leader and the Fighter Pilot," Kim Jong Un, like his father and grandfather before him, "(has) kept memories of the war and the bombing terrifyingly fresh. State media warn that, sooner or later, the Americans will strike again."   To this end, North Korea maintains a massive standing army of more than 1. 2 million soldiers, with millions more paramilitary troops and reservists, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). South Korea also maintains a high state of alert, with more than 500, 000 people in its armed forces, IISS says, plus the thousands of US troops deployed in the country.
