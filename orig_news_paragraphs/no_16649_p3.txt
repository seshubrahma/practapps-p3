And on Friday, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina    all states with competitive Senate races    joined the agreement, the RNC official said. Each state can accept $10, 000. Yet given the $2, 700 contribution limit to federal candidates, a heavy majority of the money raised by Trump Victory will not be directly managed by the Trump campaign. Large chunks of the $550, 000 go to RNC accounts that must be spent on overhead costs and cannot be spent on the presidential race.
