 (CNN) The US wrestling team won’t be able to compete in this month’s Freestyle World Cup in Iran because visas were denied to its members, the Iranian semiofficial Tasnim News Agency said Friday. Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said a special committee reviewed the case Friday and "eventually the visit by the USA freestyle wrestling team was opposed," according to the agency.   The denial comes after Iran announced it would take "reciprocal measures" toward US citizens following President Donald Trump’s order last week banning entry to nationals from seven   countries, including Iran, to the United States.
