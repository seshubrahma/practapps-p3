No presidential candidate whoâ€™s running to be president of the United States ought to be asking a foreign country, particularly Russia, to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts to try to determine what the Democratic candidate may or may not be doing," Panetta, a Clinton ally, said in an interview with Christiane Amanpour. " This just is beyond my own understanding of the responsibilities that candidates have to be loyal to their country and to their country alone, not to reach out to somebody like Putin and Russia, and try to engage them in an effort to try to, in effect, conduct a conspiracy against another party," he said. Panetta changed his convention speech in the afternoon to insert "a direct attack on Trump for his rhetoric suggesting that Russia meddle in the election," according to a source familiar with the subject.
