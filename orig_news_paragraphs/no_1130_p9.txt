The National Basketball Association, which relocated its most recent   Game to New Orleans to protest House Bill 2, did not reply to a request seeking comment. The Atlantic Coast Conference, which pulled recent league championships out of the state, indicated that it would take a fresh look at North Carolina. " The recently passed legislation allows the opportunity to reopen the discussion with the A. C. C. Council of Presidents regarding neutral site conference championships being held in the State of North Carolina," John Swofford, the commissioner, said.
