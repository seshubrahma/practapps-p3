The VICE special walks through a    look at the Breitbart News operation in Philadelphia, showcasing Breitbart’s live streaming team downtown in a suite at the Marriott across from City Hall —  where Breitbart focused on highlighting the protesters outside the convention —  to reporting on the street and live interviews. The special includes Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos as well.
