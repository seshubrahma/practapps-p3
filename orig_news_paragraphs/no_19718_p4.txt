Anyways, I don’t want to draw tidy parallels between the Cultural Revolution and America in 2016 because, obviously, so much does not run parallel. But in a time when voters have shown casual eagerness to blow up a system that isn’t working for them, at at time when Trump can ask, "What do you have to lose? , " @GPCR50 was a daily reminder by tweet of just how much we have to lose. We’ve had relative order and stability for so long.
