Nafta says that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice. But if President Trump did that, it would unleash disarray in major industries ruin the ability to have   negotiations with Canada and Mexico and most likely cause a legal showdown with Congress (which passed Nafta all those years ago and wouldn’t want it abrogated without a say). That doesn’t sound like what the Trump administration has cooked up. It’s more likely to reopen the deal.
