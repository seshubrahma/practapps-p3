May 3, 2017    Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey strongly defends his decision to alert Congress just days before the 2016 election about his agency’s investigation into emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton’s personal server, telling senators while the idea of impacting the election made him "mildly nauseous," he would not change what he did. May 9, 2017   President Trump fires Comey after his attorney general and deputy attorney general recommend his removal, due to his decision to recommend no charges be filed against Clinton and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning for it.
