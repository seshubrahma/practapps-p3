In a meeting with conservative leaders in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he anticipated the most trouble in the Senate, where moderate and conservative lawmakers are opposing the plan for different reasons. He said he was prepared to pressure holdout senators by holding the kind of   rallies he led during his presidential campaign. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said Republicans were "going through the inevitable growing pains of being an opposition party to becoming a governing party. "
