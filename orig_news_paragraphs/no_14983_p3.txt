Both sets of filings were made public as part of a White House release of financial disclosures of 180 White House officials. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said Flynn "had only just begun the financial disclosure filing process at the time he left the White House. " He filed a draft form  explicitly listing his speakers bureau contract, and he expected to engage in the usual process of consultations with the White House Counselâ€™s Office and OGE regarding what he was expected to disclose," Kelner said.
