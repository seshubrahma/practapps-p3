Manheim, Pennsylvania (CNN) Donald Trump on Saturday evening offered up the surest sign yet that he is returning to the bombastic,   style that defined his primary run as he wrapped up a week that raised fresh concerns about his presidential campaign’s viability. Straying from the prepared remarks on his teleprompter, the Republican nominee reignited his attacks on Hillary Clinton’s physical and mental health, arguing that the former secretary of state "could be crazy" and lacks the "stamina" to be president    even imitating Clinton stumbling into her car while leaving a   ceremony last month.   And just as he is once again drawing attention to former President Bill Clinton’s sex scandals, Trump took his political attacks a step further, questioning, with no evidence, whether the Democratic nominee is "loyal" to her husband.
