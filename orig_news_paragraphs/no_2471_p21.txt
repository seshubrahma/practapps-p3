Vociferous critics of his appointment, a diverse group that includes the conservative   host Glenn Beck and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who challenged Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have variously called Mr. Bannon a racist, a sexist, an   and an Islamophobe. Interviews with two dozen people who know him well, however, portray a man not easily labeled, capable of surprising both friends and enemies, with unshakable   and striking intensity. (Mr. Bannon turned down a request for an interview, saying he was too busy with the presidential transition.) Fans and foes agree that he is a "screamer," a volcanic personality who sometimes resorts to offensive or hyperbolic language.
