Haley’s proposal comes as President Donald Trump and other members of his administration    notably Secretary of State Rex Tillerson    have put less of a focus on human rights in dealings with world leaders when compared to past administrations, including President Barack Obama’s.   In a meeting at the White House on Monday, Trump told visiting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   that he had done "a fantastic job" despite criticisms of the leader’s undemocratic actions. " We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt," Trump said, speaking in the Oval Office with Sisi at his side.
