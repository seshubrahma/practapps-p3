A new poll by the Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) at UC Berkeley shows that a majority of registered voters in California want the stateâ€™s elected Democrats to work with President Donald Trump rather than to resist his agenda. [The poll reveals that "by a 53% to 47% margin, slightly more voters prefer that when state leaders disagree with the president they should try to work with him even if it means making compromises, rather than opposing him if it risks negative consequences and losses in federal funding. "    Voters prefer that Democrats work with Trump even though 61% disapprove of the job he is doing, according to the poll, which surveyed 1, 000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3. 6%.
