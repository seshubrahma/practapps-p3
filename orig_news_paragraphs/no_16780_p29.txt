I am a part of, namely women, people of color and young people. I am all in because while Hillary Clinton does not have it all right, these constituencies will have a seat at the table and where our voices matter. And I am all in because it is clearer than ever that unless all of us show up to be counted on Election Day, an enthusiasm gap over a decisive, clear, poised and brilliant candidate could leave the door open for someone unfit and unqualified.   #dealmeinHillz
