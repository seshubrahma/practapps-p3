The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) the organization that represents nearly 17, 000 of the Border Patrol agents who risk their lives to secure U. S. borders, is challenging the Colorado GOP for not holding a state primary and instead slating delegates mostly favorable to Trumpâ€™s rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). [The NBPC recently endorsed Trump for president after the candidate shocked them by publicly declaring that actual Border Patrol agents would have a seat at the head of the table in any discussions on U. S. border security policy.   In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, the National Border Patrol Council wrote: In our March 30th endorsement statement of Donald J. Trump, we, the National Border Patrol Council called upon the American people to stand with border agents in support of Mr. Trump and his pledge to end illegal immigration. We fully expected that the will of the American electorate, whatever they decided in this primary, would be upheld.
