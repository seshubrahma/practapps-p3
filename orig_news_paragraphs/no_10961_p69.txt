There’s Justine Sacco, a marketing executive who in 2013 was the subject of a Gawker (Rest in Peace!) story by Sam Biddle (Rest in Peace! ). Biddle drew attention to a single joke made by Sacco, in which she said she was glad to be white while travelling in Africa, as it meant she wouldn’t catch AIDS. It was actually meant to be a subtle joke about white privilege, but amazingly, this wasn’t properly processed by the towering intellect of Sam Biddle. Gawker’s story went up while Sacco was flying to South Africa.
