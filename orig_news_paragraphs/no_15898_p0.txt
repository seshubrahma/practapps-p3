Washington (CNN) A Capitol Police officer who risked his life responding to Wednesday’s attack on a Republican baseball practice threw the first pitch at the Congressional Baseball Game Thursday. Major League Baseball executive Joe Torre presented the game ball to special agent David J. Bailey, who walked onto the field on crutches to loud applause before throwing the first pitch    while putting most of his weight on his left foot.   Although he did not suffer a gunshot wound, Capitol Police said Wednesday that Bailey was treated for a minor injury.
