South China Sea Conflict, China has for years demanded control over almost the entire South China Sea, including territory belonging to Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan, and Malaysia. International tribunals have rejected Chinaâ€™s claims China has vowed to ignore such rulings. During the Obama administration, the U. S. Navy regularly conducted "Freedom of Navigation Operations" (FONOPs) in the region, intended to keep China from claiming the region through adverse possession. A Breitbart News report in March found that the Trump administration had yet to conduct any such FONOPs, in part because of the difficulty of staffing the Pentagon.
