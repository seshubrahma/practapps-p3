Working out at the White House, Theodore Roosevelt, whom Seale described as a "vigorous guy," had a tennis court built on the near south side of the West Wing. It moved farther south around 1910.   In 2009, Obama had new lines and removable baskets added so the space also could be used for a   game of basketball. The 44th president not only plays basketball, he has been known to lift free weights and work out on an elliptical.
