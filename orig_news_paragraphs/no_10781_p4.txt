Bergdahl, who is facing a   trial on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy after he abandoned his Army post in 2009, recently requested a pardon from President Obama. Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade noted that Bergdahl’s defense attorney Eugene Fidell alleges that his client cannot get a fair trial under the Trump administration because of the  ’s opinion of Bergdahl that he made clear on the campaign trail. Trump called Bergdahl a "dirty, rotten traitor" who "should have been executed" at a campaign event in August 2015, according to the Hill. Vierkant said that Trump was merely expressing his opinion and has no say in the trial.
