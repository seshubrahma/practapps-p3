On election day, Kasich only received 14 percent support in the Badger State, with Cruz gaining from the defections. Trumpâ€™s final vote in Wisconsin, in fact, was about where he was polling just over a week before the contest. The difference in the outcome was a collapse in support for Kasich and a surge in support for Cruz. If Cruz stops Trump in Indiana, the primary contest will stay heated until the final votes on June 7th.
