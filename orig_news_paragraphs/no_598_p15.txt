By that measure, how are things stacking up? Despite the fact that Mr. Wang’s show seemed conceived to put a    stiletto boot into the eye of the establishment (see Bella Hadid in a vintage   sporting the words "Night of Treason") the whole felt less convincing than calculated. It didn’t help that, though he had his show in Harlem, there were less than a handful of black models on the runway. Mr. Wang has been down the  ’n’  route before, and while he has a knack for combining the trappings of punk with some neat men’s wear tailoring and couture cuts, here the latter was unfortunately in short supply.
