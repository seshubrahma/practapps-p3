A Trump source says the   has made clear to Conway that he wants her to work in the new administration, but she has not decided whether to do so for several reasons. That includes being mother to four young children. CNN is told Conway is more likely to stay outside the government and follow the template of President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2008 campaign strategist David Plouffe, who opted not to go in the White House. Conway may follow that model and help the Trump administration by organizing conservative groups and pushing Trump policies and legislation from the outside.
