After seething at Washington for so long, hundreds or thousands of miles from the capital, many of these voters now see Mr. Trump as a kind of savior. Even if he does not detail his policies, even if his language strikes them as harsh sometimes, his supporters thrill more to his   slogans like "Make America Great Again" than to what they see as the cautious and   policy speeches of Mr. Ryan and other Washington Republicans. " I love the death out of Paul Ryan, but honestly, Iâ€™m going to vote for Trump anyways," said David Myers, 49, who attended a campaign rally for Mr. Trump in Charleston, W. Va. on Thursday night.
