The notorious Sinaloa cartel boss has been a wanted man on both sides of the border for years. In Brooklyn, he and other cartel leaders were indicted in 2009 on charges of conspiring to import more than 264, 000 pounds of cocaine into the United States between 1990 and 2005, according to the U. S. Justice Department. The traffickers also are accused of sharing drug transportation routes and obtaining their drugs from various Colombian drug organizations. The indictments allege Guzman and others cartel bosses employed "sicarios," or hit men, to carry out hundreds of acts of violence in Mexico, including murders, kidnappings, tortures and violent collections of drug debts, according to federal prosecutors.
