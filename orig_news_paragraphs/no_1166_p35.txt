Finally, we offer a point of broad consensus: Dinosaurs are cool. In the latest news, scientists think they’ve unmasked new features of the Tyrannosaurus’s face, like sensitive snouts and jaws that may have made them efficient killing machines.

" Have a great week, and don’t let the Tyrannosauruses bite.
