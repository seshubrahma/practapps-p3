When the water goes down, a   crane from 1937, with a boiler the size of a car, is towed out into the river. A worker reaches into the seething current with a   steel hook and feels around for an   bar. When he has hooked it, the crane grabs the end of the hook, pulls the wicket up, and the force of the current sets it in place. This is repeated until all the wickets are up, which might take 24 hours.
