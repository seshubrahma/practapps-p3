Once again, Mr. Trumpâ€™s agenda was subsumed by problems of his own making, his message undercut by a seemingly endless stream of controversy he cannot seem to stop himself from feeding. The health care measure appears on track for a House vote this week, and the president, who planned a weekend of relaxation at    his Palm Beach, Fla. club, is likely to receive a large measure of the credit. But it has also become clear that Mr. Trump, an agitator incapable of responding proportionately to any slight, appears hellbent on squandering his honeymoon. Instead, he has sowed chaos in his own West Wing, and talked or tweeted his way into trouble, over and over again.
