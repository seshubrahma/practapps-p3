PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania —   Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R. .) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R. .) told reporters Thursday at the Republicans’ policy retreat here that they are committed to a   program to implement the agenda of President Donald J. Trump. ["We are actually having a fantastic opportunity right here in Philadelphia," said Ryan, wearing a striped button down oxford shirt and tan pants combination in keeping with the "retreat" atmosphere of the party’s   series of workshops, speeches, and mixers. The Republicans arrived Wednesday morning and stayed until their working breakfast Friday.
