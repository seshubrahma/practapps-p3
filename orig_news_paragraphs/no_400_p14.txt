Handbills, posters and occasional demonstrations by such groups as the Fédération des Québécois de Souche (which translates roughly as "people of original Québécois stock") have proliferated in the city. Québécois de Souche’s slogan is "I exist, so I act," but as with fringe movements everywhere, it and other groups are most active behind the anonymity of the internet. " It’s very hard to know their numbers," said Stéphane   a sociology professor at Laval University who studies Quebec’s far right, adding that there is a small core to each group and that the followers are less active.
