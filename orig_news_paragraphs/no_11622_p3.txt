Back in 2009 and in 2013, when the outgoing President Obama was inaugurated after his initial election and his reelection, WMATA made special metro cards with his image on them. This year, according to local media outlet WTOP, the incoming President Trump won’t have his face on the special cards. WTOP’s Jack Moore wrote on Wednesday: Metro is now selling   versions of its SmarTrip payment cards to commemorate the upcoming presidential inauguration.
