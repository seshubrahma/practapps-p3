That means the drug will cost $625, 000 to $750, 000 to cover the five or six doses needed in the first year, and about $375, 000 annually after that, to cover the necessary three doses a year. Patients will presumably take Spinraza for the rest of their lives. The pricing could put the drug in the cross hairs of lawmakers and other critics of high drug prices, and perhaps discourage insurers from covering it. High drug prices have attracted intense scrutiny in the last year, and   Donald J. Trump has singled them out as an important issue.
