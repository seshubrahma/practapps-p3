August 23, 2016,   Clinton was in Beverly Hills Monday night at the home of billionaire entertainment mogul and Democratic Party   Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl. The $100, 000   event drew such Hollywood heavyweights as Disney CEO Bob Iger, Chernin Group founder Peter Chernin and outgoing DreamWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, who just locked down a reported $390 million payday as part of his companyâ€™s sale to Comcast. The Saban event reportedly drew around 80 attendees, and Clinton is said to have participated in a    session focusing on policy and the positive achievements of the Clinton Foundation.
