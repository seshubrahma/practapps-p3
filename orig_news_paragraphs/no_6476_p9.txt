Former Democratic Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders told ABCâ€™s This Week in January that James Comey should consider resigning having acted in an "outrageous way" during the presidential election. " I think he should take a hard look at what he has done. And I think it would not be a bad thing for the American people if he did step down," said Sanders, "I think that Comey acted in an outrageous way during the campaign and, you know, no one can say that this was decisive and this was what elected Trump, but clearly his behavior during the campaign in terms of what he said in the week or two before the election was unacceptable. "
