I did not attend any meetings at that event.   Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump.   Though I do recall several conversations I had during that   reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials.   If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it.
