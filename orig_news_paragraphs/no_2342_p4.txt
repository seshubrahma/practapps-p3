Chris Christie’s inner circle did want to punish Democratic Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, N. J. for declining to endorse Mr. Christie in the Republican governor’s 2013   campaign. And they had deliberately decided to do so during the first days of school. " The purpose was to create as big a traffic jam as possible," Mr. Wildstein said.
