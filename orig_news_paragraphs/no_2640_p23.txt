Fired by Westinghouse at the onset of the Depression, Mr. Stewart was never quite able to put the familyâ€™s finances back together. In 1944, he won a patent for a rotary car engine, of the type the Japanese automaker Mazda later sold, but it went nowhere. Despite his hardships, Mr. Stewart remained a staunch Republican, fiercely opposed to the New Deal. Mrs. Stewart, who was ambitious for her daughters, supported the family with a series of jobs: department store saleswoman, elementary school teacher and librarian at the St. Louis Art Museum.
