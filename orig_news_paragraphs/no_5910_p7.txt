In the 2016 election, Trump won comparatively high support from union members, especially from skilled workers in the   unions, because of his opposition to the   Partnership trade deal, his opposition to   illegal immigration, and because of his "Buy American, Hire American" economic strategy. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump met with the leaders of several   unions, who praised his outreach, partly because it will benefit their   members. But Trumka’s federation is much less receptive to Trump’s   small government policies than are the union leaders of the skilled trades. Trumka represents a wider range of unions, including unions for unskilled workers that include many legal and illegal immigrants, and unions for the government employees.
