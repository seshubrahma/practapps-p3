The NGIC, established by Congress in 2005, "integrates gang intelligence from across federal, state, and local law enforcement on the growth, migration, criminal activity, and association of gangs that pose a significant threat to the U. S. " That intelligence reveals that the "Mara Salvatrucha ( ) and 18th Street gangs continue to expand their influence in the United States, while transnational (operating across national borders) gangs are present in almost every state and continue to grow their memberships, now targeting younger recruits more than ever before. " The FBIâ€™s transnational   task forces operate in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, according to the FBI website.
