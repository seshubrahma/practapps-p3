This isnâ€™t the first time Donald Trump has had a problem looking at someone different from himself and actually seeing them," said Clinton deputy communications director Christina Reynolds.   Clinton also continued to fight back criticism of her use of a private email server as secretary of state.   She shrugged off calls for additional congressional inquiries into her email usage as nothing more than pandering to   conspiracy theorists, suggesting that the FBI "resolved" all the questions into her email use during their investigation. Clinton, speaking with her traveling press corps aboard her new campaign plane on Tuesday, said she has "just accepted" the fact that Republicans will continue to call for investigations into her, whether they are warranted or not.
