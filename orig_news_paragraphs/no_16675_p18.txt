The same pattern emerges in perceptions of immigrants, with white   partisans more apt than white partisans with degrees to say immigrants today are a burden on the United States and that the government should attempt to deport all immigrants currently living in the US illegally. And in a party whose   finisher for this yearâ€™s presidential nomination considers himself a socialist,   white Democrats are less apt than their   counterparts to consider themselves liberal or to be   two factors that could be driving them away from the   Democratic Party. Among white working class Democrats who are registered to vote, 22% say they would consider voting for Trump, vs. just 2% among white Democrats with college degrees, and nearly a quarter, 23% say they will definitely not vote for Clinton, a figure that stands at 3% among white Democrats with college degrees. The effects of this shift are showing in recent   polling.
