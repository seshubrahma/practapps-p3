Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, which owns CapitalG, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton. In November, the Wall Street Journal reported on an email released that month claiming Schmidt was "ready to fund, advise recruit talent" for Clinton’s campaign and that he "clearly wants to be head outside advisor. " The Journal reported: Mr. Schmidt in April 2014 backed a startup dubbed Timshel that helped develop some of the technology behind Mrs. Clinton’s campaign website, including functions to sign up supporters and accept donations, according to the emails.
