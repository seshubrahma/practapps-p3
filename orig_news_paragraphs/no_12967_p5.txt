And please, stop yourself when it comes to Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren, okay? Pretty sure Joe doesn’t really know where the White House is and Ms. Warren is wrapped up in that FBI investigation for having a private   system installed in her house  …      but I digress. Also: I don’t want to discuss brokered conventions, Mitt Romney, or any of this Libertarian,   nonsense.
