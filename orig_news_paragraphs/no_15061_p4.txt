The Syria situation is a mess of almost epic proportions, and even the limited strategy pursued by the Obama administration did much to empower Iran, Russia, al Qaeda and other enemies without advancing the goal of stabilizing Syria. Early in the conflict, before Russians were on the ground, Jack Keane and I twice laid out in The Wall Street Journal options that might have shifted the balance of power in favor of   Syrian forces not aligned with terrorists. In each case, we emphasized the vital importance of taking out the airfields that were allowing both the resupply of weapons to Assad and his Iranian cronies (and now the Russians) and permitting those forces air dominance over Syria.    But the Obama administration was never down with the idea of hitting Assad in any way.
