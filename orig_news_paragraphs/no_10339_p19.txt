And so MSNBC, which is touting its temporary ratings boost during the convention, has had a slew of guests on the air to talk about how deeply concerned they are by Trumpâ€™s joke, how it breaks the sacred, unwritten rules of American political discourse. Never mind that it was Hillary who pushed the infamous "reset" button, which heralded an age of appeasement that saw the U. S. back down on missile defense, yield its dominance in the Middle East, and leave Ukraine defenseless against Putin. This is how the media work, and how they cover Democrats.
