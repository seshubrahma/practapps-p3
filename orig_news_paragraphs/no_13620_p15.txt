After the roundtable, Brown spoke with Breitbart News and was clearly impressed with Ivanka and distrustful of the portrayal of the Trump family in the media. I thought the roundtable was very insightful. I thought there were a lot of opinions represented, lots of thoughts and interest that really span the entire Charlotte community, no matter which area town you represent. I thought Ivanka Trump did a wonderful job in really sharing the platform, her mission, as we move forward throughout the election.
