The current CO2 concentration is higher than for 800, 000 years, but it is far lower than at almost any time in the previous history of our planet. Nor is CO2 a pollutant. It is a colorless, odorless gas that is not toxic to humans and other animals even at concentrations much higher than we are currently experiencing. It is also one of the most important fuels for phytoplankton, which use carbon dioxide for energy and that release oxygen.
