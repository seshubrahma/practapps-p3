A   former elected Florida Republican told Breitbart News that Luntz worked closely over the summer of 2006 with Rubio’s   leadership team to prepare Rubio for his new elected role as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Luntz held a series of focus groups in Orlando, and showed people tapes of the thirtysomething legislator. Rubio and his aides would also sit in on some of the sessions, presenting bits of speeches to the focus group participants and also learning firsthand from their observations. The meetings helped Rubio to write his book "100 Innovative Ideas For Florida’s Future," but they also helped him to deliver his "American Exceptionalism" speech that Rubio finally trotted out before a national audience when he accepted victory in his November 2010 Senate race in Florida.
