The Trump administration faced new turmoil over new disclosures of contacts top aides had with Russian officials during the presidential campaign or prior to the inauguration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the top U. S. law enforcement official, recused himself from any investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, while denying that his dicussions with a Russian official last year were related to the campaign. And the White House disclosed that the ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner, the president’s    and senior adviser, also met with the Russian ambassador in December. The outgoing Obama administration had scrambled to preserve intelligence about the Trump campaign’s possible contacts with Russia by spreading the information across the government.
