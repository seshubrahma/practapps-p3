"I’’ve spent a lot of time studying [presidential impeachment].   We’’re in presidential impeachment territory," Whittington    on Monday,   before news of Comey’’s memo broke. ’ ’    The memo fills in a number of details around     ties and what the president’’s motives were in firing the former   FBI director, Whittington said. If Congress pursues those   details, depending on what they find, this latest   development may "open the door" to exploring the groundwork for   presidential impeachment, he added.
