All enforcement activities are conducted with the same level of professionalism and respect that ICE officers exhibit every day. " "The focus of these operations is no different than the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICEâ€™s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis," the ICE statement concluded. News reports indicate ICE agents have arrested hundreds of criminal aliens over the past few days under this operation. Breitbart Texas reported from Austin, Texas, that 44 criminal aliens had been taken into custody this week.
