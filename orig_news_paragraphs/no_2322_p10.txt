Dr. James M. Musser, the head of pathology at the Houston Methodist Medical System, said, "Most people are not infectious if they have pneumonia, and being on antibiotics makes them even less infectious. " Dr. Dela Cruz differed, saying he felt patients should limit contact with others the first few days of treatment when the source of a pneumonia is unknown. Dehydration, which Mrs. Clinton’s team blamed for her apparent collapse at Sunday’s memorial service, could be caused by a combination of standing outdoors on a hot, humid day and any fever she might have had, Dr. Schaffner said.
