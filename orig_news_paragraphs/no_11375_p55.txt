The campaign was bitter: It’s fair to say that the Eastern elite of that era were as horrified by Jackson as the Eastern elite of our time are horrified by Trump. Indeed, hard as it might be to believe, the elite were more appalled by the insurgent Jackson back then in the widely circulated coffin handbills, he was accused of everything from adultery to mass murder to cannibalism. Yet despite all this establishment vitriol, Jackson won in a landslide, and the first political era of America, a time of aristocratic leadership, was ended. Indeed, in many ways, our modern political system —  that is,   politics, with the winner needing the   of the electorate to win —  originates from 1828.
