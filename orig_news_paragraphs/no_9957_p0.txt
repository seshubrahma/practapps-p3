The   Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warns this week that U. S. debt will hit 141 percent of GDP in the next 30 years as America taxes itself into poverty. [With a new University of Chicago poll revealing that Democrat Hillary Clinton’s lead over Republican Donald Trump in the key      demographic is only 38 percent to 17 percent, with 45 percent undecided, Clinton was forced to adopt Bernie Sanders’s   agenda of 1) free   public college tuition for families making up to $125, 000 a year 2) gradually raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and 3) beginning "Medicare for all" by allowing    residents to buy Medicare coverage.   The CBO has warned in the past that irresponsible federal spending has deteriorated the   fiscal solvency of the United States, but the latest CBO report predicts that the net federal debt’s share of the overall economy will steadily rise from "75 percent of GDP in the wake of the financial crisis, to 86 percent in 2026 and 141 percent in 2046.
