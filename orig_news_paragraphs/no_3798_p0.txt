Only 28 percent of Americans support former President Barack Obama’s   claim that the federal government should decide bathroom policies in elementary and secondary schools, says a new poll by Rasmussen Reports. [In contrast, 36 percent said local governments should set "bathroom policies" governing youths who say they want to live as members of the opposite sex. Another 28 percent of respondents said state government should set the rules for transgender disputes, according to the poll.   That adds up to 64 percent opposition and only 28 percent support for federal rule.
