Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Mike Kelly wants   Donald Trump to begin repealing President Barack Obamaâ€™s executive orders the moment he assumes office. ["  Trump has a clear mandate to implement colossal change within the federal government," Kelly said in a statement.   " I encourage him to begin his administration with a powerful, principled, and productive achievement: on the first day of his presidency, Mr. Trump should use his executive authority to end every harmful and unconstitutional executive order previously carried out by President Obama," he said.
