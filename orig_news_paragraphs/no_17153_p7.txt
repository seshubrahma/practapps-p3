Trump bragged that he "helped numerous senators" win, and took a shot New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who narrowly lost after distancing herself from Trump. " No, thank you," he said he told Ayotte about a post in Trumpâ€™s Cabinet.   He also mocked Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican who lost his Senate race after similarly staying far away from Trump.
