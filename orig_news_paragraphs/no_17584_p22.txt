I can’’t tell you how grateful I am for that. The   principles that I rehearsed in my head often, over the past year:   Have trust in truth, and you have nothing to fear from truth as   well as everyone gets what they deserve out of life. I know it   was the combination of the principles I have lived with now and   are just part of me that have truly rounded things out for me   through the rough waters. I truly mean what I say and have said   to my parents often over the past six months.
