But Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana  —   a state won by Mr. Trump   —   said Sunday evening that he would oppose Judge Gorsuch, dealing a big blow to Republicans’ hopes of reaching 60 votes. The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote for Monday on whether to send Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Senate floor. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on NBC’s "Meet the Press" on Sunday that Judge Gorsuch would be confirmed this week.
