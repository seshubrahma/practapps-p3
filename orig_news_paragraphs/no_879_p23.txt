The hedge fund’s African unit pleaded guilty to bribery charges in September, with the firm paying a $413 million fine as part of a deferred prosecution agreement to settle both criminal and civil charges. Mr. Clayton’s wife’s modest investment in the Omega fund could also raise questions. The S. E. C last year filed an insider trading complaint against the hedge fund’s founder, the billionaire investor Leon Cooperman. Omega had managed the investment for Goldman’s retirement plan, and the Wall Street bank pulled its employees’ $300 million from the account in October, several months after the S. E. C. filed its suit.
