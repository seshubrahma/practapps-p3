Ms. Seweid, of New Hyde Park on Long Island, had told the police that three white men screaming "Donald Trump!" attacked her on Dec. 1 on an uptown No. 6 train at East 23rd Street, DNAinfo. com reported. She told the police that the men had called her a terrorist and that when she tried to move to the other end of the subway car, one of them followed and tried to pull off her traditional head scarf. DNAinfo reported that she recanted the story on Tuesday and had made it up to get attention because of problems she was having with her family.
