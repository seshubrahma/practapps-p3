His spokesman later told Business Insider that Nunes had   been there to view the documents in a secure compartmented   information facility, or SCIF, to "safeguard the proper chain of   custody and classification of these documents," but did not   respond when asked why an executive branch source would not go   directly to Trump, instead of to Nunes, with documents they found   suspicious. ’ ’    Nunes has insisted that no one from the Trump administration knew   he was on White House grounds being briefed on the documents. But     experts, Republican and Democratic members of   Congress, and White House reporters have said it is highly   unlikely Nunes could have gone unnoticed on White House grounds.
