[Slated for Wednesday, January 18, the   dubbed #J18, is taking place between the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday and Trump’s inauguration. The event’s planners say:  Let it be known that on #J18 and beyond, universities, colleges, and high schools refused to bear silent witness to the politics of hate and fear that in these times, these places of teaching and learning not only served as a sanctuary for its students and workers but also stood up to proclaim the power of knowledge on the frontlines of social justice. On January 18, the professors are calling upon their colleagues to "Teach, Organize, Resist," and "affirm the role of critical thinking and academic knowledge in challenging Trumpism. "
