The march was peaceful, unlike the Friday night protest by 1, 000 people that resulted in the arrests of 187 adults and eight juveniles, Los Angeles police said. Protests have been held across the nation and most have been peaceful, lacking the intensity from the previous night. But Portland, Oregon was one exception as violence flared there. A man was shot and wounded early Saturday during a protest and demonstrators threw projectiles at police.
