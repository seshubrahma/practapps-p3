Trump is here in Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day, a national holiday that marks Israelâ€™s reunification of Jerusalem after the 1967 Six Day War and the establishment of Israeli sovereignty over the eastern sections of the city, which include the Old City, Western Wall and Temple Mount. Many will be watching to see if Trump uses the visit to announce that he is moving the U. S. embassy from the beach in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although reports put that as unlikely. Israel officially annexed Jerusalem in 1980 in a move not recognized by the international community because the Palestinians claim eastern sections of the city for a future Palestinian capital despite their never having had a state or entity in those areas. Current U. S. law does not officially recognize Israeli control over the eastern sections of the city, going so far as to prevent American citizens born in Jerusalem from listing "Israel" as their country of birth.
