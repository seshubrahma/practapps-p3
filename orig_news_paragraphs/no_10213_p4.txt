—   with the full backing of the National Rifle Association and the NRA’s attorney in this case, former U. S. Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper  —   instead carefully designed the case to ask the simple question of whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is a right that can be claimed in any form outside a person’s home. In answer to that question, the Ninth Circuit wrote, "We conclude that the Second Amendment does not preserve or protect a right of a member of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public. " Despite the fact that a decade ago, at least 74 percent of Americans believed that ordinary citizens have the right to own guns, the Supreme Court had never needed to decide a case asking that question. Then in 2008, the Court in District of Columbia v. Heller struck down Washington, D. C.’s ban on handguns in the home, holding that the Second Amendment secures an individual right for American citizens who are   and peaceable to own personal firearms and keep them ready for use in their homes.
