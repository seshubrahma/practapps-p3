Mark Hertling, who was one of the top American generals in Iraq from 2007 to 2008, the flag officers who signed the letter of support for Trump were largely those without any experience of the war against al Qaeda and its allies.   " I didnâ€™t recognize many of those names as being there in the fight with me over the last 16 years," Hertling told CNN when the flag officers endorsed Trump in September.
