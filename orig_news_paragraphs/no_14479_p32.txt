This is the monument to the two late leaders, Kim   to the left, Kim   to the right.   It’s remarkable to see these waves of people who are coming here, all of them carrying flowers, all of them to pay their respects to the late leader on this national holiday, what would have been 75th birthday of Kim  . You see more and more taxis on the streets here in Pyongyang, more traffic in general, really. This is one of the hotels that we stay at quite often, and it’s actually on an island separate from the rest of Pyongyang, so the tourist won’t walk around in the city.
