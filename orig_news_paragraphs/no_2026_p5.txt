The parallels are striking: Mr. Trump played on issues such as immigration, trade and globalization, while attacking elites in both parties and mocking political correctness.

In the countryside, residents, on average, are older, poorer, less educated and more receptive to the populist message that they are the true protectors of their nationâ€™s culture and heritage.
