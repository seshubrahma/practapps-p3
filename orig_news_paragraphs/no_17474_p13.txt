The text of the latest Security Council resolution calls on all UN member states "to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967"    language that Netanyahu fears could lead to a surge in boycott and sanctions efforts.

Trump has set the US on this perilous path    hardly one that would seem calculated to end with the Middle East peace he hopes to broker.
