Mrs. Clinton has tried to bounce back quickly from medical issues in the past. In 2009, she slipped in a State Department garage and fractured her elbow, but traveled to India and Thailand a few days later with her arm in a sling and her joint held together with wire and pins. She took longer to recover after dehydration brought on by a stomach virus led her to faint and hit her head on a toilet at her home in 2012. She sustained a concussion and was later found to have a blood clot in her head.
