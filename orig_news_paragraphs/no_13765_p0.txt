In the course of making my film The Bloody Road to Cleveland about the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, I have been teargassed in Seattle, assaulted in Denver, kicked out of the Board of Supervisors meeting in San Francisco, and, as Breitbart News reported this weekend, arrested in Baton Rouge. This is my story of that arrest. [When I cover protests, especially shooting footage for this film, I donâ€™t do it from a distance. I want to be where the action is, but I always balance this with obeying place orders.
