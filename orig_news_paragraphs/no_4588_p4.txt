The neglect could soon change with President Donald Trump’s administration, which is committing new plans and procedures to handle the immigration court backlog. In a letter from the Department of Justice (DOJ) the administration is expected to move 50 immigration judges to detention facilities in areas like Adelanto and San Diego, California, as well as Chicago, Illinois, as Breitbart Texas reported. Judges will hear cases from 6am to 6pm with two rotating shifts. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose task it is to help remedy the problem, has long been a critic of the nation’s immigration system, arguing that lack of border security, a slow court process and influxes in   workers all put strain on social safety nets and American taxpayers.
