Mr. Trump had been feuding with them after they criticized his ridicule of the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq. Captain Khanâ€™s parents had denounced Mr. Trump during the Democratic National Convention. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, had urged Mr. Trump to stand behind Mr. Ryan and the senators for the sake of party unity. Some leading Republicans have expressed hope that Mr. Trump can at least stabilize his campaign by Labor Day, when many voters begin paying attention to congressional races.
