A snippet of the slide presentation is featured on CHIRLAâ€™s website, where illegal aliens are instructed to hand immigration authorities a card stating: "I am giving you this card because I do not wish to speak to you or have any further contact with you.   I choose to exercise my constitutional right to remain silent and refuse to answer your questions.   If you arrest me, I will continue to exercise my right to remain silent and to refuse to answer your questions. I want to speak to a lawyer before answering your questions.
