A list of witnesses scheduled to appear at a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Open Hearing on "Russian Active Measures" contains a glaring problem: the only technical experts scheduled to testify are from CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike is a firm hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and has become the primary source of the narrative about "Russian hacking" of the 2016 election and has acted as a mouthpiece for the Democrats since last June. [The initial witness list released by House Intelligence includes a number of intelligence officials, all appointed during the Obama administration, such as former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, but the sole technical people on the invitation list are two representatives of CrowdStrike, President Shawn Henry, and the   Dmitri Alperovitch.   Breitbart News has interviewed tech experts who do not agree with the CrowdStrike assessment or Obama administrationâ€™s claims that the   hacks clearly committed by Russian state actors, with much criticism aimed at the   Joint Analysis Report (JAR) "Grizzly Steppe" that was released at the end of December.
