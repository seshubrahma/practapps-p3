Washington (CNN) The investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election is partly focusing on Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s    and a key aide, The Washington Post and NBC News reported Thursday. Previous reporting has said other members of Trump’s orbit are also focuses of the investigation, but the reports Thursday evening were the first to name a current White House official. The Justice Department earlier this month appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to handle the investigation into all matters related to Russian involvement in the election, including potential collusion with Trump’s associates and potential attempts to influence the investigation.
