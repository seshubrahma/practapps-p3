The meeting raised questions because the bank has been under US sanctions since 2014    and because Kushner spent years as a real estate developer and was trying to attract financing for a building project in Manhattan. The White House said Kushner attended the meeting as a Trump adviser, not as a private developer. But VEB, in a statement provided to CNN confirming the meeting, characterized Kushner as the head of Kushner Companies, not as a representative or Trump.
