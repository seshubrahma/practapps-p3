The Chinese reports approvingly noted that the granddaughter did a   performance, singing a Chinese song, "Jasmine," and reciting the "Three Character Classic" and some Tang poetry. Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Xi’s invitation to visit China at an "early date," the   news agency Xinhua reported, a gesture that showed the two men had established the rapport that the Chinese leader was seeking to show his people at home. Then after dinner, with Mr. Xi safely back at his nearby hotel, Mr. Trump stepped to a podium to announce the strikes, making comments punctuated with emotional descriptions of the children killed by the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attack. Mr. Trump informed Mr. Xi of the attack during dinner, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said in remarks to the news media on Friday afternoon.
