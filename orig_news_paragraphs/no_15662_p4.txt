Those actions brought the total number of people arrested in the investigation to 13, with 11 still in custody. Two people have been released without being charged, Greater Manchester police said.   His younger brother, Hashim Ramadan Abu Qassem      detained in Libya in the aftermath of the bombing    knew of his brother’s movements and about the plot, Ahmed Ben Salem, spokesman for the Special Deterrence Force in Tripoli, told the private broadcaster, Libya’s Channel, on Thursday night. The brothers spoke on the phone just minutes before the attack at a concert at Manchester Arena, Ben Salem said, but Hashim told his Libyan interrogators that he did not know details about where and when the blast would be.
