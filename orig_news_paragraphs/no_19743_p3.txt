In that way, the clashing perspectives on Putin reflect not only differences on how to relate specifically to Russia, but on what goals should guide American foreign policy in the 21st century, and what allies are necessary to advance those aims. On both sides of the Atlantic, the push to reset with Putin reflects a desire to elevate a different set of   concerns while downplaying, or even abandoning, the alliances that have bound European nations more tightly to each other, and to the United States, for decades. One critical variable of the Trump presidency may be how far this radical shift in perspective advances in a Republican Party where most elected officials and   analysts still believe global stability depends on an   network of rules and alliances, and still view Putin as an escalating threat to that order. Though the   embrace of Putin common in Europe remains confined to the GOPâ€™s margins, it appears to be establishing a beachhead under Trump, noted Richard Fontaine, president of the centrist Center for a New American Security, and the former top   aide to McCain.
