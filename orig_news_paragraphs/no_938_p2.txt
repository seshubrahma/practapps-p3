Those are the questions that Dan Taberski, a former producer of "The Daily Show" and a friend of Mr. Simmons, has turned into a cultural phenomenon with his podcast, "Missing Richard Simmons," which is currently the most downloaded podcast on iTunes. The back story: On Feb. 15, 2014, Mr. Simmons didnâ€™t show up to teach his class at his gym, Slimmons, in Beverly Hills, Calif. He stopped answering emails or phone calls. He no longer sprinted out of his home to greet tour buses, delighting onlookers with his glittery costumes.
