The truth is that this is nothing but demagoguery by the president and it’s sad. And I hope people use their First Amendment right to express their opposition by protesting in the streets and writing letters and talking to their members of Congress. I hope that people really do stand up and say this is not what we believe our America is, and we believe in an inclusive America that welcomes immigrants and refugees. And that of course we’re going to be as safe, but at the same time there’s no reason to whip up unnecessary fears, as the president’s trying to do.
