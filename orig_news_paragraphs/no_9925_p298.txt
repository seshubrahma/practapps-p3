Failed GOP consultant who has never won a presidential election and just blew $100+ million on Jeb! â€™s failed campaign (while reportedly pocketing at least $12 million for himself and even more for his cronies) should be prohibited from offering any opinions during this election cycle. Will say it again: Going to him for advice is like getting advice on how to sink free throws from Messrs. Jordan (DeAndre) Howard, and Drummond. Trumpolini crushing others in early NV precincts counts.
