The correspondence came months before the F. B. I. which is part of the Justice Department, opened an investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified emails at the State Department. In July, the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said Mrs. Clinton had been "extremely careless" but recommended no charges, which the Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, accepted. Though the information Mr. Fallon passed on reflected no internal Justice Department thinking, the connection between a senior Clinton aide and the department stoked accusations that the Obama administration had conspired with Mrs. Clinton’s camp. The correspondence released Tuesday showed "a level of collusion which calls into question the entire investigation into her private server," said Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign.
