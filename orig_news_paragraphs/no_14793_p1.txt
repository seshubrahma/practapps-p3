The momentum of   populist Geert Wilders has been slipping. Even if he were to win, there are obstacles to his taking over outright leadership of this NATO nation. Wilders’ platform is a   mirror of Trump and adviser Stephen Bannon’s darkest views    pushing the bar on all Muslim immigration, shuttering all mosques (Wilders calls them "Nazi temples") and asylum centers, banning the Quran and taking the Netherlands out of the European Union in a move dubbed Nexit, following Britain’s   Brexit vote last year.   For some time, the Dutch politician found himself with apparently unstoppable momentum.
