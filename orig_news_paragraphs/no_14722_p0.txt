Washington (CNN) Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly said that apart from the six countries listed on Monday’s travel ban, there are "13 or 14" other countries that also have questionable vetting procedures. Kelly didn’t name any of the additional countries the administration is concerned about and acknowledged he doesn’t expect the list of countries subject to the travel ban will grow. " There will probably be other countries we will look at," he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room."
