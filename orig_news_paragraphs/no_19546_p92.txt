Trump             asked Mattis about waterboarding, which Trump             supported. " I’ve never found it to be useful," said             Mattis, according to Trump’s account of their             conversation. "Give me a pack of cigarettes and a             couple of beers, and I do better with that than I do             with torture," the general told him.
