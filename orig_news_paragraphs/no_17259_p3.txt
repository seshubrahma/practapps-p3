Suprun ends the editorial by saying that the electors still have a chance to unify behind a Republican alternative such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Along with Suprun, 36 other electors planning to vote for Trump would have to abandon their vote for him    which is almost beyond the realm of possibility. Even if Suprun doesn’t cast his vote for Trump, Trump is headed toward the 270 votes he needs to become president in January.   In the editorial Suprun explained that he believes Trump has shown he’s not qualified for the Oval Office.
