You can say she’s a "skank" if you are as classless as that. You can say she’s an idiot (although, I question whether that term applies to a woman who speaks five languages fluently). Such attacks are petty and small, but in the United States you have the right to be petty, small, offensive and even insulting toward Mrs. Trump and anyone else you like.       What you don’t have the right to do is to lie about her in a defamatory way.
