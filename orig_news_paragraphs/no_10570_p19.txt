Karabell points to both incoming National Economic Council director Gary Cohn and incoming Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, two Goldman Sachs executives. " Cohn, a commodities trader known for his   style, holds relatively traditional views on   mantras such as balancing regulation with encouraging the flow of capital," Karabell wrote of Cohn, the president and Chief Operating Officer of Goldman Sachs who will lead the Trump administrationâ€™s National Economic Council. Karabell added in a section of his piece on the former Trump campaign finance chairman: Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary pick, is another product of Goldman.
