Both Clinton and Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump have also appeared on SNL this season, with both candidates confronting versions of themselves played by the show’s cast members.   Of course, Sanders’ appearance is unlikely to engender the controversy that surrounded NBC when Trump hosted the November 7 episode. Thousands of people reportedly signed petitions urging NBC to rescind its invitation to Trump, while some Latino actors pledged to boycott the show and at least one Hispanic lawmaker had said Trump’s hosting gig "endangers" the Latino community. David also made an appearance during the   SNL, when he jokingly called Trump a racist during the opening monologue in order to collect a $5, 000 prize.
