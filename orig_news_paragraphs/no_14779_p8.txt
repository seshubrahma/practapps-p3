Rabin was accused of compromising Israel as a Jewish state and was portrayed at   Accords rallies in a Nazi SS uniform, Clinton said Thursday. Clinton eulogized Rabin in 1995 as not only a monumental world leader, but as a "partner and friend." " Every moment we shared was a joy because he was a good man and an inspiration, because he was also a great man," Clinton said in the eulogy.
