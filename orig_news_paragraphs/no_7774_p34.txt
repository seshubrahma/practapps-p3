Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 3, 2016,  The failed 2008 presidential candidate and 2012 Republican presidential nominee also falsely claimed on March 3 that Trump as the Republican nominee would "enable" Hillary Clinton’s victory in the presidential race. A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as Hillary Clinton must not become president. But a Trump nomination enables her victory.   —
