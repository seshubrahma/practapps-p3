Acting Deputy Secretary of State Tom Shannon called Fried a "national treasure" for his work to help advance freedom and security in Central and Eastern Europe throughout the Cold War and after the fall of the Soviet Union. He served as US ambassador to Poland and director for European affairs at the National Security Council before becoming the assistant secretary for Europe at the State Department.   In recent years Fried took on some of the most thankless tasks of US diplomacy    lobbying countries to take in Guantanamo detainees who were released from captivity and coordinating sanctions policy against North Korea over its nuclear program and against Russia over its actions in Ukraine.   Friedâ€™s departure leaves another hole in the State Department
