For Mr. Trump, whose campaign appearances are often a gleeful exercise in showmanship and    wisecracks, the speech had all the trappings of a serious address. Standing beneath a twinkling chandelier in a Washington hotel ballroom, backed by American flags and facing a sedate, largely   audience, a measured Mr. Trump read his remarks from a teleprompter, staying almost completely on script. But if Mr. Trump adopted establishment trappings, his speech still had an insurgent tone. He criticized allies in Europe and Asia for not bearing the burden of their own defense, he said he would try to mend fences with Russia, and he assailed his opponents for being overly aggressive in foreign affairs.
