: GOP legislators suck it up and do the hard work     of passing piecemeal health reform legislation, with the help     of centrist Senate Democrats. The  would be to give up on     starting from scratch, at least for now, and instead give     people who can’t or won’t buy   insurance     plans the option of buying cheaper,       insurance without premium subsidies. Subsidized       plans would still be available on the     exchanges, which would serve as a safety net for those too sick     or too poor to afford   plans with high        costs. Instead of pulling the rug out from under states that     expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, Congress could pick up a     higher share of the tab for the poorest and sickest Medicaid     beneficiaries while asking states to take on more     responsibility for helping the healthiest of them, a swap that     would greatly relieve the pressure on state budgets.
