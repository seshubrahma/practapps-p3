May 22, 2017, The Los Angeles Times reports: "With a loud boom and a cloud of dust, part of a mountainside slid into the Pacific Ocean on Saturday night, swallowing roughly a third of a mile of Highway 1 and rearranging some more of Big Surâ€™s dramatic coastline. "   The landslide came after a series of smaller problems that affected the area after one of the rainiest winters in the history of the state. In March, a collapsed bridge in Big Sur cut many residents off from access to essential supplies and services, with access only available on foot or by helicopter. The dramatic California coastline is subject to frequent erosion, as its cliffs and mountains are generally made of loose layers of sedimentary rock.
