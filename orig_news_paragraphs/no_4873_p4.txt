" In the New York metropolitan area,   Manhattan prospers while old factory towns such as Paterson, New Jersey, and Waterbury, Connecticut, languish   â€¦      While Los Angeles gained more than 54, 000 international migrants, it lost more than 87, 000 people due to domestic migration," said Bloomberg.
