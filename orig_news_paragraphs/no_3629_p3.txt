A case in point is the headline that appeared in the   of the January 13 edition of The New York Times: "Outgunned, Outmaneuvered and in Need of a Game Plan. "   Later, perhaps at the prodding of   groups, that headline was softened to, "As Trump Berates News Media, a New Strategy Is Needed to Cover Him"   Still, the word "strategy" is there in the header, reaching, as it does, deep into military history.   Could Trump really be doing all that?
