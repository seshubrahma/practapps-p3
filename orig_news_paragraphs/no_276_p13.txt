Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said Democrats were also galvanized by the turnout at last weekendâ€™s protests. He said it would serve as a unifying force for Senate Democrats. " That swell of people and strength and spirit at the marches we had Saturday showed us we have the American populace on our side," Mr. Blumenthal said.
