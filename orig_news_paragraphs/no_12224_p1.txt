He did neither. Instead, Gov. Romney did what the establishment has been doing for decades  â€¦    talk. It took all of about thirty seconds into his condescending, arrogant lecture to remind voters just why they hate the establishment, why they are sick and tired of being used and why they are furious at being told how to vote. This was a classic Romney performance and production that somehow managed to encapsulate everything truly despised by rank and file Republicans.
