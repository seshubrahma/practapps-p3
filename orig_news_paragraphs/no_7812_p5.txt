I wrote the article when Kristol set out to lead the "Never Trump" movement, after Trump had secured the Republican nomination. I would write it again in a heartbeat.

Bill Kristol and his friends betrayed the Republican Party, betrayed the American people, and betrayed the Jews when he set out to undermine Trump and elect the criminal Hillary Clinton.
