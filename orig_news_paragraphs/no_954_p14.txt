In a statement on Wednesday, Yahoo thanked the F. B. I. and the Justice Department for their work. Jack Bennett, the special agent in charge of the F. B. I. ’s San Francisco office, said that his investigators had worked on the case for two years, although the inquiry intensified last year. It remains unclear why Yahoo users were not informed about the hack during that time. An internal investigation by the company’s board found that some senior executives and information security personnel were aware of the breach shortly after it occurred but "failed to properly comprehend or investigate" the situation.
