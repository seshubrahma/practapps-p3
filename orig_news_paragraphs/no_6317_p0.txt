The Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Friday it has raised a   $41. 5 million in the first three months of 2017, its largest amount ever following a presidential election. ["Our   fundraising pace has been fueled by grassroots enthusiasm for President Trump and the Republican Party," RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said in a statement.   " The RNC is in a strong position to make an impact in key races in 2017 and 2018 as we plan to take a leading role in preserving our congressional majorities and prepare to reelect President Trump in 2020," she continued.
