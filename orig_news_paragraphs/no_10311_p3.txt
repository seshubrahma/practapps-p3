Despite pleas from police earlier in the day, some protesters began marching on Southwest 4th Avenue, only to be stopped by police, who advised the crowd to march on a facilitated northbound route. A second group followed police orders and began marching north. Police said deviating from the route was not permitted. Earlier Friday, Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman had asked the protesters to please not protest.
