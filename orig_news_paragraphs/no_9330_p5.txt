This is going to get worse. As I predicted in January: As the newest incarnation of the activist Left, Black Lives Matter will not back down or rest until it is either stopped by someone gutsy enough to call them out or until it gets what it wants: a bloody revolution leading to a   America. The one thing the left has not counted on, however, is a dogged, active conservative media culture that can bring real information straight to the American people without being filtered by Black Lives Matter’s journalism school comrades. We’re not about to let Black Lives Matter or any leftist revolutionary movement destroy America without making sure they’re fully revealed for what they are.
