We see a sharper divide with abortion: 56 percent who oppose more restrictions on abortion say their friends feel the same way, and 39 percent who support more restrictions on abortion say all five of their closest friends support such restrictions. People who identified as political moderates tend to have views that are closer to those of   liberals than to those of   conservatives. But in terms of sharing friendships among people with less education, political ideology seems to make little difference.
