You go to Cyprus because that’s where Russians launder money," said Rep. Mike Quigley,   in explaining the reason for his trip.   The Mediterranean island nation has become a part of the sprawling probe following an Associated Press report last month that said as part of an   investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s work in eastern Europe, Treasury officials obtained information regarding financial payments Manafort may have received through Cypriot banks. The AP story cites a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Manafort’s finances and consulting work are drawing attention as Ukrainian officials try to determine whether he received improper payments as part of their corruption investigation into   Victor Yanukovych    Manafort’s former client.
