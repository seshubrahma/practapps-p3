(Reuters)   —    An election analysis conducted in the   States of the Nation project shows that the race has tightened considerably over the past few weeks, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump projected to win Florida, an essential battleground state, if the election were held today. [The project, which is based on a weekly tracking poll of more than 15, 000 Americans, shows that the 2016 presidential race could end in a photo finish on Nov. 8, with the   candidates running nearly even in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president.
