A source close to the President told CNN that Trump informed Bharara that he wanted to keep him on as a gesture to Schumer    then the incoming minority leader    whom Trump had previously supported for years. Since November, however, Schumer has led the Democratic opposition in the Senate, which the White House views as obstructionist and running counter to the President’s agenda. In a statement Friday, Schumer said he was "troubled" to learn of the Trump administration’s request for Bharara’s and other US attorneys’ resignations, adding that Trump "assured him" he wanted Bharara to continue to serve as US attorney. By asking for the immediate resignations of the remaining US attorneys before their replacements have been confirmed, "the President is interrupting ongoing cases and investigations and hindering the administration of justice," Schumer said.
