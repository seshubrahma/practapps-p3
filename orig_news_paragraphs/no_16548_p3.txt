Actually, few, if any,   Republicans oppose him because they think he canâ€™t win. We are motivated, in large part, by the fact that if Trump has a 1 in 30 chance of being president, we are not comfortable with those odds.   But he is not running as a fringe third party. He is on the Republican ticket and his chances are far better than 1 in 30.
