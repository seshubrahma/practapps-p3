NO way, but personally, I liked your baseball writing a lot more than your political writing. George once called me "disgusting" over one of my utterly "disgusting" views of faith that he, the   atheist, found revolting. So in his own little party of one, he wonâ€™t have to tolerate the likes of my Southern, redneck,            kind.
