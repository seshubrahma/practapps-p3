In a   interview with   publication the Huffington Post, Ryan even suggested that he’d be open to suing a President Trump if he were to enact a temporary pause on Muslim migration. Ryan said that he is not giving Trump "a blank check" with his endorsement. His statement is significant because it suggests that he intends to be a greater check on his own party’s president than he has been on President Obama, who has systematically dismantled U. S. immigration law with the help of funding provided by congressional Republicans. Other examples of Ryan’s efforts to undermine Trump have been more subtle.
