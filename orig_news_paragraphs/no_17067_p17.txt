For both Americas, the instinctive response can be to dig in deeper to the   echo chamber of groupthink, rather than to acknowledge a failure in understanding the "other"    Americans alive today. While Traditional America gloats in a victory lap, the reality is that generational belief trends among America’s young signal Progressive America’s future reign in coming decades. The more dramatically Traditional America gloats today, the more dramatic will be the backlash in four years or eight years, when progressives retake the throne. I believe we can do better than vilifying our neighbors and plotting their demise.
