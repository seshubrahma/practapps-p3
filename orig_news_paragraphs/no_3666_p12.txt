Trump reportedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the New START treaty, which caps the number of nuclear warheads both Russia and the United States can maintain and calls for the destruction of much of the current nuclear arsenal. Trump later told Reuters that he believed the United States had "fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity. " "It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we’re going to be at the top of the pack," Trump promised. Trump’s policy towards nuclear weapons has alarmed America’s communist enemies on the other side of the world.
