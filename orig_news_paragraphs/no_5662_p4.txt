, NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Well, this is just pretty natural. I think, you know, Callista is singing at the basilica last night in the mass for life. And when they announced that Vice President Pence was going to be there, it was 90 seconds along broken applause. I think all across America, people of faith, people who care for life, people who are concerned about stopping abortion are thrilled that the Vice President of the United States for the first time ever, came to the march.
