I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. I am going to bring back millions of jobs.   Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.   The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.
