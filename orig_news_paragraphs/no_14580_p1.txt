Expect to see the media close ranks and fight for the public’s right to observe and report on government without fear of official retaliation. To their credit, the Associated Press and Time walked out of Spicer’s briefing when it became clear he was trying to punish selected news outlets. It’s reminiscent of a 2009 incident in which the Obama White House tried to exclude Fox News from interviewing a   administration official, Kenneth Feinberg    and got a brusque reply from the bureau chiefs of ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC that they would skip planned interviews with Feinberg unless Fox was included.   That professional solidarity will likely reassert itself.
