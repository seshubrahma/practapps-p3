Donald Trump has done something which I’ve been waiting to happen for a long time: He’s won the Republican nomination for president virtually without spending a dime and saying whatever he wants without regard for approval whatsoever from Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Academia, or the politically correct press. When you read how Trump can’t beat Hillary, keep in mind you’re hearing it from the same people who scoffed down their smug noses that he could not possibly win the GOP nomination, either.
