In addition, video footage of the event has been released by reporter Joshua Chavers of West Palm Beach NBC affiliate WPTV, who was streaming video live on WPTV’s Facebook page. In the WPTV video, at 15:41, Terris can be seen at left, in checked shirt and backpack.   Fields later appears to his left at 16:01, which is also when Trump finishes an interview (apparently with CNN’s Sara Murray) and begins to move. The same moment is captured in a brief   video by Kristinn Taylor of Gateway Pundit.
