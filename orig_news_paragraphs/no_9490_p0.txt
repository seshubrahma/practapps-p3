As one of the 22   of the national tea party movement, I am concerned over the fact that our nation has moved away from the principles of liberty we were founded on. [I have been an activist fighting for conservative principles since 1976, so I reject individuals and publications that try to tell me what conservatism is.   I have watched over the years as we have allowed deep pocketed special interests to set the agenda in Washington D. C. instead of we the people. These special interests gain support for their agenda, by even principled conservatives, using their millions of dollars of political contributions.
