Normally, such an appeal of a district courtâ€™s decision would be heard by a randomly assigned panel of three judges, and the losing party may ask for it to be reheard by the full court. Yet in this case, the judges on the 4th Circuit decided it should be heard by the full court    otherwise known as "en banc"    in the first instance. Ten of the 15 active judges on the court are either Clinton or Obama appointees. A source familiar with the case told CNN that Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III    a Reagan appointee and one of the most highly respected judges on the court    recused himself from the case because Wall is his    as well as his former law clerk.
