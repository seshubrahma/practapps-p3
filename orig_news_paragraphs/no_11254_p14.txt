Wang [Wengliang] holds U. S. permanent resident status, which makes him eligible to donate to McAuliffe’s campaign," the Post reported on Tuesday. But the 2009 donations to McAuliffe’s campaign, possibly from foreign nationals, may represent an even bigger legal and political problem for McAuliffe, as Cause of Action reported in 2013: Shortly thereafter [in August 2009] [Charles] Wang’s company [Hybrid Kinetic Automotive Corporation] merged with what is now GreenTech and McAuliffe was named Chairman. As GreenTech Chairman, in an email to   Haley Barbour, McAuliffe cited efforts by U. S. Senators Thad Cochran ( ) and Roger Wicker ( ) to pressure the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Alejandro Mayorkas into     visa applications that would provide Chinese investments for GreenTech. McAuliffe sent numerous emails to Director Mayorkas and Douglas Smith, Departmentof Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for the Office of the Private Sector, expressing frustration with USCIS’ slow visa approval process.
