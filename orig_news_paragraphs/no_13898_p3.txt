Beyond these symbolic moments, Obama’s leadership on matters of black equality remained too often invisible or reactionary. Obama’s presidency has also served as a   mirror on matters of race and across the policy spectrum, one whose distortions have allowed critics to view his presidency as illegitimate, subversive and a blight on the very idea of American democracy.   Furthering the ironic twist of calendrical fate that now ties him together with President Obama, Jeff Sessions,   Donald Trump’s   choice to serve as the nation’s chief law enforcement officials, fits squarely in this camp. The political genealogy of Jeff Sessions can be traced back to both the Redeemer South, where Reconstruction’s aftermath gave rise to the "strange fruit" of black bodies swinging on trees from organized racial terror and the Massive Resistance (in a term coined by Sen. Harry Byrd of Virginia) of   whites on citizens’ councils and elsewhere, who colluded with local, state, and at times federal officials to deny black folk good jobs, schools, neighborhoods, voting rights and citizenship.
