I can’t forget it, because the British press won’t let me. That day Petersen and I took a picture that would be used to label me a "  extremist" in Britain: awkwardly holding a pistol (with its shipping material still around it).    How the tables have turned.   When I met Petersen in downtown Washington, D. C. this week, he was the politico, and I was the sloppy journalist.
