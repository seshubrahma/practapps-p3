As people were leaving a concert by American pop singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena, loud explosions were heard outside the main area.   Many of Grande’s fans are teenage and   girls (they call themselves the Ariana Army) so there would’ve likely been a lot of young people in attendance. The initial reports of an explosion first came in at about 10:33 p. m. local time, according to Manchester police.
