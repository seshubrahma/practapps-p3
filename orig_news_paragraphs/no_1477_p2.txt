The governor directed the state transportation commissioner and the executive director of New Jersey Transit to submit plans by Saturday night for an "immediate and orderly shutdown" of most work funded by the state transportation trust fund. Any work that is federally funded or necessary for safety reasons could continue, Mr. Christie said. Mr. Christie, a Republican, had reached a deal with the   State Assembly earlier in the week to raise the stateâ€™s gas tax in exchange for lowering the sales tax. But on Thursday, Democratic leaders in the State Senate said they could not support the agreement because it would harm the state budget.
