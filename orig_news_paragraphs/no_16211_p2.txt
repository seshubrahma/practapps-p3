In February 2009, soon after being named secretary of state, Clinton traveled to China and urged Beijing to keep buying U. S. debt, according to media reports at the time. In an interview on Chinese television quoted by Reuters, Clinton said that China made a "wise" choice by buying United States debt instruments.
