As evangelical Christians, the Greens believe that life begins at conception, and that anything that aborts an unborn child after conception ends a human life. Hobby Lobby has 30, 000 employees, so not funding   drugs for its employees (not regular birth control, but rather drugs that induce abortions after conception) meant the company would have to pay $1. 3 million per day —  almost half a billion dollars per year —  in penalties under Obamacare.
