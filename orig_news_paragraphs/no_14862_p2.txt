Guterres acted relatively quickly to distance the UN from the report    which was compiled by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia at the request of 18 Arab countries.   On Friday, the UN said Guterres accepted the resignation of UN   general and the executive secretary of the commission that authored the report, Rima Khalaf. " The   cannot accept that an undersecretary general or any other senior UN official that reports to him would authorize the publication, under UN name, under the UN logo, without consulting the competent departments and even himself," UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
