Here’s the most important thing: Spicer used the fact that Yates refused to enforce Trump’s travel ban as evidence that she was a "political opponent" of the President and, therefore, that the White House was right to not simply take her word for it on Flynn. The problem with that explanation is this: Yates talked to White House counsel Don McGahn about Flynn being compromised by the Russians on January 26 and January 27.   She didn’t refuse to enforce the travel ban until January 30    the same day she was fired. In fact, she told lawmakers on Capitol Hill Monday she didn’t know about the travel ban when she first told McGahn about Flynn, but rather learned about it from media reports.
