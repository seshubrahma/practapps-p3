Clinton argued on Saturday that sometimes, because of the political back and forth, people "lose track with where we are" economically.   " We have come a long way since the worst financial crisis in a generation and it could have gotten a whole lot worse," Clinton said, commending Obama’s handling of the economic crash and his decision to bailout the auto industry in 2009. Clinton’s bus trip, which continues on Saturday with events in Pittsburgh and Youngstown, Pennsylvania, is also meant to fortify her support in two key swing states.
