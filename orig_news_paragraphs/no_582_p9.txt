indeed, it must happen, to avoid sticking Americans with much higher prices for imported consumer goods. But according to calculations by Michael J. Graetz, a Columbia law professor, a currency shift of that scale implies that Americans who hold foreign assets would lose $6. 1 trillion, and foreign holders of assets in the United States would gain as much as $8. 1 trillion. Meanwhile, because the dollar is the worldâ€™s benchmark currency, many businesses and governments outside the United States borrow in it, especially in   countries where confidence in the domestic currency is low. That means that a steep   in the value of the dollar generally makes those debts more onerous, and causes big trouble for countries including China, South Korea and Turkey.
