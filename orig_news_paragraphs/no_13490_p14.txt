All in all, the astonishingly high 18 national security votes on the NDAA defense bill alone that Rubio skipped are far more than anyone else in the U. S. Senate. Rick Tyler, Cruz’s campaign spokesman, told Breitbart News exclusively when the revelation was discovered that Rubio skipped all these defense bill votes. Tyler said: Marco Rubio has repeatedly attacked Ted Cruz for not supporting the NDAA, but it turns out Rubio was nowhere to be found when the bill was being debated and passed in the Senate. It’s a huge hypocrisy and an unforgivable deception.
