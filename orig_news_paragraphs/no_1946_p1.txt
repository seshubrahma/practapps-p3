Mr. Trump offered the housing job  this week to Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon who challenged him for the Republican presidential nomination. But despite expectations of a Friday announcement, Mr. Carson was "still pondering," said a friend, Armstrong Williams.

McGahn II, a Washington election lawyer who pushed to deregulate campaign finance and election laws.
