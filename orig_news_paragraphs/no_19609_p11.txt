The Committee   expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary   policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and   labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.    Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term   as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import   prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.      risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.    The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators   and global economic and financial developments.
