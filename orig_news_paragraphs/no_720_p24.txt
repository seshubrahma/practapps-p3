When I say, "That’s not unreasonable" [to not want to share a bathroom with a transgender person] it’s because women have said that to me: "I want to know," or "I’m not comfortable with someone in the bathroom, even if they, in their minds, have decided they are a woman. " Doesn’t that opinion count at all? But you don’t agree that transgender people have a psychiatric disorder.
