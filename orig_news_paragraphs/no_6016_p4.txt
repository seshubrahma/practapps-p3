Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017,   After House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) was shot Wednesday morning while practicing for the game with his fellow Republican teammates, leaders of both parties called for unity and civility. Perhaps Democrats were just following their leader Nancy Pelosi ( ). The House Minority Leader ended the truce hours before the game when she accused Republicans of being "sanctimonious" for expressing concern about violent   rhetoric that may have motivated the shooter, a rabid hater of President Donald Trump and Republicans.
