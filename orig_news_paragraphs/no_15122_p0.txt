New York (CNN) The UN Security Council failed Wednesday to so much as condemn last weekâ€™s chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of people in Syria. Russia vetoed a UN resolution condemning the killings, believed to have been carried out with sarin gas, and calling on Moscow ally Syria to cooperate with an international investigation of events on the ground. It was the eighth Russian veto of a resolution on Syria throughout the course of its civil war.
