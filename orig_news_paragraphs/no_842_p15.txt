We were hoping for the decision to be reconsidered, and this is what has happened," said Jasim   Iraq’s minister of migration, in a telephone interview. Still, it was equally likely that pressure from the Pentagon, which feared damage to the Islamic State campaign, played a significant part in Mr. Trump’s decision. In the revised executive order issued Monday, Mr. Trump dropped a provision to bar Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely, but will still freeze all refugee admissions for 120 days. David Miliband, a former British foreign secretary who leads the International Rescue Committee aid agency, denounced that decision as a "historic assault on refugee resettlement to the United States, and a really catastrophic cut at a time there are more refugees around the world than ever before," The Associated Press reported.
