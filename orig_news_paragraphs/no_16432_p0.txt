Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) Donald Trump on Thursday shelved his guiding mantra    never back down, never apologize    and did what he has refused to do in public in more than a year of campaigning. He expressed regret. Trump, reading from prepared remarks Thursday night, acknowledged that he sometimes says "the wrong thing" in an astonishing act of contrition that signaled Trumpâ€™s willingness to break from his characteristic brashness and   style that carried him to victory in the Republican primaries, but risks dooming him in the general election.
