How will it all work with Trumpâ€™s senior adviser Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, who has a long rap sheet of racial, ethnic and sexist affronts and a   war on Washington Republicans? I had gone to Trump Tower to see Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, whom Trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election, in the same release in which Bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon was mentioned first, for Kremlinologists scoring at home, and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention, given his hyperprovocative ways. But Priebus, in a sense, filled a more exotic role.
