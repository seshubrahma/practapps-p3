A Berkeley station for BART, the mass transit system, was shut down because of the disturbance, CNN affiliate KRON said. Police said they confiscated prohibited items including   flagpoles, a knife, a stun gun, helmets and signs, and flags attached to poles, KRON reported.   A police officer was treated and released from a hospital after someone threw either pepper spray or tear gas into the crowd, White said. He added that a person in the crowd was treated and released after being sprayed with "bear spray," an irritant spray used to deter aggressive bears in wilderness areas.
