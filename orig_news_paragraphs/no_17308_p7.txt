A steady stream of documents and internal emails from Democratic groups and from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman were hacked and released in the weeks and months leading up to the election, with damaging consequences for Democrats. There was also concern about attempted attacks on voter registration systems at the state and local level, though the intelligence community never said there was strong evidence that was tied to the Russian government. Voter registration databases are attractive targets for financially motivated hackers, as well. Multiple sources with knowledge of the investigation into Russia’s hacking said last week the US intelligence community is increasingly confident that Russian meddling in the US election was intended to steer the election toward Trump, rather than simply to undermine or in other ways disrupt the political process.
