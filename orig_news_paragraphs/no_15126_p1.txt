US officials have said that there is "no doubt" that Syrian President Bashar   is responsible for the attack. The US did not know prior to the attack it was going to happen, the official emphasized. The US scoops up such a large volume of communications intercepts in areas like Syria and Iraq, the material often is not processed unless there is a particular event that requires analysts to go back and look for supporting intelligence material. So far there are no intelligence intercepts that have been found directly confirming that Russian military or intelligence officials communicated about the attack.
