Pence, who has been in New York to assist with Trump’s transition, was greeted inside the theater earlier in the night by a chorus of boos and some applause. Stevie Van Zandt, a guitarist who is a member of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, blasted Dixon’s actions as a form of "bullying" and called on Dixon to apologize to Pence. " When artists perform the venue becomes your home," Van Zandt tweeted.
