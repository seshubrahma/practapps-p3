What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. They’ve wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means they’re tacitly admitting Barack Obama didn’t know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn’t care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions. Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an    Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts.
