Washington (CNN) US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order Monday that bans immigration from six   countries, dropping Iraq from January’s previous order, and reinstates a temporary blanket ban on all refugees. The new travel ban comes six weeks after Trump’s original executive order caused chaos at airports nationwide before it was blocked by federal courts. It removes out language in the original order that indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and called for prioritizing the admission of refugees who are religious minorities in their home countries. That provision drew criticism of a religious test for entry and would have prioritized Christians over Muslims fleeing   countries in the Middle East.
