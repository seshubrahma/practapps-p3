Jennifer Holliday, the   winning singer who on Friday said she planned to sing at an   welcome concert next week, on Saturday changed her mind, citing opposition to her appearance from the gay and lesbian community. Ms. Holliday, in a letter she provided to The Wrap, an entertainment news website, said she would no longer take part in any events affiliated with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president. Her decision to withdraw, she said, was influenced by an article in The Daily Beast about how her planned appearance was heartbreaking to her gay fans. She also retweeted an   piece in the Boston Globe describing Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees as "a who’s who of homophobia. "
