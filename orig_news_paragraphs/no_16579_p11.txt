In the face of recent polling, Johnson campaign spokesperson Joe Hunter told CNN the campaign would try to get into Ohio and North Carolina, but said there would be no change in strategy for the campaign in the face of the "Aleppo" comment. Those state numbers are enough to have a major impact on the election between Clinton and Trump, but he needs 15% nationally to qualify for the presidential debates beginning later this month. This is a relatively large increase from his position in 2012, when Johnson first ran for president and captured about 1% of the popular vote, but it is a far cry from anything approaching viability.   The Commission on Presidential Debates    which Johnson, along with Green Party nominee Jill Stein, sued    has an established threshold of 15% support among an average of five national polls to qualify for the debates.
