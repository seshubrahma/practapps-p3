The University, which has a boulder on campus that is often used by students groups as a billboard for promotion, was recently taken over by Students for Trump. In the morning hours of March 7th, they   the boulder red, and wrote the phrases, "Make America Great Again" and "Build the Wall".   Although their message has since been covered over with buckets of  blue and green paint, the efforts of Swogger and Rice havenâ€™t gone unnoticed. Their video of the Sanders rally has been viewed nearly 30, 000 times between Facebook and YouTube.
