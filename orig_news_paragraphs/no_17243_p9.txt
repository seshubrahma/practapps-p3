Dangerous flashpoint, The Taiwan Strait remains one of the most dangerous flashpoints in East Asia.   The return to power earlier this year by the Democratic Progressive Party, which traditionally favors independence for the island, has rekindled the prospect of instability across the Taiwan Strait.   Indeed, Tsai   has skirted around the "1992 consensus"     a tacit understanding reached between the Chinese Communist Party and Taiwanâ€™s   Kuomintang leadership that there was "one China," although either side was free to interpret what that meant.   The revisionist inclination of a DPP government poses threat to the stability of both   relations and Beijing Washington relations.
