The   populist party of Geert Wilders gained seats, but did not perform as strongly as expected. Exit polls suggested that it was tied for second place with the conservative party Christian Democratic Appeal and the     party Democrats 66   â€”   each with 19 seats. Also making a relatively strong showing were the   Greens, with 16 seats.
