Mr. Obama closed his appearance on a serious note, saluting Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter who had been held in an Iranian prison, and who attended the dinner Saturday night. He promised that his administration would "continue to fight" for journalists held against their will. And he praised the Washington press corps for trying to resist the commercial pressures to dumb down journalism, saying that "there are so many of you who are pushing against those trends. "
