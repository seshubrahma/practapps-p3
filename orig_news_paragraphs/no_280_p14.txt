In a sharp contrast to the previous two years, when the academy put forward   rosters of acting nominees, voters chose the largest number of black candidates ever. Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris each received a nod for their supporting work in "Moonlight," a poetic drama about a young black man in Miami. Viola Davis ("Fences") and Octavia Spencer ("Hidden Figures") were also nominated for supporting actress. Joining Ms. Negga in the lead categories was Mr. Washington of "Fences," an adaptation of August Wilsonâ€™s classic play about black life in 1950s Pittsburgh.
