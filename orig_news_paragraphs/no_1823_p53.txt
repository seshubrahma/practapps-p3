(I made my voyage before the summer season ended.) It’s first come first served and an easy process: Just pick out a life vest, take off your shoes and hop into a kayak (there are   and   vessels). It took a little getting used to, but once I had the hang of it, the 20 minutes positively flew by. The water between the two piers is calm and tranquil, and the views of Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge are some of the best you’ll find.
