Democrats have seized on Mr. Trump’s weight this week, with Harry Reid, the Senate minority leader, noting Tuesday that he was hardly "slim and trim," and David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Obama, suggesting on Twitter that he would rival William Howard Taft in portliness. Mr. Trump has yet to make public as much personal medical information as Mrs. Clinton has. Earlier this week, he said he would soon release new medical records, and he was expected to discuss the results of his physical on Dr. Oz’s show. During the taping, he theatrically produced what he described as the results and allowed Dr. Oz to review them, according to the brief clip released.
