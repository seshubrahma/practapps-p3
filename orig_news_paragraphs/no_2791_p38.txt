What these debates have in common is that arguing about how to define terrorism becomes a way to push and pull the contours of national identity, determining who is invited in to that identity and who is kept out. In every case, the debate is framed as one of pluralism versus security. Pinning terrorism on "multiculturalism" or   or foreign values or "radical Islam" all portray inclusiveness as somehow threatening and exclusiveness as safer. The question of whether pluralism and security are indeed in tension, or whether pluralism in fact enhances security, is one that people around the world have long grappled with.
