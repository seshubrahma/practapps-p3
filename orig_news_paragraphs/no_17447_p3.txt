The Obama administration last week nixed regulations that could have been used to reboot the George W. Bush administration’s program known as NSEERS, the National Security   Registration System, which required men under 25 from many   countries to register with US immigration authorities. Trump called for banning foreign Muslims from the US during his campaign. Obama also took action to ban offshore drilling in areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans indefinitely citing environmental reasons, a move aimed at making it more difficult for Trump to undo his legacy of progress on climate change issues. Obama has also been shipping prisoners out of Guantanamo Bay to reduce its population, although Trump has vowed to "load up" the detention facility.
