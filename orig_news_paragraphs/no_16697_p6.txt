The Clinton Foundation is actually subject to a   prohibition on providing private benefit to insiders or others, because despite its name under the law it is not a "private foundation" since it enjoys relatively   donor support. There do not appear to be any demonstrated facts that show the Clinton Foundation violated this prohibition or even the stricter   prohibition. Both foundations have also admitted to reporting errors on the annual returns they file with the IRS. Late last year, the Clinton Foundation reported that it had amended its returns for four years because it incorrectly failed to report any government grants and instead reporting such grants as "other contributions," incorrectly categorized speech fees as contributions to the foundation and, as a result, failed to report some donors that now met the threshold for reporting, and failed to report some entities related to the foundation.
