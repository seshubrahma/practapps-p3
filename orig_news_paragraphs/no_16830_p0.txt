 (CNN) Mike Pence might not have helped Donald Trump in Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate    but he certainly helped his own political future.    The Indiana governor largely batted away Hillary Clinton running mate Tim Kaine’s recitations of Trump’s most incendiary comments, dismissing Kaine’s pressure as "  lines" from an "  campaign."   He sidestepped Trump’s most politically toxic remarks    on Muslims, Mexicans, a disabled journalist and more    and showed how a more conventional Republican could attack Clinton.
