After a review by White House lawyers, the memos were changed to give officials more leeway in enforcing immigration laws, and more authority to close a   "advance parole" amnesty created by Obama.   The final memos implement most of President Donald Trump’s popular promises to enforce the nation’s immigration laws, and to accelerate repatriation of criminal illegal immigrants   —   but are being loudly criticized by amnesty advocates. However, the memos also postpone action on his promise to end Obama’s 2012   for younger illegals, his promise to reform the   contract worker program that has now provide work permits for roughly 650, 000 foreign graduates in the United States, and his call for a reduction in the annual inflow of 1 million legal immigrants.
