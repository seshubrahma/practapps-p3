Mrs. Clinton and her husband declined to be interviewed, and her campaign did not answer questions about her support of efforts to undermine the women. " The country closed the book on these matters close to 20 years ago, and there is nothing whatsoever new here," her spokesman, Brian Fallon, said in a statement. Her campaign also released statements from James Carville, Mr. Clintonâ€™s top campaign strategist, and two lawyers who worked for Mr. Clinton, saying that Mrs. Clinton had not overseen the counterattacks.
