West Bank settlers are preparing for a clash with the Israeli government. One flagship settlement, Amona, was the site of a bloody 2006 confrontation between settlers and thousands of police officers sent to raze nine homes. Now the Supreme Court has ordered that the entire outpost be dismantled by Dec. 25. Israel plans to move residents to a nearby settlement.
