A spokesperson for Schumer replied to a Breitbart News inquiry sent to his office by email on Friday: During their careers, Senator Schumer and   Sessions both met with Russian officials  —    that’s where the similarities end. Senator Schumer’s meeting was a press conference, in full view of the press and public in 2003. Senator Sessions met with the Russian Ambassador and then went on to mislead Congress about those meetings, while being put in charge of an investigation into ties between Russia and the President’s campaign.
