Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says she’ll visit the devastation caused by flooding in Louisiana, but refused to set a specific date. ["The best way to help Louisianans affected by these terrible floods is to make sure they have the resources they need today," Clinton said in a statement released by her campaign. " I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild. "
