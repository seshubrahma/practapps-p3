The U. S. media is actually quite   on the guest list: Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel, Bloomberg View’s Megan McArdle, Bloomberg LP    John Micklethwait, and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan. If one of the topics discussed at Bilderberg does prove to be uploading Henry Kissinger’s brain into a giant computer, it will most likely be handled by Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, assuming Thiel is too busy hunting the last survivors of Gawker for sport. The Guardian even describes Karp as "a bit like a younger, more hippyish Kissinger," which makes him sound perfect for the job.   LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman will also be there, and we’d best hope he isn’t the one who turns uploads Kissinger’s brain into an immortal digital demigod, or everyone on Earth is about to get   with LinkedIn connection emails.
