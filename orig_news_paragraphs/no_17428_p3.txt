The United States allowed a UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements, defying pressure from the Israeli government, which had reached out to   Donald Trump for help in pressuring the Obama administration to veto the vote.    The Security Council approved the resolution   with the US abstaining. Asked what the White House would say to Israeli officials who believe the US does not have their back, Rhodes said, "Itâ€™s just not backed up by the record. We just concluded a $38 billion tenure (memorandum of understanding) for security assistance to Israel."
