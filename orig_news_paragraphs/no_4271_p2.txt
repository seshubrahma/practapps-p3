" Executive Order    lifts the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies. Today’s order also rescinds two emergency proclamations from January and April 2014 and four drought —  related executive orders issued in 2014 and 2015. The governor’s proclamation comes after one of the wettest and snowiest winters in the state’s recorded history.
