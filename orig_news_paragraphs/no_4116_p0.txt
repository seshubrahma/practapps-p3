Linda Sarsour is a principal organizer for Woman’s March on Washington following President Donald Trump’s inauguration. [Her rise to liberal stardom following the march has occurred in spite of her support for   views and outrageous attacks on   women leaders.   Sarsour, who serves as the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York (AAANY) and who was honored by   Obama’s White House as a "champion of change," seems as if she makes it a point to attach herself to every social justice cause known to man and tie it to Palestine. For example, in November, she attached herself to the cause of blocking Dakota Access Pipeline and made sure to bring her Palestinian flag.
