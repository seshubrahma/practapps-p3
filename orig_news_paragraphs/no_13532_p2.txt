In his first visit to the White House after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama posed for the cameras alongside President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush. The decision not to participate in this tradition illustrates how bitter the campaign was, particularly for Mrs. Obama who delivered some of the most emotional arguments against electing Mr. Trump. On Thursday   Donald Trump traveled to Washington, D. C. to meet with President Barack Obama in private. Obama had invited Trump to the White House for the meeting, as is customary.
