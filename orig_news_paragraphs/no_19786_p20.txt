Moral failings perpetrated by other ideological tribes will always be easy to identify. Every institution and individual will be guilty, at times, of moral failings. And so, the moral fabric of a nation cannot survive if only the morally pure —  or only those widely seen as morally pure and employed in morally pure industries —  are given public standing to uphold substantively righteous moral beliefs. If and when a public official bullies, I shall therefore applaud every substantively sound denunciation of the behavior, be it levied by a man or woman whose entire life is filled with sin or the ideological adversary who drives me most crazy.
