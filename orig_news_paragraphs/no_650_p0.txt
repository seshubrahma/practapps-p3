When "The Good Wife" had its premiere, there was a clear line from Hillary Clinton to Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) the ambitious lawyer who came into her own after her politician husband’s sex scandal. But the show had another Clinton figure all along: Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) who hired, befriended and ultimately fell out with Alicia. A leonine liberal not allergic to money or a highball of fine Scotch, she rose in a boy’s club through alliances, compromise and knowing how much of herself to conceal. Diane begins "The Good Fight" ready for a change.
