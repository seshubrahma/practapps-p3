In my home state of Illinois, immigrants comprise 22% of the state â€™s entrepreneurs and employ more than 280, 000 people. Immigrants are almost twice as likely as native born Americans to start their own businesses. At the same time that we address our immigration system as a whole, our government should be investing in domestic job training programs that help hardworking Americans get the skills and credentials they need for a 21st century labor market.
