One of the big problems with that first doomed effort is that it conceded too many vital arguments about health insurance reform to the Democrats.

This contention is the gateway on the road that leads inexorably to the eternal hell of   nationalized medicine. Most Republicans love to talk about the superior efficiency of the free market at allocating resources, and the moral superiority of free capitalist choices over collectivist solutions imposed by force.
