In the border city of Reynosa, the Gulf Cartel has been able to overwhelm the detention capabilities of the Department of Homeland Security thus creating a humanitarian crisis as thousands and thousands of Central American illegal immigrants are brought over the Rio Grande. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the Gulf Cartel was able to make $38 million in a few months from human smuggling alone. The Gulf Cartel has also been able to successfully operate in the U. S. and kidnap American citizens that are then taken into Mexico for ransom or worse. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the most recent case of a U. S. citizen being taken at gunpoint into Mexico took place less than three weeks ago.
