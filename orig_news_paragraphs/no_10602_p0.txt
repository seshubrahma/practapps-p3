Sen. Marco Rubio is criticizing the media, urging it to report the truth about violent protests at Donald Trump rallies. ["Hope media will start to report truth, many of the violent protestors [at Donald Trump] events are ‘professional protestors,’ not grassroots," he said on Twitter early this morning.   Rubio added that there was a "whole industry of professional disrupters who go to events to disrupt them knowing cameras will gravitate to them. " "
