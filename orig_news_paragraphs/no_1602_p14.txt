Given the continuing concerns about costs and the burden that often falls to taxpayers, a larger question has emerged about whether the modern Olympics should continue to crisscross the globe as the   lottery ticket it has become. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has endorsed the view that the Olympics should be permanently located in Greece, its birthplace. Others have suggested that the Olympics rotate among four of five permanent locations. Then there are more complicated ideas, including having a "distributed" Olympics that would take place at the same time in multiple cities, using existing stadiums and avoiding overwhelming any individual city.
