Republicans will hold a   seat advantage in the Senate next year. That means if all the Democrats vote against Tillerson, Republicans can lose two of their members and still have Tillerson confirmed if   President Mike Pence breaks the tie.   In addition, aides in each party didnâ€™t rule out that some Democrats might vote for Tillerson, especially those moderate Democrats from red states up for   in 2018 and those from   states who might be naturally inclined to support the influential ExxonMobil boss. One Democratic senator who fits both of those descriptions, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, suggested he was open to voting for Tillerson.
