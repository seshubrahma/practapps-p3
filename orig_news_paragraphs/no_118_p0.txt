HONG KONG  —    Taiwan scrambled   fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday after China sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported. The transit of the aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, came amid rising tensions between Taiwan and China after   Donald J. Trump broke decades of protocol by speaking on the phone with Taiwan’s president, Tsai   after his election victory. Ms. Tsai leads a political party that has traditionally supported Taiwan’s formal independence from China.
