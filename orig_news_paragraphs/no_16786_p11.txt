, If someone perceives that they are experiencing weight discrimination, they are more likely to suffer daily stress and negative emotions than otherwise, which could cause their health to worsen over time, according to a separate study published this month in the journal Obesity. The study involved 1, 153 adults who had a body mass index classified as either overweight or obese. The adults were asked to participate in daily interviews over an   period, in which they were called each night and asked about their everyday experiences. The participants who reported having faced weight discrimination, compared with those who hadnâ€™t faced any weight discrimination, experienced more daily stress, worse emotional health and worse physical health over the subsequent eight days, said Angelina Sutin, assistant professor in the Florida State University College of Medicine and lead author of the study.
