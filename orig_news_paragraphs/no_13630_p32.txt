Cruz voted against advancing the No Child Left Behind reauthorization bill known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)   —   which still requires state standards to be approved by the USED   —   but was not present in the Senate to vote against the final bill. In a statement about the ESSA, Cruz said: The Every Student Succeeds Act unfortunately continues to propagate the large and   role of the federal government in our education system —  the same federal government that sold us failed   standards like Common Core.
