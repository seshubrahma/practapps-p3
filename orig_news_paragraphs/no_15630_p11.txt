Abedi ’behaved like a child’ According to a family friend who asked not to be identified, the boys’ father had taken his sons to Libya in   and confiscated their passports so they could n’t return to the UK where they’d been in trouble with gangs. Abedi got his passport back after telling his father he was going on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, but returned to England instead.
