In my tests, there were several occasions when Signal messages that were sent or received on my smartphone did not immediately show up inside the desktop app   â€”   though the messages eventually synchronized minutes later. Mr. Marlinspike, who is also the former head of security at Twitter, says he encourages people to report bugs so the group can continue to improve the service. Another downside is that your Signal account can work on only one mobile device at a time I could not, for instance, use Signal on both my iPhone and iPad.
