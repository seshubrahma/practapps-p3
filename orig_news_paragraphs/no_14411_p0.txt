Washington (CNN) Immigrant rights activists and Democrats are raising concerns this weekend about recent immigration enforcement actions    though immigration officials maintain that only routine actions targeting criminals were underway.   Fear is running high among immigrant communities since President Donald Trumpâ€™s inauguration    and after the recent publicized deportation of an undocumented Arizona mother of two after a routine visit with immigration officials, reports have been spreading of Immigration and Customs Enforcement stepping up its actions nationwide. The actions are the first concerted effort by ICE under the Trump administration to arrest targeted undocumented immigrants for deportation proceedings.
