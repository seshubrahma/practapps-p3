Several localities have expressed concerning about the accelerated resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions of the state. In June, L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland County Executive, demanded that Office of Refugee Resettlement director Robert Carey initiate legally required consultation proceedings with him prior to resettling refugees in his county. Carey told Patterson, in essence,  the federal government did not intend to comply with the consultation requirements of the Refugee Act of 1980. On Friday, a spokesperson for the city of Flint told Breitbart News, "city leaders have not been informed" by the federal government of plans to resettle 100 Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
