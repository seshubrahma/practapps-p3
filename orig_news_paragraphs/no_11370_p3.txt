A second or third place showing in South Carolina, and the almost certain elimination of   laners Jeb Bush and John Kasich, gives Rubio a future. Nevertheless, he has won nothing, including a South Carolina where all the money, endorsements, and conservative media like Fox News, along with the Establishment had his back. Trump, of course, still managed to win after making a handful of what looked like mistakes. He called George W. Bush a liar in the South Carolina debate last week, he said he was in favor of the ObamaCare mandate (and had to take it back) got into a battle with no less than the Pope (that the Pope started) and had to deal with some blowback regarding his   position that he was always against the Iraq War.
