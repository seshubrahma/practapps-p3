WASHINGTON   â€”    Hackers on Thursday posted hundreds of emails from a young Democratic operative that contained documents detailing the    schedules and precise movements of the vice president, the first lady and Hillary Clinton during recent campaign   and official political events. The emails included names and cellphone numbers of numerous Secret Service agents, spreadsheets with the names and Social Security numbers of campaign donors, and PowerPoint presentations showing    directions for where officials like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should walk when they arrived at events.
