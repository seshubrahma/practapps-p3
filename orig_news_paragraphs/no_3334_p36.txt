Stranahan asked Bolton for his assessment of the threat Russia poses to the United States today. " I think you have to look at this not as to whether today the Russians are going to attack us, or even tomorrow, but what the   geopolitical risks are from a Russia under an authoritarian state   —   rebuilding its military, enhancing its ballistic missiles, adding to its arsenal of nuclear weapons, crossing international boundaries in Europe with military force, annexing part of the Ukraine, threatening other Eastern and Central European countries, increasing its influence in the Middle East, and cooperating with China" was Bolton’s highly detailed reply.
