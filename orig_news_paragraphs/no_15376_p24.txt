Most of us consume   television in a completely different way now from back when everyone had three channels and waited in bed for the Carson monologue every weeknight.

It started with a glimpse of nudity on "NYPD Blue" back in the ’90s, and then everyone else making television had to up the ante    including   TV hosts.
