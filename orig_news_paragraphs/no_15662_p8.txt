US officials told CNN this week that it is likely Salman Abedi received some ISIS training by traveling to Syria in the months before the bombing, according to information gathered in the preliminary investigation. Mondayâ€™s attack on   leaving an Ariana Grande show killed 22 people, many of them children, and injured dozens more. In her first comments since the attack, Grande said Friday in a note on Twitter that she is sorry for the "pain and fear" her fans are feeling. She said the fans killed Monday will be on her mind and in her heart forever.
