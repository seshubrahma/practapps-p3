Delta Air Lines has banned a disruptive passenger who shouted   Trump and   Clinton remarks at fellow passengers on a flight from Atlanta to Allentown, Pa. last week, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday. The chief executive, Edward H. Bastian, said in a memo published on Delta’s website that other travelers on the flight Nov. 22 would receive refunds for their tickets. " This individual displayed behavior that was loud, rude and disrespectful to his fellow customers," Mr. Bastian said in the statement.
