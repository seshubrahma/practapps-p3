Mattis said during a joint press conference with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada on Saturday that a U. S. policy recognizing islands at the center of a territorial dispute between China and Japan remains the same. " Today the minister and I discussed the security situation and I made clear that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku Islands stands. The United States will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands, and as such article five of the U. S.  Security Treaty applies," he said. The following day after those remarks, China sent three Chinese Coast Guard vessels around those islands, located in the East China Sea, according to the Japan Coast Guard.
