In December 1921, Britain and Ireland signed a peace treaty, only to have civil war break out six months later among the Irish.

He felt "pushed into" serving, Mrs. Pence Fritsch said, and was reluctant to fight his countrymen. With little prospect of work, he fled to England, she said, to earn his way to America.
