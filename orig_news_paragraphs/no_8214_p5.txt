Voters aged   support Sanders   over Clinton. Among seniors, aged 65 and over, Clinton leads by a large   margin. Sanders lead among young voters is much larger than even Obama achieved in 2008. Even more promising for Sanders, the number of voters under 40 in 2008 was almost 3 times the number of voters 65 and older.
