Add to that the carping on the "rigged" election, and his assertion and that he won’t necessarily accept the results of the election ("I will tell you at the time" and "I’ll keep you in suspense") and you have a candidate preaching to his choir. Trump’s strategy was successful in that regard, but it’s not a winning strategy for independent or undecided voters.   Indeed, it’s a ridiculous debating strategy.   One of the first rules on our debate team is that when we have a panel of judges, we should try to debate for the judges we aren’t sure about, since the ones who favor our arguments are probably going to vote for us anyway.
