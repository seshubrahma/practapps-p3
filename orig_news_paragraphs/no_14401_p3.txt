Indivisible made its biggest splash just this week when some of its affiliated groups made their voices heard at GOP congressional town hall meetings. Shellshocked, It started out a couple of days after Thanksgiving, at a bar in Austin, Texas, as a conversation between a liberal husband and wife about what to do about Donald Trump. Itâ€™s morphed into a nationwide movement, comprising 7, 000 affiliated groups in all 50 states and almost every congressional district. That husband and wife, former congressional staffers Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg, were like a lot of Democrats after the 2016 presidential election    shellshocked.
