President Barack Obama ’s actions were meant to help more than 4 million undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows and apply for programs that could lead to work authorization and associated benefits.

It was a victory for Texas and 25 other states who challenged the programs arguing they represented an unauthorized abuse of presidential power.
