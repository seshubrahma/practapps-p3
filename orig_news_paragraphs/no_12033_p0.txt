BEVERLY HILLS  —    Cory Booker’s trip to California has been described as a "tryout" to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate. But the Senator from New Jersey was greeted by a largely empty room on his first stop, at an LGBT outreach event Thursday.    The event was scheduled for 3:00 p. m. but at start time there were only four people in the room, excluding three who worked for the Feminist Majority Foundation, which hosted the event.
