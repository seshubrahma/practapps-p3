"Leo Durocher" (Bloomsbury, $28) chronicles the adventures of Leo the Lip, the colorful player (briefly for the Yankees, later the Dodgers) and manager (for the Dodgers, Giants and other clubs) who stayed in the sports pages for more than 40 years. Steve Steinberg â€™s "Urban Shocker" (University of Nebraska, $32. 95) recalls a Yankees pitcher who should be better known for his name alone.
