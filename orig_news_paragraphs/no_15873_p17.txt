Sanders confirmed that the President did interview Robert Mueller as a candidate for FBI director the day before he was named special counsel of the federal investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia ties. Sanders would not, however, say whether the President has confidence in Mueller in that role. " Beyond that, what I said earlier, I donâ€™t have anything more to add," Sanders said, when a reporter asked if Trump has confidence in Mueller.
