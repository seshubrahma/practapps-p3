In 2014, Ms. Park instructed an aide to ask Hyundai Motor Company to sign a contract with a parts supplier owned by a friend of Ms. Choi’s, prosecutors said in their indictment of Ms. Choi. Ms. Choi later collected $44, 000 in kickbacks from her friend. In February, again acting on Ms. Park’s orders, the aide asked Hyundai to hire Ms. Choi’s advertising agency. Ms. Choi’s company earned $780, 000 from the account.
