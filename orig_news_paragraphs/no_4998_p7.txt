Most recently, earlier this month, at the request of Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, the city council of California’s capital voted unanimously to make $300, 000 of city funds available to assist a network of legal, education and   groups help illegal immigrants facing deportation. In yet another example of the high priority that Governor Brown places in "taking on" the policies of the federal government and President Trump, he has also proposed increasing the budget of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to support a stream of lawsuits challenging executive orders of the President. The revision to the Attorney General ’s budget includes funding for 19 attorneys and 12 other staff members.
