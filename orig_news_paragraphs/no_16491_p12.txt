Trump sought again on Saturday to draw   voters    a reliably Democratic demographic    to his campaign, noting that "Republicans are the party of Abraham Lincoln" and arguing that minorities would benefit from his presidency. " Nothing means more to me than working to make our party the home of the   vote once again," Trump said while speaking before a nearly   audience at Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst’s "Roast and Ride" event. At the same event, he referenced Clinton’s use of the term "super predators" in 1996 to describe violent criminals, a term widely seen as racist and that Clinton has said she regretted using.
