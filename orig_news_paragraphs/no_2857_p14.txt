Mr. Trump arrived on Tuesday night in Florida to celebrate Thanksgiving at his private club,    in Palm Beach, a visit intended to give the   some time with his family, and he isnâ€™t planning a packed schedule for Wednesday.

The trip is the first time since Mr. Trump was elected president that he has visited his Florida club, which played host to a few primary night victory parties.
