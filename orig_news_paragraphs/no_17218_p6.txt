Trump met with foreign policy heavyweight Henry Kissinger, as well as Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and   critic South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who are both under serious consideration for Cabinet jobs. In perhaps the most surprising news, Trump plans to meet this weekend in New Jersey with 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who was one of Trumpâ€™s most vociferous critics during the campaign (calling him a phony, and a fraud, and skewering him on Twitter for the way in which he talked about women on a leaked "Access Hollywood" tape).   Romney may be considered for a Cabinet post    possibly secretary of state    though sources close to the former Massachusetts governor say he has not actively sought a role in the Trump administration and merely agreed to meet with Trump as a gesture of good faith.   Establishment Republicans viewed the more recent developments with relief on Thursday    a signal that Trump may be giving more serious thought to addressing the deep fissures in his party.
