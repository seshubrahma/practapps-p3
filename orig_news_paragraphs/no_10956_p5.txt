State legislatures have passed laws to eliminate   abortions and improve safety standards for women in abortion clinics who choose to undergo the procedure. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, both of which have taken advantage of progressive activist judges, however, have challenged these new laws in court. " The overall political lesson is that we need to pay as much attention to our state legislatures as we do to Washington," said Steinem.
