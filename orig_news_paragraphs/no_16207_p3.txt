The 6 electoral votes in Utah have moved from solid to "lean Republican," but remain in Trump territory for now. Explore the map and make your choices, Road to 270: Electoral College map, The state of play, Looking at the totality of the new polling, the advertising buys, and candidate travel and organization suggests that Donald Trump’s best possible path to the White House goes through the upper   Belt region of the country, where he can try to turn out white working class voters in big numbers to turn states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin from blue to red.   If he were able to erase Clinton’s advantage in Florida (where there has been some conflicting polling of late) it would give him some incredibly important flexibility in putting together the rest of his map. Hillary Clinton’s mission remains turning out the Obama coalition (African Americans, Latinos, young people, single women) in record numbers    especially in states where the demographics of higher turnout among those groups can really alter the outcome such as Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida and doing so in Pennsylvania and Ohio as much as possible in order to block Trump from making significant inroads among   graduate whites.
