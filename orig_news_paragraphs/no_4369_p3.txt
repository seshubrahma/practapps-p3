The Palestinians claim eastern Jerusalem as their future capital.   Last month, a U. S. abstention allowed the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution calling the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem "occupied Palestinian territories," and demanding a halt to Israeli construction in those areas. Some of the holiest sites in Judaism are located in eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, including the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, which was home to the oldest continuous Jewish community in the world until the Jews of Hebron were massacred and expelled the Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus   —   biblical Shechem.
