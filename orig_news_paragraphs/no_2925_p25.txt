Apply the same math to California and it would have 159 Electoral College votes. And the entire state of Wyoming already has fewer residents than the average California congressional district. In Washington, these imbalances directly influence who gets what, through   minimums (no state can receive below a certain share of education funding) and through formulas that privilege rural states (early road spending was doled out in part by land area and not road use). There are policy reasons that the country might want to disproportionately spend resources on places with few people.
