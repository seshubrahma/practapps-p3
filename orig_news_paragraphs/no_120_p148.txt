My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won’t stop in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you’re young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president  —   the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I am asking you to believe.
