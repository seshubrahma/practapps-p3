Schweizerâ€™s Clinton Cash details several incidents of foreign donations to The Clinton Foundation. Both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal confirmed a few of his revelations, which are detailed in the book. For example, Schweizer notes the foundation hid four donations that totaled $2. 35 million from a Russian uranium company headed by Ian Telfer, which was a violation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Obama administration.
