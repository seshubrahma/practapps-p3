Donald J. Trump sought on Monday to move beyond a week of turmoil, using a major policy address to cast himself as a president who could bring new jobs and prosperity and warning that his rival, Hillary Clinton, would be a steward of stagnation. Saying he wanted "a conversation about how to make America great again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least," Mr. Trump unveiled plans to simplify the tax system, rethink America’s energy policy and tear up trade agreements. Mr. Trump chose Detroit as his backdrop, and his speech  —   though interrupted frequently by protesters   —   was clearly chosen to appeal to the   Americans who are at the center of his political strategy.
