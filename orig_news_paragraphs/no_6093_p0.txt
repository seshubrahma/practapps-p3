In a video that accompanies the "Troubled Times" track from its new "Revolution Radio" album, Green Day takes several shots at   Donald Trump, depicting his caricature as a crazed leader.   Also shown throughout the video are   protesters and imagery from the Civil Rights era. The lyrics written by by Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Ryan Pritchard, Frank Edwin Wright III, however, do not mention Trump by name. Lyrics as follows: What good is love and peace on earth?
