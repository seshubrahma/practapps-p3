CNN has seen Trump golfing    driving up the 12th hole on his championship course at Trump International Golf Course    multiple times during the former reality starâ€™s first two months in office. Asked about playing golf before Air Force One took off from Florida, Trump said he played "very little" over the weekend. It has also been revealed    through golf blogs and media reports    that Trump has played with top professional golfers such as Rory McIlroy, one of the   golfers in the world. While hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Palm Beach last month, Trump also played a full round with the foreign leader and professional golfer Ernie Els.
