Tom Ciccotta, a student at Bucknell University, has been removed from his position as Junior Class President after taking up a   job at Breitbart Tech and inviting conservative speakers to campus. [With no practical reason to remove Ciccotta (his term was due to expire in just one week with the end of the semester) it seems that the Bucknell student has become the latest victim of   sentiment on campus, targeted for little more than being an effective conservative organizer.   Ciccotta was, by the numbers, a dedicated and   member of Bucknellâ€™s student government. He put in over 100 hours over the course of this semester alone and attended over 75 meetings since January.
