Since the Palmdale case, Shenkman has overturned   election systems throughout Southern California, most of which had been in place for many decades, without complaint. The Orange County Register called the changes a "historic upheaval," citing "dozens" of local agencies that had been forced to change from   to district voting. Not even liberal cities are safe. Last year Shenkman sued the City of Santa Monica, which prides itself on its   "progressive" politics, and which has a Latino mayor.
