Independents remain stubbornly divided in three camps: 35 percent say they will vote for Clinton 34 percent prefer Trump and 31 percent are undecided.

The margin of error in the 2, 007 registered voter poll is +   2 per cent, and it also shows Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green candidate Jill Stein failing to reach double digits.
