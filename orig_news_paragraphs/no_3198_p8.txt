She praised Israel for having robust feminist and gay rights movements and mused that any activists hoping to spearhead similar movements in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, and Pakistan, would end up being "jailed, tortured, raped, and murdered, perhaps beheaded. " Women like Rasmea Odeh and Linda Sarsour, the faces behind Wednesday’s women’s strike as well as January’s Women’s March, are not feminists, Chesler said. As Breitbart Jerusalem reported, Odeh, who together with other strike organizers are calling to "decolonize Palestine" and protest the "white supremacists in the current government," is a convicted terrorist accused of bombing attacks in the late 1960s that killed two Israeli university students and injured nine more.
