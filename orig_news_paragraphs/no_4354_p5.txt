The third organization suing for the visitor logs is the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.   The Institute, a $60 million effort, was launched last year by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation together with Columbia University.   Numerous Knight Foundation projects are also financed by Soros. The Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas at the University of Texas at Austin, for example, was also the recipient of a $270, 000 grant from Sorosâ€™s Open Society Foundations.
