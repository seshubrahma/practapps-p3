First, what we have to do is elect a president who will name the enemy," Pence told Breitbart News Saturday in a live interview on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125. He continued, I was at the Reagan Presidential Library a few days ago, and one of the things Ronald Reagan did in his time was he named then the Soviet Union as an Evil Empire. All the fashionable beliefs at the time said that that was irresponsible, not what a president should do, but first you have to name your enemy. Donald Trump has been willing unlike this president and unlike Hillary Clinton to name radical Islamic terrorism.
