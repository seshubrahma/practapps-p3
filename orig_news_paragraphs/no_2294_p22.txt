Kenneth Griffin, the hedge fund manager, has spent more than $120 million in Palm Beach to buy and combine four parcels of land, which brokers say worked out to be more than $200, 000 a linear foot. Mr. Rybolovlev’s property is considered among the best on the island   —   close to the town center and with direct access to the beach. Some brokers say it could well top the Griffin price.
