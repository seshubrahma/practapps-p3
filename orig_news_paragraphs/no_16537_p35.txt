Early Saturday evening, Trumpâ€™s campaign issued a statement outlining its "new civil rights agenda," highlighting his previously stated positions on public safety, education and job security. It says a Trump administration would work with law enforcement at all levels of government    and even the Mexican government    to fight crime, in particular gangs, violent offenders and "the international drug cartels. "  The statement called for school choice and allowing states to use federal money to "help parents and students" find alternatives to public schooling, including charter schools, religious schools and home schooling.
