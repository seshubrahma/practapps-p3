By choosing Judge Gorsuch, Mr. Trump has forced Democrats to reckon with the kind of obstructionism they long lamented from Republicans. In their   opening statements, Democratic senators made no attempt to quibble with Judge Gorsuchâ€™s qualifications or temperament. While several members have already said they will vote against him, the prospect of an   fight has concerned some more moderate Democrats, particularly those who face   in states that Mr. Trump won. If Judge Gorsuch cannot meet the   threshold needed to overcome a filibuster, Republicans could change longstanding rules and elevate him on a simple majority vote.
