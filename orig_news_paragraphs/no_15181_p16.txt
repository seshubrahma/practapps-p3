They argue that the   entitlement approach to poverty and social services hasn’t succeeded. The nation’s poverty rate hasn’t changed dramatically since the 1970s, when programs like SNAP and Medicaid were first introduced and the percentage of children in poverty hasn’t declined since 1970, five years after Medicaid and other "War on Poverty" welfare programs were first signed into law.   " We don’t know what works best," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute.
