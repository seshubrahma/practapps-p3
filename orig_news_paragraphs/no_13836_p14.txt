And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall’s full cost. According to Trump’s website, those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico.

And the one step that could provide the required amount of money    remittance seizure    would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.
