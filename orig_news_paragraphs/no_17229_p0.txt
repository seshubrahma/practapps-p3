Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country is ready to cooperate with the new US administration, as he gave his annual     address Thursday in Moscow. His comments come at a time when   relations have sunk to their lowest point since the Cold War, amid tensions over Syria, Russiaâ€™s actions in Ukraine and allegations of Russian meddling in the US presidential election. US   Donald Trump has, however, praised Putin as a firm leader and the pair have indicated they want ties to improve.
