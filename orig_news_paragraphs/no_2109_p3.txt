Among the Republican proponents of the registry program is Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team. Mr. Kobach, an     helped to devise the program while at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration. Last month, before a meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kobach was photographed with a document of   proposals that included, under the rubric "Bar the Entry of Potential Terrorists," a proposal to reintroduce the registry program. That information, as well as Mr. Trump’s comments on the campaign trail, prompted Democratic lawmakers, mayors from cities with large   populations and some business leaders in Silicon Valley to call on Mr. Obama to undo the legal framework that undergirds the program.
