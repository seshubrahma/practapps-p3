Though neither Trump nor Clinton has a majority of the delegates needed to secure the nominations of their respective parties, each could clinch in California. On Monday, while campaigning in Indiana, Cruz predicted that no Republican candidate would win enough delegates to secure the 1, 237 threshold. If Cruz wins in California, or holds Trump to a small victory, he could stop Trump from amassing enough delegates. Trump will likely need to win California to secure victory, even if he wins Indiana on Tuesday.
