The Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their promised future state. The Palestinian foreign ministry issued a statement criticising Trump as well as his Democrat rival in Novemberâ€™s election, Hillary Clinton, accusing her of overly favouring Israel at the expense of the Palestinians. " The state of Palestine will not serve as a bargaining chip for gaining the Jewish vote in the United States," the statement said.
