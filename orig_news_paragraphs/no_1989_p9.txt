Syria and the importance of fighting Islamic extremism are areas in which Mr. Putin’s interests and Mr. Trump’s statements seem to coincide. Mr. Putin, who has repeatedly accused the Obama administration of mollycoddling extremists, said the United States needed to focus on "a real rather than   threat" and join Russia in fighting international terrorism. The " " threat seemed to refer to fear in Washington and many European capitals that Russia has become a menace to security since it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and supported   separatists in eastern Ukraine. Ignoring American efforts to destroy the Islamic State, Mr. Putin said the problem of international terrorism "is being solved by our servicemen in Syria," where Russian warplanes have helped President Bashar   regain control of large sections of Aleppo, once Syria’s biggest city, from rebels, some of whom are supported by the United States.
