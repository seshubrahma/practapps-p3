The Senate minority leader, who for years has taken to the Senate floor to assail the Kochs for taking advantage of campaign finance laws to covertly funnel money into defeating Democrats, seems more than willing to go on the attack for Ms. Cortez Masto, who chooses her own words very carefully. While receiving an award on Thursday from a progressive group whose leadership praised him for "holding the Koch brothers accountable," Mr. Reid declared that the goal of the Kochs and their allies was to turn the United States into an oligarchy with a chosen few running the nation for their personal benefit. " They want to make sure that they pick the next Supreme Court justices," said Mr. Reid, who regularly refers to Mr. Heck as a fraud and a phony.
