Revere had instructed the sexton of a Boston church to climb to the top of the steeple  —   unobserved by the church’s Loyalist minister   —   and signal the patriots of Charlestown with lanterns to indicate which route the British were taking: One if by land, and two if by sea. (Please tell me most American schoolchildren still know that line.)
