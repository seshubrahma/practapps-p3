Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s fledgling diplomatic skills are being put to the test as he visits Turkey to discuss the fight against ISIS and then Belgium for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers this week. Tillerson’s stop in Turkey Thursday likely poses the real challenge. Trump’s top diplomat is there, on the eve of a massive push against ISIS’ Syrian stronghold Raqqa, to persuade Ankara that its sworn enemy    the Kurds    are critical partners in the effort to defeat the terror organization. In Brussels, Tillerson will reprise the Trump administration’s refrain that it’s "essential" NATO partners boost their defense spending and do more to fight terrorism.
