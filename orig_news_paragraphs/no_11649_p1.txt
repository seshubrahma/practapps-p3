Over a short, intense few hours of momentous world events, Donald Trump revealed that not only does he understand the grave threats that free and civilized people face, but also that he has the wisdom and temperament to be leader of the free world. Mr. Trumpâ€™s address to American Israel Public Affairs Committee Monday night was thoughtful and considered. It was not one of his rambling   campaign speeches, which are enormously entertaining for supporters but maddening for people trying to piece together his specific policy positions. At AIPAC, Mr. Trump laid out a clear and concise vision about the threats we and our allies face from the terror and hatred spewing from Islamic radicals in the Middle East.
