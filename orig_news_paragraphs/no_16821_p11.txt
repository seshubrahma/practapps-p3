Pence told CNN’s Dana Bash last month that it was "inarguable" that Putin is a stronger leader than President Barack Obama. Pence goes further than Trump on Syria military action, He also suggested the United States "should be prepared to use military force" against the Syrian government if Russia doesn’t stop supporting President Bashar   ’s regime.   Pence also said that "what America ought to do right now is to immediately establish safe zones" to protect Syrian refugees    a departure from Trump, who has praised the idea of safe zones but put the burden on Middle Eastern countries to establish and maintain them.
