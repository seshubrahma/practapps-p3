WASHINGTON   â€”      Donald J. Trump met in the last week in his office at Trump Tower with three Indian business partners who are building a   luxury apartment complex south of Mumbai, raising new questions about how he will separate his business dealings from the work of the government once he is in the White House. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump described the meeting as a courtesy call by the three Indian real estate executives, who flew from India to congratulate Mr. Trump on his election victory.
