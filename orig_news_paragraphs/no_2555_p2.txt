In addition, the State Department announced the closing of two waterfront estates  —   one in Upper Brookville, N. Y. and another on Maryland’s Eastern Shore   —   that it said were used for Russian intelligence activities, although officials declined to say whether they were specifically used in the   hacks. Taken together, the sweeping actions announced by the White House, the Treasury, the State Department and intelligence agencies on Thursday amount to the strongest American response yet to a   cyberattack. They also appeared intended to box in   Trump, who will now have to decide whether to lift the sanctions on Russian intelligence agencies when he takes office next month.
