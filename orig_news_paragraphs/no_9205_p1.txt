An exclusive interview with Breitbart News after the event, Congressman Gohmert reiterated his concerns about Israel and Donald Trump: I heard Donald Trump say during the debate basically that he understands both sides in the problems between Israel and the Palestinians and he would be a  broker the deal. The problem is in that situation you have people on one side people who want to kill all the children of Israel, and on the other side they just want to live free. For those of use who believe in God and the Bible, on one side you have the children of Israel who occupy the land that they were given by God over 3, 000 years ago. On the other side, you have people who want to wipe out the children of Israel.
