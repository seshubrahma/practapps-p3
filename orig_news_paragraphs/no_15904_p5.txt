For example, Bill Self, the head coach of KU’s basketball team, dominated the tax code with the same ease that his Jayhawks dominate Iowa State. Self set himself up as a   business, using Brownback’s tax policy to pay $0 in state income taxes on that part of his pay, which was the bulk of his compensation.   While I love KU basketball and our head coach, the fact that he paid no income tax on $2. 75 million in compensation shows he is as shrewd with his taxes as he is on the sidelines, but that isn’t fair to Kansas families scraping to get by.
