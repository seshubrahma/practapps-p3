The police raided their home and office, leaving with computer equipment. But that was no preparation for what would happen after the protestersâ€™ harassment of Mr. Maduro that night in September. The protest, which was soon known as news spread online by its hashtag, "#cacerolazo," or the "great pot banging," was a deep embarrassment for Mr. Maduro. That week the opposition had amassed an estimated one million people in Caracas to protest food shortages and demand his ouster.
