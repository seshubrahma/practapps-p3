 (CNN) Donald Trump is under fire for his vulgar comments about women in an "Access Hollywood" tape    and one woman alleges he exhibited similar behavior in at least one other incident. A friend whom CNN anchor Erin Burnett has known for years recounted an experience she had with Trump in 2010 that echoes his words in the tape that surfaced Friday. In March 2010, the woman    who asked not to be identified    met Trump in a boardroom in Trump Tower.
