" For Saudi Arabia, we are all Houthis," said Haroon   of the   Amran Cement Factory, which once employed 1, 500 people before it was bombed  twice. Plant workers showed us the remains of munitions they had collected, including pieces of at least one   a cluster bomb unit that contains 10   submunitions. They are manufactured by Textron Defense Systems of Rhode Island.
