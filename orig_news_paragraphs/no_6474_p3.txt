The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sided with the Obama administration, holding that the term "sex" in federal law is ambiguous, and that courts should defer to  ’s private letter as an authoritative declaration of law. Subsequent to   ’s letter, Obama’s Justice Department and Education Department issued a joint "Dear Colleague" letter as an official policy, declaring that both Title IX and Title VII —  which generally prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex —  require all schools and employers to embrace transgender policies, and that anyone declining to do so can be sanctioned for violating federal law. However, on Feb. 22, 2017, the Trump administration rescinded the Dear Colleague letter.
