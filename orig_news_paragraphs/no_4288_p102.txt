I’d like to remind you that many of the great people in history were born as orphans or adopted. People like Julius Caesar, Bach, Steve Jobs, Aristotle, Louis Armstrong, Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Bill Clinton. What if some of these people hadn’t existed? Don’t say anything about Bill Clinton  …     without him we wouldn’t have had Sick Hillary’s hilarious campaign!
