Former FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about "shifting explanations" for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration. [Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administrationâ€™s statements about the matter "confused me and increasingly concerned me. " He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay.
