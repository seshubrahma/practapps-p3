She condemned what she called the "Russian occupation" of the Ukrainian territory, giving some reassurance to US allies in the region. The Russian Embassy in Washington made clear its opposing perspective in a tweet Tuesday afternoon: "We will continue to patiently explain to the new US administration why Crimea is Russia. "
