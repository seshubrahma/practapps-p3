The Washington Post is reporting that Clinton is leading Trump by 79 percentage points among   but the fine print in the article says Clinton’s score is 82 percent and Trump’s score is 3 percent  —   leaving 15 percent who did not pick either candidate. So if Trump gets just    of the undecided   voters, he reaches Romney’s 2012 level. Some concerned people lie to pollsters.
