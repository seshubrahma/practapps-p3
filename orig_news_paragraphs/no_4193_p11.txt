With the SPLC, the "hate watch" group is the hater. Unlike some toothless nobody claiming to be a member of the   KU KLUX KLAN, the SPLCâ€™s slanders are instantly amplified by the media megaphone in somber interviews conducted by the most easily fooled people in the universe, American journalists. Breitbart, Daily Caller and others have done a great job collecting the hoax hate crimes since the election, but we need a central clearinghouse to keep up with the volume. How about someone found the Northern Poverty Law Center (NPLC) to document actual hate crimes and expose the hoaxes being spit out on an assembly line by the SPLC?
