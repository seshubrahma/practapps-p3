Five years ago, World Policy Journal used a basket of indicators to identify Israel, alongside Finland and Singapore as the world’s three most innovative countries. At the time, Israel had the largest number of startups in the world outside the United States    3, 850, or one for every 1, 844 Israelis, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center. It had more companies listed on America’s   Nasdaq than the entire European continent. The pace has only accelerated since then.
