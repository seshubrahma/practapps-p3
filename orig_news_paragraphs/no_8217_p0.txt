Citing his more than forty years in America, the Republican Hindu Coalitionâ€™s founding chairman Shalabh "Shalli" Kumar told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon, "I see America going down the drain. People say that civilizations last only a certain amount of time. I would go as far to say if we have eight more years of Obama, in terms of Hillary Clinton, she will be worse than Obama in my opinion and then the end of this American civilization anyway, will be there. We are bound to become more like Greece with a lot of problems. "
