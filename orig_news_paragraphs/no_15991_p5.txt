We reported on this claim last October. That small loan from Trump’s father was worth $1 million, probably given before Trump entered the Manhattan real estate market in the early 1970s. If Trump’s father made the loan in 1968, the year his son graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, that $1 million would be worth $6. 8 million in today’s dollars, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. Trump has built up a    net worth, expanding his father’s lucrative real estate business to new heights.
