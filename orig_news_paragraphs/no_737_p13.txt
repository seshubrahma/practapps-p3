Anxiety is also high in corners of the moneyed financial world that have benefited mightily from the current system. Private equity has for years guarded the special treatment of "carried interest," a loophole that lets billionaire fund managers pay low capital gains tax rates instead of higher income tax rates on the fees they charge clients. Mr. Trump, taking up a call from his predecessor, Barack Obama, campaigned to end the loophole, and because Mr. Ryanâ€™s plan is silent on the matter, it could be in jeopardy. Another fear is the impact of a move away from the tax deduction for interest on corporate debt in favor of the immediate deductibility of business expenses.
