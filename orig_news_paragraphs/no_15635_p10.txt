Montana allows voting by mail and, as of Tuesday, more than 250, 000 ballots had been returned, according to Michael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida. (Here’s a link to the Montana Secretary of State’s site.) How many votes remain to be cast    and how many of those voters are truly undecided and might be swayed by an episode like this    remains to be seen. And, because so many of the details are unclear at the moment, it’s not at all certain how the story even turns out over the next 24 hours.
