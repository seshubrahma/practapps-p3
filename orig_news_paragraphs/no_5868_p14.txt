I can’t comment on the contend of any material or who may have masked or unmasked names. That’s not something I can get into. But if there is anyone in the course of our appropriate oversight that should be brought before the committee, I welcome that opportunity. What I don’t welcome, though, is trying to besmirches the reputation of someone who served the country very well.
