Trump was the first candidate to weigh in, voicing his reaction in an interview on Fox and Friends Thursday morning calling for law and order, leadership, and unity. But Clinton’s campaign appears focused on spreading existing media to the press, with no new statement from the Democratic presidential nominee. A taped interview of Clinton’s appearance on the comedy web series Between Two Ferns was released on Thursday and the campaign hosted a press conference call with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to question Trump’s ties to Russia. The campaign also released her weekly podcast, with her daughter Chelsea Clinton as a featured guest.
