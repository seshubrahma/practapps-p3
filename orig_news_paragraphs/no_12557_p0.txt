Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s "Hannity," host Sean Hannity took on Univision’s Jorge Ramos on the issue of immigration and the candidacy of Republican presidential   Donald Trump, who has taken an hawkish approach on the issue of immigration on the campaign trail.   Ramos attacked Trump for his declaration that the border should be sealed in the wake of this week’s terrorist attacks in Brussels. Ramos also suggested Hannity had not sufficiently defended his colleague Megyn Kelly from Trump’s criticisms. Hannity accused Ramos of misrepresenting the GOP  .
