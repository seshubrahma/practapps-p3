"    In an interview separately Friday with the AP, Deputy Attorney   General Rod Rosenstein acknowledged that Mueller could expand his   inquiry to include Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ and   Rosenstein’s own roles in the decision to fire Comey, who was   investigating the Trump campaign. Rosenstein, who appointed   Mueller as special counsel to take over the investigation, wrote   the memorandum intended to justify Trump’s decision to fire   Comey. Sessions met with Trump and Rosenstein to discuss Trump’s   decision to fire him despite Sessions’ pledge not to become   involved in the Russia case. "
