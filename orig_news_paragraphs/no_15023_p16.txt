Hadi al Abdullah, a citizen journalist, arrived at the scene two hours after he says a single gas rocket hit the town.   Abdullah, who had common side effects of a nerve gas attack     blurred vision, a splitting headache and lethargy    told CNN the scene was chaos. Families died in their homes, and in the streets, children risked exposure looking for their parents.   At first, people were unaware it was a gas attack, Abdullah said.
