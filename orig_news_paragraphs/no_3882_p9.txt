In striking down Section 6, the portion of Executive Order 13780 in which President Trump limited the number of refugees to 50, 000 annually, Judge Watson —  for one of the first times in American history —  asserted the supremacy of the judicial branch over the legislative and executive branches. Not even Judge James Robart, who stopped the first executive order of the same title (Executive Order 13769) went that far in his usurpations. Robart notably excluded Section 5 d of Executive Order 13769, in which President Trump limited the number of refugees in FY 2017 to 50, 000, from his temporary restraining order. Also on Wednesday, 4th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Theodore Chuang, another Harvard Law School graduate Obama appointee and former bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, issued a similar ruling.
