(Recall that an immigration bill created in part by Marco Rubio, who in a slightly different universe might be Mrs. Clinton’s   opponent, was one vote in the House of Representatives away from becoming law not long ago.) In the category of administrative action, Mrs. Clinton was vague but clear about her intention to use the machinery of government to nudge things in workers’ favor. She said she would "continue to crack down on wage theft" and abuse of overtime rules, suggesting that she would, if anything, seek to expand Obama administration rules to make more workers eligible for     pay and use government authority to fight employers that try to shortchange employees. The policy steps she described had mostly been put forward by her campaign already, so it is hard to describe the speech as a step toward the left, in hopes of corralling Sanders voters, or to the center, in hopes of broadening her appeal to the general electorate.
