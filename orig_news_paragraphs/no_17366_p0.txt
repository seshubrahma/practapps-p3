 (CNN) A US official familiar with the US intelligence assessment of the Russia   hacking said the understanding is that the operation was carried out with sophisticated hacking tools, the equivalent of those used by the US National Security Agency. The use of the advanced tools suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved in the hacks, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that it was more than a US intelligence assumption at this point. But neither of the sources said they knew of specific intelligence that directly ties Putin to the attack.
