Pence’s visit to West Virginia comes on the heels of a stunning defeat of the Republican alternative to Obamacare, dubbed the American Health Care Act, in the House. The vice president canceled a previously scheduled trip to Little Rock, Arkansas, on Friday to help with the whip effort.   Pence joked Saturday that he "could have used a WWE fighter up on the Hill yesterday," a nod to the professional wrestling company owned by the family of Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, who introduced Pence to the crowd. The vice president conceded in the speech that "Congress wasn’t ready" to repeal the bill and acknowledged that a "handful" of Republicans were to blame as well for the failure.
