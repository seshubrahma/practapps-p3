The Gorsuch appointment dwarfs in importance anything else Trump can or will do in the next four years and more than balances the inevitable disappointments and missteps he will send our way. Some people will think I am enthusiastic about Gorsuch only because he is likely to uphold Trumpâ€™s Executive Orders on immigration, but they are mistaken. I earnestly hope he will have the opportunity in the next few years to overturn bad precedents in Kelo (2005) Chevron (1984) and Roe (1973) decisions and many others.
