Their whole agenda offers liberty at a price, and compulsion to those who can’t afford to pay it.   Individually and in corporations, Americans are nominally "free" to do many things they can’t actually afford to do, because the State will extract huge fees, or impose a crushing regulatory burden on the endeavor.   It’s particularly rough on small operations and upstart competitors, which is why Big Business loves Big Government. (Bernie Sanders would bring the aforementioned collapse down on our heads years ahead of schedule, and we’d probably end up with   nationalization, instead of    manipulation.)
