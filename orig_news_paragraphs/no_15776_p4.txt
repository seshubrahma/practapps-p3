Gulf allies have repeatedly criticized Qatar for alleged support of the Muslim Brotherhood, a nearly    Islamist group considered a terrorist organization by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.   The UAE accused Qatar of "funding and hosting" the group in its statement announcing the severance of ties. It also cited Qatarâ€™s "ongoing policies that rattle the security and sovereignty of the region as well as its manipulation and evasion of its commitments and treaties" as the reason for its actions. Saudi Arabia accused Qatar in its statement of "adopting" groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood.
