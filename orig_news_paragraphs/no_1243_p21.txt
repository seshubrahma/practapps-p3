The American missiles, according to the Russian military, destroyed a warehouse of mat√©riel and technical property, a training building, a canteen, six   aircraft in repair hangars, and a radar station. Evgeny Poddubny, a Russian television reporter who was at the air base, said nine planes had been destroyed. The strike plan was put together at the United States Central Command in Tampa, Fla. and alternatives were developed within hours of the chemical attack. When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis briefed Mr. Trump on Thursday, the options had already been winnowed to a Tomahawk cruise missile strike at Al Shayrat.
