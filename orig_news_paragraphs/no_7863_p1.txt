I notice that somebody tallied up in the debate Saturday night that the word ‘liar’ was used 22 times. We don’t use that word where I come from, because when you make that kind of allegation, we look back at our founding fathers, for example, and realize that Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations, and now we have them hurled out as if making that allegation somehow makes it true and makes it stick.   I will say this. The things I heard Donald Trump say, you would never want a president of the United States speaking like that from the podium.
