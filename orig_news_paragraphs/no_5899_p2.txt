Donald Trump kept his promise to nominate a conservative judge to the supreme court, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year. Despite opposition from Democrats, on April 7th Neil Gorsuch was confirmed as the 113th justice of the U. S Supreme Court, which could help cement a conservative majority on the SCOTUS for decades. Congratulations to Justice Neil Gorsuch on his elevation to the United States Supreme Court. A great day for America!
