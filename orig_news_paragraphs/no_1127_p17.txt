Early in Nawaz’s 2012 memoir, "Radical: My Journey Out of Islamist Extremism," there’s an   scene. The narrator, an irreligious, N. W. A.  child, has resorted to strapping a knife under his shirt for fear of the gangs of skinheads that stalk his Essex suburb, Southend. He is 15, and on this afternoon, he is with his older brother, Kaashif (identified by a pseudonym in the book) and a friend who has converted to Islam. Neighborhood racists have chased the boys with baseball bats and now have them cornered and outnumbered.
