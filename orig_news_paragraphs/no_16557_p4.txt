But the apparent shift only further muddled Trump’s position on immigration, less than a week after Trump’s speech in Phoenix, which aimed to clarify Trump’s stance on a core issue in his presidential campaign. In the week before that speech, Trump suggested he was "softening" his stance and would be open to a pathway to legal status for   undocumented immigrants    before shifting away from that days later. Trump reaffirmed in his immigration speech last week that no undocumented immigrants could hope to obtain legal status under his administration without first leaving the US, but did not say outright that he would deport all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. Trump’s latest repositioning Monday on the question of legal status came one day after key campaign surrogates and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, gave conflicting answers about whether the nominee’s immigration plan still includes mass deportations.
