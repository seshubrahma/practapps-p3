That there are adherents to this program, not all Muslims by any means but a considerable number of them, and many of them run mosques and otherwise have dominant positions, that thanks to the work of the Muslim Brotherhood  —   to pretend that that’s not a problem is, I think, extraordinarily dangerous and one of the things the Koch brothers ought to be called out on," he said. " If they’re going to suggest that people, and I think both Trump and Cruz in their ways have seriously called attention to these sorts of problems  …     at least they are calling the public’s attention to a real danger, that is, sharia adherent Muslims seeking to impose that program on all of us through jihad of the violent kind, or the Muslim Brotherhood stealthy kind, that’s something that we need leadership on," he added. Gaffney believes both Trump and Cruz "have done a real public service by allowing us to have the conversation we must as a nation have about the nature of this jihadist enemy, the fact that it is not only a problem in parts of the Middle East and now in Europe, that represents real dangers for our interests, but that they are actually building the infrastructure in this country to wage jihad here, as well.
