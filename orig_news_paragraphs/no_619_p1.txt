The Holocaust could have been prevented. We know it could not have taken place had the Jewish state been established a few years earlier," the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in 1998, standing amid the ruins of an   crematory. He had just led Mr. Kushner and thousands of other teenagers waving Israeli flags in a procession through the campâ€™s gates and past the barracks. As part of the commemoration, the group would soon leave Poland and fly to Israel, to complete the journey from slaughter to Zionist rebirth.
