Palmer Luckey’s girlfriend deactivated her Twitter account after Gizmodo, Gawker’s technology vertical, published a hit piece that delved into her private life, personal Instagram pictures, and exposing her political views, despite her lack of newsworthiness. [In their article reporting on the recent revelations that Luckey has been funding a   organization, Gizmodo reporter Bryan Menegus dedicated over half of the piece to Luckey’s   girlfriend, posting information and pictures from her private life, whilst criticizing her   and Trump views.   " Luckey is also in a longterm relationship with Nicole Edelmann, aka Nikki Moxxi, a cosplayer, vocal member of the GamerGate movement, and active Trump supporter," wrote Menegus, dedicating more words in the piece to Luckey’s girlfriend than the millionaire himself.
