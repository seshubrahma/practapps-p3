Around 1, 510 Danes moved away from Malmö in 2016 while only 1, 040 arrived in the city, shrinking the total number of Danes living in the city which is just across the border from Denmark. Besides immigration, the rest of the population increase was made up by a   baby boom in the city. 5, 120 children were born in Malmö in 2016 while some 2, 471 people passed away. The population increase is one of the largest in Malmö since 1969 according to Peter Karpestam, community strategist for Malmö.
