Conservative author and commentator Ann Coulter triggered an outrage spasm on Twitter yesterday evening when she suggested that opinions on what it means to be an American carry more weight when they come from people who were actually born in the country. [It took just two tweets from Coulter, one about CNN journalist Fareed Zakaria, and another about guest Danielle Pletka, to send progressives (and a fair few   conservatives) over the edge.   I like hearing CNN’s Fareed Zakaria ask in a thick Indian accent, "What kind of America do we want to return to? "  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter)
