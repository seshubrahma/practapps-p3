American intelligence officials did not cite threats against domestic airports, but one said the Transportation Security Administration has been on heightened alert at several airports. It was not clear if that alert was related to the new restrictions on electronic devices. The restrictions follow other recent changes the T. S. A. has made in aviation security. Two weeks ago, the agency adopted enhanced   searches for passengers at United States airports, a response to what it said were weaknesses in airport screening measures.
