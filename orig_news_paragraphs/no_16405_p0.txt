Washington  (CNN) A hacker’s release of personal contact information about House Democrats triggered a series of "sick calls, voicemails and text messages," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Saturday.   The California lawmaker was responding to the latest hacking incident, into the House Democratic campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which on Friday night published members’ personal cell phone numbers and some private email addresses. The hacker going by "Guccifer 2. 0" claimed credit.
