A swift repeal may be a prelude to further deregulation of the telecommunications industry. Republicans said President Barack Obamaâ€™s appointee to the F. C. C. Tom Wheeler, had created a slew of overbearing rules for broadband providers that would put them at a disadvantage relative to internet companies like Google and Netflix. Those internet companies are not regulated by the F. C. C. but are increasingly in competition with telecom companies for online streaming customers. Lawmakers and Republican regulators at the F. C. C. have said they plan to target the 2015 classification of broadband as a utilitylike service that is strapped with strong regulatory oversight.
