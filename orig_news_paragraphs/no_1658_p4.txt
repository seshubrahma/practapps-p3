We want a cultural shift of people being able to know what they want and how to talk to the people in their communities, so that in the future, when there are political leaders that want to demagogue   issues, they do hit resistance," said Levi Russell, the director of public affairs for Americans for Prosperity. After Americans for Prosperity spent more than $100 million during the 2012 election, yet failed to take back the White House or the Senate, the Koch network undertook a major   and overhaul. It is spending $3 million on the training initiative, which officially began in February 2015, and plans to expand it next year. The effort has taken on newfound urgency because Mr. Trump has shown that Republican voters will support a candidate who denounces trade agreements and rejects the   doctrine the Kochs have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to push.
