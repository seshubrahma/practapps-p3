President Trump has said that the border tax could boost U. S. jobs, but Marlow wondered whether the tax will have any consequences for small businesses that rely on imports, such as job losses. Marlow said that 97 percent of importers are small business and asked Brady whether the tax would make it harder for small businesses to conduct business. Brady said that foreign products receive a lot of special tax breaks, and "competition is best for consumers when everyone is taxed the same. " Brady also advocated for a "fairer, simpler tax code" and said Americans will soon be able to file taxes with less paperwork.
