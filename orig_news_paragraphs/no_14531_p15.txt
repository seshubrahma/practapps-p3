South Sudanâ€™s president is this man, Salva Kiir, and this is his long time rival and vice president, Riek Machar.    Civil war broke out in 2013 after the president accused the vice president of an attempted coup.   Machar was sacked and forces loyal to each side began fighting.    The conflict also has a strong ethnic dimension.
