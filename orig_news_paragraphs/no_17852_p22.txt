His recent contretemps     with BuzzFeed over that website’s decision     to share the specific contents of the "golden shower" memo, a     story CNN first broke, is another example of Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy and, in so doing, missing the forest to yell at     another tree. Tapper defended Trump     from BuzzFeed, saying, "The president has a right     to be mad," as though what mattered was Tapper’s infallible     sense of right and wrong and not the larger picture. Tapper     framed the stories as though they were in opposition to each     other when they were actually mutually reinforcing,     with BuzzFeed’s elevating CNN’s above a kind of       blind item. Tapper recast a genuinely thorny     question of journalistic ethics as simplistic, supporting the     bully who yells "fake news" and perpetuating a paradigm of     "good media" and "bad media" to indemnify his institution from     a president who  out anyway.
