Governor Pence is an experienced public servant and a solid conservative whose policies have led to the longest period of uninterrupted job growth in Indianaâ€™s history," Priebus said in a statement.

Their winning ideas are in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, whose plans are merely more of the failed Obama policies which have sent debt skyrocketing and paychecks slumping.
