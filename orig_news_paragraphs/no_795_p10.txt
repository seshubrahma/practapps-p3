It was their first meeting and the discussion included how to "enhance communications," the Pentagon said. Discussing the fighting in Iraq, General Townsend also said that some   Islamic State fighters had sought to escape from Mosul disguised as civilians, but that they had been detained. He said that there were 12, 000 to 15, 000 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, some 2, 000 of them in western Mosul and in and around the nearby town of Tal Afar. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has presented the White House with his recommendations on how to step up the military campaign against ISIS, which President Trump vowed to "demolish and destroy" in his address to Congress on Tuesday.
