The possibility that the band from the    college, founded by former slaves in the small town of Talladega, could perform sparked controversy    and resulted in two dueling petitions. College President Billy C. Hawkins has the petitions    one organized by a current student in favor of performing and the other by a Talladega graduate against taking part    CNN affiliate WVTM reported. Hawkins was expected to announce his decision Wednesday, school spokesman Greg Wilson told CNN. But another school official, spokeswoman Veronica   told CNN late Wednesday that any decision was unlikely to be announced during the evening.
