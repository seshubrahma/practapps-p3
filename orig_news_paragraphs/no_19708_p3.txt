It was, in a sense, a test of the political boundaries for a party that insists it has won a broad mandate from the voters. If Trump could get away with all manner of offensive comments, damaging revelations, ethical malfeasance and still get elected president, what would stop lawmakers from neutering a pesky ethics office that had ensnared many of them (and Democrats, too!) in investigations? As it turned out, Trumpâ€™s victory did not mean the end of public scrutiny it did not immunize politicians from nasty headlines or angry phone calls, emails, and tweets. Republicans backed away from their ethics gambit, but as Ryan made clear, they are intent on acting swiftly on an ambitious policy agenda to dismantle key parts of the Obama presidency and replace them with   conservative reforms.
