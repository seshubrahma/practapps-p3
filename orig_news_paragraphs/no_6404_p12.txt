In the weeks following Nordstrom’s letter affirming the brand would be continued, boycott leader Shannon Coulter of #grabyourwallet stated that she tracked how much of the Ivanka Trump line was carried on the retailer’s website. Coulter attests that an early December count of Ivanka Trump items available on Nordstrom’s website numbered 71, within weeks of Nordstrom’s email. Little over a month later there were only 26 items, and as of this week, just four items remained visible in a search of the website. It was February 2 that Nordstrom’s announced it would stop carrying Trump’s line due to sales numbers according to NBC News.
