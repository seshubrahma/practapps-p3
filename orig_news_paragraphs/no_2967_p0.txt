WASHINGTON   —    President Obama designated two new national monuments on Wednesday, protecting 1. 35 million acres of federal land surrounding the Bears Ears Buttes in southeastern Utah and about 300, 000 acres around Gold Butte in Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas. The monuments are Mr. Obama’s latest effort to protect public lands and waters from development and to nail down as much of his environmental legacy as he can before Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency on Jan. 20.
