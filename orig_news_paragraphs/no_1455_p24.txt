Fla. Mr. Trump was flanked by bottles (and cases) of   wine,   water, and a mound of raw steaks, which he tried to pass off as his brand. Even Mr. Trumpâ€™s private 757, emblazoned with his name across the side and a tool for his businesses, now occupies a central role in his campaign imagery, rolling up to airport hangars during primary rallies as a symbol of power and success. People in the crowd gawk, pointing to the plane, unprompted, as a reason they believe in Mr. Trump. Yet some Republicans still think Mr. Trump should simply disentangle the personal (and business) from the political.
