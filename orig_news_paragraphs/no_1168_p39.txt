" In January, when The Times and others reported on Ms. Huddy’s settlement, representatives for Fox News and Mr. O’Reilly dismissed the allegations. Fox News is now in a legal battle with Ms. Tantaros, the former   personality who is suing the network and Mr. Ailes after turning down a settlement offer of nearly $1 million. Mr. O’Reilly is not a defendant, but in the suit Ms. Tantaros said that in early 2016 Mr. O’Reilly had asked "her to come to stay with him on Long Island where it would be ‘very private,’" and told her "on more than one occasion that he could ‘see [her] as a wild girl,’" according to court documents.
