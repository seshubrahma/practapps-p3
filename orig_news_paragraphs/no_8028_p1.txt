This is precisely the kind of confusion the left loves to use to dishonestly smear normal, decent Americans who are in no way racist but simply believe in the rule of law. By conflating illegal aliens with   legal immigrants such as Judge Curiel, Mr. Trump does a massive disservice to a vital American cause and severely undermines his own political campaign. Also, it makes Mr. Trump sound like he is desperately afraid of what will come out in the civil lawsuit against him over Trump University  â€”   an issue that precisely zero of his supporters care about.
