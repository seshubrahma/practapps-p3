my dad worked for 34 years as an engineer for Norfolk Southern, driving coal trains in Virginia. He put both myself, and my brother, and my sister  —    all three  —   through college, and everything was good. Those jobs don’t really exist any more, and you know he has a pension, most people who are working hard now have lost their benefits.
