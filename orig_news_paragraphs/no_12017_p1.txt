New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman reported that Tillerson was expected to meet with Trump today.   Tillerson is a surprising choice, particularly for establishment political forces who urged Trump to select Mitt Romney for the job. Romney signaled interest in the position, appearing publicly to recant his opposition to the  â€™s victory. It also shows that Trump will start fresh with his diplomatic team, rather than selecting a   politician.
