In 2016, 63 percent of applicants, not including those who dropped their cases during the review process, received asylum or some other form of protection, up from 46 percent in 2015. Most applicants in the last few years have been from El Salvador and Honduras, which have been convulsing with gang violence. The increase in asylum petitions in Mexico is also in part due to the rise in detentions on the countryâ€™s southern flank, an effect of an   plan begun in 2014 to better control the flow of people and goods crossing the   border. After being stopped by the immigration authorities, some detainees have come to learn that they may be eligible for asylum, either through word of mouth from other detainees or during screenings with immigration officials.
