Trump has claimed NAFTA has taken American jobs and has been one of the worst deals signed by the United States.   Ruiz Massieu said the government of that country would be meeting with the Trump administration in the coming months in order to discuss NAFTA.

The new willingness to discuss trade comes after as Breitbart Texas previously reported Mexican politicians have claimed that a Trump presidency would be as disastrous as a"hurricane" to the economy
