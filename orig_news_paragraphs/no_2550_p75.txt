Their relationship went back to the   when they were each other’s dates for a homecoming dance at J. E. B. Stuart High School in Falls Church, Va. On the rainy, dark afternoon of Dec. 18, Ms. Moore was among the roughly 350 mourners crowded into the Fourth Universalist Society church on Central Park West. Nearby sat Mr. Slonim’s wife and their sons. Speakers included his two sisters, who recalled the Superman costume he wore as a boy his    Dominic Moore, who described his generosity with the swag bags he picked up at parties the   film producer Bruce Cohen, who reminisced about his days with Mr. Slonim in middle school, at Yale and on the red carpet and the former Allure editor Ms. Wells, who spoke last.
