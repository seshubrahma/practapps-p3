Trump turned to social media again late Monday when he retweeted supporters who blasted CNN’s Jeff Zeleny for reporting that debunked the  ’s claims of voter fraud as baseless.   On Tuesday, he unleashed a new controversy on Twitter, saying that those who burn the American flag should perhaps be jailed or lose their citizenship. The Supreme Court has twice ruled that flag burning is an expression of free speech, so Trump’s tweet raised new fears about his attitude towards the Constitution that he will swear to defend January 20.
