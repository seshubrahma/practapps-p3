Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s transition is being marked by sharp internal disagreements over key Cabinet appointments and direction, both for internal West Wing positions and key national security posts, sources involved in the transition team tell CNN. One source with knowledge of the transition described it as a "knife fight."   The split has put traditional Republican operatives such as Reince Priebus    named Trump’s chief of staff Sunday    against more   influences such as Steve Bannon    the   leader of Breitbart News    who will be Trump’s chief strategist.
