The obsession over Trump’s worth, both on his part and the part of outside observers, is something that would not get a definitive answer through Trump’s tax returns. Trump’s statement, along with those financial disclosure forms, that his "net worth is in excess of $10 billion" wouldn’t be confirmed or proven false by Trump’s annual returns. But the returns would provide a clearer window into Trump’s individual finances    most notably his adjusted gross income    and shed more specific light on his finances than the disclosure form, which requires candidates only to list the values of the holdings in broad ranges. Trump, for his part, has said repeatedly he has no problem releasing his returns    and downplays their potential political impact.
