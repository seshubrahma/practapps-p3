The Democratic nominee for president rallied with supporters and reached out to her GOP rival Donald J. Trump’s voters Friday at Cuyahoga Community College, just outside of Cleveland. ["I want to say something to people, who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent," said Hillary R. Clinton, who wore a dark green pant suit as she walked around a   stage carrying a wireless microphone and referring from    to printed notes at the podium.   " I know you may still have questions for me," she said.
