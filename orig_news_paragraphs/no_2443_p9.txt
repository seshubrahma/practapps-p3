" Once the president makes a decision they’re doing something it’s the Service’s job to make that secure, regardless of the situation, whether a   a war zone or the middle of Fifth Avenue. " "We accept a president for who they are and their particular lifestyle and nuances," added Mr. Heintze, who is currently the chief executive of Hillard Heintze, a security firm. While Fifth Avenue remains open to vehicle traffic for now, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York office, David Beach, did note that security arrangements could change at any moment.
