Washington (CNN) Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will not be speaking at the NAACP Annual Convention in Ohio next week, the civil rights organization’s president and CEO said Tuesday. After days of speculation, NAACP’s Cornell William Brooks told CNN that Trump had declined the group’s invitation to address its members in Cincinnati at their conference, which is being held this weekend. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is scheduled to speak, Brooks told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room." "
