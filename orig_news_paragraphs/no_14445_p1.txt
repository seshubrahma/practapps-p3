Some at the EPA are reportedly turning to the app to speak out confidentially against current administration policy on the environment. " The committee is concerned that EPA career officials’ decision to utilize encrypted messaging tools in fact circumvents federal   requirements and is an attempt to shield communications from production in response to (Freedom of Information Act) or congressional requests," Reps. Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, and Darin LaHood, the oversight subcommittee chair, wrote in a letter. The committee’s Democrats said they could not verify the conduct alleged in the reports but said federal records laws must be followed.
