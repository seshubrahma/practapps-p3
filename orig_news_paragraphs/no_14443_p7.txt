Trump’s growing skepticism about Flynn, however, did not prevent the national security adviser from spending the weekend before his ouster with Trump at his    resort during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Spicer’s attempts to put out the firestorm are unlikely to end the saga, not least because several prominent Republicans on Tuesday joined Democrats in calling for congressional probes into Trump’s ties to Moscow, an explosive issue given allegations by the US intelligence community that the Kremlin intervened in the presidential election to help him. Tuesday’s developments also left key questions in the intrigue unanswered    including why it took Trump more than two weeks to push Flynn out after he learned that his national security adviser had not told the truth to Pence. Flynn was eventually asked to resign on a dramatic day of confusion and conflicting messages from the West Wing, hours after the publication of a Washington Post report that revealed the Justice Department’s warning to the White House counsel’s office.
