If you want to see what’s really going on with immigration policy, look at the cash. Take a look at a list of the top lobbyists on the issue of immigration and it’s a   wonderland. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, Qualcomm, Motorola, Google, and, of course, Facebook are all the household names that are spending millions of dollars to influence politicians on immigration. You may also remember that Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg went   on the immigration issue, forming a new   immigration reform group called FWD.
