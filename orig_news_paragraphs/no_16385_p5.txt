Soon we’ll all be driving U. S.  muscle cars again    believe me! Trump’s retro vision of what makes America great    namely,   middling skilled,   manufacturing jobs that are highly vulnerable to automation    is a major political liability. Yes, it taps into the gnawing sense of economic and cultural dispossession felt by many   workers.   But it doesn’t speak to the aspirations of   voters who now mostly work in offices, use digital technology to boost their productivity, and understand that their jobs depend both on keeping their skills up to date and on their companies’ ability to succeed in global competition.
