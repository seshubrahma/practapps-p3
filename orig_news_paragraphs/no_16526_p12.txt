Professor David Studdert of Stanford University, an expert on health law who has tracked data on medical malpractice lawsuits, said gastroenterologists such as Bornstein have about a 10% chance of facing a new medical malpractice suit each year. " Over a career, it would be the norm rather than the exception that a gastroenterologist would have a few claims filed against him. Thatâ€™s not an outlier situation," Studdert said.
