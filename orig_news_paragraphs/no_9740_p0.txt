A small gaggle of   Trump protesters stood along a police barricade on lush San Vicente Boulevard in my adopted home town of Santa Monica on Wednesday evening. Many of them backed Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) and between shouts of "Dump Trump" (and worse) they debated whether Sanders and Trump are in fact the same. [The idea horrified one   woman, but a few of the men said they were confident some Sanders fans would vote for Trump over Hillary Clinton.   Certainly, Sanders and Trump are tapping some of the same reservoirs of public discontent.
