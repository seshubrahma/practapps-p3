Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said fewer than 10 people were working in the offices at 1717 Pennsylvania Avenue, a number that would not grow beyond two dozen until after Nov. 8   —   and then only if Mrs. Clinton won. None of the job seekers are eager to talk either, at least on the record, but they are trying to show their usefulness in other ways. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has already designated 35 people to serve as coordinators or senior partners for its foreign policy advisory committee.
