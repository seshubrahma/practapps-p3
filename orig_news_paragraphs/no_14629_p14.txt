Trump’s closest advisers have also previewed dramatic changes to the federal government budget. At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, Steve Bannon, a top Trump aide, said that new administration’s aim was "deconstruction of the administrative state," a comment many federal workers saw as a pledge to weaken regulatory agencies. Monday, Trump vowed "a budget of great rationality" that would be unveiled in "great detail" during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening. He wasn’t specific about where he planned to cut spending, saying only he aimed for a more streamlined federal government without listing any specific agency or program that might see its budget slashed.
