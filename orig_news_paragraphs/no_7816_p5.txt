Marlow summed up the state of Project Veritas’ investigation: "You’ve infiltrated a Clinton Super PAC. Not only have you exposed that they claim to be communicating regularly with the Clinton campaign, which is illegal, but they are putting in massive amounts of resources to quite aggressively create violence during the Trump rallies, and then plan to blame them on Trump. " After Marlow played a clip from the undercover Project Veritas video, O’Keefe said it was "evidence of criminal campaign coordination violations," since "a Super PAC can’t work with Hillary’s campaign.
