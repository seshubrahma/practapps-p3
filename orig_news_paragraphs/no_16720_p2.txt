Neither police dashcam nor   footage shows Scott pointing a gun at police officers. At one point in the   video, there is a view of Scott from his right side and he has his arm by his body, but it is unclear if there is a gun. " You canâ€™t clearly identify what, if anything, is in his hand," attorney Justin Bamberg, who represents the Scott family, said at news conference Saturday evening.
