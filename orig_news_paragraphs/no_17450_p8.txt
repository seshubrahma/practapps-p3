The United Nations blamed the Arabs for the violence and aggression meant to undermine the Resolution and forcefully take land, and the Spokesman for the Arab Higher Committee readily agreed.   If there was ever an occupation of Palestinian territory under international law, it happened between 1948 and 1967, when two of the invading Arab armies, Jordan (West Bank) and Egypt (Gaza Strip) occupied territory that they had taken through aggressive action    the kind of aggressive action that the new Resolution explicitly reminds us is forbidden under international law.

The Green Line was drawn for no other reason than to mark off on a map how far the two invading armies had managed to get.
