Among other things, the Sanders campaign took issue with the DNC’s scheduling of the   debates, saying the committee was purposely choosing times where viewership would be lower. The tensions reached fever pitch in May, when Wasserman Schultz openly criticized the Vermont senator’s response to a chaotic scene involving Sanders supporters in Nevada and even compared the situation to a "Trump rally."                                             The constant controversies led many in the party to believe that Wasserman Schultz had become more of a distraction than an effective leader of the party. The breaking point came over the weekend, when leaked DNC emails showed that committee staffers had deliberately tried to sabotage Sanders’ campaign, sparking fresh uproar and calls for Wasserman Schultz to resign.   Her exit, coming after Hillary Clinton accepts the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday night, still isn’t coming soon enough for some critics.
