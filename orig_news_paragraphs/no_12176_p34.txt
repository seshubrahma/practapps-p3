After the defeat of Rep. Tim Huelskamp ( ) by an   primary challenger with the help of Ryan —  who broke his promise to conservatives to put Huelskamp back on the House Agriculture Committee, from which he was removed by Boehner as retaliation for voting his conscience —  conservatives in the House are furious with Ryan. Rep. Paul Gosar ( ) another strong conservative, is similarly facing a tough battle down in Arizona. " If the speaker’s inaction to support current incumbent members of the House continues, he will have problems being reelected speaker of the House," a senior GOP aide from an unaffiliated office whose member voted for Ryan for Speaker when Boehner went down told Breitbart News.
