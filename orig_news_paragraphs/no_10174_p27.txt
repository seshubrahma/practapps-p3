In 1975, Clinton served as the defense lawyer for Thomas Alfred Taylor, a    factory worker accused of raping Shelton after luring her to his car. Taylor pleaded down to ‘unlawful fondling of a minor’ and served less than a year in prison after Clinton was able to block the admission of forensic evidence that linked her client to the crime. Shelton also tweeted about her suffering at Hillary’s hands. I don’t care if Trump said gross things.
