Local police agencies should not automatically hand over undocumented immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I. C. E. aka La Migra) to be detained for deportation. It is not the duty of local police agencies to act as immigration agents. Lastly, people should demand a just immigration policy that allows honest working people to live and work in the U. S. with a path to citizenship.
