A Trump administration official said Mr. Tillerson knew many of the regional players from his time at Exxon Mobil. The decision on Bahrain also suggests that Mr. Tillerson is likely to deal similarly with Saudi Arabia, the largest and most powerful Sunni force in the region. The Obama administration deepened its rift with its Gulf allies in December over the conflict in Yemen when it blocked a transfer of precision munitions to Saudi Arabia because of concerns about civilian casualties that American officials attributed to poor targeting. But Mr. Tillerson has signaled he favors reversing that decision, and allowing Raytheon to sell the Saudis about 16, 000 guided munitions kits, which upgrade   dumb bombs to smart bombs that can more accurately hit targets.
