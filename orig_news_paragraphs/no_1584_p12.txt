_ 4. Michael Phelps, who already held more Olympic gold medals by far than any other athlete, won his 20th and 21st tonight. His win in the   butterfly was loaded with meaning: He beat Chad le Clos, the South African who defeated him in this event at the last Olympics. Phelps’s   routine during Monday night’s semifinals included this fearsome grimace, now viral as #PhelpsFace, made while le Clos warmed up nearby.
