: CNNâ€™s Dana Bash is reporting that Cruz allies are going trying to get Cruz on petition tonight in order to nominate him in a symbolic move. [Note: Cruz and his allies must consider how much harm this will do this his presidential chances in 2012. In their insular worlds, they think everything revolves around the "GOP Smart" set and "professional" conservatives. Cruz risks turning off conservatives and "somewhat conservative" voters who are already suspicious of him.
