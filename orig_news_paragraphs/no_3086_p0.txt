Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer is pushing an ad campaign targeting former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump’s pick for Secretary of State. [The ad, launched by Steyer’s NextGen Climate   group, claims that as CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson put his company’s interests first and did business with Russia.    But Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, has his own record of doing business with the Russians. In 2010, Steyer’s hedge fund Farallon Capital Management profited from a sale of its stake in a Russian oil firm to a investment firm owned by Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko, according to the Free Beacon.
