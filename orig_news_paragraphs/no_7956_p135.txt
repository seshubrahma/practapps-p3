: Rubio has a Beltway fan club. In Virginia’s 8th congressional district, situated mostly inside the Washington Beltway, Rubio is currently crushing Trump 46 percent to 19 percent, by far his best showing anywhere in any primary in the country so far. The even better sign for Team Rubio: There’s a ton more votes in that part of Virginia to be reported, meaning that he’s likely to narrow his current 37 percent to 32 percent statewide deficit.
