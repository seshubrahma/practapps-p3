Kowalski testified that he considered the comment a joke. In a recent interview with CNN, Kowalski said Sessions played a pivotal role in getting the case against the Klansmen off the ground. Kowalski said the slaying of the young black man, Michael Donald, was initially seen by local authorities as the result of a drug deal gone bad, even though his body was found hanging in a tree across the street from a member of the Klanâ€™s residence. Kowalski said Sessions was supportive of his idea to convene a grand jury to investigate whether the killing was racially motivated and therefore qualified as a federal civil rights crime.
