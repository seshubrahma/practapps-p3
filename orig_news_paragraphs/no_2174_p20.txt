__ 8. New Jersey closed one of its most notorious cold cases, convicting this woman of murder 25 years after her    son disappeared. A bit of blue blanket found with his remains was the key. Investigators recently went back and found three people who could testify that the blanket was from the boyâ€™s home, allowing prosecutors to draw the damning connection.
