The United States’ decision to deploy the missile technology brought new scrutiny to China’s policies toward North and South Korea and suggested that its attempts to please both countries in hopes of averting a crisis had fallen short. " To put it bluntly using a common Chinese expression, it has wanted to have a foot in two boats," said Deng Yuwen, a current affairs commentator in Beijing who has sharply criticized North Korea. Yang Xiyu, a former senior Chinese official who once oversaw talks with North Korea, said China was worried that the deployment of the system would open the door to a broader American network of antimissile systems in the region, possibly in places like Japan and the Philippines, to counter China’s growing military as much as North Korea.
