Schumer "has generally worked well with Republicans even though he can be a fierce partisan," said Jim Kessler, who was a senior aide to Schumer on Capitol Hill for eight years and now is senior vice president for policy at Third Way. " He has a belief that politics is a rough sport but it can be played fairly and cleanly. If you play the game that way even if you take a shot at him he feels that it is fair and doesnâ€™t ruin the relationship," Kessler said.
