If the speaker’s inaction to support current incumbent members of the House continues, he will have problems being reelected speaker of the House," a senior GOP aide from an unaffiliated office whose member voted for Ryan for Speaker when Boehner went down told Breitbart News. Conservatives and the House Freedom Caucus in particular have already proven they have the  votes to take out a sitting Speaker using a mechanism that Founding Father Thomas Jefferson put in place in the House Rules —  what’s called a motion to vacate the chair. While early, that senior GOP aide confirmed to Breitbart News that with Ryan’s behavior here in Wisconsin and in Washington, D. C. "there are ongoing discussions that the Speaker and leadership getting involved in Republican primaries may" lead to use of such a mechanism. At this point, the aide said, there does appear to be enough angst in the conference to oust Ryan if such a vote came up.
