’ ’    I am talking about Sen. Ted Cruz, who called Trump a   "pathological liar" and "utterly amoral"  —   and  even though   Trump never apologized for threatening to "spill the beans" on   Cruz’’s wife and suggesting Cruz’’s father was   involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. ’ ’    Most of all, I’’m talking  a man whose   pained, blue eyes suggest he desperately wants to cry for   help.
