For instance, Anwar   the New   jihad propagandist and "spiritual advisor" to   terrorists was the son of migrants from Yemen Syed Farook, the   San Bernardino terrorist was the son of Pakistani migrants Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooter was the son of a woman who emigrated from Palestine and Muhammed Youssef Abdulazees, the Chattanooga shooter who murdered four U. S. Marines was an immigrant from Kuwait, who naturalized at the age of 6. In a December letter to the Obama administration demanding the release of the immigration histories of those connected to terrorism, Senator Jeff Sessions wrote: "We are dealing with an enemy that has shown it is not only capable of bypassing U. S. screening but of recruiting and radicalizing Muslim migrants after their entry to the United States. The recruitment of terrorists in the U. S. is not limited to adult migrants, but to their young children and to their U. S.  children
