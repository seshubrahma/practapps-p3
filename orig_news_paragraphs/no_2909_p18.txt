Rumors about Franklin D. Roosevelt’s health, for example, pervaded his final presidential campaign in 1944, but he campaigned vigorously and his aides kept the extent of the heart disease that would kill him the following year out of the news. More recently, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and Senator John McCain, each of whom was the Republican presidential nominee while in his 70s, faced questions about their physical condition. " The physical demands of running for president, even with private planes and Secret Service protection, are more difficult than the mental demands," said Scott Reed, who managed Mr. Dole’s 1996 campaign.
