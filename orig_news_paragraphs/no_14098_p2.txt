Monday’s committee vote split along party lines, with Republicans backing Trump’s nominee and Democrats opposing.   During the vote, Rubio said he still had reservations about Tillerson, but looked favorably on the Texan’s support for NATO and his recognition that "Russia’s claims on Crimea are illegitimate. " Rubio said he came around to supporting the nominee because "given the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy, it would be against our national interests to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy."
