BAYONNE, N. J.  —   Nicole Adamczyk’s drinking water used to slosh through a snarl of pipes dating from the Coolidge administration   —   a rusty, rickety symbol of the nation’s failing infrastructure. So, in 2012, this   port city cut a deal with a Wall Street investment firm to manage its municipal waterworks. Four years later, many of those crusty brown pipes have been replaced by shiny   ones, reflecting a broader infrastructure overhaul in Bayonne.
