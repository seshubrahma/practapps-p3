Corey Stewart, President Donald Trump’s former Virginia campaign manager, has carved out a niche for himself as the populist challenger to   GOP operative and 2014 U. S. Senate candidate Gillespie. In addition to making the fight against illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign, Stewart made headlines with his pledge to defend against the removal of any of Virginia’s   monuments to the state’s Confederate Civil War heroes by   agitators. Earlier polling had Stewart down significantly to his more   rivals who have been reluctant to wholeheartedly line up with the   populist base on issues like immigration. The poll has   former U. S. Congressman Tom Perriello up eight points in the Democratic primary for the same office.
