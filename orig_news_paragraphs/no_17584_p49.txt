We have a process of what we call   "believability weighting" votes. I won’’t go through it at length,   but each person assesses each other person’’s credibility on   different dimensions, because people are strong and weak in   different things. Some people have subject matter expertise in   one thing. Some people tend to be creative but not reliable, and   others are reliable but not creative.
