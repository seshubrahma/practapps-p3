Here we go. UPDATE 10:03 A. M. James Comey has walked into the room where is going to testify in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Folks at Union Pub don’t really seem to care much as they are engaged in deep conversation, very loudly, so loud one cannot hear the television. UPDATE 10:02 A. M. Comey’s written testimony published last night basically proved he had nothing on Trump, and this whole case is going nowhere.
