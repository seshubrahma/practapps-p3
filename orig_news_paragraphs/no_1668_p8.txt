We’ll also invite on guests: the colleagues we admire at The New York Times, filmmakers, artists, writers, scientists, and regular people in our daily lives, like Jenna’s energy healer (no joke). We’ll debut new episodes of Still Processing on Thursdays, on all the usual places you find podcasts, including iTunes, Google Play Music, Stitcher and The New York Times itself. One more thing: We want to hear from you!
