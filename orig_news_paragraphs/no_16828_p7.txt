Thirty minutes into this debate, Mike Pence is demonstrating why he was a smart pick as Donald Trumpâ€™s VP.   He appeals to those conservatives who have been dissatisfied with Trump, by demonstrating both good temperament and familiarity with policy.

Tim Kaine, on the other hand, seems to be content to take the Donald Trump approach to debating    interrupting, hectoring, and insulting.
