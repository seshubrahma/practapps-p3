Since March 7, "Charging Bull" has faced off against "Fearless Girl," a statue of a girl posed with her fists on her hips that was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors, a financial firm based in Boston. Mr. Di Modica said that "Fearless Girl" was an insult to his work, which he created after the stock market crashes in the late 1980s. " Sheâ€™s there attacking the bull," he said.
