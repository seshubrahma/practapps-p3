This would seem to push back at the idea, put forth by the   industry, that the rules around how and which schools gain access to aid hinder student achievement. A disproportionate percentage of   veteran, and minority students enroll in   colleges, and the industry has long argued that constricting its reach would harm these students. Yet the new data released by the administration and this working paper seem to suggest that these students, on the whole, fare okay when such regulations exist, particularly when they have a chance to enroll in schools that are less expensive and have the same (and in many cases better) employment outcomes. It’s important to point out that it’s still too soon to know how students who attend the   schools will fare.
