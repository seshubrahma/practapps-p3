Welcome to the Supreme Court, rookie, Gorsuch joins the court as it rounds the final turn of a term set to conclude by the end of June. Last week, the justices held their regular   conference to discuss pending petitions. After the conference concluded, the court announced that Gorsuch had not participated presumably because he needed time to adjust to his new job and prepare for upcoming oral arguments. The results of the conference will be announced Monday morning at 9:30 a. m. ET.
