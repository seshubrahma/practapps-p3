" It is clear that in terms of both outside help and   that Harry Reid is calling in every favor and connection he has and that this is about continuing his legacy," said Brian Baluta, a spokesman for Mr. Heck. The Heck campaign is eager to link Ms. Cortez Masto to Mr. Reid, and at times it can be hard to tell from its Twitter feeds whether it is running against her or Mr. Reid. Mr. Baluta is correct that outside groups are supporting Ms. Cortez Masto, including the League of Conservation Voters and the Senate Majority PAC, a group run by Democrats with connections to Mr. Reid that has spent nearly $2. 5 million on ads against Mr. Heck.
