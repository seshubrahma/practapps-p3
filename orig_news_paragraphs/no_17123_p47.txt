Freed slaves, who were often malnourished and had few clothes and little shelter, died by the "tens of thousands," he said. The federal government responded by creating the nation’s   national health care system, directed at newly freed slaves. It was called the Medical Division of the Freedmen’s Bureau. The division built 40 hospitals and hired hundreds of doctors to treat more than a million former slaves from 1865 until it was shut down in 1870 after losing congressional funding, Downs said.
