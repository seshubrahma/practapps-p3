Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump’s budget proposal includes a $1. 3 billion cut to the US Coast Guard, congressional sources told CNN Tuesday. The cuts would be applied to an operating budget of about $9 billion, which hawks on the Hill were quick to slam as too deep a reduction to the military branch’s funding. Two sources familiar with the administration’s FY2018 budget request told CNN the plan is to boost the Department of Homeland Security’s total budget by 6% up to $43. 8 billion. That increase would primarily go to border security and would be paid for with the Coast Guard cuts and reductions to other agencies.
