In order to receive SCAAP funding, the state’s prisons must give the Department of Justice a list of names of illegal aliens and how much time they have served behind bars. In 2015 alone, the Colorado prison system harbored 1, 992 illegal aliens, who made up 7. 8 percent of the state’s prison population, at a cost of $59. 7 million to the taxpayers. But that amount of money only includes the amount spent on state prisons.
