Several officials said the fact the orders have been put on hold was an encouraging sign the   process was working, with the White House now considering the expertise of career officials after failing to consult national security agencies before rolling out new immigration policy to disastrous results.   Chief among the concerns of designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization, officials said, is the difficult position such a designation would create for Iraqi Prime Minister Haider  . Abadi is a key partner with the US in the fight against ISIS, but Iraqi forces also rely on support from the IRGC. There is also concern about US military and embassy personnel in Iraq who could become a terror target.
