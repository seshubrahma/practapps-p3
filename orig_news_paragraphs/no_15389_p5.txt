And there are yet more differences between Macron and virtually every other President or Emperor France has ever known. First, he has no real political backing or party. He bolted from the Socialist government of Francois Mitterrand and founded his own "movement" a little more than a year ago, then stuck his finger in the eyes of the leaders of every other established party.   Moreover, the French have now elected a President without the kind of overwhelming mandate that Jacques Chirac managed against Le Pen’s father 15 years ago, when Chirac surged to an  % victory, making next month’s legislative elections even more important for the stability and direction of France and Europe itself.
