Consent decrees mean that these cities have agreed to work with the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, under court supervision, to overhaul their police departments, enact certain reforms and improve relations with their respective communities. Sessions said he believes these consent decrees lower police morale, and he opposes the federal governmentâ€™s role in "dictating to local police how to do their jobs    or spending scarce federal resources to sue them in court.
