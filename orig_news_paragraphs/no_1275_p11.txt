Mr. Kushner, 36, a government neophyte who has taken on a much larger portfolio as a top West Wing aide and foreign envoy, was said to be displeased after hearing that Mr. Bannon made critical remarks about him to other aides and Trump associates while he was in Iraq recently. Mr. Bannon has told confidants that he believes Mr. Kushnerâ€™s contact with Russians, and his expected testimony before Congress on the subject, will become a major distraction for the White House. Kushner allies have also raised the issue with the president of the increasingly unflattering coverage that Mr. Kushner is receiving from Breitbart News, the   website that Mr. Bannon used to run. But Mr. Bannon has his own core of supporters outside the White House.
