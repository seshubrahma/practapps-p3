Opinions of who won the debate closely match the    results. Nearly 37 percent of Republicans said Trump won the debate, while 25 percent said Cruz won the debate. The 12 point spread separating Trump and Cruz on debate performance is the same margin between them on a hypothetical vote. Perhaps the most interesting finding is that the combined vote for Rubio and Bush is just 25 percent in their home state.
