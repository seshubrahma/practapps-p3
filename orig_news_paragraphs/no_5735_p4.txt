Ari Melber reported that companies like GM said that their decision to announce the new jobs wasn’t because of Trump, but rather part of their already planned expansions. Trump has met or spoken with several CEOs of major companies who have announced big job plans in America after his election, even before his inauguration as president. Melber said that Trump’s impact on the jobs announcements were "very small or nonexistent" " There’s a fantasy football aura to all of this," he said, suggesting the companies were serving shareholders first, not responding to Trump.
