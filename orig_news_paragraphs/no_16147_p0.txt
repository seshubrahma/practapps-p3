Washington (CNN) For Donald Trump, politics    like real estate    is a family business. The presumptive Republican nominee’s search for a running mate revealed the intense and increasing role of three of his adult children, Donald Jr. Eric and Ivanka Trump, along with his    Jared Kushner, in the billionaire’s unorthodox political operation.   Trump offered the vice presidential slot to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Wednesday, CNN has learned, and the Indiana governor accepted.
