The comedy had received $250, 000 for an Emmy marketing campaign, but executive producer Chuck Lorre and the stars decided to donate their budget to support the organization, which is facing budget cuts under the American Health Care Act.   Explaining their decision, star Allison Janney told "Access Hollywood": "It just seems like now is a time to do something like this    as the House of Representatives voted to defund Planned Parenthood. "  Janney, who plays Bonnie on the series, is a   advocate for the organization. Janney said her   worked with Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger and her mother once sat on the board of an affiliate organization.
