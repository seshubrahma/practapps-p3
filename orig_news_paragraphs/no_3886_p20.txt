P. M.  —    Barry Jenkins and Tarrell Alvin McCraney win Best Adapted Screenplay for Moonlight. Both men wear ACLU ribbons, and get slightly political with their speeches. Jenkins vows to work over the next four years to inspire those who feel they’re not represented in films, while McCraney dedicates the award to boys, girls and "  conforming" young people.
