In July, Twitter refused to sanction an account that sexually harassed and sent violent threats to a female Breitbart News contributor, while rapper Talib Kweli was able to repeatedly call numerous black conservatives "coons," including Breitbartâ€™s Jerome Hudson, Sheriff David Clarke, and   activist Maajid Nawaz, without suspension. Threats against the president have also been repeatedly allowed on Twitter, with over 12, 000 tweets calling for the assassination of President Trump having been made since he took office on January 20.
