As André told me in the fall when I interviewed him, he came away impressed with the Trump women. He called Melania charming and private, "soignée and polished" with "impeccable" manners and legs that are "a long drink of water," and said she had a gift for standing on      stiletto heels. " She’s very much like a high, super, superglamorous Stepford Wife," he told me.
