Trump supporters have frequently been the victims of real, as opposed to staged, violence. In June, for instance, Trump supporters leaving a rally in San Jose were attacked, beaten and chased by   mobs. One woman was pelted with eggs in full view of the national media. The mayor of San Jose blamed Trump for the violence.
