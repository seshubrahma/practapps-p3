In Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist newspaper Commercial Daily described Goldwater as an extremist backed by the John Birch Society, the Ku Klux Klan, and Fascists. The AP followed up with another piece citing more unnamed diplomats fearing Goldwater’s foreign policies: Misgivings about Goldwater and his publicized views on diplomatic and military policies were expressed in Cairo where African leaders were gathered for a continental summit conference. Some expressed fear that Goldwater could force the United States back to isolation and impede   rapprochement. In India, spokesmen for some political parties viewed Goldwater’s victory as hardly a happy sign for easing world tensions.
