Wang said China had made "important contributions" to supporting US engagement with Pyongyang but stressed it was, at its core, an issue between the United States and North Korea. An   opinion piece Friday in the Global Times, a Chinese   tabloid, made a similar point. " Washington and Seoul are trying to shift all the burden of solving the North Korean nuclear issue onto China and include China into their strategy toward Pyongyang," it said.
