[Liz Kreutz from ABC News notes that while Clinton still hasn’t held a formal press conference, after her Labor Day event in Cleveland, Ohio, she hopped into the press cabin of her new campaign plane, which was flying to the Quad Cities area of Iowa, to take a handful of questions from reporters. But instead of actually being able to answer their questions, Clinton had to cut the "press availability" short because of another coughing fit.   Clinton made statements about her new book    and then took 7 questions from reporters before excusing herself bc of a cough.   —
