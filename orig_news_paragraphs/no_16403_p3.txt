Trump, meanwhile, has said that he will not release his tax returns while they are under audit by the IRS, though there is no law prohibiting him from doing so. Trump’s tax returns going back to 2009 are under audit, according to his tax attorneys, making it highly unlikely Trump will release his tax returns from recent years before voters head to the polls in November. " I think he’s made it very clear, he’s going through an audit at this time and will release the taxes when that audit is complete," Pence told WABC.
