Bill O’Reilly, the embattled Fox News host, received a powerful show of support on Wednesday from a longtime friend, interview subject, ideological sympathizer and fellow  : the president of the United States. Speaking in the Oval Office, Donald J. Trump praised Mr. O’Reilly as "a good person" and declared, "I don’t think Bill did anything wrong, " days after The New York Times reported that five women had received settlements after making harassment claims against him. News of the payouts, totaling about $13 million, generated a storm of criticism toward Fox News, which recently renewed Mr. O’Reilly’s contract, and prompted more than two dozen advertisers to withdraw their support of Mr. O’Reilly’s prime time show, the   program in cable news.
