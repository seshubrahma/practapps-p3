Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, who has a luxury suite named after her in the hotel, described the process of bidding for the project, and the complex renovations undertaken at the hotel. She added that despite the presidential campaign, those working on the hotel worked "very, very hard" to complete the renovation and restoration of the facility. Their work, she said, was a rebuke to those who tried to "discredit" her father’s business. Trump himself said he was honored "to thank the incredible team of people who brought our own vision" for the historic building to life, including construction workers and others.
