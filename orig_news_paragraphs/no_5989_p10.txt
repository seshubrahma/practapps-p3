During the first three months of the Trump administration —  from January 21 to April 21, 11, 431 refugees were resettled in the United States, or about 900 per week. During this period, 42 percent of refugees were Muslim, and two countries —  Syria with 1, 417 refugees and Somalia with 1, 305 refugees —  accounted for just over 23 percent of all refugees. Though the Trump administration has dramatically reduced the overall number of refugees to less than half the Obama administration rate for the first three months and 20 days of FY 2017, it has left the percentage of refugees arriving from Syria and Somalia —   two of the most   countries in the world —  virtually unchanged.
