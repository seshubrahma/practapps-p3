I do believe, however, that an independent California can reorganize itself in such a way where conservatives might think twice before relocating. An independent California is going to empower local government through the establishment of "states" of California (our current counties). These states will have their own governors, legislatures, etc. and function much like a U. S. state in the Union does today. This will end the problem of Bay Area and LA Area urban liberals controlling policy across all of California.
