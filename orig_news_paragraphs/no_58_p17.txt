At a news conference late Friday in Florida, officials warned that learning the gunman’s motive would be a long, complex process. " We have not ruled out terrorism, and we will pursue every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack," said George Piro, the special agent in charge of the F. B. I. ’s Miami division. The shooting comes at a tense time for a nation that has been watching nervously as terrorist attacks have occurred elsewhere in the world, and as Mr. Trump, who has promised to bar Muslims from entering the country, prepares to ascend to the presidency.
