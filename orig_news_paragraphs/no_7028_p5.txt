Yet CNN’s Dan Merica attempted to turn that positive and commendable gesture into an opportunity to attack President Trump   —   and to do so using demonstrably false claims about the administration and its staff. The headline atop his article reads: "Trump commemorates Holocaust after a series of missteps," and the bulk of the article is about the   "missteps," most of which are innocent mistakes and some of which are demonstrable lies that Merica repeats. For example, Merica claims: "Bomb threats have been on the rise in the United States and Canada since January, a fact some Jewish groups attribute to Trump’s campaign and presidency" [original link]. Merica links to a CNN article from February 27, but since then it was revealed that most of the threats came from a troubled Jewish   teen.
