" Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, is likely to simply retain the title of "first daughter" without taking on an official staff title, a transition official told CNN on Monday. The source said it hasn’t been decided yet whether she will have a West Wing office and her specific portfolio likely won’t be announced for a while. But Trump is expected to make clear in the presser that his daughter will not be running his company while he is in the White House.
