The U. S. could resettle nearly one million immigrants from the Muslim world under one term of a Hillary Clinton presidency, according to projections from Center for Immigration Studies’ Steve Camarota. [Camarota explained that this large expansion in Muslim migration would be part of a massive increase in overall immigration, which the U. S. could experience under a President Hillary Clinton. Camarota noted that Clinton could potentially add as many as 10 million new immigrants to the U. S. during her first term alone, on top of the millions of illegal immigrants to whom she would grant immediate amnesty.   Camarota’s analysis is based on recent data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Census Bureau.
