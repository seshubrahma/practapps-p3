Media Matters for America, the George   progressive activist organization, has been secretly planning a major campaign to "stop" Breitbart News. [The scheme was documented in a Media Matters briefing book obtained by the Washington Free Beacon at a retreat for current and prospective donors held in Florida over the weekend.   The   pamphlet listed a core budget goal for 2017 of $13. 4 million, which the booklet says would pay for a staff of 81, ostensibly to wage war on independent news media outlets like Breitbart.   The briefing book focused heavily on Breitbart News, which was repeatedly singled out as a target.
