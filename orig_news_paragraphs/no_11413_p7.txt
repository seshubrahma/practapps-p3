Why would the city of Zachary open a shelter the day before opening schools were back up, marshaling a ton of resources away from a supposed shelter? Why would Obama visit a shelter that has hastily been put together in a neighborhood, though flooded, was the only neighborhood flooded in a city that was fully functional, aside from the school, through this entire process? Yes, the hardest hit neighborhoods and cities —  places where upwards of 90% of all homes and buildings were completely wiped out —  have not supported Obama politically or otherwise. The city of Baton Rouge still had major shelters full, as does Livingston and Ascension parish.
