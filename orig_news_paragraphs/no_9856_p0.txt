Alan Dershowitz writes at the Jerusalem Post:   The Egyptian decision to withdraw the     Security Council resolution should not mask the sad reality that it is the Obama administration that has been pushing for the resolution to be enacted. The United States was trying to hide its active ‘behind the scenes’ roll by preparing to abstain rather than voting for the resolution. But in the context of the Security Council where only an American veto can prevent   resolutions from automatically passing, an abstention is a vote for the resolution and because of this automatic majority, an   resolution like this one cannot be reversed by a future American president.
