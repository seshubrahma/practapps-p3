The Minnesota state director for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign tells Breitbart News the latest   poll showing Trump and Hillary Clinton tied at 43 percent reflects what he sees on the ground and the Democrats know it, too. ["They don’t smell a defeat coming yet, but they have definitely shifted from     mode to       mode," said Andy Post, the Minnesota state director for the Trump campaign.   In the poll, 49 percent of Minnesotans said the country was going in the wrong direction, compared with 32 percent saying it was going in the right direction with 15 percent saying it was neither. The poll of 906 likely voters has a margin of error of 3. 3 percent.
