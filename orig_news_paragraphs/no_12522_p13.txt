The conventional wisdom about Cruz is likely correct: He won’t bring in independent voters, so he’ll be relying heavily on the turnout game. That’s what he did in Iowa, where he won 30 percent of Republican voters, compared with 25 percent for Trump and 23 percent for Rubio. In fact, Cruz crushed the competition among the very conservative, winning 44 percent Rubio crushed all comers among those who were "somewhat conservative," winning 29 percent and, destroying the myth that Trump appeals mostly to conservatives, Trump won among moderates with 34 percent. Religion.
