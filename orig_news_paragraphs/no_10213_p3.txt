The plaintiffs here filed a federal lawsuit, arguing that the Second Amendment entitles them to carry a firearm outside their home. They did not argue one way or the other whether the state can require them to get a license, or whether they can carry openly instead of concealed. Former U. S. Solicitor General Paul Clement and accomplished   attorney C. D. Michel   —   with the full backing of the National Rifle Association and the NRA’s attorney in this case, former U. S. Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper  —   instead carefully designed the case to ask the simple question of whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is a right that can be claimed in any form outside a person’s home.
