Now it appears that Ivanka was just being strategic about her timing before taking her place, along with her husband, as the country’s   First Couple. As one of the most powerful first daughters the country has ever seen, Ivanka is in place and ready to rule Trump’s America. The Department of Justice may have ruled Kushner’s hire as not being in violation of   laws, but Ivanka, despite divesting some of her assets and selling $36. 7 million in assets to comply with ethics rules, still owns her clothing and jewelry brand.   Ethics watchdogs say the measures Ivanka is taking in both divesting and selling assets are "better than nothing," but are still weak in the face of blatant ethics violations by her father, whose hotels and golf courses continue to engage in business with foreign and national groups.
