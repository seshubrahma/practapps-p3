President Barack Obama admitted that world leaders were "surprised" and "rattled" by the political rise of Donald Trump.   " I think it’s fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee. They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements, but they’re rattled by him, and for good reason," he said.
