European diplomats are watching the new US officials all the more closely after Trump’s disparagement of NATO and questions about the utility of sanctions. Similarly, Western military officials are closely following Defense Secretary James Mattis’ participation in the NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels and Munich Security Conference this week as well. And in an anticipated meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Tillerson will have an opportunity to discuss the future of the   relationship with his counterpart as the UK prepares to exit the European Union. It remains to be seen whether the Cabinet secretaries will outline any specific shifts in US positions    despite Trump’s rhetoric before and after the election    both on European issues as well as the Middle East.
