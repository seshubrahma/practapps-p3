In the afternoon, Trump released a statement calling Warren a "sellout," pointing to the campaign contributions Clinton has received from Wall Street. " While Warren claims that Wall Street businesses have too much influence in D. C.," the statement read, "the Clinton campaign has accepted over $41 million this cycle from Wall Street interests."   Warrenâ€™s decision make a formal endorsement and be an active surrogate is a significant political win for Clinton.
