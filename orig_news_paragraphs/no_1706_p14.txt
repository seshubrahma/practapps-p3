But the Kochs’ political organization, backed by an overlapping group of large conservative donors, is so far steering clear of the presidential race and focusing its efforts on the House and Senate. And some of the top Republican donors in the country have now, like Mr. Adelson, given to the Koch organization or the Senate Leadership Fund, according to Tuesday’s filings. These donors include Mr. Singer, the Chicago hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, and a company controlled by Frank L. VanderSloot, a prominent Idaho businessman. Mr. Adelson’s $5 million will go to yet another group, called Future45, which was set up and funded last year by the Ricketts family, Mr. Singer and Mr. Griffin to test lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton.
