The U. S. boycotted the Council’s opening session in March over the   agenda before it, and Haley herself has called the Council "so corrupt" and filled with "bad actors," using it to protect their own behavior.   In her piece for the Post, titled "The U. N. Human Rights Council whitewashes brutality," Haley notes that the Council has done good work in places such as North Korea but says that it also allows countries on the Council, such as Venezuela and Cuba, to have their abuses ignored:   Venezuela is a member of the council despite the systematic destruction of civil society by the government of Nicolás Maduro through arbitrary detention, torture and blatant violations of freedom of the press and expression.
