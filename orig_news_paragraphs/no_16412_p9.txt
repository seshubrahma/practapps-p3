As a point reference, 10% of the Electoral College is akin to the entire state of California (the largest prize in the Electoral College).   If such an event were to occur, it would trigger a constitutional crisis of epic proportions.    In my investigations, one elector noted that he believed he had a duty to vote his conscience if he were to find out that his partyâ€™s nominee was a "madman" in the time between the nation votes and the time the Electoral College votes. There is little to stop electors from asserting their independence.
