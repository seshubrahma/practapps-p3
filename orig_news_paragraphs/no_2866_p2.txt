The jobless rate for November, the lowest since August 2007, "is a testimony to how strong employment growth has been," said Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. Jason Furman, now chairman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, remembers the transition eight years ago, when he was crammed into his office with a circle of key officials as the latest jobs numbers from the Labor Department landed. " It was an utterly terrifying time, the likes of which none of us had ever seen in our lifetimes," Mr. Furman recalled.
