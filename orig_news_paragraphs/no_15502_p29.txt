US officials said last week that a plan from the Pentagon had been delivered to Trump’s desk, though Defense Department officials have suggested that Trump will assess the contributions of fellow NATO members when he attends a summit at the headquarters of the military collective next week in Brussels. Trump has similarly delayed a decision on withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, a determination he was originally intending to make ahead of next week’s G7 summit in Italy. Aides say Trump is newly unsure about how withdrawing from the plan would affect US interests, and his advisers    led by daughter Ivanka    have been working to develop a more robust picture of what withdrawal would look like. Even as the Comey controversy swirls, Trump is preparing for his first foreign trip at the end of this week, a whistlestop swing through the Middle East and Europe that reflects an ambitious lift for a new White House.
