Russia investigators were canceled this week shortly before the top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, said Nunes must recuse himself in order for the investigation to continue. Schiff also said Tuesday that he wants Republicans to agree to reschedule a pair of hearings that had been set for today    including one where former acting Attorney General Sally Yates was expected to testify about communications between former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak    before agreeing to move forward with their investigation.   " We certainly welcome the director coming back at any time, but not as a substitute for the open hearing that he agreed to," Schiff told reporters Tuesday.
