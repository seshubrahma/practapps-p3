Republicans have repeatedly pleaded and cajoled Mr. Trump to run a more professional campaign, reflecting greater attentiveness to rules of political and social decorum. Mr. Trump has essentially disregarded those demands and charted his own course as an insurgent candidate with a skeleton crew of campaign staff. A new test of Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign begins on Thursday as the candidate and his top aides embark on their most concerted push yet to win over big Republican donors. On Thursday, 70 donors are to meet at Trump Tower in New York, followed by lunch at the Four Seasons hotel.
