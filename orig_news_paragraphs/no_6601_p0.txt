Daniel Levinson, son of former FBI agent Robert Levinson, is hopeful that President Trump can bring his father home after 10 years missing in Iran. [Fox News interviewed Daniel on the tenth anniversary of his fatherâ€™s disappearance, shortly after the Trump White House declared it would "spare no effort" to recover Robert Levinson or learn the full story of his fate.    " The Levinson family has suffered far too much during the last decade due to the absence of Mr. Levinson, a loving father, brother, husband, grandfather and friend to many," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday.
