In a recent Pew Research poll, Trump was at 2% support among black voters and 26% among Hispanics. A Monmouth poll this month found that Trump only picked up 10% of   voters.   Trump has brought on new campaign leadership in the past week, parting ways with former Chairman Paul Manafort and bringing in Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and Breitbart executive Steve Bannon as chief executive.   One of his early endorsers among his former opponents, Ben Carson, has been a     voice for Trump, and Carsonâ€™s business manager Armstrong Williams confirmed that the retired neurosurgeon would help in the new outreach effort.
