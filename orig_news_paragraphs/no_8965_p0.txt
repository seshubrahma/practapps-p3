Fox News financial analyst Gary Kaltbaum found the vicious elitist backlash against Brexit voters unsurprising, during his appearance on Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Friday morning. ["Voters are always idiots when they disagree with the glitterati, as they say," Kaltbaum observed.   He predicted markets would "shake and shudder," and "there’s going to be a lot of scare tactics, there’s going to be a lot of yelling and screaming from people that are on the wrong side of this, and probably the markets are going to be on the defensive for a while.
