The objective of this meeting was to meet each other and to know about the bilateral relations. As far as commercial issues, I shared with Mr. Trump my conviction that the free trade of North America has done a lot of good to both the U. S. as well as Mexico. U. S. exports to Mexico are close to $200 billion a year. And according to the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, more than six million jobs in the U. S. rely on the exports to Mexico.
