White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Wednesday that  an alleged draft executive order titled "Detention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants" "is not a White House document. "["I have no idea where it came from," stressed Spicer.   Various mainstream media outlets, including the New York Times (NYT) and the Washington Post (WaPo) published the contents of this document, suggesting it was a legitimate draft from White House officials. The alleged draft directs national security officials to "recommend to the president whether to   a program of interrogation of   alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States," and addresses whether to lift the ban on the use of   "black site" prisons overseas implemented by Barack Obama.
