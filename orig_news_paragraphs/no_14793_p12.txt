A ruling coalition will inevitably result from complex political   that could last three months, the longest having lasted 208 days in 1977.   Electoral quirks, particularly France’s   system, which allows only the public’s popular vote to decide on a winner, could be enough to keep Europe out of the hands of the extreme right. It’s in contrast to the American Electoral College system that allowed a candidate who didn’t have a majority of the popular votes into the White House.   Hopefully, Dutch voters and the politicians they finally send to The Hague will have the good sense to assemble a government without any of the extremes that seem so seductive in the short run, but pose an existential threat to Europe and the peace of democracies.
