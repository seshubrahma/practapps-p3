The Verge mentions a rumor that Steve Jobs told Barack Obama in 2011 that "those jobs aren’t coming back," which would make a splendid epitaph for the entire Obama presidency, plus the series of hostile corporate tax moves long predating his arrival in the Oval Office. The point is that it’s a fair question to ask of Trump, rather than assuming what he meant about Apple from a couple of lines of dialogue at the end of a speech.   He’s hardly the only politician that likes to toss out a few quick applause lines at the end of his speeches.   Trump’s applause lines can feel a bit more  …     spontaneous than most.
