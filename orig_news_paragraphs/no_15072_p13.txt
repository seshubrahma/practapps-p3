Neil Gorsuch. You may not agree with him on every case, but his opinions will be   and clearly written. Gorsuchâ€™s mentor, Justice Byron White, liked to say that each new justice makes for a new court, and I look forward to the breath of fresh air, intellectual rigor, collegiality, and constitutional seriousness that Justice Gorsuch will bring. Neil Gorsuch will serve with distinction.
