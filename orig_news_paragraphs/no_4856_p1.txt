It’s always nice when someone of such eminent ecclesiastical authority confirms from on high something which many of us long suspected: that the Establishment really just does not have a fucking clue  —   and that that’s why we were so right to vote for Trump and Brexit. If Welby had wanted to play a clever game, what he would have done in his speech to the General Synod is keep resolutely schtum about his position on contentious political matters. Sure, many of us could have predicted where his politics probably lay: he is, after all, an Old Etonian and a former corporatist stooge (yes, oil industry  —   but most of them swing left, I’m afraid) evidently gifted with the emollience and the   views which are the only way a churchman can climb up the greasy poll of the Church of England these days. So yes, we could have guessed he was probably a   man and an   Trump man, as pretty much every Establishment type is.
