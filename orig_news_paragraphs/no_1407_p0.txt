Donald J. Trump, who said last week that a   judge was biased against him because of his heritage, said on Tuesday that his remarks had been "misconstrued" and that he did not think that the judge’s ethnicity created a conflict of interest. " I do not feel that one’s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial," Mr. Trump said in a long statement in which he continued to raise questions about his treatment in the Trump University case. Mr. Trump created a firestorm last week when he suggested that Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, who was born in Indiana, was not handling his case fairly because of his immigration policies, which include deporting immigrants in the country illegally and building a wall along the southern border.
