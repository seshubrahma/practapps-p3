Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, an opponent of the House bill who along with Mr. Brat is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, the driving force on Capitol Hill behind the resistance, said that any Republicans who will not vote to fully repeal the law will not be keeping a promise they made to voters. " And they can go back to their districts and explain to the American people why they lied," he said. Conservatives see many of the same problems in the Republican leadership plan today that bothered them about the Democratsâ€™ 2010 health care bill: It extends a   subsidy to help individuals buy insurance though it revokes the Affordable Care Act
