’s worth of culture will depend on emphasis. It seems likely that if most people on the Right were asked what "going back to the Fifties" would mean, they’d talk about restoring family and community values, strengthening the rule of law, and shoring up the economy for   people, but they wouldn’t want to repeal the Civil Rights Act. On the other hand, ask the average campus liberal what going back to the Fifties means, and "turning back the clock" on civil rights, or gay rights, will be a common, contemptuous response.   It’s curious to think that our supposedly tolerant friends on the Left would take pleasure in the notion of white Christians feeling marginalized and frustrated, as such a poll suggests.
