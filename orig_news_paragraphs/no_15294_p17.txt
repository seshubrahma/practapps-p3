Today, the Justice Department estimates roughly 30, 000 members worldwide and more than 10, 000 in the US, a number that has held steady for some years but that the department believes is trending upwards.   is active in 40 states plus the District of Columbia, the department estimates, and has found in recent investigations that gang leaders in El Salvador are directing US cliques to become more violent. But DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security were not able to provide information on how many of those 10, 000 were estimated to be in the US illegally, nor how many had been arrested or deported in recent years. There are roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. And per the FBIâ€™s most recent statistics, the roughly 10, 000   members are a fraction of the estimated 1. 4 million members of US gangs nationally.
