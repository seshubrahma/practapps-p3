I am very disappointed at the talk show hosts, also spewing out lies and propaganda against Donald. Why, I wonder? The only thing I can think of is he represents a form of freedom none of them ever saw before, and they are bewildered about it, and frightened about it. I pray all Americans who have seen and felt the meltdown of America with the Obama years, to please fight for Donald Trump.
