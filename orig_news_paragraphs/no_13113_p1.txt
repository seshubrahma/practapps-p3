—    Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016,   Howe, who is a RedState contributing editor, has been leading the growingly embarrassing   #NeverTrump movement of moderate "movement conservative" political consultants, pundits, and bloggers upset over Trump’s victory in the Republican primary. When he received backlash over his mocking of the woman covered in egg yolks thanks to   protesters, he aimed to draw a moral equivalence between a woman being pelted with bottles and eggs and a reporter who had her arm grabbed while chasing a presidential candidate. These tweets are identical to what we said about Michelle Fields.
