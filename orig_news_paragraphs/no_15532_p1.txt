The President called Cornyn to discuss the position twice, including after Cornyn passed up the job. Cornyn, who the officials say was intrigued by the idea and initially interested, ultimately withdrew from consideration  after a number of his colleagues said they believed Trump should shy away from picking a GOP politician. Trump was meeting Wednesday afternoon with four FBI director candidates, just as he is facing fresh questions over his firing of former director James Comey. Among the candidates, Trump will meet with 2000 Democratic vice presidential    Joe Lieberman, a former senator who supported Republican Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election.
