If the attack on St. Petersburg was carried out by ISIS relying upon at least one Central Asian recruit, it would provide further evidence of the expansive and   threat ISIS poses to Russia. ISIS despises the Russian government for its support of the Syrian dictator Bashar   and so itâ€™s no surprise that ISIS began targeting Russia in 2015, around the same time that Russia first intervened in the Syrian civil war. On October 31, 2015, ISIS bombed a Russian airliner carrying vacationing passengers from Sinai, Egypt to St. Petersburg, killing 224 people. ISIS celebrated the attack both in its English language magazine Dabiq as well as in its Russian language magazine Istok.
