These were the finest and bravest and toughest people that could ever grace a city. We remember the heroes of Flight 93, who saved countless more from a terrible fate. We remember the heroes at the Pentagon who fought to save every last life from the smoldering rubble. Today is a day of sadness and remembrance.
