Schlafly has already largely regained control of parts of the organization, but the plotters against her claim that they have control of one of Eagle Forum’s three wings. The organization will likely litigate whether that wing of Eagle Forum, a   part of the group that is technically a 501( c)(4) will remain under Schlafly’s control, but she and her allies have successfully booted the rebels from the 501( c)(3) wing already. Last Friday, they fired several people involved in or close to the coup attempt, and officially they are now barred from publicly identifying themselves with the Eagle Forum 501( c)(3) wing.
