At the inaugural luncheon after Mr. Trump’s   on Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, spent a good 15 minutes yakking with Mr. Trump, apparently to express displeasure with the president’s cabinet nominees, in particular Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee to be secretary of health and human services. The session will be the president’s first extended opportunity to look for common ground with Democrats, who have denounced his messages and policy priorities, including his executive order on Saturday to pave the way for weakening the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. He will also have a chance to discuss potential bipartisan initiatives, including his $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan. Mr. Trump has high hopes for his relationship with Capitol Hill.
