Although the establishment media seems loath to report it, globalist trade deals and the   of American jobs have become a central focus of the 2016 race —   as earlier this month President Obama’s signed what could arguably be one of the impactful trade agreements in modern history, the   Partnership. The Economic Policy Institute has documented that "Between 1993 (before NAFTA took effect) and 2013, the U. S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17. 0 billion to $177. 2 billion, displacing more than 850, 000 U. S. jobs. " "More than 5 million U. S. manufacturing jobs were lost between 1997 and 2014, and most of those job losses were due to growing trade deficits with countries that have negotiated trade and investment deals with the United States," the report states.
