So you’ll be voting for Donald Trump in November? I’ve said all along, I’ll support the nominee, because we can’t afford another term of the   foreign policy or for that matter, economic policy at home. And now Donald Trump’s the presumptive nominee. So we obviously need to do some work to unify around our common and shared principles and Donald’s got the responsibility and opportunity to do that in the coming weeks.
