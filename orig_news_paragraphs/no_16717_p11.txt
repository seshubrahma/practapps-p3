Cruz implied that it is possible    which conservatives read as preferable    to remain loyal to the GOP precisely by repudiating Trump. If Trump is not a true Republican, then saying so is probably the best thing a conservative can do for the future of   party    to say: "Because I love the Republican Party so much, I cannot support this current nominee."   I call this Cruzâ€™s greatest moment, not only because he said something I sympathize with, but because only Cruz could have said it and said it so well. Its power derived from his intellect and his association with ideological conservatism.
