I’m gonna be honest with you, I don’t know much about GamerGate. It just didn’t really interest me, I didn’t know what it was really about. But I think the GamerGate situation is kind of tied into this situation with the social justice mindset. Obviously they’re tied, but this time on a much bigger scale.
