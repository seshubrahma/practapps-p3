I am proud it looks like most of the country did the right thing and the popular vote has gone to Clinton. And, as much as I wanted Hillary Clinton to win the presidency, I couldnâ€™t shake that nagging feeling that having her in the White House was not going to help mend this country. The hatred toward her would have bloomed forth unchecked: more obstruction, more mudslinging, more investigations, more vile would have been in store for her. Now, the Republicans will be in the hot seat.
