Washington (CNN) The campaign managers for both major presidential nominees decried Thursday the role fake news played in the 2016 election, though Donald Trump’s manager Kellyanne Conway used her criticism to include pundits who doubted the Republican nominee’s chances. " I think the biggest piece of fake news in the election was that Donald Trump couldn’t win," Conway told CNN’s Jake Tapper during a discussion at Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, referencing the widespread predictions that Trump couldn’t win the Electoral College votes he needed.
