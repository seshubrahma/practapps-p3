Mr. Trump is seen as needing a drastic recovery in Sundayâ€™s debate after a dismal performance against Mrs. Clinton on Sept. 26. He has slipped markedly in the polls over the past week and appears to have sacrificed much of the ground he captured in September. A Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday showed Mrs. Clinton with a   edge over Mr. Trump in Ohio, where he had been running strong Monmouth surveys this week have also shown Mrs. Clinton leading by double digits in Colorado and Pennsylvania. Visiting a barbecue restaurant in Harrisonburg, Mr. Pence told an antsy supporter of the Republican ticket that Mr. Trump would be well prepared for his next confrontation with Mrs. Clinton.
