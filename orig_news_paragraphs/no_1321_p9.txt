Texas says the president has failed to fulfill his constitutional obligation to "faithfully execute" federal immigration law. (This obligation comes from the charmingly named Take Care Clause in Article II.) Am I right that the Supreme Court hasn’t often laid out what it means for the president to "faithfully execute" a dense body of law, like the statutes that set immigration policy? It’s the kind of   concept that could become a bottomless pit, if the court jumps in.
