Not only can the Attorney General withhold grants from this year’s funding requests, the DOJ can actually claw back grants made in prior years to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with immigration officials, U. S. Representative John Culberson ( ) told Breitbart Texas. Culberson began working on defunding sanctuary jurisdictions with   General Lynch, Breitbart Texas reported in December. Using the "power of the purse" entrusted to Congress, Culberson told a group of supporters in December that he has been able to "step on the air hose" of Obama’s DOJ and force the certification of ten sanctuary jurisdictions as not being in compliance with 8 U. S. C. § 1373, an existing law that requires 100 percent cooperation from local and state jurisdictions in order to receive DOJ grant funding. That law was signed by President Bill Clinton in the 1980s to force local jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration officers.
