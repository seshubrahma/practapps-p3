In a presentation entitled "RNC Cleveland 2016: Protecting Guests, Maintaining Safety," Michael McGrath, Safety Director for the City of Cleveland, said the city was going to partner with the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ). He stated that the city has received a National Special Security Event ("NSSE") grant and the City will have to account for how it spends the money. He added that the Secret Service was acting as the lead agency to develop a security plan. The police union president said that city officials are ignoring the experts.
