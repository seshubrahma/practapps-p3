Some staff members at the Republican National Committee were told Wednesday that if they were unable to get behind the nominee, they should leave by the end of the week. Representative Peter T. King of New York, whose Long Island district Mr. Trump won overwhelmingly in the April 19 primary, echoed other Republicans in pledging to vote for Mr. Trump even though he had reservations, calling Mr. Trump "a guy with no knowledge of what’s going on. " "As far as any involvement or campaigning, it’s really going to depend on him filling in the gaps and consolidating his policies," Mr. King said.
