The wheels are coming off the Hillary Clinton campaign. The White House is taking shots at her, the F. B. I. has expanded its investigation into her use of a private email server, she lost the endorsement of MoveOn. org, and now a   socialist is up 14 points against the Bungler of Benghazi in New Hampshire.   In this same poll two months ago, Sanders was ahead by just +3 points, 48% to 45%. Sanders is also surging in Iowa.
