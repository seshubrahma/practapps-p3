We may, in fact, have an additional Republican colleague voting ’no,’ which would stop her tomorrow," Sen. Debbie Stabenow told CNN’s Erin Burnett "OutFront" Monday. Last week, Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski said they would not vote for DeVos.   If all other Republicans vote in favor of her, DeVos’ nomination will pass the Senate with Vice President Mike Pence casting a   vote. That would be the first time the vice president had broken a tie for a Cabinet pick in history.
