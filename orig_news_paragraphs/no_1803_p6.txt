In each case, Mr. Phillips said, the decision to go by helicopter was made by the mayorâ€™s police detail. He described the flights as "infrequent," and directed questions about the total number of trips to the Police Department, whose officials declined to provide the data, saying it would have to be requested under the state Freedom of Information Law. " The security and transportation of the mayor are determined by the N. Y. P. D.," the department said in a statement attributed to John Miller, the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence.
