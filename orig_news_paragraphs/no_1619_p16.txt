No one was injured, though Weinerâ€™s volunteer driver for the D. N. C. a local college student named Tim, was clearly shaken and upset. Weiner, who had been talking to his    son, Jordan, over a speakerphone, jumped out of the van to direct traffic around the mishap. He evinced the   demeanor of a man who was accustomed to handling things, someone very much in his element amid chaos. Weiner comforted both drivers and oversaw the exchange of insurance information.
