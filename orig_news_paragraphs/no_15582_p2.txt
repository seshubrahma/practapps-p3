The deals were paraded before Trump and Saudi Arabiaâ€™s King Salman bin Abdulaziz   in a public ceremony at the Royal Court, with the American CEOs walking to the middle of a cavernous room to exchange   folios marking the agreements with various Saudi ministers. Sitting at one end of the ballroom beside Salman, Trump, who arrived in the room looking drained from the long flight to Saudi Arabia and series of meetings, began to smile and applaud as the exchanges took place. Separately, Trump also signed a nearly $110 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia, which the two countries hailed as a sign of a stronger partnership between the two countries. Soon after, Trump lauded the deals as "tremendous investments in the United States."
