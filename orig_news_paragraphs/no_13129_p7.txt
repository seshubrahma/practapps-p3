Kasichâ€™s support was also seriously underestimated in Vermont, which voted on Super Tuesday. The only poll of the contest, from Vermont public radio and Castleton Polling Institute, showed Trump winning the state by 15 points and Kasich far back in the pack with just 10 percent support. On Super Tuesday, Kasich won 30 percent support, however, and came within a few hundred votes of winning the state from Trump. In all, polls in only five states have finished close to the final elections results: New Hampshire, Nevada, Alabama, Massachusetts, and Georgia.
