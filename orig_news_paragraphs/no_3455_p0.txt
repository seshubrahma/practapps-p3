President Donald Trump’s new bipartisan commission on voting security can use federal data to help resolve the bitter partisan dispute about the reality of   fraudulent voting, Commission   Kris Kobach told Breitbart News. ["The issue of voting fraud often gets politicized, and people are making statements with few foundations [of fact, so] this commission will provide a firm foundation [of] information and facts that are verifiable about the issues surrounding voter fraud," said Kobach, who is the Kansas Secretary of State and is a   opponent of voters fraud and illegal immigration.    "The states are in the drivers’ seat, but this commission can offer recommendations and evidence" for state legislators to debate, he added, adding that many state elections are decided by fewer than 50 votes.
