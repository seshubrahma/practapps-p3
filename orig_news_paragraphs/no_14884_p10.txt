CNN has tried to get a statement from the FBI on investigation of this new document but has received no response.     When CNN asked Leshchenko if he had been contacted by the FBI, he declined to comment. It is unclear if the FBI has seen the document. On Monday, FBI Director James Comey testified to the House of Representatives on the ongoing investigations of Russian links to the Trump administration and attempts to influence the 2016 election, including the role of Manafort as Trumpâ€™s campaign manager.
