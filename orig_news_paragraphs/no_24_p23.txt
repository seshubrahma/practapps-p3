Despite all the abuse hurled their way, some "liberal elites" have accepted at least part of their detractors’ critique, particularly on the progressive left. It was during Bill Clinton’s presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published "The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy," which mourned that "   liberals" had turned into "petulant,   intolerant" scolds, thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America. Since then, the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers, including MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, whose 2012 "Twilight of the Elites" called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal "meritocracy"  —   a system, he argued, that tends to fuel   and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom. So as 2017 begins, we find ourselves in a strange and uncertain political moment.
