Now, people in the United States are showing that they are allies with groups   —   including LGBT, minorities and women  —   who say they feel threatened by Donald Trump’s election. New York magazine, which taunted Donald Trump with a cover story entitled "LOSER" printed and distributed before the actual vote, reports further: As stories of   violence and hate speech circulate online, some people have begun wearing safety pins to identify themselves as allies in the fight against intolerance, and to show solidarity with women, LGBT people, immigrants, and people of color feeling frightened by Trump’s presidency and the vitriol that some of his supporters display. Many of the stores of "hate crimes" by Trump supporters have been fabricated or exaggerated.
