Good morning. I’ll be spending a lot of today with Kim Severson, our national food correspondent, up from Atlanta to help us welcome guests to our Food for Tomorrow conference, which starts tomorrow in Pocantico Hills, N. Y. at the Stone Barns Center for Food   Agriculture. It would be great if we were cooking, but we’ll be in a car, talk, talk, talking, and when we need gas, we’ll stop, and Kim will scout for pork rinds, because you never know: There may be a better kind than Golden Flake.
