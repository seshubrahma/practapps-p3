An imam involved with the British government’s review of Sharia courts in Britain has praised the divisive   organisation Hope not Hate for what he termed their "incredible work" opposing "hatred". [In an article for The Yorkshire Post, Qari Asim MBE, chief imam at Makkah Masjid mosque in Leeds, praised the group while denouncing the "populism" which led to both the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s election as the next president of the U. S.  "2016 will be remembered as a year when the values that underpin our society  —   freedom, tolerance, and respect for fundamental rights   —   were crushed by the rise of populism in the West," Asim wrote. He continued: "The     and   rhetoric and politics of hatred used during the EU referendum and US presidential campaign gave legitimacy and a   voice to racist and bigoted narratives across the world.
