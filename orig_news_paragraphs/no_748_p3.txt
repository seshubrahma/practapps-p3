" As a private businessman, Mr. Ross made pragmatic decisions based on the rules of the road at the time  and it is precisely his knowledge of how trade deals work that will allow him to be successful in renegotiating bad deals like Nafta," said the spokesman, James Rockas. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Mr. Ross’s confirmation on Monday. Mr. Ross’s flexible approach to trade is characteristic of many private equity barons focused on the bottom line, his former associates say.
