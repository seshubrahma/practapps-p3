In addition to gratuitously playacting one of the most vile, grotesque and evil acts of violence one could    against any human, let alone the President     Griffin has also managed to weaken good arguments against Trump’s intolerance and the intolerance of some of his supporters. There is no equivalency between Griffin’s photo, for example, and the stabbing of three people on a train allegedly by a   white supremacist, but if you think the President should take more seriously his role in tamping down violence and hate across the country, as I do, stunts such as this are a serious setback. There are good people on the left and right who are trying earnestly and responsibly to hold this President to account.
