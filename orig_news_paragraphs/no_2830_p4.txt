" If she underperforms what Obama did in ’12, she’s not going to carry Florida," said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist in Miami. A poll his firm conducted for Univision, released last week, showed Mrs. Clinton winning 53 percent of Florida Hispanics, compared with the 60 percent who voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. After several weeks in which Mr. Trump attempted to sand off some of his rough edges and attacked Mrs. Clinton for portraying half his supporters as "deplorables," the share of Florida voters who view the candidates unfavorably is now the same for Mr. Trump as for Mrs. Clinton, according to a   poll.
