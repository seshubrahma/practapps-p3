A senior administration official said Trump was unlikely to allow a government shutdown over funding for his border wall and said they believed Trump would ultimately accept money for border security in general for the coming budget. The mixed signals from the White House just days before the critical government funding deadline did not just develop Tuesday morning after Trump’s comments to a group of conservative reporters the previous evening. Trump himself muddied the waters in recent days by adding a return to health care reform to the legislative docket, and promised a "big announcement" on tax reform during the week leading up to the crucial budget deadline and, coincidentally, the   marker of his presidency. And top White House officials failed to send one clear and consistent message as they made the rounds of the Sunday news shows as to whether the budget bill needed funding for the border wall to earn Trump’s signature.
