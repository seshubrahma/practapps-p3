In France, the skier behind the goggles is important in different ways.   The French system supports all of its skiers once they reach the national teams, through a mix of federation, Olympic Committee and federal funding. Tessa Worley, for example, who is fifth overall in the ladies World Cup standings, is one of 70 skiers paid by the French administration.   While the same pressure to fundraise doesn’t exist, social media and building a personal identity is just as crucial for French ski racers’ ability to reach the public.
