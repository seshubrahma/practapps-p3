On Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson testified before Congress last week that the Pentagon is likely to seek more US troops to advise Afghan forces in the battle against both an emboldened Taliban and the looming threat of ISIS.    And in Yemen, the Sahel region of Africa, and well beyond, special operations forces lead nighttime combat operations in a continuation of the    battles targeting terror groups. Such a raid claimed the life of Navy SEAL William "Ryan" Owens last month during an operation in Yemen targeting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
