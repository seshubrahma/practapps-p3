WASHINGTON   —    Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have yet to face off in their first debate, but both candidates have already moved teams into a plush    office building a block from the White House, where they are vetting résumés, sketching out organizational charts and otherwise planning the transition to a Trump or Clinton administration. The jockeying for jobs that usually consumes the two and a half months between Election Day and Inauguration Day is well underway in Washington, with people swapping their notional lists of cabinet officers and speculating about who might get the plum deputy posts just under them.
