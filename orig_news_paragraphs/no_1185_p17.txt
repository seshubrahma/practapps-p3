It’s almost like Tesla is positioned in people’s minds as an energy storage company that happens to put most of its batteries on wheels," said Andrew Stewart, chief investment officer at Exchange Capital Management, an investment firm in Ann Arbor, Mich. Tesla is also prone to more volatile stock movements because Mr. Musk and other board members and top executives own a large chunk of shares, leaving a relative few that change hands frequently, he said. " Whenever there’s interesting news, the people trying to buy are buying from a limited number of people who are willing to sell," Mr. Stewart said.
