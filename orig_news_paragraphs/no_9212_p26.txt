Rubio says the life issue is a human rights issue and it puts two competing issues against each other and he has chosen to err on the side of life. He says what he finds outrageous is that the media have not asked Democrats about abortion. He wonders why the media have not asked Hillary Clinton about why she thinks   abortion should be a fundamental right. He says they are the extremists on abortion and he canâ€™t wait to expose them in a general election.
