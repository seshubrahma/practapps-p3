Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has vowed that Chicago will continue to be a sanctuary city despite Trump’s promise. Other cities also are refusing to back down. Universities and colleges implementing sanctuary campus policies do so at the risk of being stripped of federal funds once Trump’s administration takes control of the matter. Most recently, students at Southern Illinois University (SIU) have demanded that all illegal immigrants residing in the region be given "sanctuary" status on the campus, as Breitbart Texas reported.
