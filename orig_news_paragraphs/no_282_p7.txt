In October 2016, Mr. Baumer set out on his latest   hike, with financial help from a poetry fellowship he had been given from the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts. On Oct. 13, he published a video on his YouTube page as he set out on his journey with a barefoot run from Providence to Coventry. His diary took followers through Connecticut, the Bronx, Times Square and Pennsylvania. People offered him shoes, or a lift.
