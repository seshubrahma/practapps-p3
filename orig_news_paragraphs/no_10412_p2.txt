The Iran deal was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by Obama, so Trump cannot simply undo the lifting of sanctions and other measures that are now federal law. Other parts of the arrangement  —   the ones that are simply executive actions by Obama   —   can be reversed as soon as Trump becomes president himself Jan. 20. In addition to lifting sanctions on Iran, some of which dated back to the 1979 seizing of the American embassy in Tehran and the subsequent holding of American diplomats for more than 400 days, the arrangement also thawed an estimated $150 billion in Iranian assets held by the federal government.
