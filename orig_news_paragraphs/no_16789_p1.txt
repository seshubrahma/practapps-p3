at 3 a. m. ET, Donald Trump picked up his phone and began tweeting about "made up lies" in the media.   Just two hours later, he opened up Twitter again and quickly went from venting to slandering a former beauty queen    shaming her for a sex tape for which the campaign has not provided evidence. Trump’s conduct since the first debate has been astonishing for a major party nominee just 39 days away from the election. Instead of zeroing in on his strongest points from Monday night on jobs and trade, he’s cited fake polls, resurfaced Bill Clinton’s marital scandals from the 1990s, floated a conspiracy theory about Google searches and attacked 1996’s Miss Universe.
