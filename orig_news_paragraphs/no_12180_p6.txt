The candidate winning the most votes across the state earns 30 delegates. Another 27 delegates are awarded through the stateâ€™s 9 congressional district, with the winner of each district receiving 3 delegates. There is no apportionment the   of the statewide vote or in the congressional districts receives zero delegates. If Cruz were to win Indiana and   the   of its delegates, Trump would likely end the primary campaign a few dozen delegates short of a simple majority, based on current polling and campaign trends.
