"Basically, weâ€™re looking to support community based programs that provide alternatives to individuals who have started down a road to violent extremism," the Department of Homeland said of the program. However, a former official involved in the program said it has never been geared toward identifying white supremacists, a job handled by people in the FBI and Justice Department focusing on hate crimes.   The former official said as of now the only thing that would change "in practice" would be the actual name of the program. The source added the change could make it harder to do community engagement with Muslim groups, but the new program would be "more intellectually honest" about what the Countering Violent Extremism program did prioritize anyway.
