A new survey suggests that nearly   of Muslim Americans will vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the upcoming presidential elections on November. [The Council on   Relations (CAIR) released its national survey Thursday, reporting that 72 percent of Muslim voters surveyed say they will cast their vote for Clinton on November 8, with 4 percent intending to vote for Trump and 12 percent undecided.   Although CAIR claims that its mission is to "enhance the understanding of Islam, encourage dialogue, protect civil liberties, empower American Muslims, and build coalitions that promote justice and mutual understanding," it has come under increasing fire for its unwillingness to condemn Islamist violence and its ties to international terrorist groups such as Hamas. Despite its pretensions of being the voice for Muslim Americans, CAIR was designated as a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates, and has been criticized by leading political figures in the U. S. from both sides of the aisle.
