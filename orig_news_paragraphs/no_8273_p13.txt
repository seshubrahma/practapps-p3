In October, Santos was constitutionally forced to put his FARC peace deal up for a national vote. What he got was a slap in the face: a solid "no" that forced the FARC leaders, after much fanfare in a symbolic peace deal "signing" that assumed the people would also approve, to return to Havana and back to the drawing board. Uribe, the leader of the "No" vote movement, is now once again a major player in assuring "peace," and his peace is likely to involve much less impunity.
