Do you think the G. O. P. has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal? Or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits? Aaron: I think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits, but not too much. Thereâ€™s a part of me that thinks many in Congress were always so willing to vote for a "repeal" because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law.
