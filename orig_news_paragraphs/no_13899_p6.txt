The waiver expires June 1. Israeli sources have suggested the May 24 Israeli holiday of "Jerusalem Day" as a possible date for relocating the embassy. That national holiday commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem and the establishment of Israeli control over the Old City following the June 1967 Six Day War and typically is marked by ceremonies and memorial services.   Diplomatic sources said having Friedman work out of the consulate, at least until the waiver expires, could give the incoming administration time to think through the consequences of relocating the embassy and find a   way to back out of Trumpâ€™s campaign pledge.
