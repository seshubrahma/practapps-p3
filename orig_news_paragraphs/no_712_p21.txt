The office, known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice, will provide victims with information about defendantsâ€™ immigration status and whether they are in jail. Significantly, funding for the office comes from reallocating "any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE will now have to provide monthly public reports on its apprehensions and releases. The agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails.
