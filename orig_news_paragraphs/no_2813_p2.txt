Even with hundreds of millions in gross revenue from his vast real estate empire, "it’s both possible and legal that Donald Trump would pay little or no income tax," said Len Green, an accountant and chairman of the Green Group, a tax and accounting advisory firm. Mr. Green is also a real estate investor, teaches at Babson College and is the author of the forthcoming "The Entrepreneur’s Playbook. " "I would expect he’s paying little or no tax," agreed Steven M. Rosenthal, a veteran tax lawyer and senior fellow at the   Tax Policy center. That’s because Mr. Trump, as a prominent and active developer, can take advantage of some of the most generous tax breaks in the federal tax code to reduce his reported income to near zero, or even report a loss.
