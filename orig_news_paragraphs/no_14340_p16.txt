After suggesting on the campaign trail that he might recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the administration told the UN last week that it will keep sanctions against Russia in place until it leaves Crimea.   Haley’s fiery speech to that effect came just a week after Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway had said the administration was considering easing sanctions against Russia.   Vice President Mike Pence repeated administration concern about eastern Ukraine on Sunday, telling ABC’s "This Week" that the US is "very troubled" by escalating violence there and that Washington will be "watching" to see what Russia does.   Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that there might be a silver lining to the Trump administration’s mixed messages.
