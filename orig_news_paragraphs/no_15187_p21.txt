The Organization of American States recently tried to declare Venezuela in violation of its democratic charter but was denied the necessary votes by Caribbean and Central American nations that have depended for years on cheap Venezuelan oil.   OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro, a Uruguayan, routinely calls Venezuela a dictatorship. In March, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodr√≠guez called Almagro a liar and a criminal mercenary at the OAS. The region seems split in its support for Maduro.
