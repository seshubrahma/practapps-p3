White House sources have also backed up their account in recent weeks, but a source who spoke separately with both men last week told CNN that while Bannon had nothing negative to say about Priebus, the White House chief of staff badmouthed Bannon over the phone. The two menâ€™s professional backgrounds could not be more different. While Priebus has long been a creature of establishment Republican politics    rising to Republican National Committee chairman before becoming chief of staff     Bannon spent most of his professional career amassing wealth in the private sector before taking on a role as the head of the     Breitbart News site.
