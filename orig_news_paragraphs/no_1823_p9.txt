I went to an intense, uplifting morning service at the Brooklyn Tabernacle church downtown and walked through Atlantic Antic, a street fair that bills itself as the largest and oldest in Brooklyn. I went to a baseball game on Coney Island, channeled John Travolta during a visit to Lenny’s Pizza in Bensonhurst and visited Chilo’s, a great bar in   with a taco truck permanently parked in the back patio area. I was particularly proud of the deal I scored on my lodging through Airbnb, which happened to be in Prospect Heights: $75 a night for a private room on the top floor of a gorgeous townhouse.
