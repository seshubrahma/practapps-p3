California is perhaps one of the more egregious examples. From supporting high taxes and heavy regulation to amnesty and sanctuary cities, the top three officials in California have been a disaster for the state. A number of qualified Republican candidates ran to fix Californiaâ€™s problems, but Trump decided to back liberal Democrats against them. This is an insult to every Republican candidate, activist, official and volunteer who spent countless hours knocking doors, filling envelopes, making calls, and raising money to prevent these   liberal extremists from taking office.
