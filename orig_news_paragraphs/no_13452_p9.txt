" But Moore’s film was in trouble almost immediately after it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September. After selling the film to an    new company from former Radius executives Tom Quinn and Jason Janego and Alamo Drafthouse founder Tim League, the film’s release date was pushed back from December 23rd to January 15, and then again to February 12, reports THR. Moore’s planned   bus tour to promote the film was cancelled after the filmmaker was hospitalized with pneumonia.
