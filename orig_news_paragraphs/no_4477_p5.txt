Breitbart Texas reported from Austin, Texas, that 44 criminal aliens had been taken into custody this week. A Texas Congressman, Joaquin Castro ( ) confirmed the arrests were part of Operation Cross Check but questioned the threat posed by those being arrested. " I am asking ICE to clarify whether these individuals are in fact dangerous, violent threats to our communities, and not people who are here peacefully raising families and contributing to our state," Castro said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.
