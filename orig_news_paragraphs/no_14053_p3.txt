The message continued, "Please make sure that any scheduled tweets are no longer scheduled," and referred all questions to another career staffer at the department. On Saturday, the National Park Service called Fridayâ€™s retweets "mistaken." "We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you," the account tweeted. A Park Service source tells CNN the decision to stop tweeting was in order to investigate whether or not the account had been hacked.
