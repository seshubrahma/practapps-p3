But since Trump won the election, Romney is singing a different tune. Romney traveled to Trump’s golf course in New Jersey to meet with Trump last week, raising speculations that he could serve in the administration, even as a possible Secretary of State. After the meeting, Trump said it went "great" while Romney said that he had a "very thorough and   discussion" about the United States and its place in the world. The New York Times reports that there is a debate in Trump’s circle about whether Romney should serve as Secretary of State.
