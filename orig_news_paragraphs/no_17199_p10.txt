With massive Russian air power against them, and Assad getting help from Iran and Hezbollah, the rebels are losing ground everywhere.   The opposition, always a hodgepodge of often mutually hostile groups united only by their enmity of the regime, hold only scattered and shrinking pockets of territory around Damascus, Homs, Daraa and Aleppo, with the only sizable area still under their control in Idlib province. Turkey supports factions of the Free Syrian Army along Syria’s northern border, and the United States backs the   Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast, but both those groups are focused on fighting ISIS, not the regime.   The Obama administration, which drew red lines in Syria, which demanded the ouster of Assad, which called for democracy and human rights in Syria, in the end could do little to change the course of events.
