" If you don’t do nothing wrong, they don’t mess with you," said Mr. Moteelall, 48, a Guyanese immigrant who has been living at the airport since December but who walks about two miles to his old Queens neighborhood to buy inexpensive meals. At Grand Central, in a cluster of tables in the station’s dining concourse, one of every three or four tables on a recent weekday was taken by people who appeared to be homeless, sharing the cavernous space with lunchtime office workers, passengers and tourists. The homeless people foraged through trash cans, including Mr. Mellor, who pulled discarded food from the garbage and ate it as he sat next to a table of teenage girls who were visiting New York to sing with their school choir at Carnegie Hall.
