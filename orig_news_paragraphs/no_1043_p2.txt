The company, which is part of Paddy Power Betfair, a bookmaking business based in Dublin, is advertising the   contracted position amid sustained interest in   bets. A Paddy Power spokesman insisted the job is a real one, despite the irreverent manner in which its advertisement is written. " With more than 100 special bets online, the successful candidate will monitor and manage existing Trump markets while devising new specials to launch," the company said in its online advertisement.
