But the administration acknowledged that the shorter   period "could lead to a reduction in enrollees, primarily younger and healthier enrollees" who often sign up near the deadline. Other parts of the rules would limit opportunities for people to hold off on buying insurance until they get sick, a phenomenon that has loaded many health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act with more expensive, sick customers than they expected. By manipulating a system that now precludes insurers from rejecting customers with   medical conditions, consumers are avoiding the purchase of insurance when they are healthy and rushing in when they need it, insurers say. The rules also would require consumers to provide "supporting documentation" to prove they were eligible to enroll in health plans through HealthCare.
