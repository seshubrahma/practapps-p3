We must recount the votes so we can build trust in our election system," Stein said in a statement.

"If nothing else, this is going to give us a very good audit, it’s going to   Wisconsin voters that we have a fair system, that we’re not counting illegal votes," said Elections Commission chairman Mark Thomsen.
