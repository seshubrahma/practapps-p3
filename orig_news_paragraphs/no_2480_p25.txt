Eleven states and the District of Columbia now record a higher percentage of votes for Mrs. Clinton than President Obama received in 2012. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he would leave his "great business in total" before moving into the Oval Office, promising further details next month about his efforts to avoid conflicts of interest as he becomes the nationâ€™s 45th president. It is unclear whether the steps Mr. Trump is prepared to take would be enough to satisfy ethics experts who say that putting his children in charge of the business would not be enough to ensure that his official decisions are independent of his personal financial ones. His daughter Ivanka has attended a number of meetings with heads of state since the election, and she would be one of the main officers of the Trump Organization.
