Itâ€™s hard to imagine that there are pundits who are calling this debate a draw    or even a "victory on points" for Trump. He blustered, he blathered, he blazed a   trail of spite and fury across the stage, and through it all, Clinton remained cool, collected and, dare I say it, presidential.   Every slur and slander from 30 years of unhinged Clinton hatred was dragged before the audience of "uncommitted voters" (is there really such a thing as a Muslim American uncommitted voter? ). None of the attacks stuck, because they seemed nasty and irrelevant, and put Trump in the position of being a barker for a particularly unpleasant sideshow.
