In a state   by unemployment caused by globalization importing thousands of unemployable or   "refugees" makes no sense to voters, who are looking for someone to champion their economic and cultural interests. Hillary Clinton has clearly put herself on the other side of that battle and that is a major reason why Donald Trump is surging in Michigan. The federal governmentâ€™s arrogant lack of responsiveness to legitimate local concerns about the economic, public health, and security costs of bringing so many refugees into the state only compounds the political problems for Hillary Clinton, as Breitbart News reported previously: In June, L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland County Executive, demanded that Office of Refugee Resettlement director Robert Carey initiate legally required consultation proceedings with him prior to resettling refugees in his county. Carey told Patterson, in essence,  the federal government did not intend to comply with the consultation requirements of the Refugee Act of 1980.
