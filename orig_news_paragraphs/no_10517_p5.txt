—   $2. 9 billion, Motorola started when brothers Joesph and Paul Galvin purchased the Stewart Battery’s Company at a manufacturing auction in 1928. They created the car radio and coined the phrase Motorola to go along with it, leading to a series of revolutionary inventions, such as car radio receivers for police vehicles as well as the walkie talkie. Motorola was extremely important to the Apollo 11 mission as they designed, tested, and produced electronics for the mission.
