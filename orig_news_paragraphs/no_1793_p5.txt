True to form, her campaign was nervous and hypercontrolling from the outset, a point that I fleshed out in the story. I described, among other things, the experience of visiting Clintonâ€™s Brooklyn headquarters and receiving, before I arrived, an email request from a press aide requesting that I keep "the office itself" off the record.

It was a ridiculous request that I refused.
