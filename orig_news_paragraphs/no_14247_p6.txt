Yates’ decision came amid a flood of protests against the executive order nationwide and after four federal judges ruled against Trump’s order, staying its impact on people who were detained at US airports over the weekend. The bipartisan group dates back to the 1970’s and the signatories also include a number of former assistants to Rudy Giuliani, during his tenure as US attorney for the Southern District of New York.   The former New York City mayor was been a   Trump campaign adviser. After Yates told Justice Department lawyers not to defend the travel ban, Trump promptly relieved her of her duties and installed Dana Boente, a US attorney, to serve in the acting capacity until Jeff Sessions, Trump’s nominee for the post, is confirmed by the Senate.
