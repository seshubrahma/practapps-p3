And according to the National Women’s Law Center (with numbers drawn from the U. S. Census Bureau): "Compared to white,   men, mothers of color fare even worse:   mothers make 53 cents and Latina mothers 47 cents compared to white,   fathers."   In the face of this everyday discrimination (perhaps because of it) moms are wielding their political, consumer and economic power in unprecedented ways this year as the first woman, mom and grandmother, Hillary Clinton, tops the Democratic presidential ticket.   And while being the first female nominee of a major party breaks a historic glass ceiling, being the first mother is revolutionary.   Clinton’s success helps hit back at the bias against mothers.
