Trump invited Abbas to the White House during their first phone call two weeks ago. Abbas’s office said that he told Greenblatt during their meeting that he believed a "historic peace deal is possible" under Trump’s leadership. In addition to Greenblatt’s meetings, Trump’s    and senior adviser Jared Kushner has also been meeting with Israeli and Arab leaders in recent months to better understand the climate in the region. Trump has said he wants Kushner to lead the peace process.
