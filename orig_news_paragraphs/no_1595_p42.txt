A 2014 analysis by economists at Stanford University, published in the science journal Nature, estimated that the cost of carbon was actually $220 per ton, far above the government’s official estimate. Mr. Greenstone, in a recent interview, defended the government’s number as a result of a technocratic process that was not influenced by political pressures. " Our job as faceless bureaucrats sitting in windowless rooms was not to do science but to summarize the frontier of science," he said.
