The jury accessed Gawker $115 million in compensatory damages and $25 million more for punitive damages. At the May 24 hearing, Gawker’s attorney urged asked the judge for a "remittitur," reducing or throwing out a jury verdict, and compared the jury’s damages determination to awards against tobacco companies in trials over smoking deaths. He stated the award was "one of the largest in Florida’s history and grossly excessive compared to the conduct at issue. "
