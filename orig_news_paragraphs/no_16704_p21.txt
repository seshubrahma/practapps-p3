Jack Schlossberg, President Kennedy admired political courage, believed it essential to our democracy and summoned it himself during critical moments in history.   Each year the JFK library gives the Profile In Courage Award to elected officials who demonstrate the courage to act on behalf of the greater good, often against their own self interest. Why should the American people have confidence in you to demonstrate courage in office?   Jack Schlossberg is the grandson of President John F. Kennedy and a member of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award Committee.
