On Thursday, Syria’s foreign minister challenged accounts by witnesses, experts and world leaders that his government was involved. " I stress to you once again: The Syrian Army has not, did not and will not use this kind of weapons   —   not just against our own people, but even against the terrorists that attack our civilians with their mortar rounds," the minister, Walid   said in Damascus.
