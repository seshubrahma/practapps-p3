The CBO projected that Rubio’s Gang of Eight bill would have added another 10 million to our immigration population growth on top of the existing 10 million green card baseline. On top of that, it also would have provided an additional 10 million green cards to illegal immigrants already in the United States —  meaning that Rubio’s bill would have resulted in a total issuance of more than 30 million green cards in the span of a single decade, or about 30 times as many green cards as active South Carolina GOP voters.   However, Rubio ignored Bartiromo’s question entirely —  relying on one of his common techniques of avoiding a question by beginning his response with the phrase, "first of all" and then transitioning into a prepared script rather than answering the question at hand. In his effort to pivot away from Bartiromo’s question, Rubio suggested that immigration —  despite workers in his own state being forced to train their foreign replacements —  is no longer an economic issue.
