Though Trump was not in office when Dilbireen’s family was initially denied visas, the executive order that was signed January 27 to keep certain people from entering the country had the family worried. The order indicated that immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations    Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia    were unable to enter the country for at least the next 90 days.   Dilbireen’s parents submitted new applications to the US consulate in Erbil, Iraq, but when they arrived at the consulate for an appointment last week, they were refused entry. Then, this week, they were granted their visas.
