Supporters of WikiLeaks have reacted harshly to suggestions they were stooges for a Russian intelligence operation. Among the harshest criticisms was penned by Glenn Greenwald at The Intercept, in which the Washington Post’s Friday story was criticized as "classic American journalism of the worst sort: The key claims are based exclusively on the unverified assertions of anonymous officials, who in turn are disseminating their own claims about what the CIA purportedly believes, all based on evidence that remains completely secret. " Greenwald assailed the Post for burying the concession that intelligence officials disagreed about the CIA’s assessment deep in their story.
