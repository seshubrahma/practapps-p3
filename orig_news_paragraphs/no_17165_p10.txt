Halderman is   in election security circles and gained some fame after he and his students at the University of Michigan successfully hacked Washington’s Board of Elections in 2010 during a trial run of its online voting system.   People who voted using the system were greeted with the University of Michigan’s fight song    placed there by Halderman’s students.
