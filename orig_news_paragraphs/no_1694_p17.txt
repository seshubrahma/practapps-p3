The Trump campaign also changed the language of its proposal to refer to the "business" tax rate rather than "corporate" tax rate. But after learning about the endorsement Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cole of the Tax Foundation said that he spoke again to the campaign and that he was assured Mr. Trump still intended to eliminate the tax cut. The campaign told him it was making a more modest change in the plan that would reduce taxation for some small businesses. The details of the Trump campaignâ€™s plan remain unclear, as does the cost.
