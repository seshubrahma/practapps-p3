Richard Nixon, who famously appeared sweaty in his 1960 television debate against Kennedy, went for a few   after he lost, appearing on one late night show playing the piano and then later, mocking his uncool rep on "Laugh In" as a way to show that he was in on the joke.   " Sock it to me," he deadpanned, repeating the shows signature catchphrase in September 1968, just before November the election.   (Whatever cool points he might have gained by that appearance, were quickly confiscated when, as president, he strolled on the beach in wingtips and a suit.)
