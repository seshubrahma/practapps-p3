Leap says the gang has earned a reputation above others in the US not because it is more dangerous, necessarily, but because its violence is known to be particularly brutal, because it is one of the rare gangs that operates internationally, and because in Los Angeles it was the only gang to not observe "prison discipline"    the customary pause in rivalry among gang members who were incarcerated.   She added she was "suspicious" of the increased attention on the gang.   " It’s not to say that the gruesome crimes have not occurred, I just question why they’re being highlighted now," Leap said.
