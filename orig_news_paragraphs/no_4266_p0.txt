WASHINGTON, D. C.   —    Edward "Ned" Price, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst who said he resigned last week because of President Donald Trump’s "disturbing" actions and that his "decision had nothing to do with politics," donated thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential campaign. ["To be clear, my decision had nothing to do with politics, and I would have been proud to again work under a Republican administration open to intelligence analysis," Price wrote in an   he penned for the Washington Post Monday.
