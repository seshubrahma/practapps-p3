Clinton is taking a day off the campaign trail, staying at her home in Chappaqua after stumbling at a   commemoration event on Sunday. Aides later said she was diagnosed Friday with pneumonia. Pence is in Washington ahead of meetings with Capitol Hill Republicans on Tuesday. Asked if top Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani had gone too far in questioning Clinton’s health prior to Sunday’s incident, Pence demurred.
