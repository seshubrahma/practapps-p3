" Never before have I witnessed a senior government official so carelessly threaten an   relationship," a former senior intelligence official told CNN.   The US is part of the   "Five Eyes" agreement (along with Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) which calls for open sharing among member nations of a broad range of intelligence. In an interview with Adelaide Radio on Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull declined to address the claims against Trump directly but did reaffirm his confidence in the relationship between his nation and the US.
