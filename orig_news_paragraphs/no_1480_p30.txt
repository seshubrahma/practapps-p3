The Douglas Education Center was founded in 1904 as a finishing school for high school graduates headed into corporate jobs. The school has become a primary training ground for people who create   monsters for movies, thanks to a program created by Tom Savini, a Pittsburgh native, an actor and a renowned makeup artist for horror movies. The school now has offices in an old church, classrooms in a former hospital and workshops in a former convent now stuffed with models and masks of monsters, ghouls and aliens. A soundstage with a green screen occupies what was once a furniture showroom.
