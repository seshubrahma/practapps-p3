The House cannot bring in any "white knight" who was not already running on Election Day. Because a majority of state congressional delegations are Republican, a presidential election going to the current Congress essentially guarantees a Republican president. With these constitutional provisions in mind and the reality that Republicans will control the House at least until January 3, 2017, NeverTrump activists are considering selecting five key states, then running a candidate in each of those states —  and those states only —  who could win that state with a plurality of the statewide vote, beating both Trump and Hillary. So long as neither Trump nor Hillary wins a landslide of the remaining states, these   candidates could result in no candidate receiving 270 Electoral College votes, sending the entire matter to the House.
