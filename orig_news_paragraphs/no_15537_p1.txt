Mueller was former FBI director James Comey’s predecessor. President Donald Trump fired Comey last week.   The longtime litigator was the   FBI director in history, only behind iconic and controversial director J. Edgar Hoover. Congress passed legislation in 2011 to extend Mueller’s term from the usual 10 years, giving him a   tenure.
