The average length of time in the program is 3. 6 years, according to data provided to The Times by the Florida Department of Education, and 85 percent of McKay recipients are in elementary or middle school. Families who leave the program sometimes do so after moving residences. Other times they conclude that their childâ€™s needs would be better met in a public school. Carla Donaldson of West Palm Beach used a McKay voucher to send her son Zachary, who has autism spectrum disorder, to a private school that specializes in serving   students.
