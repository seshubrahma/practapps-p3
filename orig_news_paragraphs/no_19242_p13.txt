"    I became a Republican as a teenager because of my upbringing in   Massachusetts, a state where the GOP has produced five   good governors in my lifetime, from Bill Weld (now the   Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee) to Charlie Baker.    I worked for Mitt Romney when he ran for governor, and while I   did not like his presidential campaigns, I think he has a record   in Massachusetts he can be proud of. " ’
