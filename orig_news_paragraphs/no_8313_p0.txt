NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana  â€”    In an open letter to President Barack Obama, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and 30 other "sanctuary city" leaders across the country asked for further protections for illegal immigrants before   Donald Trump takes office. [  immigration advocates with the Cities for Action organization helped orchestrate the letter demanding more sanctuary   policies for migrants, with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney also signing off on the missive, according to the Observer.   One of the focal points of the letter is a request for Obama to give an extension to the some 740, 000 illegal immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a program which could be reversed under Trump.
