I suspect the coming political movements will be identified on two axes: open and closed and individual and social. Those who believe in open believe in open trade, relatively open immigration, an active foreign policy and racial integration. Those who believe in closed believe in protective trade, closed borders, a withdrawn foreign policy and ethnic separatism.   …     Trump’s bigotry, dishonesty and   will have to be denounced. We can’t go morally numb.
