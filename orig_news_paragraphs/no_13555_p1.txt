The Obama administration appears to be rushing as many refugees as possible into the country before   Donald Trump is inaugurated as the 45th President on January 20, 2017. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to pause the resettlement of refugees who come from Syria or other countries that have a history of hostility to the United States. During FY 2016, 85, 000 refugees were resettled in the United States. The Obama administration has asked Congress for budget authority to resettle 110, 000 refugees in the country during FY 2017.
