Opponents of the climate deal were concerned after White House economic advisor Gary Cohn told reporters that the president was "evolving on the issue" during his trip overseas. His daughter Ivanka and    Jared Kushner reportedly channelled support for the deal behind the scenes at the White House, encouraging climate change activists that Trump might change his mind. Trumpâ€™s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon CEO, also supported remaining in the treaty. On May 9th, Obama defended his climate change legacy, calling the agreement "the one that will define the contours of this century more dramatically perhaps than any other. "
