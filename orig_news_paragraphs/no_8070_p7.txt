On Clinton, Rumsfeld said she is wholly "unacceptable" to serve as President of the United States because she is "clearly corrupt" and represents more of the same America has seen under President Barack Obama. Rumsfeld said: So then you look at the two choices â€”  and as I look at Mrs. Clinton, I find her unacceptable as a presidential prospect. She is clearly corrupt. She is clearly on the wrong side of every major threat we face.
