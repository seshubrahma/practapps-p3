In a crowded room awaiting Donald Trump’s speech at the Burlingame Hyatt, where the California convention is currently being held, Jim Brulte, the Chairman of the California Republican Party, told convention goers that Donald Trump was running late to no fault of his own. A large group of protesters attempted to block Trump’s motorcade from reaching the convention for his speech. #Trump motorcade stops on freeway shoulder. Surrounded by security, Trump hops barrier to get to Hyatt.
