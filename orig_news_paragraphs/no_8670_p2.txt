The fact that Donald Trump had a really bad period and he went down just a few points indicates that it will be difficult for either candidate to break out given the   division in the electorate," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang to the Journal. Yang conducts the poll together with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. Clintonâ€™s lead is only one point when   candidates are considered, including Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump also leads Clinton among independent voters in the   poll by 10 points, 40% to 30%.
