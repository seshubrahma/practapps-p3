They were first named in reports by The New York Times and The Washington Post.   The Times reported on Thursday that two White House officials helped furnish Nunes with intelligence reports that showed that Trump aides were caught up in "incidental" surveillance of foreign targets. When Nunes then told Trump about the reports, the President said he felt partially vindicated over a tweet in which he accused President Barack Obama, without evidence, of wiretapping him during the campaign. The White House has refused to comment on the Times report, but has not dismissed it outright.
