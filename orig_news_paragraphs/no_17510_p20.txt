Why the difference in the way I view Schumer’s jokes about Latinos?   Two things: First, Trump is not a comedian telling jokes about race that are designed to startle us and make us uncomfortable with their outrageousness. Rather he’s a person in power    who would like voters to give him even more power    making serious remarks demonizing the Mexican people. He even doubled down with a tweet on Tuesday after NBC dumped him.
