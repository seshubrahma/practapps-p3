 (CNN) Sen. Lindsey Graham said Wednesday if the FBI determines that President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign illegally coordinated with Russia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions should recuse himself from making the decision whether to pursue prosecutions. Sessions, a Trump appointee, "cannot make this decision," Graham said. But Graham deflected a question about a Washington Post report that Sessions twice spoke with the Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying he needs to know more.
