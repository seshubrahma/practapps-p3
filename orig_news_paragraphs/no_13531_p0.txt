Sanctuary cities and other jurisdictions will now have to choose between protecting illegal aliens and receiving federal law enforcement grants thanks to the work of a Texas congressman. [Texas Representative John Culberson ( ) used his position as chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, and the congressional power of the purse, to force the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce existing law. Culberson announced in February an agreement with outgoing Attorney General Loretta Lynch to block federal law enforcement grants to jurisdictions with sanctuary policies, Breitbart Texas reported. Since that time, the Texas congressman has been working with DOJ officials to certify the   jurisdictions whose state and local law enforcement agencies are not cooperating with immigration officials.
