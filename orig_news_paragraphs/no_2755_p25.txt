By Hisham Matar (Random House). The author’s father, Jaballa Matar, a leading Libyan dissident, was kidnapped in 1990 by agents for that country’s dictator Muammar   and sent to the notorious Abu Salim prison in Tripoli. In this beautifully chiseled book, the younger Mr. Matar chronicles his   search for his missing father, whose absence has haunted him for decades. It’s a detective story of sorts, with Mr. Matar trying to piece together what happened to his father after his arrest.
