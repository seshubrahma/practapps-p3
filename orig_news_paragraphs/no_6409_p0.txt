Members of the liberal sports media are aghast after reports that Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins recently played a round of golf with President Donald Trump. [NBC’s ProFootballTalk, for instance, was quick to note that the Golden State Warriors are rumored to refuse an invitation to visit with Donald Trump, but Redskins thrower Kirk Cousins had no such qualms about being seen in public with the president.   The president and Cousins batted the ball around at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminister, New Jersey. The quarterback noted that he had Eric Shuster, the director of strategic partnerships at CSN Midatlantic, to thank for arranging the matchup.
