* Gun control proponent Michael Bloomberg will reportedly meet with pollster Frank Luntz this week to discuss a possible White House run. The first CBS New   reports about a possible Bloomberg presidential run began swirling on January 23. The initial reports were bolstered by a January 25 story in which anonymous sources close to Bloomberg claimed he was willing to spend $1 billion in an attempt to win the White House. On February 8 Bloomberg confirmed what the sources had been saying when he told the Financial Times he is weighing "all the options" for a presidential run.
