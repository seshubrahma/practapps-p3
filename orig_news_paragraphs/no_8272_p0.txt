(REUTERS) U. S.   Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that besides winning the Electoral College "in a landslide" in the Nov. 8 election: "I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. "   The allegation, made without evidence, comes as Democratic rival Hillary Clintonâ€™s lead in the popular vote over Trump has surpassed 2 million votes and is expected to grow to more than 2. 5 million as ballots in populous states such as California continue to be tallied.
