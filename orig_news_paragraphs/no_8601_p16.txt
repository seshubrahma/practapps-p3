Muslims themselves are perfectly happy in the west   â€”   a large majority of Muslims (91 per cent) feel a strong sense of belonging to their local areas, and the vast majority (94 per cent) say they can practise their religion freely. 88 per cent of British Muslims think that Britain is a good place for Muslims to live. You can think of this special treatment as analogous to the "perk" culture in the Valley, in which CEOs dish out free food and install nap pods to keep employees happy.
