On Monday, American military officials said that two infantry companies from the 82nd Airborne Division were being sent to help protect those United States advisers and that a "route clearance" platoon was also being deployed to clear away roadside bombs. Together, the deployment adds about 240 troops to the mission. The troop cap that the Obama administration established for the operation in Iraq  —   what the Pentagon calls the "force manning level" —   is 5, 260. But that formal limit, which the Trump administration is likely to eliminate, does not count temporary deployments.
