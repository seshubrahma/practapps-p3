The White House was not considering a veto, the US official said, but added that if the resolution is amended, US officials will need to review it before deciding how to vote. Trump, meanwhile, made his unhappiness with the resolution clear, saying in a statement that the US should issue a veto if it is brought to a vote.   " As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations," Trump said.
