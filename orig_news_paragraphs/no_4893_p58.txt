The true costs of medicine are more obscure than ever to average consumers, and the network of shifted and hidden costs to cover them is more complex. Be honest about the needs of people with   conditions, and healthy people who can’t afford even the inexpensive coverage that true market competition will provide.   Present the taxpayers with a clean, understandable invoice for handling the needs of those people, in the most streamlined and efficient manner possible, with the lowest bureaucratic overhead. Don’t fumble around with schemes to give them "insurance"  —   worry about the medical care they need, and how our society can best provide it.
