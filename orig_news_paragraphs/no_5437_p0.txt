  Federal Judge Ann Donnelly has blocked deportations of foreign nationals who have been detained at American airports in the last day. [The legal maneuver follows an executive order issued by President Trump Friday calling for temporary visa restrictions on seven countries connected to radical Islamic terrorism.   The suit had been filed by the ACLU on behalf of two Iraqi refugees who were detained at New Yorkâ€™s John F. Kennedy Airport, despite that both men were later released. NBC reports that a Trump administration official said waivers would be granted for the two men.
