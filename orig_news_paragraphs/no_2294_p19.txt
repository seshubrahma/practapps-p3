In March, the Palm Beach Architectural Commission approved the demolition of the estate. According to brokers and neighbors, crews have been working daily at the site with an oversize backhoe and bulldozer. The limited liability company has also submitted a request to the town to subdivide the land into three parcels. The proposal calls for the largest lot, at the southern end, to be 2. 35 acres, with the potential to include a house of more than 51, 000 square feet with 10 bedrooms and 12 baths.
