The Los Angeles ICE office confirmed among its arrests five had no criminal histories but prior orders of removal. " We ultimately decided those people were not a priority as there are literally millions of them and most have never committed any crime," the official said referring to violent crimes or felonies. The official said that one appeal of targeting individuals with removal orders is that they can be deported "quickly," because no further court action would be necessary.
