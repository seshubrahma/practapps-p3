When Nathan Kecy graduated from Plymouth State University in New Hampshire a decade ago with a bachelorâ€™s degree in communications, he found himself with about $10, 000 in debt and few clear career options. He first found work as a    salesman ("a pyramid scheme," he recalls) and then in telemarketing. Finally he landed a job as an infrastructure specialist for Datamatic, a      company. He was traveling across the country installing meters, making a decent salary.
