According to Climate Home,  former Eastern Bloc countries Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary are trying to "gut, block or water down" the Paris accord’s   promises because they interfere with their economic growth and commit them to useless, expensive renewable energy. Europe’s steelmakers  —   among them,     Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and Austria’s Voestalpine   —   have written to EU leaders begging not to be burdened with any of the carbon emissions costs they say would make them uncompetitive against foreign rivals.
