Two new polls (CBS and Public Policy Polling) have Clinton with a   lead over Sanders in South Carolina, but Sanders has been closing the gap. Clinton led Sanders by nearly 40 points in January. Though Clinton and Sanders are virtually tied among white voters in South Carolina, Clinton leads Sanders by 40 points among black voters in the PPP poll. The Public Policy Polling poll had Donald Trump with a commanding   lead (35% % over Sen. Ted Cruz) in South Carolina.
