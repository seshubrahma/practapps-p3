And, of course, there is no way of knowing what kind of relationship Britain would have with the European Union after a   Brexit. Michael Gove, a leader of the "leave" campaign, has said Britain would not want a bilateral deal that required it to accept freedom of movement and labor, so it would choose a simpler World Trade Organization relationship with the European Union, like the ones held by Brazil and Russia. That kind of relationship, the Treasury suggests, would mean a bigger annual loss of G. D. P. per household by 2030 of Â£5, 200. Still, every alternative the Treasury examined would reduce G. D. P. a position accepted by most economists.
