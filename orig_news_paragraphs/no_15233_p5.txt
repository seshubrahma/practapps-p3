Armed with tactical missiles and equipped with superior communications capabilities, the Michigan is one of four US Navy subs that began service as a ballistic missile submarine, loaded with nuclear missiles as part of the US strategic nuclear deterrent. In the 2000s the Navy converted four of the   subs into   platforms armed with conventional weapons. Each of the four submarines can carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles.
