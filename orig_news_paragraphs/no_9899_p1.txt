Rick Scott is exactly right about the issues Republicans want Donald Trump to talk about: jobs and strong on national security. The problem is Trump did not come out of his convention convincing voters that he was a serious person qualified to be    with the right temperament. He’s got to work on that now. If voters don’t see him as someone qualified, if voters don’t see him as having the right temperament, they’re not going to take his ideas on jobs, his ideas on ISIS seriously.
