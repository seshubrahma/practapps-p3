Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz wrote Saturday that President Donald Trump had respected the independence of the judiciary by appealing, rather than ignoring, a federal judge’s injunction against his executive order on immigration. [While Dershowitz, a noted Democrat and civil libertarian, was critical of Trump for calling Judge James L. Robart a "  judge" on Twitter, he observed that there was a distinction between Trump’s words and his actions.   Dershowitz wrote in Canada’s Globe and Mail: President Donald Trump avoided a constitutional crisis by appealing, rather than defying, an overbroad injunction against his visa executive order issued by a federal judge in Washington State. Justice James Robart’s injunction is   in effect, despite another federal judge in Massachusetts having rendered a decision refusing to renew a similar injunction, and thus allowing the visa restrictions to be implemented.
