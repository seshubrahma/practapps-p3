The advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said they could not rule out Mr. Trump making decisions on the fly next week to try to influence the convention. Low points at past conventions, like the empty chair next to Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican convention and Pat Buchananâ€™s fiery and  divisive speech in 1992, were the result of impulsive decisions, according to several Republicans involved with those gatherings. They warned that Mr. Trump could do himself real damage if he injected himself or his opinions into carefully scripted or choreographed convention moments.
