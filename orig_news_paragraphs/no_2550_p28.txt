Capt. Charles E. Slonim, whose career took the family to Hawaii, New Hampshire, Virginia and Washington State, Mr. Slonim early on developed a knack for putting strangers at ease, a skill that came in handy on the red carpet. He met Fiona Moore, the woman who would become his wife, on the Greek island of Ios in the early 1990s. She was on vacation with friends, one of whom had just given her "The Andy Warhol Diaries" as a birthday present.
