The United States exported $1. 3 billion more in automobiles and $2. 1 billion more in industrial supplies in January than it did in December. The details show the economic idea of specialization at work. The $1. 3 billion rise in automotive exports was paired with a $900 million rise in automotive imports. The overall balance didnâ€™t shift much, but that suggests that the United States is shipping cars and trucks that it makes more efficiently while importing those that others make more efficiently.
