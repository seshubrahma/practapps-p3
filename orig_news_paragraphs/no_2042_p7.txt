The costs of transportation, textbooks and housing, however, are another matter. University students have reported struggles with soaring housing costs in the areas surrounding many of the campuses, in places like Irvine, Santa Barbara and Berkeley. In July, a survey found that one in five University of California students sometimes went hungry. A study this year by the Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that even after subtracting aid,   students in both the Cal State and University of California systems had to come up with as much as $13, 000 a year.
