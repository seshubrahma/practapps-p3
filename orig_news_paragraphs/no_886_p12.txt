The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, moved to seize the moment after his organization released a new trove of classified information about the C. I. A. â€™s cyberweaponry. Speaking from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has sought refuge since 2012, Mr. Assange presented himself as a defender of some of the biggest American technology companies against their own government. The C. I. A. responded by saying that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, and described Mr. Assange as "not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity. "
