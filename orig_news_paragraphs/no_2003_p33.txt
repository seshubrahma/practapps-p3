This video captures the opening song in the set: a   hallucinatory cover of "Black Lake," by Björk. Stick with the clip for the full     minutes, and you’ll begin to understand how improvisers like Mr. Bynum can turn a brief scrap of melody into something as churning and vast as an oceanic swell. N. C. Jamire Williams is a drummer with a   capacity for groove, which has served him well as a sideman. He also has his own band, Erimaj  —   but on "      EFFECTUAL," he pares down almost entirely to solo drum kit, creating a series of poetic experiments in rhythm and tonal color.
