Trumpâ€™s prepared remarks did not call for the "freeing of political prisoners," a hefty demand Trump apparently added on the fly. Cuba freed 53 political prisoners in January 2015 as part of its deal to reopen diplomatic relations with the United States. The two countries officially restored full diplomatic relations in July 2015, more than 50 years after the two countries cut diplomatic relations amid Cold War tensions. The US embargo on Cuba still remains officially in place, but Obama loosened a series of regulations to  allow more US companies to sell their products in Cuba.
