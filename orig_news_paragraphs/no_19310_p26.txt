Massive and diffuse   political machines, especially those relying heavily on   volunteers, are by their nature insecure, easy targets for   Russia’s extensive, aggressive, and active intelligence services.    And America’s increasingly bitter and divided political landscape   produced an exceedingly hostile presidential campaign that   maximized the impact of strategic leaks and other "active   measures"  —   as the Russian spooks call political operations. The   opportunist in Putin spotted the weaknesses within the U. S.   political system this election and seized the moment with glee,   and American democracy has indeed suffered. But Putin has also   managed to make Russia’s role so evident that it demands some   kind of U. S. response.
