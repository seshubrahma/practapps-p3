The traditional call is for everyone to come together and focus resources on defeating the opposing party’s nominee.

There is no excuse for sore losers to permanently ensconce President Obama’s radical big government agenda because they don’t like the choice who emerges from the primary. The stakes for our nation are too big to throw away by playing legal games designed to deny a nominee who legitimately earned a first ballot victory.
