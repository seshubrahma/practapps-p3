Mr. Kaine, 58, differs from the man he is hoping to succeed, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in that he is a relatively new member of the Senate, not an elder statesman. But Mr. Kaine has made a point of focusing on foreign policy during his time in the Senate, where he serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees. Speaking to reporters after an event here on Monday, Mr. Kaine said he did not think the new episode involving Mrs. Clintonâ€™s health put any more pressure on him to convince voters he is ready to be president. Even before the latest incident, Mr. Kaine had tried to defend Mrs. Clinton against questions about her health, while also calling on Mr. Trump, who had accused Mrs. Clinton of lacking stamina, to be more forthcoming about his own health.
