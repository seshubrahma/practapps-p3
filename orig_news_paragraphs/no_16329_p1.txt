Trump super PACs have struggled for months to gain traction, and Chandiâ€™s spots will be only the third major advertising buy in support of Trump. When it comes to television advertising,   Clinton spending is vastly outgunning   spending. Clinton and her allies have more than $100 million in advertising reservations from now through Election Day, while Trump and his backers have merely about $1. 1 million. Chandi and his wife, Susana, gave $500, 000 to the group last December through a limited liability company, and the group says it is successfully fundraising for more cash.
