The case alleges emotional harm and economic damage, but Ms. Allred said the purpose of the lawsuit was not financial. The goal, she said, was to get Mr. Trump to admit that he lied when he said Ms. Zervos fabricated her allegation. If Mr. Trump made such an admission, she said, Ms. Zervos would drop her case. Ms. Allred said Ms. Zervos had already submitted to a polygraph test that would help prove she was telling the truth.
