This Sunday, I will be flying to Israel immediately after the gala dinner of our organization, the World Values Network. I am going to attend the 50th anniversary of Jerusalem Day, when Israel reunified Jerusalem in the 1967 war, affirming the Jewish people ’s rebirth in their ancient capital after the devastation of the Holocaust. [President Donald Trump will be there, too.
