Goldsmith has it right: According to federal law —  the National Security Act of 1947, as amended —  the National Security Council, and also, the more recent Homeland Security Council, have a very few "statutory" members that is, formal memberships, enumerated in the underlying statute.   And nothing that Trump decided last week changes that such a change would require an act of Congress.    In other words, while Bannon certainly has a high position in the Trump White House, he has no statutory role in the NSC.
