The Great Disruptor Donald Trump has not only battered the GOP Establishment Temple. Using the truth and nothing but against Bill and Hillary, he is effectively (along with New Media) doing his part to shred the   Media effort to usher Hillary into the White House. Not only is this New Hampshire poll another example of how awful a candidate Hillary Clinton is, it is also another piece of evidence on the pile that proves the DC Media is losing its   power to influence the political discussion by shaping the debate and bottlenecking inconvenient truths. In the nineties, the same DC Media that attempted to destroy Clarence Thomas over one unfounded allegation of harassment from one woman, effectively protected Bill and Hillary from a dozen or so allegations ranging from rape to groping to harassment to character assassination.
