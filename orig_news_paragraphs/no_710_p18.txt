In 1986, at the height of the civil war in El Salvador, the Suffolk County Legislature declared the county a place of sanctuary for refugees fleeing conflict in Central America. But once the population grew from a couple of thousand to almost 7, 000 immigrants, attitudes changed. By 1993, that resolution was reversed. According to census statistics through 2014, 58, 426 Salvadorans live in Suffolk County, and nearly   live in Brentwood.
