WASHINGTON   —   Hours after President Trump took his oath on Friday, the Justice Department issued an opinion saying that his appointment of his    Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser would be lawful despite a federal antinepotism law. In a   opinion signed on Friday, a longtime career lawyer in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel said that the president’s special hiring authority exempted White House positions from a 1967 law barring the president from employing relatives at a federal agency.
