It is unclear exactly what about Mr. Page’s visit drew the F. B. I. ’s interest: meetings he had during his three days in Moscow, intercepted communications of Russian officials speaking about him, or something else. The Times report reveals that Page was only monitored after he had already left the campaign: After Mr. Page, 45  —   a Navy veteran and businessman who had lived in Moscow for three years   —   stepped down from the Trump campaign in September, the F. B. I. obtained a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing the authorities to monitor his communications on the suspicion that he was a Russian agent.
