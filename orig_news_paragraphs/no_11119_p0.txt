Fifty Wisconsin faith leaders joined Governor Scott Walker in endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz for president this week. [The news comes as Cruz surged in polling this week and frontrunner Donald Trump hit some new controversy on the campaign trail. A Marquette Law School poll released Wednesday showed that Cruz jumped 21 points from 19 percent in February to 40 in the March poll, while Trump held steady at 30 percent of likely Republican voters in Wisconsin.   Cruz also made a trip to California this week to appear on the   show Jimmy Kimmel Live! hold a   fundraiser, and meet with the lion’s share of more than 100 Californians slated as delegates for Cruz.
