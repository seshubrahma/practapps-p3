The Cato article delineates another inconsistency in Levin’s position on trade. Specifically, Levin’s espoused economic theory dictating his trade policy seems at odds with his stated position on labor policy. Levin has previously claimed to oppose open borders, in part, because a large excess of   labor that is willing to work at a reduced salary unfairly undercuts the jobs and wages of American workers. Similarly, a large, uninhibited flow of   imports manufactured by countries whose governments unfairly subsidize those goods, will undercut American manufacturing —  and, subsequently, the jobs and wages of Americans who fill those jobs.
