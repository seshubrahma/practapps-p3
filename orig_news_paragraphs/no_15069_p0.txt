Washington (CNN) Sen. Edward Markey is calling on President Donald Trump to engage in direct negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as part of a proposed joint effort with China to reduce North Korea’s nuclear threat.      The Massachusetts Democrat’s plan, outlined in a letter that was sent to Trump on the eve of his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, suggests that the US should agree to direct talks with North Korea in exchange for China ’s commitment to drastically escalate sanctions against Pyongyang if they fail to negotiate in good faith.
