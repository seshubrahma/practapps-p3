Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke on Friday at the United Nations Security Council in New York City, saying the United States cannot "idly stand by" as North Korea continues to threaten it and its allies with the nuclear weapons stockpile it possesses. ["With each successive detonation and missile test, North Korea pushes Northeast Asia and the world closer to instability and broader conflict," Tillerson said. " The threat of a North Korean nuclear attack on Seoul, or Tokyo, is real. "
