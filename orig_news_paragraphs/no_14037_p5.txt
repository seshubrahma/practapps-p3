No day in our nation feels more patriotic than Inauguration Day    the Marine Marching Band, the past presidents, politicians and power brokers braving the cold to flock to our nation ’s capital.

Trump’s   and not see represented a shockingly different America than we saw on this same day eight years ago when President Barack Obama was sworn in. In fact, this was the whitest inauguration I’ve witnessed in my lifetime.
