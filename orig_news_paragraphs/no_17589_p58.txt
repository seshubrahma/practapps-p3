If we assume that                         Trump will indeed pursue a more                           foreign policy, this may encourage former                         Soviet countries, in Central Asia, for                         instance, to move  given that the United                         States is less likely to induce them to do                         otherwise.                       ’ ’                         While other countries are unlikely to                         formally recognize Russia’s annexation of                         Crimea, no one’s going to seriously                         challenge it, and the peninsula will                         increasingly be treated as de facto Russian                         territory.

The                             meddling in the U. S.                         election is a model that has been and can                         be replicated in important races around the                         world.                       ’ ’
