Mr. Viola would report to Gen. James N. Mattis, Mr. Trump’s choice for secretary of defense, if the Senate confirms General Mattis, a retired   officer in the Marines. A person familiar with Pentagon appointments for the transition said that General Mattis had reached an agreement with Vice   Mike Pence that the new defense secretary would choose who would fill the top policy jobs at the Pentagon   —   like under secretary of defense and general counsel   —   while the White House would select the service secretaries, like Mr. Viola.
