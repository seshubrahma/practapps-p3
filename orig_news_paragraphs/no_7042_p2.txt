Manning released a statement opposing Speaker Ryanâ€™s partial repeal of Obamacare bill, also known as "RyanCare. " Manning argued that the bill will likely not survive conservative opposition in Congress. He said in the statement: Given the current impasse, Americans for Limited Government urges the House to scrap the current proposal and to keep their word and pass a repeal bill that respects the states and voters who elected a GOP majority, ensuring that the people are not forced into costly federal government mandated health plans.
