The FBI granted limited immunity deals to at least two Clinton aides, including Clinton’s State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, when the FBI requested to search the two attorneys’ laptops, sources told CNN late last week. This isn’t the first time Trump has called for legal action to be taken against his Democratic challenger. In June, he called for Clinton to be jailed over the email matter, and he has said that if he is elected, he would instruct his attorney general to investigate her. Trump followed up his comments by raising several Clinton controversies from the 1990s, including the Whitewater scandal, the cattle futures controversy and even former President Bill Clinton’s controversial 11th hour pardon of Marc Rich, a prominent oil trader who fled the country after learning of plans to indict him on tax evasion, racketeering and breaking an embargo against Iran.
