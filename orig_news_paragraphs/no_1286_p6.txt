The East Bay Times Dozens of journalists at The East Bay Times worked on the coverage of the deadly "Ghost Ship" fire in Oakland, Calif. in December, which killed 36 people at a warehouse party. " We had everybody involved, from investigative reporters to artists to breaking news reporters," said Neil Chase, the paper’s executive editor. Mr. Chase said the paper, whose reporting also revealed the city’s shortcomings in preventing the tragedy, was donating the cash prize that comes with the award to a local fund for the victims.
