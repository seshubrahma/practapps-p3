Arizonaâ€™s   Legislature passed a measure in 2010 known as the "show me your papers" law, which required law enforcement officials to determine the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest if there is reason to suspect the person might be in the country illegally. Despite anger over that law, Mitt Romney won the state in 2012 by 10 percentage points. Democrats insist that even if their efforts do not pay off now, they will in the long term as the voting population becomes more Hispanic. But the Trump campaign says it is not leaving anything to chance.
