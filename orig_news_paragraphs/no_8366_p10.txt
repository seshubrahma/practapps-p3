Rubio said that he was forced to talk about the "differences" he had with Trump because he didn’t want to see the party of Lincoln and Reagan taken over by a con artist. " I’ve used strong words and my parents didn’t raise me that way, but I’ve used strong words because I feel that passionately about it," Rubio said. He appeared disturbed that more and more people were backing Trump, insisting that they were being fooled by a con man because of their fears for the future.
