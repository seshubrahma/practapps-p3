Compare that with the patriarchy, as personified by Donald Trump. Trump has appointed women to some of the highest jobs in the federal government, and has a history of promoting female managers, and the first female construction supervisor for a skyscraper in 1980. Of course the patriarchy isnâ€™t only about hiring and promoting women that are competent at their job.   It involved a lot of men, because patriarchy embraces masculinity.
