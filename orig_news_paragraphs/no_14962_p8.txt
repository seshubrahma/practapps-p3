The plan is based on Republican President Richard Nixon’s Clean Air Act. And the EPA’s authority to fight climate disruption was established by a ruling of conservative Chief Justice John Roberts’ Supreme Court, under President George W. Bush. In Massachusetts v. EPA (2007) five justices determined that EPA not only has the authority but also the responsibility to cut pollution if it endangers public health    which it does.   Curbing carbon pollution    and defending America’s land, water and people from other potentially lethal threats    is neither a liberal value nor a conservative value.
