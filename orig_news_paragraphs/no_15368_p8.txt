The best thing for the health of Earth and its inhabitants would be for Trump to stay in the Paris agreement and stick to the existing pledge. Policy makers have identified an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3. 6 Fahrenheit) as the red line for warming. Go past that much warming and we are living in a fully   world (more than we already are, since human fingerprints already are on many extreme weather events, especially heatwaves and temperature records). Existing pledges to the Paris Agreement put the world at about 3. 4 degrees Celsius of warming, which is unacceptable.
