Mr. Trump made only passing reference to the newest accusations against him. In an interview with The Washington Post, a woman named Kristin Anderson said Mr. Trump had slipped his hand beneath her skirt and grabbed her genitals at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s. Mr. Trumpâ€™s spokeswoman denied the account, and Mr. Trump said in his speech that certain details were implausible because he rarely sits alone at nightclubs. But The Post did not say Ms. Anderson had described Mr. Trump as being alone.
