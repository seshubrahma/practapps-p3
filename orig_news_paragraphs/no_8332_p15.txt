In my normal life, I was a    mother of two, so life consisted of car lines, lunchboxes, and afternoon volleyball games. But during the 2008 presidential campaign, I spent time with Mitt and Ann, rode on their campaign bus, heard dozens of speeches, and saw the machinery of a modern presidential campaign from the inside.    …      I headed out west, where I stayed with Mitt, Ann, Ann’s brother Rod, and his wife Cindy in the Romneys’ home.
