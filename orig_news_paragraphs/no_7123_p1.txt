However, the company denies the allegations, saying that their decision was within the confines of the law. In a statement to the Detroit Free Press, EZ Industrial Solutions operations manager Jordan Yoder said: The law is quite clear that employees can’t just not show up to work when they’re expected, and also that they are not free to participate in political,   related protests during their work day without consequences. We therefore deny any wrongdoing and are confident that the charge will be dismissed. Meanwhile, the workers’ lawyer, Tony Paris, who filed the complaint on their behalf, contended that the firing goes against normal company practices.
