Washington (CNN) Parties who are challenging President Donald Trump’s travel ban have until June 12 to respond to a petition from the Justice Department asking the Supreme Court to allow the ban to go into effect, the court said Friday. The Court set a deadline of June 12, which comes about two weeks before its term is scheduled to end. Once the Supreme Court has heard from the challengers, it will decide whether it should allow the revised controversial executive order    that blocks entry from six   countries    to go into effect while the justices decide whether they should take up the government’s appeal.
