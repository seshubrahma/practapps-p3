Trump’s tweets as   annotated, President Barack Obama has ordered US intelligence agencies to complete a full review of hacking in US elections going back to 2008 before he leaves office and Trump is sworn in to take his place.   What is Trump basing his dismissal of the US intelligence officials’ conclusions on? Trump hasn’t offered any evidence to counter the CIA claims, other than to insist it is a political effort aimed at delegitimizing his electoral victory    also without evidence. His rebuttal is nearly identical to his pushback during the 2016 campaign after US officials began concluding Russia orchestrated the hacks of the Democratic Party’s political organizations    when he repeatedly said he did not believe US intelligence and law enforcement conclusions about Russia’s responsibility for the hacking.
