Ed Cox, chairman of the New York Republican State Committee and    of late President Richard Nixon, offered his review of Monday night’s presidential debate on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily. ["I thought that Donald Trump really presented a broad vision for what he wanted, which is what a president has to do," Cox told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.   As for Hillary Clinton, he said she offered a "very detailed, lots of words, very lawyerly kind of brief, but you fall asleep when you listen to that. "
