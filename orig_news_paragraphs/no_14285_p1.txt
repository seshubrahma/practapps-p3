The denial comes after Iran announced it would take "reciprocal measures" toward US citizens following President Donald Trump’s order last week banning entry to nationals from seven   countries, including Iran, to the United States.   Ghasemi said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was "obliged inevitably to oppose the US wrestling team ’s travel to Iran" in the wake of Trump’s policies, according to the semiofficial FARS news agency. The US wrestling team has been in Iran for tournaments 15 times since the Iranian Revolution, and the sport’s governing body said Monday it planned to send a delegation to the Freestyle World Cup on February   in Kermanshah, Iran.
