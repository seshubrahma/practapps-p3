A source close to Breitbart Texas said a group of rioters went back late in the night to Lee Circle and the surrounding area to do more damage, saying that was when some of the behavior grew out of control. Protests by liberal students and the social   of the Democratic Party began early yesterday, just a day after Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump, in a gracious speech to supporters, asked that the country come together and heal, along with President Obama, who mirrored Trump’s lead on the issue.
