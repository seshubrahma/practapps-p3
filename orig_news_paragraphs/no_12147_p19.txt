FALSE.   The    policy dates back to a 1968 decision by the U. S. Supreme Court that allowed police to stop and frisk in individual based on a reasonable suspicion that he or she is armed and dangerous and may be involved in a crime. The policy has been constitutional for nearly four decades. During that time, and especially during the last two decades (until the last two years) relationships between police and communities have improved.
