Voters are more evenly divided on whether or not Trump will be able to reduce lobbyists’ influences in Washington, D. C.: 37 percent say it’s not likely, while 41 percent say it is. The poll also provides a look at how leftist media manufactures controversies: "Do you think certain members of the Trump family, chosen by Donald Trump, should be allowed to receive top secret security clearances, or not?" one question reads. Initial reports in the leftist media, citing "sources," claimed that Trump wanted three of his children to have top secret security clearances. A transition team official later told pool reporters that such a request was never made.
