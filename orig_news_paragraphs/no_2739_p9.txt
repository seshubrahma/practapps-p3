Jenovan Krishnan, 25, the leader of the Ring of Christian Democrat Students, a group with 8, 000 members in several universities, said he and his associates wanted an explicit ban on face veils. Julia Klöckner, one of Ms. Merkel’s deputies as party chairwoman, called last summer for an outright ban on the veils. She was the top   in elections for the six deputies at the congress on Tuesday. The atmosphere at the conference was less tense than at last year’s, Mr. Krishnan said.
