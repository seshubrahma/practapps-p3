Typically, Republicans since Ronald Reagan —  in the years of the Bush clan dynasty —  would pander to globalist ideals pushing   "free trade" and other open borders policies with regard to immigration, crime policy, economic policy, foreign policy and national security policy. Democrats, meanwhile, no longer represent the strong America policies that John F. Kennedy believed in their party has veered over the past several decades into hardcore progressivism mixed together with globalist elitism. This gap was created and expanded during the years of the Bushes and Clintons —  and was ripped wide open in the last seven plus years under Barack Obama. Right now, the world is on fire.
