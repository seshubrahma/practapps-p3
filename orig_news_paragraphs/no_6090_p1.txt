[Trump left Riyadh for Tel Aviv ahead of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in hopes of seeking ways to achieve   peace.   A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel told AFP he was not aware of any flight taking that course before. Israel has no diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia despite informal ties on certain levels, particularly around shared concerns over Iran. Any links are diplomatically delicate, with the Arab world strong supporters of the Palestinian cause.
