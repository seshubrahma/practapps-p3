On Monday, a curiously timed report appeared on the   website Breitbart, often a repository of tea leaves for members of Mr. Trump’s circle. (It was once run by Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, a vocal Ryan critic in his old job.)

The content of the tape was not news Mr. Ryan’s view at the time was clear, just after the release of the "Access Hollywood" video in which Mr. Trump boasted of sexually assaulting women.
