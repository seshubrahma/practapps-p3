WASHINGTON (AP)   —   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says he doesn’t like going up against NFL games when he debates Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton this fall and that the football league complained to him about the debate schedule in a letter.   A spokesman for the NFL says the football league didn’t send a letter to Trump as the billionaire businessman claims. The independent, nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates serves as the debate sponsor and sets the participation criteria, dates, sites and formats.
