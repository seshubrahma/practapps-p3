One of the most notorious magistrates, Mohammed Nagy Shehata, known as the "executioner judge," a holdover from the Mubarak era, has handed out hundreds of lengthy prison terms and death sentences to   activists. In early 2016, Shehata sentenced three young members of April 6, who were attending a memorial service for a murdered comrade when they were arrested, to life terms for protesting without a license, possessing fireworks and spreading false information. (The sentences were later reduced to 10 years.) In June 2014, another Cairo judge sentenced 25 peaceful demonstrators, some of them teenagers, to 15 years for violating the protest law, blocking roads and attacking public institutions.
