On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s "Hannity," Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump argued that Humayun Khan wouldn’t have died if he was president "because I wouldn’t have been in the war, if I was president back then. "   Trump said, "I can say this. If I was president, because his son died 12 years ago, if I were president, his son wouldn’t have died, because I wouldn’t have been in the war, if I was president back then. There would have been no war for Iraq, I can tell you that, because I think it’s ridiculous, the whole thing.
