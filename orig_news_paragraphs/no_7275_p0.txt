A Hillary Clinton Presidency would enact the   Partnership (TPP) and lead to a massive jobs depression in the same pattern of Clinton’s career according to Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump who laid out a litany of Clinton misconduct in a highly anticipated Wednesday morning address. ["If [Hillary Clinton] is elected President she will adopt the   Partnership and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good," said Trump.   Just as she has betrayed the American worker and trade at every single stage of her career and it will be even worse than the Clinton’s NAFTA deal. And I never thought it could get worse than that.
