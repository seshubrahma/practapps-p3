Washington (CNN) White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday that the firing of FBI Director James Comey doesn’t have anything to do with the current ongoing investigation into Russia’s interference into the 2016 election. " This has nothing to do with Russia," Conway told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on "AC360" Tuesday evening, just hours after news of Comey’s firing broke.
