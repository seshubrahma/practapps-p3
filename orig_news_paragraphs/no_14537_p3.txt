Pence, speaking Monday, called Flynn’s firing "the proper decision" and said "it was handled properly and in a timely way. " Questions continue to swirl around why Flynn was only asked to resign last week, even though Trump and his top advisers found out about the full contents of Flynn’s conversation on or soon after January 26. Pence, meanwhile, did not find out he had been misled until February 9, administration officials told CNN.
