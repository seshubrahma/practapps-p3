Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced sanctions on two Russian officials and several separatists in Eastern Ukraine to support the Ukrainian amidst ongoing   conflicts in the region. " This administration is committed to a diplomatic process that guarantees Ukrainian sovereignty, and there should be no sanctions relief until Russia meets its obligations under the Minsk agreements," Mnuchin said Tuesday. Poroshenko said it was a "great pleasure" to meet with Trump to discuss issues important to Ukraine and called the president a "supporter and strategic partner" of the country.
