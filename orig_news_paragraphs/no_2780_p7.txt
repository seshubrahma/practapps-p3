The plot involves the main character dying and becoming a ghost, his wife trying to drown a young man so that the deceased husband can inhabit an earthly body again and engage in carnal pleasures again, and so that they can complete a business deal with Mr. Trump (or something like that). The film was a success at the Razzie awards, winning worst picture, worst actress, worst director and worst supporting actor: Mr. Trump. _ _
