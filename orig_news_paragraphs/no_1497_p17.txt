The chamber says it does not get involved in presidential elections, and that is mostly true. The Center for Responsive Politics shows relatively small donations given to Republican presidential candidates over the years. In 2012, Mr. Romney was the largest recipient, taking in $36, 900, according to data compiled by the center. A spokeswoman for the chamber said any donations to presidential candidates came from individuals in the chamber, rather than the chamber itself.
