The PGA of America killed the PGA Grand Slam of Golf for good after cancelling it last year because the group scheduled it for a Donald   property. [The PGA of America addressed the end of the    event in a release:   After pulling out of Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, California in July, a bumbling PGA of America could not schedule the event for another country club in the ensuing months, forcing a cancellation. The group cited controversial comments from the presidential candidate regarding immigration as the reason to break the agreement to hold the event at the Trump property.
