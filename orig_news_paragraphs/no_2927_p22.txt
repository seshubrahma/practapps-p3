We asked Cortney Burns, a chef at Bar Tartine in San Francisco, to suggest a dish that takes advantage of the fall season. She offered this one from a book she wrote with Nicolaus Balla, "Bar Tartine: Techniques  Recipes," winner of a 2015 James Beard award: Potato and Green Bean Soup This is a soup to make in late summer, or autumn when the days get shorter and the green beans grow big and tough. It is ideal for those    beans, which are much better cooked well past the bright green and crisp stage that culinary professionals prize.
