UTLA traces its activism back to the 1970’s however, a backlash against taxes in 1978 ended with the passage of Proposition 13 which, to this day, limits the amount of property tax dollars California public schools can capture. The union is affiliated with the California Federation of Teachers (CFT) which boasts 120, 000 members, and the 325, 000 member California Teachers Association (CTA). The latter dubs itself the "preeminent voice" for the state’s educators, public schools, and colleges. Through its   affiliations, UTLA is part of national powerhouse teachers unions the National Education Agency (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT)  .
