Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives like those at Apollo have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era. Deals like Hostess have helped make the men running the six largest publicly traded private equity firms collectively the   executives of any major American industry, according to a joint study that The Times conducted with Equilar, a board and executive data provider. The study covered thousands of publicly traded companies privately held corporations do not report such data. Stephen A. Schwarzman, a   of Blackstone, took home the largest haul last year: nearly $800 million.
