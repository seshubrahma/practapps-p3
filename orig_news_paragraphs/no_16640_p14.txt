When Kaine knew about pneumonia diagnosis   Clinton declined to address when her running mate Tim Kaine knew about her pneumonia diagnosis, as she faced questions about the nature of her partnership with her running mate on her first day back on the campaign trail.

Her doctor made the diagnosis Friday, but the public did not find out about it until Sunday.
