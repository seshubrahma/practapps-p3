Echoing the Afghan Talibanâ€™s Ramadan message, which emphasizes that jihad during the holy month is "obligatory,"   mentions that it is incumbent on Islamists to wage jihad against occupiers of Muslim lands. Explaining when jihad becomes mandatory, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman purportedly states in the video: The scholars, both past and present, are of the consensus that if a hand span of Muslim territory is occupied, then jihad becomes obligatory and a binding duty upon every Muslim, whether he is old or young, rich or poor, youthful or elderly and whether he is trained or not. The Muslim lands that have been occupied are not merely a hand span or even a thousand hand spans, but rather it is millions of hand spans.
