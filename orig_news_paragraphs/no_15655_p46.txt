The hacker otherwise known as "Guccifer 2. 0" burst into the national conversation after claiming responsibility for a hack of the Democratic National Committee last year. US officials believe with "high confidence" that "Guccifer 2. 0" was actually a front for Russian military intelligence and was part of the effort to influence America’s elections. Roger Stone has been forced to defend contacts with the online persona via Twitter. While Stone said his messages to the hacker alias are of no consequence, he is the first person in Trump’s orbit to have acknowledged any contact with a hacker    not to mention one that claimed responsibility for hacking the DNC.
