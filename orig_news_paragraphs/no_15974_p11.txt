While Lewandowski insisted Monday that he had no regrets about the way he conducted himself as campaign manager, it’s unclear what place Lewandowski might have in the future of GOP politics.   A former officer trainee in the New Hampshire marine patrol who had never run a presidential campaign before, Lewandowski in many ways isolated himself from the national Republican Party throughout the 2016 campaign. He is viewed as having refused to heed concerns from GOP leaders that Trump’s candidacy    particularly his rhetoric about immigrants and minorities    is inflicting permanent damage to the party’s image.   Lewandowski’s reputation has also been tainted in other ways: His arrest raised questions about his temperament     and that of Trump    even though the charges were dropped.
