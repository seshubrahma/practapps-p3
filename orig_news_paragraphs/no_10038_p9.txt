This is documented by my book The Clintons’ War on Women, which is 445 pages long and backed up with 586 footnotes and a bibliography of 157 books. Just as Cosby’s wife attacks Cosby’s victims, Hillary has allegedly attacked those women who claim to have been sexually assaulted or raped by her husband. Thanks to Donald Trump, the mainstream media won’t be able to sweep Bill’s dark past, and Hillary’s true role in it, under the rug. The media will try to pretend the issue is martial infidelity or adultery.
