The Corps of Engineers is part of the Department of the Army.    Donald J. Trump, however, has taken a different view of the project and said as recently as last week that he supported finishing the   pipeline, which crosses four states and is almost complete.

Representatives for Mr. Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
