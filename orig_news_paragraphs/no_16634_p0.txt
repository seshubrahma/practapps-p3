 (CNN) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said today that he’s not in favor of requiring a prescription to purchase birth control.   In a taped interview on "The Dr. Oz Show," Trump said, "I would say it should not be a prescription it should not be done by prescription."   Three West Coast states already allow pharmacies to sell hormonal contraception without a doctor’s script.
