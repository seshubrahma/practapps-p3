Before she became President Obama’s secretary of state, Hilary Clinton signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Obama administration promising to disclose all foreign donations during her tenure as head of the State Department. Clinton violated the Memorandum of Understanding, according to the New York Times, the moment her family foundation accepted and failed to disclose a string of donations totaling $2. 35 million from Ian Telfer, the foreign head of the   uranium company, Uranium One, which Hillary Clinton approved to acquire U. S. uranium. Clinton Foundation documents didn’t show Telfer’s donations.
