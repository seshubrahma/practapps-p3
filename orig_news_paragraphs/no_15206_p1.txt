Aside from the titillating internal campaign anecdotes, nothing revealed in the new book, "Shattered," surprised anyone closely engaged in the 2016 elections, particularly those of us who publicly supported Bernie Sanders.

A retread coterie of pollsters, consultants and insiders tried to sell an    elitist candidate to voters who were in   revolt. It was a campaign so clueless that, during the general election, it could not find Wisconsin on the map.
