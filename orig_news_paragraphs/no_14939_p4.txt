CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. The watchdog inquiry comes as Democrats raise questions about the costs and security questions that comes with Trumpâ€™s frequent trips to    a private club he has owned since 1985 and a home he has visited for six weekends since becoming president in January. Variations in each trip make it difficult to estimate how much it actually costs for Trump to spend weekends in Florida. But a 2016 GAO report about a   trip President Barack Obama took to Florida in 2013 found the total cost to the Secret Service and Coast Guard was $3. 6 million.
