Russian officials on Thursday expressed anger that their ambassadorâ€™s actions were being questioned and that some news reports suggested he might be an intelligence operative. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, delivered an extended diatribe during her weekly briefing against what she called the low professional standards of the American news media. " I will reveal a military secret to you: Diplomats work, and their work consists of carrying out contacts in the country where they are present," she said.
