 (CNN) Two Secret Service agents are facing an internal investigation over their alleged conduct last week while they protected a grandchild of President Donald Trump, people familiar with the matter tell CNN. The actions of the two agents, who are assigned to the protective detail for the children of Donald Trump Jr. are being reviewed by the internal affairs division of the Secret Service. The questions involve photographs the agents may have been taken of one of the children while being driven around New York on Sunday.
