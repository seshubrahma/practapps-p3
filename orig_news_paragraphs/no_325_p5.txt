On Tuesday, Jan. 31, a revival of "Zoot Suit" begins its run at the Taper, kicking off the theaterâ€™s   season. A fantastical reimagining of the   Sleepy Lagoon murder case, in which 12 Latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge, "Zoot Suit" features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids, lively swing tunes and family squabbles. The infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against   youths in the summer of 1943, figures in as well. Looming over it all is El Pachuco, a mythical trickster figure who can stop time and materialize wherever he pleases (think Prospero, but with a lot more panache) and "The Press," a barking headline made flesh.
