If confirmed as Sessions’ deputy, Rosenstein would oversee any potential investigations or prosecutions into Trump surrogates and Russians    including the key decision on whether to appoint a special prosecutor    now that Sessions has recused himself. Rosenstein assured Grassley that he has not had any contact with Russian officials that he knows of and would have to review the facts of any Russia investigation before deciding whether to recuse himself. " As far as I’m concerned, every investigation by the DOJ is an independent investigation," Rosenstein said.
