President Donald Trump has instructed the State Department to slash its $10 billion budget for funding United Nations programs by as much as 50 percent, Foreign Policy is reporting. [The article said the move is "signaling an unprecedented retreat by [the] administration from international operations that keep the peace, provide vaccines for children, monitor rogue nuclear weapons programs, and promote peace talks from Syria to Yemen. "  FP used three unnamed sources for its report, which also called Trump’s directive "draconian measures" taken ahead of the planned release on Thursday of his 2018 federal budget proposal. The budget "is expected to include cuts of up to 37 percent for spending on the State Department, the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other foreign assistance programs, including the U. N. in next year’s budget," according to the report, which went on: It remains unclear whether the full extent of the steeper U. N. cuts will be reflected in the 2018 budget, which will be prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget, or whether, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has proposed, the cuts would be phased in over the coming three years. One official close to the Trump administration said Tillerson has been given flexibility to decide how the cuts would be distributed.
