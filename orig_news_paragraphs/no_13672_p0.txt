My Dear Fellow Americans. [If youâ€™ll recall, right here on Breitbart on June 16  2015, I wrote my first article on Donald J. Trump, and at that moment laid out the case for why I knew he was the voice America was waiting for.   I received much ridicule, even from friends. As the weeks progressed, I continued to write not only here but in other places like Newsmax and the Orange County Register, but mostly at my home here, given to me by Andrew Breitbart himself.
