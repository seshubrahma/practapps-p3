Democrats mobilized quickly on Monday to begin lobbing a stream of attacks against the Republican health care proposal, marking a drastic role reversal for a party that has struggled to defend the Affordable Care Act for the past eight years    and suffered significant political losses along the way. Particularly encouraging to Democrats is the CBOâ€™s conclusion that the Republican bill would hurt demographic groups that President Donald Trump tended to perform better with, including older Americans. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the liberal independent from Vermont who challenged Hillary Clinton from the left in the 2016 presidential primary, was characteristically blunt: Thousands will "die," he said, if the GOP bill is passed. " Throwing 24 million Americans off of health insurance, raising premiums for older   Americans, while giving $285 billion in tax breaks to the top 2% is a disgusting and immoral proposal," Sanders said.
