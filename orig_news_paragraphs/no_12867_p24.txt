RedState —   a blog that is certainly no friend to Trump —  points out that members of corporate media are promoting a false characterization of Trump’s statement. RedState writes: It seems pretty clear  …     that Trump is not calling for a 45% tariff specifically, he’s saying that this is basically what he figures that it would take to even out the playing field in terms of China’s devaluation of their currency  …      In other words, while Trump did utter the 45% figure, he seemed to be clearly using it as an example of how he would respond to a given value of Chinese currency devaluation.
