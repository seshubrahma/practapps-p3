Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had opposed the Schrunk Plaza event, citing concern over community tensions following the train attack. He asked the federal government to revoke the permit for the demonstration, CNN affiliate KOIN reported. But the federal General Services Administration declined, saying "the permit was lawfully obtained to assemble at this federal location. GSA has no basis to revoke the permit," KOIN reported.
