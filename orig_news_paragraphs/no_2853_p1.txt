The Trump International operates out of the Old Post Office Building, which the federal government owns. That means Mr. Trump will be appointing  the head of the General Services Administration, which manages the property, while his children will be running a hotel that has tens of millions of dollars in ties with the agency. He also will oversee the National Labor Relations Board while it decides union disputes involving any of his hotels. A week before the election, the board ruled against Mr. Trumpâ€™s hotel in a case in Las Vegas.
