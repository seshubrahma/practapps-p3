whatever that is.   It’s likely no coincidence that Thursday night, a U. S. official reportedly insisted that President Trump has the power under the Constitution to use force overseas to defend the U. S. national interest.   It’s pretty amazing when you think about it: firing 59 Tomahawk missiles at a military base in a sovereign nation might not be an "act of war," constitutionally.   The framers didn’t have cruise missiles, so they expressed no opinion in the Constitution on whether using them to strike targets in other countries a thousand miles away constituted "war."
