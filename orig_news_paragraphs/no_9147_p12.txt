But let’s be aware that Nato is now directly under threat from Juncker and the European Union who want their own army. They have to have an enemy, don’t they. What Putin represents for all his faults is a strong leader who beleives in his own nation  …     of course Putin doesn’t like the European project, because the EU wanyts to make Ukraine, his next door neighbour, a member of an alternative political and military alliance. All through history you see empires that are failing have to have an enemy, a hate figure, and that’s Putin  …     unless we stop this European army, we could be heading for very real trouble.
