When Rand Paul offered an amendment only a few weeks ago to pause migration from Muslim nations with jihadist movements, Rubio opposed the measure. Rubio told Sean Hannity that he’d "hate to use" the omnibus spending bill to block Obama’s refugee resettlement. Rubio subsequently failed to show up for the vote on the Paul Ryan’s omnibus spending bill, which would have expanded Muslim migration. Rubio similarly denounced Trump’s plan to temporarily pause Muslim migration.
