Jackie Kendall, executive director of the Midwest Academy, was on the team that developed Camp Obama, a    day intensive course run in conjunction with Obamaâ€™s campaign. It trained volunteers to become activists to help Obama win the presidential election. WND also reported the Woods Fund, a nonprofit for which Obama served as a paid board director from 1999 to December 2002, provided capital to the Midwest Academy. Obama sat on the Woods Fund board alongside William Ayers, founder of the Weather Underground domestic terrorist organization.
