The night before, the jihadists had told the residents of Buharbuq, an   village near Bashiqa, to be ready to leave at 6 a. m. for Mosul. The intent was obvious: They would be used as human shields. In the middle of the night, the village fled en masse. After leaving the headquarters, Barzaniâ€™s convoy passed the refugee caravan, 80 or so cars and trucks stretched along a roadside.
