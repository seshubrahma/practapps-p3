The associations between the   Indivisible and the   MoveOn. org and ACLU may be telling since the latter two groups have been central to recent efforts to stop Trump. Two weeks ago, within hours of reports surfacing that Attorney General Jeff Sessions held two conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U. S. while he was Alabama’s senator and served on the Armed Services Committee, MoveOn. org was already outside the U. S. Department of Justice building calling for Sessions’ resignation. Sessions maintains that the conversations did not concern the 2016 presidential campaign.   He served as an informal adviser to Trump during the presidential race.
