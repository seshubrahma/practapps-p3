The data on which Politico relies suggest that in states like Iowa, 95% of Republican caucus voters "had previously voted in at least one of the past four presidential elections," and were simply voting in the primary for the first time. That means that while the Republican primary turnout was high, turnout in the general election in November could be flat, Politico suggests. Furthermore, in South Carolina, there were the same number of Democratic crossover voters in 2016 as in 2012. The latter point is striking, because if Trump were as poisonous to November election prospects as some pundits suggest, he should have driven more Democrats away
