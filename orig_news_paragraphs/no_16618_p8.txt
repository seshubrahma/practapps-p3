I knew Mike had access to a fun, fiery and somewhat sacred space in his community: a barbershop. And I had a feeling he had friends    from diverse political backgrounds    who wouldn’t be camera shy. Our group included: Taj Anwar Baoll, a firefighter and urban farmer Shelly Winters, a Harlem native who is wholeheartedly supporting Donald Trump Jamida Orange, whose father marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Kalonji Changa, a grassroots activist and local leader who won’t be voting on the national level this year and Christine White, an attorney who is all in for Hillary Clinton. And, of course, Mike, a former Bernie Sanders supporter who (and I don’t think he’ll mind my saying this) shed tears when Bernie bowed out.
