"["He made a deal with the devil. Sheâ€™s the devil," Trump told his supporters near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at Cumberland Valley High School.   In recent days, Trump has taken to categorizing the agreement as a "deal with the devil," but Monday was the first time he went so far as to specifically equate Clinton with Lucifer," noted Dallas News reporter Hannah Wise.
