In the most recent New York   News poll, some 62 percent of registered voters said Mrs. Clinton said what she thought people wanted to hear most of the time, rather than what she believed, compared with 39 percent who said the same about Mr. Trump. " It’s more like she’s saying things because they’re politically correct or because they further her agenda, rather than because it’s coming from the heart," said Alan Podmore, 53, of West Hills, Calif. Even her supporters tell pollsters that they do not trust her, a weakness Republicans identified early and have tried to capitalize on for more than a year.
