[U. S. Secret Service agents said Michael Steven Sandford approached a Las Vegas police officer at the campaign stop to say he wanted Trumpâ€™s autograph, but that he then tried to take the weapon.   A complaint filed Monday in U. S. District Court in Nevada charges Sandford, 20, with an act of violence on restricted grounds. He was denied bail during a court appearance later in the day. His   attorney said he was living out of his car and in the country illegally after overstaying a visa.
