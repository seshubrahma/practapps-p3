Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump renewed his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States from places that have been invaded by terrorists during his speech on Monday afternoon in New Hampshire. ["I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so   â€”   and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country," Trump explained during his speech addressing the terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida that killed roughly 50 people.
