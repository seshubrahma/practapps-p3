Mattis was also joined at the ceremony by fellow Marine commanders, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and retired Gen. John Kelly, now currently the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Kelly lost his son, Marine 1st Lieutenant Robert Kelly, in the Afghanistan War in 2010. Mattis’s remarks held special poignance since he has recently commanded troops in the    Afghanistan and Iraq Wars. The cemetery’s Section 60 holds many of those who have fallen in those wars.
