Barack Obama is the only president in the history of America to preside over 7 straight years of GDP growth under 3 percent. 2016 is off to a pace that virtually guarantees this will be the 8th straight year with GDP under 3 percent. If so, Obama will become the only president in Americaâ€™s history to never produce a single year of 3 percent or higher GDP. The longest previous streak of under 3 percent GDP in the history of America was four years (1930 to 1933) during the depths of the Great Depression.
