The policy of the United States is clear —   the Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan and, therefore, fall within the scope of Article 5 of the U. S.  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security," President Barack Obama said in April 2014 in answer to a media request to clarify the issue. Article 5 of the   treaty in question requires the United States to use its military to defend the integrity of Japan’s territory from foreign invasion or usurpation. Should the Chinese attack a Japanese aircraft within the ADIZ for not identifying itself to Beijing, the United States would be   to retaliate and engage in military action with China.
