In the ACAâ€™s individual   exchanges, healthy   people and people with preexisting conditions are in the   same pool. For insurers, this helps to balance the risk and costs   and mitigate losses from the exchange. Since there are limits to   how much people in the same pool can be charged, this also   leads to healthier people having slightly higher premiums   than they would otherwise and those with preexisting   conditions to have somewhat cheaper premiums.
