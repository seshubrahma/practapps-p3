NOPD told Breitbart Texas that the policies have "been approved" by "the federal judge overseeing our consent decree" and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Under NOPD’s sanctuary city policies, officers are barred from looking into the immigration status of anyone they come into contact with, including victims of crimes or suspects related to the same. Even if NOPD officers learn that an individual is in the country illegally, they are not allowed to share that information unless they are under court order. The City’s sanctuary city policies forbid the NOPD from aiding ICE in any way with operations such as raids, whereas the law enforcement agency once helped with traffic control.
