Under Republican plans, Ohio could lose $22 to $40 billion in federal health funding from 2019 to 2028, according to the Urban Institute.    And while block grants may promise states a reasonable amount of money when first implemented, studies have shown that over time other social safety net block grants for housing and health insurance donâ€™t grow to account for inflation, rising costs or population changes, leaving states with less spending power each year.   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities studied 13 federal block grants for programs like child care, substance abuse and maternal health and found that between 2000 and 2016, federal funding fell an average of 26%. Few states could make up the shortfalls and instead reduced benefits or cut people from the programs.
