According to Rashed, the White House’s announcement that Trump will visit Saudi Arabia upon his first trip outside of the U. S. as president "sends a message that constitutes a change in priorities regarding his (Trump’s) foreign policy after relations between the countries in the Obama era and up until his (Obama’s) visit last year to Saudi Arabia, were the worst relations between the countries in 50 years. " With Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, "We’re seeing a correction in American policy on all fronts: Syria, Iran, Yemen and on the level of bilateral relations," Rashed wrote. Rashed also discussed the challenge posed by the Muslim Brotherhood movement for Egypt and the Egyptian government.
