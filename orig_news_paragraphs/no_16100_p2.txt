Cheryl Mills, a longtime confidant who is taking a lead role in the vetting process, walked into Clinton’s residence in Northwest Washington on Thursday morning. James Hamilton, a veteran Washington lawyer who is overseeing the teams of lawyers researching the candidates, also was on hand. Clinton arrived less than an hour later and stayed until past sundown. For nine hours Clinton’s home was the site of constant activity, with more than half a dozen cars coming and going from the estate.
