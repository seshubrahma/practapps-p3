how much might I sacrifice in returns or payouts) if I elect to receive a   bonus on my annuity? Or for a guaranteed minimum income or benefit if I elect to take my money in monthly payments starting at some later date? What if I want a death benefit for my heirs? Are there specific charges for the insurance component of the product?
