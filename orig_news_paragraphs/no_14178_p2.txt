Sarmad Assali said they received a call from authorities Saturday morning telling them their relatives would not be allowed to enter the country. The Assalis, US citizens who live in Allentown, Pennsylvania, werenâ€™t able to make contact with their family members until they were already headed back overseas. One of the brothers told Sarmad Assali they were not allowed to make calls or use the Internet while they were held. According to the Assalis, their family members do not speak English very well and were told by authorities they could either be detained and have their visas taken away, or they could take the first flight back to Doha.
