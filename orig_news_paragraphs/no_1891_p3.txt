The results suggested that a cloud had begun to lift, and that compelling games played by marquee teams would keep fans engaged. Seattle’s exciting   win over New England on Sunday night on NBC drew an average of 22. 5 million viewers, up 16 percent from the comparable game last season. Until then, NBC’s viewership had fallen by 18 percent this season, to 19. 3 million. Fox’s late afternoon broadcast of Dallas’s     victory over Pittsburgh generated a preliminary overnight rating of a 17. 8, the highest for any N. F. L. game this season (although it fell 3 percent from the comparable game on CBS last year).
