A few weeks ago I felt like I was dreaming when I was at a White House event  and met first lady Michelle Obama. I had just been appointed to the student advisory board for her Better Make Room initiative, which encourages young people to go to college. I am inspired by Better Make Room and want to help more young people improve their lives through higher education.   But as I watched President Trump being inaugurated, I found it hard to believe he might make it impossible for me to go to college in this country.
