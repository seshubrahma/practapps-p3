The first screen shot shows Politico’s originally published version of the article, how they misspelled "Priebus" as "Preibus" and called Ivanka the "wife" of Donald Trump.   The second screen shot shows Politico’s first update, shortly before 11:40 a. m. which still misspells "Priebus" but removes all reference to Ivanka Trump.   The third screen shot, which still misspells "Priebus," adds Ivanka Trump back into the story and now correctly refers to her as Donald Trump’s daughter.   As of Breitbart News’s publication 0f this article, Politico has still not updated the story with the correct spelling of Priebus’s name.
