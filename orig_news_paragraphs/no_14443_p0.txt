 (CNN) The White House struggled Tuesday to answer an avalanche of questions over national security adviser Michael Flynn’s resignation. Flynn was asked to quit Monday after it became public that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about whether he had discussed US sanctions during   phone calls with the Kremlin’s man in Washington, Sergey Kislyak. In new developments Tuesday, it emerged that President Donald Trump was told on January 26    more than two weeks ago    that the Justice Department had concerns about Flynn’s conduct.
