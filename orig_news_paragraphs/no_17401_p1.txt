Trump is assembling a conservative dream team of domestic Cabinet appointments that promises to move swiftly to dismantle the Obama administration ’s legacy in health care, education, labor and environmental policy. They will be aided by a   House and Senate that will coordinate on legislation. That prospect is a far cry from the days when many conservatives rejected Trump outright as he picked off the likes of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, eviscerating the movement’s most promising presidential primary field in decades.
