I’m an ‘out there’ comedian. I’m an ‘in your face’ comedian. But I just wanted to say, if you don’t stand up, you get run over. And what’s happening to me has never happened, ever in the history of this great country, which is that a sitting president of the United States and his grown children and the first lady are personally, I feel, personally trying to ruin my life forever.
