In Washington state, a group of plaintiffs applying for immigrant   visas asked US District Judge James Robart in Seattle   who   suspended the first ban   to stop the new order. ’ ’   Washington state, joined by California, Maryland, Massachusetts,   New York and Oregon, said in court filings they supported the   plaintiffs in Seattle. ’ ’    To move forward with the lawsuits, the states and groups have to   prove harm, or "standing," which some legal experts have said is   difficult to prove because of all the exemptions and waivers in   the new order.
