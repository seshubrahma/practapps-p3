In   the last year alone, the Commission brought a record 868   enforcement actions.   And for the first time, the Commission   devoted significant resources and emphasis on using cutting edge   data analytics to uncover and investigate misconduct resulting in   numerous enforcement actions involving insider trading, asset   management and complex financial instruments.   ’ ’ As a result of the successful whistleblower program, the   Commission has awarded more than $100 million, since inception  —     virtually all during Chair White’s tenure  —   to whistleblowers who   provided key original information that led to successful   enforcement actions.
