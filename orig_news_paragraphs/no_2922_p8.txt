Mr. Giuliani defended his firm’s work for Qatar   —   which he said included training the Qatari police and analyzing the security of a desalinization plant   —   because, he said, it was done under the previous emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa   who abdicated in 2013. Mr. Giuliani said he had consulted the State Department about the contracts and had been told that Sheikh Khalifa was friendly toward the United States.
