The President’s reasoning for dismissing Comey, which Trump told NBC News was something he had been planning to do before it was recommended by his attorney general and deputy attorney general, "raises a very serious concern about obstruction of justice, about obstructing that investigation," Nadler said. Other US officials, including prominent GOP lawmakers such as Sen. John McCain, have said they were "troubled" by Trump’s abrupt firing of Comey  . Many Democratic lawmakers are calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor to take Comey’s place leading the probe. When he fired Comey earlier this week, Trump garnered comparisons to President Richard Nixon and his infamous decision to remove the special prosecutor investigating Watergate crimes in 1973.
