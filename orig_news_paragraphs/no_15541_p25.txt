The drug has been blamed for the death of an otherwise healthy high school student, a    who experienced a heart problem last month.   He had three caffeinated drinks, including coffee and an energy drink in a   period.   And then he collapsed at South Carolinaâ€™s Spring Hill High School. The coroner says the teenager had no prior hearth conditions and that no other drugs or alcohol were found in his body.
