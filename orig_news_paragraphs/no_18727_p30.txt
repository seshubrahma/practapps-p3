At a rally in Boca Raton, Florida, on March 13, I heard him utter at least two bald untruths in the first two minutes of his speech (he said there were 25, 000 people at his Chicago rally when the arena holds fewer than 10, 000, and then he repeated the falsehood that no one had been injured at the event). But journalists I talked to who continue to report the lies as such donâ€™t feel their efforts have much effect. " How many times can you write that the same statement is untrue?
