Trump on Brexit: America is next, President Barack Obama, who felt strongly enough about a British exit or "Brexit" to travel to Britain in April to warn it could not expect special treatment on reaching a free trade deal with the U. S. if it left Europe, offered a rote assurance that nothing would actually change between London and Washington. " While the UKâ€™s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations," Obama said during remarks at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.
