In the final weeks of the campaign, we have often been ushered out before he has finished his speech. In September, Mr. Trump left the traveling press corps behind as he made his way to a rally in New Hampshire, and gloated about it as he took the stage without us there. Despite the restrictions, I try my best to convey the tone and tenor of the campaign and capture a sense of Mr. Trumpâ€™s events, which can at times feel dark, both visually and in tone. At rallies, the press is routinely harassed by supporters and insulted by the candidate himself.
