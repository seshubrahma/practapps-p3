The Trump campaign grabbed headlines with a late announcement that Trump would travel to Mexico to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto before the speech in Phoenix. Trump has repeatedly stated that as President he would make Mexico pay for a border wall. I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2016,
