Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence are going to Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Friday to meet victims of the flooding that has killed 13 and forced 30, 000 Louisianans to leave their homes. ["I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them, and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours," Trump said at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday.   President Obama has given no indication he will interrupt his two week vacation in exclusive Marthaâ€™s Vineyard to visit the flood victims. The president played another round of golf Thursday with television star Larry David and Bain Capital   partner Jonathan Lavine.
