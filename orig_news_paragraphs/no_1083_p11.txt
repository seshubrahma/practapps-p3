Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, also called for bipartisanship. His state has benefited from its expansion of Medicaid under the health law, and would have been punished under the House Republican bill because its high premium costs would not have been offset by larger tax credits, as they are under current law. " The reason why Obamacare failed was because it wasnâ€™t a bipartisan bill," Mr. Young said.
