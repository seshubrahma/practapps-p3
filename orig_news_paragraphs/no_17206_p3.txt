The Obama administration’s response misses the point.   No one is asking for legal status for the DREAMers what House Democrats are seeking is a presidential pardon for them.   This would be completely within the President’s constitutional and legal authority, and in keeping with historical precedent.   With his legacy on immigration at stake, Obama should do the right thing and grant the DREAMers a pardon.
