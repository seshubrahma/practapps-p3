They had met Mr. Trump a few months earlier at a wedding in New York in December 1988, and Mr. Connally had been a close friend of Nixon’s, serving as his Treasury secretary. Nixon was already familiar with Mr. Trump. The former president had written an unsolicited letter to  Mr. Trump in 1987, informing him that Nixon’s wife, Pat, had predicted "that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!" Mr. Connally invited Mr. Trump and his wife, Ivana, to Houston as special guests at "A Night for Nellie," an event to honor Mrs. Connally at the Westin Galleria hotel on March 11, 1989.
