Take freezing rain, for example.   You start with the snowflake high in the atmosphere.   It will enter a warm layer, temperatures above freezing, that will cause the snowflake to melt and basically turn in to a rain drop.   That warm layer is so thick that temperatures donâ€™t get below freezing until just above the surface, not enough time for that raindrop to freeze again.
