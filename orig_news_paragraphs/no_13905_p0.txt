 (CNN) Classified documents presented last week to President Obama and   Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.   The allegations were presented in a   synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.   The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.
