Trump also said the health care legislation is "changing."   Trumpâ€™s comments come days after moderate New Jersey Rep. Tom MacArthur and leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus cut a deal that would require insurers to cover those with   conditions but, unlike the mandate under Obamacare, insurers could charge them higher rates than others in the plan if they allow their  coverage to lapse. Such a change could leave those with   conditions, such as diabetes and asthma, paying much higher premiums and potentially facing gaps in coverage, health care experts note. Republicans would have states set up "  pools" for those with   conditions.
