Mr. Trump said the threat to withhold subsidies was a way to force Democrats to negotiate with him over the future of the Affordable Care Act. In the Journal interview, Mr. Trump said that "Democrats will start calling me and negotiating" because they want to avoid any interruption of the " " subsidies, which reduce    costs for seven million   people. On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a statement saying that "the   subsidies will be funded" while a federal appeals court weighed the legality of the payments. Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks coincided with a letter in which doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and employers pleaded with him and with Congress to help stabilize insurance markets by authorizing a continuation of the subsidies.
