All in all, this adds up to, in the report â€™s words, "a massive and historically unprecedented imbalance" in geographic dynamism. The kinds of jobs in places like Dallas and Las Vegas and San Francisco, versus eastern Kentucky or   Texas or the   Dakota border, might explain why the recovery feels more durable in denser areas, too. Workers in rural areas are far more likely to be involved in industries like farming, forestry, mining, and manufacturing, sectors in which job growth has been undercut and remains threatened by offshoring and automation.
