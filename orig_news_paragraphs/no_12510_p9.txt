NBC also reported about American boots on the ground just prior to Trump taking office, saying that in January, "The U. S. Army in Europe is due to deploy a total of 4, 000 American troops and 2, 000 military vehicles on a rotational basis to Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic nations. " In another provocative move, Reuters reported a barrage of claims and   by U. S. and Russian officials over a new provision in the defense authorization bill signed into law by President Obama last week that the Russians claim would allow the U. S. to supply   weapons to the   rebels in Syria. As Reuters reported, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the move by Obama a "hostile act" and said in a statement: Washington has placed its bets on supplying military aid to   forces who donâ€™t differ that much from blood thirsty head choppers.
