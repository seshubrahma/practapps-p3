We just got word about this year’s Egg Roll and are working on planning," Jennifer Rankin Byrne, the senior director of media relations for PBS, said on March 20. The Easter Egg Roll has been crowded in past years with cast members from "Sesame Street," but this year, there will be a lone emissary. "PBS asked us to participate with them, and we agreed to provide a ‘Sesame Street’ character," said Elizabeth Weinreb Fishman, the vice president for strategic communications for Sesame Workshop. She declined to say which character would attend, referring questions to the White House.
