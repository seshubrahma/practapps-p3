laborers brought in from abroad to fill jobs that Japanese citizens arenâ€™t taking. Just like the United States and other developed countries, Japan has a hard time finding people to pick vegetables, collect   bedpans and wash restaurant dishes.

Japan, on the other hand, long ago achieved what Mr. Trump has promised: It has very little illegal immigration and is officially closed to people seeking   work.
