New Jersey Governor Chris Christie surprised reporters at a press conference with Donald Trump in Texas, endorsing the billionaire presidential candidate for president. ["I’m endorsing the person I believe is the best person to defeat Hillary Clinton and restore American jobs, restore American prestige around the world, and restore the faith and confidence of the American people again in the fact that we are an exceptional and great nation," Christie said during his press conference.   Trump used Christie’s appearance with him to remind reporters of Rubio’s disastrous debate performance against the New Jersey governor in New Hampshire. "
