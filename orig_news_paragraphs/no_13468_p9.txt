As President, I will work tirelessly with the NBPC and their    agents to secure our border once and for all. I will ensure that every    officer has the resources, tools and support they need to protect this nation and stop the influx of drugs, gangs and cartel violence. Together, we will save thousands of American lives, millions of American jobs, and billions of American tax dollars. I am deeply privileged to have the official support of Americaâ€™s border patrol agents, and will never let them down.
