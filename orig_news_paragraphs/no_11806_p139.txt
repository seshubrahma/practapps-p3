My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist," Marshall wrote to his colleagues in one email that came out as part of the leak. Marshall did issue an apology on Facebook, but has faced no consequences for his actions. " I deeply regret that my insensitive, emotional emails would cause embarrassment to the DNC, the Chairwoman, and all of the staffers who worked hard to make the primary a fair and open process," Marshall said in his apology.
