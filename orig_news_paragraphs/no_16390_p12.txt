During the Democratic primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders goofed by dismissing Clintonâ€™s possible ethics issues: "the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn " Sanders famously said at the first Democratic debate.    That let Clinton off the hook, and prevented Sanders from raising the issue later in the campaign, when it might have done him some good. Trump is making a similar mistake.   It should be a respected legal supporter    an   or law professor, for instance    who points out any potential ethical shortcomings in actions of Clinton or her aides.
