" If you want to regain your country, if you want to make the Netherlands for the people of the Netherlands, your own home, again, then you can only vote for one party," Mr. Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom, said. Mr. Wilders, whose party leads in national polls, posted a video clip of his comments on Twitter. Mr. Wilders, who was convicted in December of inciting discrimination after leading an   chant at a political rally in 2014, has vowed to end Muslim immigration and shutter the countryâ€™s mosques if elected prime minister in a general election on March 15.
