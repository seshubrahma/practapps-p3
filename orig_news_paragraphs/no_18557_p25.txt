As Alan Dershowitz, the renowned attorney and professor emeritus   at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider in an email,   Congress "can compel" Sessions to answer the questions and   override any Justice Department policy, so long as privilege has   not been invoked. He added that Trump would have to invoke   executive privilege if Congress were to subpoena Sessions for the   questions. ’ ’    But Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University, said he   believes "it’’s too late" for Trump to invoke executive privilege,   adding that he would argue Trump has already waived his right to   invoke.
