I think at the core of leadership, you have to get   everyone on the same team to move the ball ahead. And you can’’t   have discord, you’’re a peacemaker as a leader if you want to have   a community of spirits and hearts. And I think in all those   categories, he has to come back as a different person. Next life,   maybe.
