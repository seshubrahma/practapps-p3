On the issue of defending unborn children and protecting women from the violence of abortion, Mr. Trump cannot be trusted and there is, thankfully, an abundance of alternative candidates with proven records of   leadership whom   voters can support. We have come to this conclusion after having listened patiently to numerous debates and news reports, but most importantly to Donald Trumpâ€™s own words. The next president will be responsible for as many as four nominations to the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump has given us only one indication about the type of judges he would appoint, and it does not bode well for those who would like to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade.
