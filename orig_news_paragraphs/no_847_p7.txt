Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. the head of the United States Pacific Command, announced the start of the deployment, saying that "continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterdayâ€™s launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy Thaad to South Korea. " The developments come as South Korea is consumed by turmoil over the impeachment of President Park   whose administration agreed to the Thaad deployment. But with the president facing possible removal from office over a corruption scandal, the fate of the system had been in doubt.
