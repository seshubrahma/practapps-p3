This made Mondayâ€™s visit between Abadi and Trump a much warmer one than if the Iraq travel ban were still on the table. The arbitrary nature of the Iraqi travel ban was underlined by the fact that Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati, who is the most important leader in the   fight since he heads the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service, could not get a visa to visit his own family members in the United States. Now that Abadi has met Trump, he should invite him to visit Iraq and see a city such as Sulaimani which is, by regional standards, a safe and   city of smooth highways and modern apartment blocks ringed by   mountains that feels a lot freer and more open than much of the rest of the Middle East.   At the American University in Sulaimani, female students wear a wide range of garb, from simple headscarves to   dresses paired with high heels.
