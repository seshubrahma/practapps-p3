Appearing on Breitbart News Daily Monday morning, economist Peter Morici of the University of Maryland was unsurprised by the   market rally, and predicted investors would remain bullish on Trump until and unless he gives them a firm reason not to be: The thing is, we had a ‘Trump scare’ about two weeks before the election. People started to realize he could win, and the stocks went down. But you know, after a certain point, you step back and say, ‘What would happen if we had a Trump presidency? ’
