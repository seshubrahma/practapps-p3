McCarthyâ€™s spokesman told CNN that if the resolution passes the committee this week, then the House is expected to vote on the resolution in early June. CNN obtained a copy of the resolution from a congressional source. It states that "those Turkish officials blatantly suppressed the First Amendment rights of United States citizens, and multiple armed Turkish security officials beat, kicked, and choked unarmed demonstrators."   It also notes that two Turkish security officials who were detained by local law enforcement were later allowed to be released and leave the country because they held diplomatic immunity.
