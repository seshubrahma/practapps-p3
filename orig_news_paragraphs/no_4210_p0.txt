The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed several web pages about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions from its homepage as the agency announced Friday that it would be "undergoing changes" to better reflect the Trump administration’s priorities. [Officials took down one website that appeared to contradict EPA administrator Scott Pruitt’s statements on climate change and removed another that provided information about the Clean Power Plan, an initiative of the Obama administration, the Washington Post reported.   " As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land, and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency," J. P. Freire, the agency’s associate administrator for public affairs, said in a statement.
