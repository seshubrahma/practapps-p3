I am going to build a great border wall, institute nationwide   stop illegal immigrants from accessing welfare and entitlements, and develop an   tracking system to ensure those who overstay their visas are quickly removed. If we don’t enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border   —    it’s as simple as that.
