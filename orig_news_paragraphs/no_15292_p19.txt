Ultimately, that flabbergasted person is who I wanted to reach with that episode of the show. And if you are #woke about the KKK being alive and well in America, all I can say is: keep watching "United Shades" this season    there’s more you need to see. I guarantee that we will cover some subject, some group of people,   some cuddle business that you have never heard of or thought much of before you saw our show. Because that’s what we do.
