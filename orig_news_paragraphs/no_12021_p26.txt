Donald Trump is responsible for what happens at his events. He is the person who has for months now been not just inciting violence but applauding violence. The images of the, you know, young African American protester being attacked totally without any provocation what so ever and having Donald Tump saying he would pay the legal bills of the attacker. So clearly, you know, people who engage in protest should follow civil disobedience principles and should be peaceful, should be non violent, but I do think that as I said the other day what Trump has done is like a case of political arson.
