Senator John McCain of Arizona will join four of the five living former Republican nominees in skipping the convention. " Iâ€™m in a very tough   campaign," he said last week, explaining his expected absence. Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, two of the most endangered Republican incumbents, will also be nowhere near Cleveland that week.
