Nunes apologized to his committee members Thursday, a day after he told the public and the President that communications of him and associates may have been collected by intelligence agencies before telling Democratic members of the committee. Earlier Friday, Intelligence Committee member Rep. Jim Himes,   accused Nunes of persistently serving "the interests of Donald Trump," but stopped short of calling him to step down from the probe into ties between the Trump White House and Russia. " Devin, as much as I appreciate him and consider him a friend, has demonstrated on multiple occasions that he often serves the interests of Donald Trump," Himes told CNNâ€™s Alisyn Camerota on "New Day."
