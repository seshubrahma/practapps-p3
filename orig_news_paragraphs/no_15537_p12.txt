As chief of the criminal division, Mueller saw the creation of the agencyâ€™s first   unit, putting himself on the leading edge of a field of crime fighting and national security that has only grown more important.   Prior to joining the FBI in 2001, after he left Justice Department headquarters, Mueller served as the US attorney in San Francisco.   After leaving the FBI, Mueller joined private law firm WilmerHale, from which he is resigning to take the special counsel role.
