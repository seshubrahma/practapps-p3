" The Cuomo plan covers only the difference between a studentâ€™s existing aid and tuition. In New York, where tuition is among the lowest in the nation ($6, 470 at state universities $6, 330 at city universities and $4, 800 at   colleges) existing federal and state grants already cover tuition entirely for students from families making less than about $50, 000. So students coming from the bottom half of the income bracket in New York will see no additional direct aid from this new plan.
