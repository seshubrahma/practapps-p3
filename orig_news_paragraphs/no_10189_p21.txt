I think they’ll give the leader the benefit of the doubt that it is complicated and a big hairy problem of feeding this terrorist threat. It is a big problem. they want them to connect with the fact that they’re worried about it, that they’re scared about the future of the country, and when you can’t call the enemy what the enemy is, and when San Bernardino happened, you know what they did with the flags, they put them at half mass   they said it was workplace violence.
