It’s not believed Kim was directly threatening an imminent launch of a missile, with or without a nuclear warhead, but rather was emphasizing his commitment to the missile program. Both US officials told CNN that it appears North Korea’s weapons program remains relatively quiet at this time with no signs of an imminent intercontinental missile launch, although there are indications that   missiles continue to be moved around. Nonetheless, the US officials have indicated they will continue to pay extra attention to any North Korean intelligence throughout the rest of the US presidential transition and through the early days of the Trump administration because of concerns Kim could see it as a period of vulnerability for the US.
