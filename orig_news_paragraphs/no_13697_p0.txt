Glenn Beck indirectly offered an opinion on his suspension from SiriusXM by linking to an article by Erick Erickson calling the satellite radio company "cowards. " [SiriusXM suspended Beck over comments made last week during his interview with fiction writer Brad Thor, in which the radio talker agreed with Thor’s suggestion that a "patriot" might have to "step up" to remove a potential President Donald Trump from power should Trump overstep his Constitutional authority and Congress refuse to impeach him.   In a statement issued this morning, SiriusXM said Thor’s comments "may be reasonably construed by some to have been advocating harm against an individual currently running for office, which we cannot and will not condone. For that reason, we have suspended The Glenn Beck Program from our Patriot channel for the coming week and are evaluating its place in our lineup going forward.
