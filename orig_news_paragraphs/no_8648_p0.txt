A black, female Bowling Green State University student allegedly fabricated a hate crime story about white, male   Donald Trump supporters attacking her on campus and is now being charged for faking a police report. [The day after Trump’s presidential victory, Eleesha Long told Bowling Green police that she had been attacked by three men wearing Trump gear who "began to throw rocks" at her, according to ABC13.   Long took to her Facebook page to share the story, describing in detail what each Trump supporter was wearing and giving a description of as to where the alleged hate crime had occurred, but never actually called the police. Long’s Facebook post went viral and her father notified law enforcement after he said he was not able to get in touch with her.
