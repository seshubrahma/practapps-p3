On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s "New Day," former Attorney General under President George W. Bush Alberto Gonzales stated that if former FBI Director James Comey felt he was being pressured by the White House, he "had an obligation" to tell his superiors, and if he didn’t, "then he failed in his job. "  Gonzales said that he thinks the appointment of a special counsel is a good idea and expressed his confidence in the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller. He added that if he were advising the president, he would advise him to stop commenting on the investigation.
