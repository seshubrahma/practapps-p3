Breitbart News has obtained an emergency alert sent out by Trump activist Rebecca Clutter in Medina County, where the Kasich establishment is also shutting down the Trump force: ZERO Trump lit is going out at the ORP scheduled "walks" in Medina, Brunswick and Wadsworth.   This is at the direction of our female State Central Committee person (Sharon Ray).   Almost exclusively, the Trump door knocks are being done by 15 ladies from Medina County Women for Trump. We (Medina Co Women for Trump) are literally knocking on EVERY door one township at a time.
