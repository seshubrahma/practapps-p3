I have been the only candidate with a clear message on this issue.   As for drug traffickers, they are wreaking havoc on our communities and I oppose efforts to reduce penalties for drug traffickers: we must do more to keep traffickers out of our neighborhoods. I have been   enforcement all of my life.   The American people are crying out for safer communities, and I will bring this message of supporting law enforcement and safe communities to a general election.
