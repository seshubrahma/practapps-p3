While Nevada decided how its delegates would vote on the   of the RNC convention two months ago, the state is only now preparing to decide who will serve as delegates. The Nevada State Republican party convenes for its convention on May 13th. Party members will select the delegates who will represent the state at the RNC convention in July. In most cases, these delegates will be bound to support a particular candidate on the first ballot at the convention, but could otherwise be free to support any candidate on subesquent votes for the nomination.
