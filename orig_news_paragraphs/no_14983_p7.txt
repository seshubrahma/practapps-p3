Flynn also left some speeches off his initial forms that donâ€™t appear to be linked to Leading Authorities or another speakers bureau. Those include talks to Halifax Investment Management and Black Duck Software, which he identified only as consulting jobs in his initial filing. The initial and recent disclosures also show discrepancy in how he listed a speaking engagement paid for by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a former official with the nonprofit Assembly of Turkish American Associations, a   advocacy group based in D. C.   In his initial forms, Flynn lists Kurtulus in a section detailing sources of income exceeding $5, 000 in the past two years.
