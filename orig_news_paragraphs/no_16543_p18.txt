Differing views on immigration among Team Trump members, Trump’s vice presidential pick, Gov. Pence, on Sunday deflected questions about the fate of those undocumented immigrants who haven’t committed additional crimes in the United States, on NBC’s "Meet the Press." "With all due respect to the media’s focus on the 11 million or whatever that number is, he was focused on the more than 300 million people who are citizens of this country and are here legally in this country, and driving policies in immigration that will work for them, work for the future of our nation," Pence said. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway also wouldn’t say what Trump’s eventual plan for the majority of undocumented immigrants living in the United States would be.   On ABC’s "This Week," Conway said that "once you enforce the law, once you get rid of the criminals, once you triple the number of ICE agents, once you secure the southern border, once you turn off the jobs magnet, jobs and benefit magnet, then we’ll see where we are."
