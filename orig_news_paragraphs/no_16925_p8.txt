A young Stone served Nixon by planting false stories about his opponents during the 1972 campaign.   After his president was driven from office by the Watergate scandal, Stone became one of the Nixon alumni who would convert the trauma of disgrace into decades of seeking to settle scores. Like Nixon’s first campaign manager, who said "the purpose of an election is not to defeat an opponent, but to destroy him," Stone takes a   approach that includes promoting conspiracy theories, such as the notion that Lyndon Johnson was behind John F. Kennedy’s assassination.    In the current campaign, he is best known for developing outrageous theories about both Clintons, including much of the material Trump now uses, without proof, to argue that Bill committed many sexual assaults, and somehow it is Mrs. Clinton who should be scorned for enabling him.
