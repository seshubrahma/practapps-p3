Secretary of State John Kerry will spend his last week in office in much the same way as he spent a lot of it: traveling. The trip began with a stop in Vietnam on Friday, above. On Sunday, he’ll be in Paris for peace talks. Also on Sunday, Vice President Joe Biden will be in Ukraine to meet with that country’s president.
