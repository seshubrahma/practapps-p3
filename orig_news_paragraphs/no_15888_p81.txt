sometime it passes us lying on the ground.    I figured out this was not really a good place to be if that shooter goes around the third base dugout toward home plate on the outside of the fence because then you have a clean shot at us lying on the ground.    So thatâ€™s when I ran into the dugout, helped apply a tourniquet with my belt to one of our staffers, who was shot in the leg.
