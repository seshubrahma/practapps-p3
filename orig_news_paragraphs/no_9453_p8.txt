Trump was talking on speaker phone, the aide realized, while Kushner was in the room. Kushner is considered a critic of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who has been locked in a   power struggle with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Kushner has operated largely above the internal feud, acting as a freelance power center across multiple areas of the campaign. He was part of a Trump delegation that met with House Speaker Paul Ryan’s policy team late last month in Washington, attended an   meeting of Trump’s transition team in New York, joined Trump’s first fundraising swing last month in California, and recently courted opinion leaders such as former secretary of state Henry Kissinger to discuss Trump’s foreign policy.
