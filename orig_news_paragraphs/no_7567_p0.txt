Columnist Charles Krauthammer said GOP presidential candidates Ohio Governor John Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were the winners of Saturday’s GOP presidential debate, while Florida Senator Marco Rubio was "really hurt" by his exchange with Christie in a way that will impact the results of New Hampshire’s primary significantly and  "put something of a brake on his momentum" during the Fox News Channel’s coverage of the debate.   Krauthammer said there was "not a lot of ambiguity" in the debate results, "The winners were the three governors for sure, the ones with most, way behind, who had to gain, particularly I thought Kasich, he made his case as perfectly pitched for New Hampshire, of the guy who can appeal to independents, to reach across the aisle, who’s a moderate, a bit like the Obama appeal of 2008. I thought he was the most effective. Bush had his best night, had a good night presenting his own case, but also he nailed Trump on the eminent domain, he took him on, number one, and second, I think that he really landed a blow.
