Order is not simply forced on people by the police or handed down to them by Congress or the courts. Order is a collaboration among all, the product of the American community.   Our 21st century order is shaped by our Constitution, which demands that the laws be applied equally, justly, and humanely. In an earlier time in America, the law made some people the property of other people, the law discriminated against some, the law divided race from race.
