Watts also noted that Russians likely targeted every candidate in the campaign    including one member of the Intelligence Committee, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.   " They were in full swing during both the Republican and Democratic primary season    and may have helped sink the hopes of candidates more hostile to Russian interests long before the field narrowed," Watts said.
