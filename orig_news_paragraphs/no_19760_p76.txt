LAWA police headquarters is located in an unremarkable gated complex, tucked behind a cinderblock wall on a   street off Sepulveda Boulevard. The famously close approach of passenger jets supplies a   roar, reminding everyone of what theyâ€™re here to protect. This is where Anthony McGinty comes to work every day (Michelle Sosa, on the other hand, spends most of her time at the Joint Regional Intelligence Center, or JRIC, a straight shot east on the 105 freeway in Norwalk). After passing through a series of   doors, the facility features low ceilings and small cubicles, all an unremitting shade of grey.
