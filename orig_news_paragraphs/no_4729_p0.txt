Former U. N. ambassador John Bolton discussed the Trump administration’s top foreign policy objectives with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily. [Curt Schilling, who was   from CPAC on Thursday morning, asked Bolton what he thought the top foreign policy concern for the Trump administration was at the moment.   " I think there are two immediate concerns, and then there are two strategic concerns that may sound   but require corrective action by the Trump administration just as soon as they can get to it, to overcome the mistakes of the last eight years," Bolton replied.
