Yesterday, BuzzFeed reported that a freelance correspondent for the   channel TV Azteca was booted from the Trump Tower in New York after he was overheard speaking Spanish on his phone. However, a modicum of fact checking by CNN proved the story false. [BuzzFeed was told by a "source with knowledge of the incident" that TV Azteca correspondent Marcos Stupenengo, an Argentinian working for the Mexican outlet, was initially granted an interview with Donald Trump, before being told that the campaign "wasn’t interested" in coverage from   media once he arrived on site.   It now appears that it didn’t quite happen that way.
