This is not a guy who has been in love with the media throughout his career. I haven’t detected, over the course of his career, that he gets moved by the press coverage. He’s always seemed to me to be a smart enough guy to know something that maybe Jim Comey had to learn the hard way, which is that whether you’re a hero or a goat often doesn’t have a lot to do with you. It has a lot more to do with whatever agenda the media has, and what they seek to be accomplishing that day.
