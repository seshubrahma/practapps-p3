The Boiler, a Pierogi Art   venue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn has cancelled Lucian Wintrich’s upcoming   art exhibition, after threatening to redirect fees to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The exhibition organizers, who are still fundraising for the project, say they have an alternative venue which will be announced soon. [In an email to arts website Artnet, Pierogi Gallery   Joe Amrhein claimed that he had been led to believe that the event, which is set to feature performance art pieces from Breitbart’s MILO, Gavin McInnes, and Martin Shkreli, was satirical. He then threatened to send any money he received from Wintrich to the Clinton campaign.
