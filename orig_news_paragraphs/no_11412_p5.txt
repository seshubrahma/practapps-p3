the fewer complete the overall survey. The insults start after the "Trump vs. Clinton" question is asked, but polling methodology traditionally involves only counting those who complete the whole survey so that you have a breakdown of age, gender, and race. While PPP did not return an email from me Tuesday asking if they dropped results from voters who did not complete all 38 questions, the methodology is biased either way: Either way, the questions constitute terrible methodology being used to create a press release trashing Trump rather than learn where the race is.
