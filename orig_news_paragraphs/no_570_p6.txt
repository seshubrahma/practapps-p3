Mr. Carter has long shaped Plains, where he is known as "Mr. Jimmy," and the Sunday school teacher ’s grin   —   in snapshots, in paintings and in caricature on Christmas ornaments and a   peanut statue  —   is hard to miss. The presidential seal graces welcome signs, which are illuminated, fittingly, by solar electricity, and the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site has attracted more than 1. 6 million visitors since 1988.
