We might pause at some of those numbers: Buffett paying 17. 4 percent of his income in taxes puts him right in line with the findings noted by Chriss Street above. And yes, we can believe that his tax rate is roughly half that of his office employees in today’s tax system, the curve of the rate of effective taxation rises progressively with income —  and then plummets, regressively, for the very rich. (As an aside, we might note that Buffett does not seem to have volunteered any extra payment to Uncle Sam as guilt money.)
