Trump 28% Cruz 23% Rubio 15% Bush 13% Kasich 9% Carson 9%. In light of the bizarre   outlier poll that showed Trump losing his national lead to Cruz, some people might look skeptically at this SC poll. The RCP average shows Trumpâ€™s lead dropping 5 points over the last few days but he is still maintaining a 14 point lead. Obviously, the only   poll will be the voting tomorrow.
