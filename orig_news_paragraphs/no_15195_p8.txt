Why, they ask, is someone who refuses to identify as a Democrat, being given so much say in the party’s future? The nerve!   On the flip side, many progressive Democrats regard Sanders, along with a few others, like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, as the left’s answer to the corporate influence    and political incompetence    it believes poisoned Clinton’s candidacy. They view Sanders as a uniquely powerful bulwark against the party’s embrace of policies (free trade, austerity, privatization, etc.)
