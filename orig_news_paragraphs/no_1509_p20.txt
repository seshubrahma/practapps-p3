The Cato Institute, a   group, called Mr. Pence a "champion tax cutter" and lauded his "frugal" spending record. As governor, he repealed Indianaâ€™s inheritance tax and lowered taxes on corporate income and business property. In 2010, Mr. Pence proposed a bill in the House that would have instituted a limit on federal spending, but the idea did not have enough support to pass. Where they differ Mr. Trump has promised big tax cuts, but he does want to close some loopholes, such as the one on carried interest, that benefit the rich.
