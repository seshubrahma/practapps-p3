In June, a top State department official said that ISIS had lost 47% of the territory it had previously controlled in Iraq, and its ranks had been nearly halved from the members it had in 2014.   " Whereas it once promised lavish pay for recruits, and free services in its ’caliphate,’ it is now slashing pay, cannot provide services, and is facing internal resistance," Special Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk said in congressional testimony. In the first half of this year, the IHS Conflict Monitor found that ISIS’s territory had shrunk by 12%.
