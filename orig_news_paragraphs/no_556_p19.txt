Under the influence of René Guénon, a French metaphysicist and convert to Islam, Evola in 1934 published his most influential work, "The Revolt Against the Modern World," which cast materialism as an eroding influence on ancient values. It viewed humanism, the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation and the French Revolution all as historical disasters that took man further away from a transcendental perennial truth. Changing the system, Evola argued, was "not a question of contesting and polemicizing, but of blowing everything up. "
