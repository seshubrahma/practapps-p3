To put that into perspective, George Wallace, running for president in 1968 on an openly racist,   message, got three percent of the nonwhite vote. So this isn’t about Trump winning   votes. It’s about convincing   white voters that he is not a racist. As my friend and colleague Ron Brownstein has written, "No Democratic presidential nominee has carried (  whites) in the history of modern polling dating back to 1952."
