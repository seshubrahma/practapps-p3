As Trump explained, Clinton’s Syrian refugees would come on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U. S. already admits from Muslim countries. Adding Clinton’s 65, 000 Syrian refugees to the approximately 149, 000 Muslim migrants the U. S. resettled on green cards in the course of one year, means that Clinton could permanently resettle roughly 214, 000 Muslim migrants in her first year as President. If Clinton were to continue her Syrian refugee program throughout her Presidency, she could potentially resettle roughly 1. 5 million Muslim migrants during her first two terms.
