Confusion at airports again? When the new executive order was signed last week, administration officials told reporters that the new order included a   " " period to ensure that those traveling "arenâ€™t placed in legal jeopardy," and in the hopes of avoiding the "chaos" seen at airports after the first travel ban was signed. But now that judges have scheduled hearings to hear challenges to the new order Wednesday    just hours before it is slated to go into effect at 12:01 a. m. on Thursday    travelers at airports could experience confusion once again if any judge blocks the new order, either in full or in part.    The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.
