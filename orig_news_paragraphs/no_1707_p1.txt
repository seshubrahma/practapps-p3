His office declined to comment on Tuesday about whether it would look into the donations tied to Mr. Trump’s business disputes. A group of congressional Democrats has also asked the Department of Justice to look into a $25, 000 political donation made through the foundation in support of Florida’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, around the time her office was reviewing allegations against Mr. Trump’s   education programs. Ms. Bondi ultimately decided not to take action against Mr. Trump. Aides to Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, have said that donation was made in error from the foundation.
