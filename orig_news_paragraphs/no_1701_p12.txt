Mr. Trump directly equated American vulnerability to terrorism with what he called laxness in the immigration system. He has mainly warned about the risk of admitting refugees from Syria and other   countries, though the suspect arrested in the weekend attacks, Ahmad Khan Rahami, is a naturalized citizen born in Afghanistan and has lived in the United States for years. " These attacks, and many others, were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system," Mr. Trump said, trying to return the political debate to the issue he is most comfortable discussing.
