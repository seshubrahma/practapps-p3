Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump spent his 100th day in office not at the annual   dinner that some say launched his bid for the White House, but with some of the people who sent him there. Amid increasingly hostile relations between Trump and the media, Trump announced in February that he would not attend the White House correspondents’ dinner Saturday night    making him the first President since Ronald Reagan to miss the event (although Reagan, who was hospitalized after an assassination attempt at the Washington Hilton    the same hotel serving as the venue for Saturday’s dinner    gave remarks by phone). Instead, Trump held a   rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, one of the states he wasn’t expected to win in November, with the aim of reminding some of his most ardent supporters that he has kept his campaign promises.
