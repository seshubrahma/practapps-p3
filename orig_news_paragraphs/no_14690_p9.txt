ICE said in a statement that Avelica was arrested because he has "multiple prior criminal convictions, including a DUI in 2009, as well an outstanding order of removal dating back to 2014. " The ICE statement said members of a Los   fugitive operations team conducted surveillance to confirm Avelicaâ€™s identity before arresting him near a charter school.   Avelica, a father of four, had lived in the United States for more than 25 years, according to a statement from Emi MacLean, an attorney for National Day Laborer Organizing Network.
