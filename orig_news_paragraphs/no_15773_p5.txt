A Flynn source told CNN they will submit "some documents soon based on their narrowed document requests after we objected." Comey’s memos are of particular interest to congressional investigators following reports last month that the   director wrote a memo following a meeting with Trump, detailing how the President allegedly asked Comey to end the investigation into Flynn. CNN has not viewed the memo but did have the memo described by sources familiar with the matter. Trump later denied Comey’s description of the meeting.
