The exemption in the 2016 budget allowed companies to exempt visas for new   workers from the annual cap of 66, 000 visas if those workers had been an   worker in the previous three years. That "returning worker exemption" effectively boosted the annual size of the program from 66, 000 up to a maximum of 264, 000. If that exemption is reestablished for 2017, the   inflow would be larger than the annual inflow of roughly 110, 000   employees via the   visa program, which is mostly used by information technology and medical industries. Ryanâ€™s retreat from the   program is a notable change.
