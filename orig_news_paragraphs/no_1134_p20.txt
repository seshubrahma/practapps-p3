Laura Chapman, 26, a rescue coordinator at the center, said in an interview Wednesday that the drones were likely being used for sightseeing or taking pictures, and that their pilots might be unaware of the harbor and elephant seals they are disturbing. " With new technology comes new responsibility," she said. Ms. Chapman said that the noise was interrupting a very sensitive period in the lives of the young seals, and that the disruption could have implications for the pupsâ€™ nutrition.
