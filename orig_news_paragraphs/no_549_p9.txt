But the site has since corrected the article on its website. The spreading of articles about the old Kuwait visa ban began last week, after Mr. Trump signed an executive order blocking citizens from seven   countries from entering the United States. As chaos spread at airports and opponents mounted legal challenges to the order, an editor working the night shift at The New Arab, a news site based in London, came across a report that Kuwait had announced a visa ban of its own on citizens from five   states. Keenly aware of the "justifiable international public interest," the editor quickly wrote and published an article about the Kuwaiti ban without realizing that it was based on "a decision made in 2011," according to a statement posted on the site on Tuesday after The New York Times inquired about the articleâ€™s origin.
