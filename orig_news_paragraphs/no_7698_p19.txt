The move back to traditional radio was an easy one for me to make based upon the individuals who are leading the station I am with. With their vision and philosophy of making sports radio something that is distinguishable in so many ways from the status quo, I looked upon this a perfect opportunity to get back in the game to provide the kind of a show that is my hallmark. I have zero restrictions, no limitations on what to say or not to say, and most important, the total and complete backing of station management. The lack of a corporate culture here and the renegade spirit that is present is an exact parameter fit for me on every level.
