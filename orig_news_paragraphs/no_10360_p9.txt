In Jesus’s time, some Jews expected the Messiah to be a political or military leader  —   a revolutionary who would overthrow the Roman empire. Yet he, as a carpenter who didn’t live to 40, accomplished so much more than that. Jesus brought a new, otherworldly kingdom (John 18:36)   —   one that exists today within and across the world’s nations (Luke 13:29, 17: ) and will someday become the only authority in the world, with Jesus as both its King (Revelation 1:5) and Priest (Hebrews 4, 5).
