but it’s worth saying again: if President Trump proves to be as radical on energy and climate as he promised to be on the campaign trail, then this, even if he achieves nothing else, will more than qualify him for a place next to the greats on Mt Rushmore. He will go down in history as the hero who slew ManBearPig: the president who, unlike his pusillanimous,   Establishment predecessors from Clinton and the Bushes to the ultimate horror that was Obama, finally had the courage, integrity and honesty to point out that the Climate Emperor is wearing no clothes the guy who brought to the end the greatest scientific scandal ever who saved Western Industrial Civilisation from the Watermelons. But it’s all very well having good instincts and good intentions.
