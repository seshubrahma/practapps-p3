The lack of   jobs is a direct result of the Clinton globalist policies that have sent US jobs and industries overseas. The August jobs report shows a troubling   trend: The   economy fails to produce   jobs, particularly in the manufacturing industries that can reduce our trade deficit. We lost 14, 000 manufacturing jobs. The offshoring of   American jobs and the replacement of American workers at home with   foreign labor, whether illegal or on work visas, has destroyed upward mobility, consumer purchasing power and the tax base of state, local, and federal governments.
