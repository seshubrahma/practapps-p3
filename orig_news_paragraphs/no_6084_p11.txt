Repeatedly, the progressive activists packed throughout the venue shouted nasty,   pejoratives at Buchanan. Even when he was answering questions, they would shout "answer the question" repeatedly, and yelled "yes or no" many times when he would not give them an answer they wanted. " Healthcare for all," a sign the progressives want to go even further than Obamacare when it comes to government control of healthcare, was another chant that the activists shouted to open up the event before Buchanan even took the stage.
