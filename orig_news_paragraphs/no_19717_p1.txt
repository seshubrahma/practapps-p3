Together, they illustrate political challenges that Trump will face as he tries to hold on to the very different sorts of supporters who form his coalition. Brendan, an immigration hawk from Colorado, represents one part of Trumpâ€™s base: I am a first time voter, 19, and Trump would have to back down on his campaign promises for me to not support him. I am already a bit nervous about some of his cabinet appointments, such as the Goldman Sachs bankers and the establishment neoconservatives like John Bolton he has chosen. I feel like the wall, and his strong   immigration stance, are his signature policy proposals, and he would have to cave to pressure from establishment   Republicans and betray his immigration policies he laid out in his AZ speech.
