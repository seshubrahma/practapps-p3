Thursday on CNN’s "The Situation Room," with the New York presidential primaries a little over a week away, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin was asked to comment on Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz’s remarks regarding "New York values. "   Cruz had criticized his opponent GOP presidential   Donald Trump back in January for his "New York values" and doubled down on that criticism earlier in the week, insisting he was referring to New York Democrats, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo ( ) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ( ). However, Toobin suggested it went beyond that and said that it was an "  stereotype derogatory term. " "
