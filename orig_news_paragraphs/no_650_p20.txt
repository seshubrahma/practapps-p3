The surprise election result turns the series’ premise into an unintended metaphor. Diane stands in for a certain breed of liberal who expected to be able to take a breather, the glass ceiling shattered, the gains consolidated. Instead, her financial ruin  —   the scam, we learn, wiped out "many of the nation’s liberal elites"  —   leaves her to claw her way back. Oddly, this makes the series feel more    than if it had aired as planned, during a triumphalist Clinton administration.
