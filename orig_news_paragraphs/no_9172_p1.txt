Mr. Cameron’s influence has had a negative effect on his own campaign, making 29 per cent of respondents say they’re more likely to vote Leave   —   nearly double the 15 per cent who say he has made them more likely to vote Remain. At 56 per cent, over half of those polled said his contributions have had no impact on their vote. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has not caused quite such a negative impact on his own side, with a marginally better 19 per cent of people more likely to vote Leave thanks to his contribution, compared to 13 per cent for the Remain side he supports.
