The Malaysian government acknowledged for the first time that the pilot of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished with 239 people aboard more than two years ago, had recorded a route on his personal flight simulator for the southern Indian Ocean. That is the area where a few pieces of debris from the aircraft were found. While not conclusive, the finding deepened suspicion that the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, deliberately flew off course en route to Beijing.
