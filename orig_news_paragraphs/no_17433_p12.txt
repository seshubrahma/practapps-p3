The overall result is a big disparity among states: Some have seen a flood of new charter schools, while others have barely seen a trickle. States such as Arizona and Colorado instituted   regulations that helped fuel their growth, while other states have much stricter rules: Iowa, where local school boards maintain control, has only a small number of approved charter schools. Currently, 43 states and Washington, D. C. have charter school laws.
