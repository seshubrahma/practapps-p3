â€”   not just for U. S. citizens, but for foreigners as well. Our reporting has shown that one of the Mexican cartels, Los Zetas, is currently stockpiling Russian   grenades and their launchers at the Texas border, that they recently forced down a U. S. helicopter by open firing on the aircraft and striking it. Los Zetas are headquartered in Nuevo Laredo, a city that sits immediately across the shallow and narrow Rio Grande from Laredo, Texas. There are no fences or walls in the region and the local police do not have a presence in many of the     that sit in Texas along the open border.
