Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, declined to say whether he would be concerned if a private citizen attempted to set up backchannel communications with a foreign government to influence US foreign policy and said he would not be concerned if a White House official attempted to do so. " We have backchannel communications with a number of countries," McMaster said.
