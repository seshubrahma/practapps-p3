As two powerful exclusive pieces from Breitbart’s Joel Pollak show, Cruz’s mother and father were listed on an electors list in 1974 in Canada. Cruz’s father, Rafael Bienvenido Cruz, had already publicly confirmed he applied for and received Canadian citizenship back when they lived in Canada in the 1970s. The issue of Cruz’s mother, however, had never been answered before and it had never been clear whether she had applied for or received Canadian citizenship until this week when Cruz’s campaign finally confirmed she was only in Canada on a work permit and never applied for or received Canadian citizenship. Cruz’s campaign also provided Breitbart News with his mother’s birth certificate, proving she was born with U. S. citizenship in Delaware.
