"Given the amount of students that could very literally be in fear of their legal status    doctoral students or international students from the Middle East, which we have a fairly decent percentage of at SIU, we wanted to make sure they know we supported them and that they were aware we were advocating on their behalf," President of the Graduate and Professional Student Council Brandon Woudenberg told The Southern. Additionally, there are at least 20 illegal immigrant students who are enrolled at SIU under President Obamaâ€™s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, according to university officials. Trump has hinted at reversing DACA, as it allows young people to take spots at American   universities despite entering the country illegally. SIU Carbondale Interim Chancellor Brad Colwell is already pushing back against the demand by students, saying that under Trump, the university would be risking federal funding if it goes out of its way to shield illegal immigrants in the area.
