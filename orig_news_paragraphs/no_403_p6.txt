When the nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 with major powers including the United States, they agreed sanctions on Iran would be relaxed in exchange for its verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work. A Security Council resolution "called upon" Iran not to undertake any tests of missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Iran contends that it has not violated the resolution and that its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads   â€”   which it already has promised not to make as part of the nuclear accord.
