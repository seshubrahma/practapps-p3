A   Trump is blindly defending O’Reilly against the courageous women who came forward to make sexual harassment claims. As a reminder, Trump also blindly defended his   friend Roger Ailes last summer when over two dozen women came forward to report that Ailes had sexually harassed them when he headed Fox News.   But I have to disagree with the "SNL" line where Trump says to O’Reilly, "I actually see a lot of myself in you, Bill. "
