Roger Palmer, an Army veteran, said Mr. Trump’s treatment of the Khans and of Mr. McCain had been unpresidential. Mr. Palmer, 56, a   conservative who wore a baseball hat with the Revolutionary War slogan "Join or Die," said he did not plan to vote for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton in the general election. " He’s basically a loose cannon," Mr. Palmer said of Mr. Trump, adding that he voted for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the New Hampshire primary.
