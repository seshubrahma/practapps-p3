Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  (CNN) President Donald Trump was lavished with extravagant royal pomp here Saturday during his first stop abroad as President, an elaborate start to a trip meant to bolster international partnerships but which aides now hope can reset a   narrative back home. Trumpâ€™s stop in an enthusiastic Saudi capital is the first in a     swing across the Middle East and Europe. The complex itinerary will take Trump to the capitals of three great world religions and introduce him to the grueling pace of presidential foreign travel.
