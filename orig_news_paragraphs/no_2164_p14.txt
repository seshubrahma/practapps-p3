This is the first Blanche Iâ€™ve encountered who specifically evokes women of my generation, like those former popular girls you come across at high school reunions, teetering on stilettos between husbands and highballs. This Blanche is forever positioning herself as an object of masculine desire. (Watch her undulating   behind a semitransparent curtain while Stanley and his pals play poker.) Her sense of sex as a weapon, on the one hand, and a necessity, on the other, is beautifully conveyed in her defensive scenes with Mitch (the excellent Corey Johnson) her diffident suitor, and her aggressive encounter with the delivery boy (Otto Farrant) who summons the ghost of the young man to whom she was briefly and ruinously married.
