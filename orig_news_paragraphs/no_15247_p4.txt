What’s far more confusing to me is why the White House doesn’t appear to be cooperating with the committee’s investigation into Flynn. Wrote CNN’s Tom LoBianco and Manu Raju:  "White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short outlined in a letter to the House oversight committee how it would not complete the request from the panel, referring some requests to the Department of Defense, saying the office doesn’t have custody of some of the other documents or simply stating ’we are unable to accommodate’ others. " The letter says one reason is that "many, if not all, documents relating to" Flynn’s contacts with foreign nationals after January 20, 2017 "are likely to contain classified   confidential information.
