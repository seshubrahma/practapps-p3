British voters decided in a June referendum to leave the European Union, but the lengthy process of exiting the bloc has not yet legally begun. European officials "know that it will not be easy" to carry out the plans, Elzbieta Bienkowska, the European Union commissioner for the internal market and industry, said on Wednesday. Federica Mogherini, the union’s foreign policy chief, said the plans did not amount to competition with NATO. Agreeing to the spending could help European countries get over a "Trump hump" created by the  ’s demands, said Nick Witney, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
