Kurdish leaders have said that if the people of Raqqa wish to join their autonomous "democratic federal" system after the Islamic State is defeated, that would be fine with them. The U. S. military has been patrolling the   border to discourage further Turkish attacks on the Kurds. Turkish officials have suggested they might not care if American troops get in the way during their next operation against the YPG. Mattis also said that he was reviewing the Russian proposal to create "safe zones" for refugees in Syria, a proposal   by Turkey and Iran.
