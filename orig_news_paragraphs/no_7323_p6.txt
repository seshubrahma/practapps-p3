Trump, Navarro noted, has been giving detailed   speeches across the United States over the past several months while his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton has been running a   campaign focused on insults and the politics of personal destruction. Nonetheless, the media completely ignores Trump’s   campaign. So what Trump plans to do now is circumvent the media while taking his message directly to the American people. Navarro said: What happens is there will be a major speech that goes on for 40 minutes laying out in precise detail exactly what’s going to get done and then the media will take a clip from that that’s unrelated to the policy agenda and make that the news.
