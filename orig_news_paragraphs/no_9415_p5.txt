The rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, and threatened many of us  —   immigrants of all statuses, Muslims and those of diverse religious faiths, people who identify as LGBTQIA, Native people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, survivors of sexual assault  —   and our communities are hurting and scared," the group says. Although the Women’s March on Washington "is an evolving effort originally founded by white women," men and women of color are encouraged to attend. According to the National Park Service, the marchers will not have access to the Lincoln Memorial due to the fact that Trump’s Presidential Inauguration Committee already submitted its application to use the historic site. In planning to attend a march in protest of Trump’s incoming administration, Schumer has come a long way since she first vowed to leave the country if the Republican defeated her preferred candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton.
