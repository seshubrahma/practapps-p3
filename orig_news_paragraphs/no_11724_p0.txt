From the Hollywood Reporter:  Donald Trump will not be a part of the Fox News town hall hosted by Megyn Kelly on Wednesday.   The GOP presidential frontrunner had a prior commitment that could not be changed on short notice, according to a Trump campaign spokeswoman. " The campaign has a previous engagement in Virginia and then New York, which could not be rescheduled," Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks said in an email to The Hollywood Reporter.
