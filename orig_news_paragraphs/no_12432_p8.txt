Cruz sponsored his own legislation in 2013 and 2014 that called for a   phase out of the RFS. Branstad said Tuesday that Cruz is "diametrically opposed to what we really care about. " "We should not support someone who is opposing those things that are critically important to the economic   of our state," Branstad said. Cruz was questioned about his ethanol stance during his recent bus tour in Iowa and said he approves of phasing out the RFS throughout a   period.
