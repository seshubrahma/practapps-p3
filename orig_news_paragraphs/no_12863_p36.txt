6:10: On CNN, Trump’s Senior Adviser Stephen Miller says that Clinton’s decision to make this a referendum on foreign policy is the worst decision since her Libya policy. She says before   Obama was choked off by sanctions while Iraq was stabilizing. Miller says Iran is closer than ever to a nuclear weapon, Libya is in disarray, Syria is a failed state with 4 million refugees, and a more belligerent and a hostile North Korea. Miller says Clinton’s foreign policy signature is a "trail of blood and death" and says there is chaos, destruction, and death everywhere after four years of Clinton’s foreign policy.
