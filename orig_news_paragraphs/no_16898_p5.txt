The bridge is located across from Manhattan in Fort Lee, New Jersey    where the cityâ€™s Democratic mayor had declined to endorse Christie during his gubernatorial reelection campaign.   Rescuers had faced delays during medical emergencies while on the bridge, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Those caught in the bottleneck of traffic said being stuck in the congestion had    implications for those needing immediate medical or emergency attention.   Two senior government officials    former Christie Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly and Port Authority Deputy Director Bill Baroni     were indicted in May 2015.
