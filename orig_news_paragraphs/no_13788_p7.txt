1182 ( f) —  provides: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. This statute likely conveys all the authority needed for a president to enact the policy advocates, although liberal judges —  and possibly some moderate judges —   might disagree.
