The group of enforcers quickly built a name for themselves for their fighting skills and cruel tactics. Los Zetas were able to expand their ranks and operations without any resistance from Mexican authorities.   As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, Los Zetas were able to set roots in the border city of Nuevo Laredo and hold their ground despite a fierce takeover attempt by the Sinaloa Cartel in 2005.   During that time, police officers, commanders, and others lost their lives as Los Zetas and Sinaloa forces fought for control of the city.
