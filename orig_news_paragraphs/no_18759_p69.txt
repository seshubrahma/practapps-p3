Rubio’s campaign is collapsing. Kasich’s has lasted longer than anyone expected, though even if he wins his home state of Ohio next week, it’s unclear where his next victory would come. Cruz, meanwhile, has proved to be Trump’s toughest challenger, but he’s already missed out on his best chances for big wins in the Deep South —  where he’s theoretically strongest —  and is unlikely to be the favorite in the    contests that dot the primary calendar after next week. Unless something major happens in the next few weeks, their only realistic hopes would be at the convention.
