Its current members include such noted human rights exemplars as China, Cuba, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.   Since its establishment in 2003, the UN Human Rights Council has taken 80 actions against Israel  —   more than three times as many as it has taken against Syria, a regime that has deliberately murdered hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced millions more. It has only taken six actions against Iran and one against Cuba. Actions against Israel make up nearly 30% of the UN Human Rights Council’s activity.
