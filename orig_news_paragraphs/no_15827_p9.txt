A Quinnipiac poll recently found that 34% of voters approve of President Trump. Sixty eight percent said they were "very concerned" or "somewhat concerned" about his relationship with Russia, though only 31% believed he did something illegal. Quinnipiac is not an outlier. Most polls have confirmed that the public does not see President Trump as doing a good job and they are concerned about Russia.
