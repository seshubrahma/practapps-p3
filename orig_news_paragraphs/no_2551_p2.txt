Before the health law, the hospital had to absorb the cost of caring for many uninsured patients like Mr. Colston. Now, with   Donald J. Trump and the   Congress vowing to dismantle the law, Temple and other hospitals serving the poor are bracing for harsh financial consequences that could have a serious effect on the care they provide. Since the election, hospitals have been among the loudest voices against wholesale repeal of the health law. In a letter to Mr. Trump and congressional leaders this month, the two biggest hospital trade groups warned of "an unprecedented public health crisis" and said hospitals stood to lose $165 billion through 2026 if more than 20 million people lose the insurance they gained under the law.
