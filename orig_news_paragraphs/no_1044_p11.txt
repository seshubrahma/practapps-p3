Having secured Mr. Trump’s acquiescence to eliminate the requirement that insurers offer "essential health benefits," members of the Freedom Caucus pressed their advantage. While they did not specify precisely which regulations they wanted to eliminate, the section they wanted to gut requires coverage for   health conditions, allows individuals to remain on their parents’ health care plans up to age 26, bars insurers from setting different rates for men and women, prohibits annual or lifetime limits on benefits, and requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on medical care. " We’re committed to stay here until we get it done," said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Freedom Caucus.
