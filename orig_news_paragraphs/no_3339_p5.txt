Opening with a   of "God Bless America" and "This Land Is Your Land" from the roof of NRG Stadium under a cloud of pulsating red, white and   drones, Gaga literally dove into the building and straight into a collection of her greatest hits: "Poker Face," "Just Dance," "Born This Way," "Telephone" and the grand finale of "Bad Romance," all delivered   (a rare feat given the amount of dancing she was doing) and reasonably well.   It was a mesmerizing performance, filled with the kind of expert showmanship that only very confident artists can pull off. It reminded me, if only slightly, of Princeâ€™s pageantry and   2007 halftime show in Miami, in which the late artist, ever the consummate entertainer, ran through a collection of Bob Dylan and Tina Turner covers before hoisting his guitar high for a rousing rendition of "Purple Rain," in the middle of an actual downpour. Gaga did her set, and then it was over.
