This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone)   —   once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions.
