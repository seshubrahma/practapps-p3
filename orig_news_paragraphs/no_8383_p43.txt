Though only one former employee specifically mentioned the active suppression of conservatives, the Gizmodo report which sparked this controversy was based on interviews with "several" Facebook whistleblowers who painted a clear picture of how the tech giant puts its thumb on the scale to tilt its trending news section leftward, despite claims of impartiality: Facebook workers routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the social network’s influential "trending" news section, according to a former journalist who worked on the project. This individual says that workers prevented stories about the   CPAC gathering, Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, and other conservative topics from appearing in the   section, even though they were organically trending among the site’s users. Several former Facebook "news curators," as they were known internally, also told Gizmodo that they were instructed to artificially "inject" selected stories into the trending news module, even if they weren’t popular enough to warrant inclusion —  or in some cases weren’t trending at all.
