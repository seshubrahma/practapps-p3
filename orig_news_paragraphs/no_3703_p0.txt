Matchbox Twenty frontman Rob Thomas says Hollywood celebrities’ constant complaining about President Donald Trump is getting stale, whatever one’s personal opinion of the president may be. ["I’m not a fan of Donald Trump, but I am so tired of hearing celebrities talk about not being a fan of Donald Trump, that it almost seems like white noise," Thomas said in an interview with The Hill.
