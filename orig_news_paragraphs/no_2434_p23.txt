Artyom Troitsky, a Russian critic of the Kremlin who lives in   exile in Estonia, said Russian speakers in Narva, while heavily influenced by Russian propaganda, have "a much more objective view of Russia" than Russians in Tallinn "for the simple reason that they live on the border and go to Russia often, so they know what life is really like over there. " All the same, many have strong emotional ties to Russia and have absorbed a message spread by Russian television that the political establishment in Washington, including Mrs. Clinton, wants to provoke armed conflict. Before Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory, said Aleksandr Moissejenko, an ethnic Russian office manager in Narva, "it seemed we were just a step away from World War III" because of all the Russian and American warplanes flying over Syria in support of rival sides.
