For other potential candidates, the 2018 midterm cycle is more important. It’s an opportunity to curry favor with House members and senators on the ballot this cycle by campaigning and raising money for them while also elevating their own profiles and meeting local party honchos, said Mitch Stewart, a founding partner of 270 Strategies and a veteran of Obama’s campaigns.   Stewart argued cattle calls are "less important now" than they were in 2004 and 2008    in part because social media tools like Twitter allow more opportunities for potential candidates to reach wide swaths of the party’s electorate. He pointed to Booker’s Twitter account during his tenure as Newark mayor as an example.
