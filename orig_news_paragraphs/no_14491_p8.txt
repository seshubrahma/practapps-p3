The JTA, a Jewish news agency, says it has obtained a recording of one of the calls. On it, the caller says a   bomb has been placed in the JCC and that "a large number of Jews are going to be slaughtered."   Several JCC sources said the FBI has told them it is investigating the calls as hate crimes. Online, another term has circulated: "telephone terrorism."
