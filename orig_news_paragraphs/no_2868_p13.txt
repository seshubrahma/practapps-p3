General Mattis’s retirement from the Marines in 2013 means that he would need a congressional waiver to be defense secretary because American law requires a   waiting period between active duty and serving in that role. There is little doubt that General Mattis, who is well liked by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the head of the Armed Services Committee, will be able to get that waiver. Mr. McCain said he was pleased with the general’s nomination, saying in a statement that he "looked forward to moving forward with the confirmation process as soon as possible in the new Congress. "
