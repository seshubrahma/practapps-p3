The St. Jude letter said that since its establishment, the Eric Trump Foundation had raised  —   or helped raise through affiliated groups  —   $16. 3 million for the hospital, which offers free care to needy children. Tax documents filed by nonprofit foundations are often delayed by two years, so there is no public accounting of these totals yet available. The letter said that some of the money was raised via related efforts, such as an Eric Trump   team that participates in the New York City Marathon.
