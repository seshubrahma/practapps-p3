The last three Republican nominees: Romney, John McCain and George W. Bush, aren’t showing up. The only former Republican nominee to appear will be former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, who will be honored Monday night and will share Trump’s VIP box. Dole has been sharply critical of Republicans who have refused to endorse the presumptive GOP nominee.   Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was the last holdout in the GOP primary, won’t be addressing the Republican convention that’s held in his own backyard.
