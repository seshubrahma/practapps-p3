Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a 46% to 41% lead over Donald Trump among likely voters    with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson at 9% and the Green Party’s Jill Stein at 2%    a new Washington   News poll shows.   The survey found that Clinton’s lead swells to 10 points    45% to Trump’s 35%    when the sample is broadened to include all registered voters, a similar margin to a Washington   News poll the previous month. The overall results are a departure from a spate of recent public polls    including a   survey released last week that put Trump up, 45% to 43%    that show the race tightening in recent weeks.
