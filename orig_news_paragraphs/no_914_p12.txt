Absent from the witness list was Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trumpâ€™s first national security adviser, who resigned after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Though Mr. Nunes emphasized it was only an early list, he referred to Mr. Flynn as "a tangent," portraying him as more of a victim of the intelligence leaks Mr. Nunes is seeking to investigate than a target of the inquiry. " From everything that I can see, his conversations with the Russian ambassador, he was doing this country a favor, and he should be thanked for it," Mr. Nunes said.
