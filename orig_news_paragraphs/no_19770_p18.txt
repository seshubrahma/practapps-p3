If Trump decides to impose his authority on the system, he will have my support. But I strongly suspect that he will have to decide to lead the fight against the rest of the elites and their pet Congressmen, Senators, and the rest of the Deep State. If he does, I will support him. If he caves to them, makes peace with them, then he will lose my support.
