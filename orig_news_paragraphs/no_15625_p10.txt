British Prime Minister Theresa May, who spoke with Trump Tuesday after the Manchester attack, is expected to attend both gatherings. European officials say they are looking for Trump to more fully articulate what has remained a purposely ambiguous agenda, including his view of NATO. Trump has recently taken credit for shifting NATO’s focus toward terrorism, despite the group’s     long engagement in Afghanistan, and say he’s committed to bolstering the group by pressing member states to increase military spending. But when it comes to Trump and NATO, uncertainty remains.
