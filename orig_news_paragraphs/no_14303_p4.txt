Other countries party to the deal, including Iran, have said the US alone could not unravel the agreement, which involves a host of countries and has already pushed billions of dollars into Iran in exchange for it curbing its nuclear program. President Donald Trump criticized the Iran deal during the campaign, but as of the first two weeks in office, he had not yet pulled the US out of the agreement.   Signaling his intent to take a tough approach on Tehran, his administration on Thursday put Iran "on notice" for testing a ballistic missile. Then on Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the longtime US foe in response to the missile test.
