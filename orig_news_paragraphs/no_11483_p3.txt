After more than a week of refusing to do any events in the district open to press, Ryan —  on the final day before Tuesday’s primary with Nehlen —  decided at the last minute to hold two open press events in the Racine area. One, in Racine, happened at AE Tools —  a   Wisconsin manufacturing plant that employs hundreds locally —  where Ryan took questions from workers in a town hall format. The second event, in Pleasant Prairie, was at Ocenco, another manufacturing plant. But it was at the first one that Ryan defended his trade policies, even at one point comparing himself and his position on trade to the 2016 GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.
