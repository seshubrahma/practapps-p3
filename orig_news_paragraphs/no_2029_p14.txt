President Obama also interviewed a single finalist for each post in most cases, usually in a    discussion meant to confirm an already   conclusion that the candidate would be right for the job, said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior transition official in 2008. " In some cases, he knew who he wanted and it was a question of convincing them to do it," Mr. Pfeiffer said, citing examples like Hillary Clinton, who became Mr. Obamaâ€™s secretary of state, and Robert M. Gates, whom he persuaded to stay on as defense secretary. Mr. Obama was also adamant that the deliberations not spill out into the open, but that has not been the case with Mr. Trump.
