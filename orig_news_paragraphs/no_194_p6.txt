Have you forgotten, say, the odd 2009 incident in which Henry Louis Gates Jr. the Harvard scholar, who is black, was arrested after having to force his way into his own home because of a jammed door? This program hasn’t, and places it in the context of the growing schism that ultimately made Mr. Obama a divider rather than a uniter. So the documentary, though it’s not particularly rewarding to watch, does achieve its goal of painting a portrait of a country that is about as disunited as it could be, thanks to economic forces, increasingly unveiled racism and an anger that continues to be hard to pin down.
