 (CNN) Donald Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, spent part of Friday touring flood damage in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The visit drew a contrast with President Barack Obama, who was criticized for not cutting short his summer vacation in Marthaâ€™s Vineyard to visit the stricken region. The White House announced Friday afternoon that Obama will visit the area on Tuesday, after his vacation concludes.
