Another 54 delegates are awarded through votes in the stateâ€™s 18 congressional districts. In each district, voters vote for a candidate and then must vote for up to three individuals to serve as delegates, each of whom are affiliated with one of the candidates. The vote for the candidate counts towards the statewide total, but the votes for individuals running as delegates are used to tabulate the delegates for that district. It is entirely possible, for example, that Donald Trump wins the votes within a Congressional District, but three individuals tied to the Kasich campaign win the most votes for delegates.
