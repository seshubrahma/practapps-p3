Ritual public humiliation is wholly deserved in this case. So if you have some time on your hands later, why don’t you write a polite letter to Richard Davenport, President of the University of Minnesota, or to Steven Leath, President of the University of Iowa.

Anyway, I’ve done some research, and it turns out that West Virginia University might be the most triggering school in the most triggering state in all of America.
