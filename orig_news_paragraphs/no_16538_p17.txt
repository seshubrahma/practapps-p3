Political operatives and leaders of   organizations said there are plenty of more authentic and effective opportunities available for Trump to engage with minority voters. Inclán suggested Trump buy television advertising in Spanish in Nevada    a state where polls show him within striking distance of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton    to highlight his business record and focus on job creation. In the past, GOP candidates have focused their efforts on minority business or evangelical communities.    campaign stops, like stopping by Versailles    an iconic eatery in Miami    for coffee with Cuban Americans, could also benefit Trump, Inclán said.
