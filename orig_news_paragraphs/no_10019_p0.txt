Sunday on CNN’s "Reliable Sources," in responding to claims Breitbart has had only positive coverage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Breitbart News Network editor Alexander Marlow said he has no problem criticizing Trump and gave the example that Trump, "can’t talk about his penis size if he wants to be the next president of the United States.

People are constantly trying to back us into a corner when you’ve got competitors like National Review who dedicated resources trying to destroy Trump.
