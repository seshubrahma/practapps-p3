Responding officers checked Palmer’s record, finding that he had an outstanding arrest for failing to pay child support. Palmer was subsequently arrested and later released on bail. The next morning, a relative of Palmer’s called Daytona Police after they received a note apparently written in blood saying, "You will never see your grandson again alive," with the same letters "KKK" included in the message. When police went looking for Palmer, they found him at a nearby Burger King, where he confessed to fabricating the original hate hoax and his own abduction, saying the blood on the note was actually his own.
