Apollo and Metropoulos retained a combined 42 percent stake in the company, which is now publicly traded. After investing only $186 million in cash when they bought the company in 2013 (they took out debt to help finance the rest of the $410 million deal) Apollo and Metropoulos’s investment is now worth 13 times that initial cash investment. Tracing how these enormous returns wind their way into Mr. Black’s pocket is a byzantine task.
