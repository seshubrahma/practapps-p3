There is no suggestion that Paul Tudor Jones II actually financed the Weather Channel’s hit job on the Florida sugar cane industry. But given the Weather Channel’s lamentably poor research and willingness to buy the version of events of a small group of environmental activists serving Tudor Jones II’s interests, clearly it had no need to. Across the U. S. there are dozens of other liberal billionaires doing much as Tudor Jones II is doing in Florida —  bankrolling the environmental activism which has made swathes of the U. S. landscape unworkable, destroyed jobs, and killed local industry.
