WASHINGTON   â€”    By a single vote, the Senate gave final approval on Thursday to a measure to block cities and counties from organizing retirement savings accounts for workers who have no access to   plans. The vote reverses a Labor Department rule that allows local governments to automatically enroll   workers in retirement plans unless they opt out.
