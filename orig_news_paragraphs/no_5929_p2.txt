They were all singled out as exceptional security risks in the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015 and its 2016 extension. In fact, President Trumpâ€™s order does not even name the seven countries. It merely refers to the sections of U. S. Code that were changed by the Terrorist Prevention Act:   I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217( a)(12) of the INA, 8 U. S. C. 1187( a)(12) would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order.
