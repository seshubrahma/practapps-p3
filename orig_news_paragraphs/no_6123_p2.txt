But Coulter refused to bow to the "heckler’s veto"  —   or, more accurately, "rioter’s veto"  —   over when she would speak. Now, Coulter is planning to show up on campus Thursday regardless. She is expected to speak outdoors in Sproul Plaza, which is a designated free speech area on campus, and the site of the 1964 demonstrations that launched the Free Speech Movement. (No time has yet been set for the speech.)
