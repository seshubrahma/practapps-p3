Charges against those arrested included felonious assault on a police officer, failure to disperse and resisting arrest. In a joint statement released Wednesday night, Williams and Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said 18 arrests had been made over the course of the day. More than a dozen protesters and Donald Trump supporters had said that a group planned to burn a US flag, and officers and medics with fire extinguishers stood at the ready a block away on Euclid and E. 4th Street in the minutes before the incident kicked off. Cleveland police denied accusations by protesters and witnesses that they used pepper spray.
