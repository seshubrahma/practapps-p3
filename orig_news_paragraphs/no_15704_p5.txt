I realize that some of President Trump’s actions and statements have unsettled America’s friends," the Republican senator from Arizona and 2008 presidential candidate said. Though McCain has been outspoken about his belief that the Trump administration should take a more globalist approach to US foreign policy, such unvarnished criticism of a sitting US President    and fellow Republican    remains rare.   The senator delivered a similar critique of the President’s foreign policy during a speech at a security conference in Munich in February. McCain has been a vocal proponent of the   relationship, and his speech appeared to reinforce the belief that despite the whims of the Trump administration, Australia and the United States need each other if both want to maintain the current geopolitical order.
