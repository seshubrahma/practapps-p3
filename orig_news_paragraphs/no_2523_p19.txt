Mr. Geva recalled Mr. Friedman saying that he decided to buy a home in Jerusalem on the day in 2002 that a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up at Caf√© Moment, a popular bar in the city, killing 11 Israelis. Mr. Kahana, who directs a task force on disabilities for the Jewish National Fund, said Mr. Friedman and some friends raised and donated several hundred thousand dollars to help build Aleh Negev, the village for disabled people, a joint project of the fund and the Israeli government. " He visited, and I must say, he was very concerned that this village is not only for Jewish kids, that it is also for Bedouin kids," Mr. Kahana said.
