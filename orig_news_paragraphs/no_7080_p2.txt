Today, I’m directing the Department of Commerce to immediately prioritize the investigation that began yesterday and really long before that   —   because Wilbur and I have been working on this for a long time  —   into foreign steel arriving into our markets, and to submit a report on the effects of these foreign steel products on the national security of the United States. It’s not just the pricing, it’s not just employment, it also has to do with the national security of our country, which people never talk about. I talked about it.
