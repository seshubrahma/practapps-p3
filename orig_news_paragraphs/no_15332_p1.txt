The lawsuit accuses them of backing out of a verbal agreement to provide final services for Zawadski’s husband, Robert Huskey, in May 2016 after discovering he was gay. The reversal compounded the family’s grief and left them scrambling for alternatives. The only provider they could find was 90 miles away, the lawsuit alleges, leading the family to cancel Huskey’s memorial.   The funeral home denied all the claims in a response to the lawsuit.
