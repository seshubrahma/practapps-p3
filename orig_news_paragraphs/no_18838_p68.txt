I have supported the Libertarian party specifically for the policies (military   ending war on drugs, low taxes, etc.) and the fact that, if successful, it would significantly undermine the   duopoly. ’ "That said, I do not identify with the libertarian preference for a weak federal government. My ideal government would be strong enough to take on massive projects (such as the illegal immigration question) only when necessary, would prevent mass exploitation by the elites ( conservationist efforts to protect the environment, for example,) but would try not to regulate people’s personal and economic lives.
