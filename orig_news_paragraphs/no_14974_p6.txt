A White House official on Thursday said Israel’s decision to approve a new West Bank settlement did not amount to defiance of the President’s request for a pause in settlement activity, rather it was "already in the queue. " The new settlement was already on track to be approved "before the President had a chance to lay out his expectations," said the official, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of peace talks. The two sides have previously met in Washington and Jerusalem, as the Trump administration pushes forward with an   peace plan.
