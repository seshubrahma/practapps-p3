AFP  —   German Chancellor Angela Merkel led a sharp European response to US   Donald Trump Monday after he branded NATO "obsolete" and said more countries would leave the EU after Britain. [In a   interview with two European newspapers, Trump unleashed a volley of verbal attacks on Europe and criticised Merkel’s "catastrophic" decision to open Germany’s borders to Syrian refugees.   With fears growing in Europe over Trump’s commitment to the transatlantic alliance and over signs he will pivot towards Russia, Merkel warned that the continent now had to take responsibility for itself.
