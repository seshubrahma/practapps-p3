The bandâ€™s next album, Revolution Radio, is due out in October. In an interview with Rolling Stone last week, Armstrong said he was inspired in part to write the album when he witnessed and later joined a New York City protest march to commemorate the   anniversary of the death of Ferguson, Missouri teenager Michael Brown. " I got out of my car and marched with the people," Armstrong told Rolling Stone.
