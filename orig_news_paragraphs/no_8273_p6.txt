Under da Silva, the socialists established a sprawling corruption scheme that came to be known by the nickname "Operation Car Wash," in which government officials would systematically overcharge for government projects through   oil corporation Petrobras and keep the change. Revelations tying Rousseff, minister of energy during most of the scheme’s existence, and da Silva to the corruption triggered protests of millions throughout the country demanding her impeachment. In August, they got their wish: the Brazilian legislature ousted Rousseff, replacing her with her more   vice president, Michel Temer. To cement the nation’s rejection of leftists, not just the Workers’ Party, the legislature ousted Eduardo Cunha, the head of the House of Representatives and architect of impeachment.
