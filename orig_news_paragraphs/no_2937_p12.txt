Washington has been drifting toward perpetual political combat for more than two decades, at least since the Newt   Republican revolution of 1994. But this time, "People on the left are scared about Trump in a way they were not scared about Reagan or George W. Bush," said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University who has written extensively on the history of liberalism. Moreover, the uneasiness with Mr. Trump has hardly receded in the nearly six weeks since his election. Half of Americans surveyed in an   Street Journal poll last week approved of how the   was preparing for the job, a figure far lower than when it was asked of Mr. Clinton in 1992 (77 percent) and Mr. Obama in 2008 (73 percent).
