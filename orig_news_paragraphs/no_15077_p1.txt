President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike against the air base earlier this week, targeting it because the Syrian jets that carried out the bombing of a rebel stronghold with chemical weapons Tuesday originated there, US officials said. The attack injured hundreds, killing nearly 90 people, including almost 20 women and more than 30 children, according to Syrian health officials and Syrian Civil Defense volunteers.
