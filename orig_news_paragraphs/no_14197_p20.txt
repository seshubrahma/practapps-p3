Asghar Farhadi, the director of "The Salesman," which has been nominated for the Oscar for best   film, has said he will not attend this year â€™s Academy Awards in protest against the ban. Farhadi is Iranian, and so would have been kept out of the U. S. due to the ban, but could possibly have requested an exception had he wanted to.
