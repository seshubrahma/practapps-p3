UPDATE 11:49 P. M. ET, The team at Breitbart Texas has an enormous scoop, particularly photo confirmation that the Dallas shooter Micah X. Johnson was a member of the Houston New Black Panther Party for a short period of time. This completely undermines the mainstream narrative that Johnson was a lone gunman, not affiliated with any organization, and that this killing of five Dallas police officers was somehow a matter that more gun control could have prevented. Make sure to read the whole expose from Breitbart Texasâ€™ Bob Price. UPDATE 11:44 P. M. ET, More arrests tonight, this time in Baton Rouge according to RT: Arrests made in #BatonRouge protests #Atlanta protesters in standoff with police on highway https:  .
