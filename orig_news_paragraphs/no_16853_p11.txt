Another senior administration official said that the major focus of making the announcement at this time was an effort to reassure the public that government is on top of the situation, that officials know who carried out the hacking and that the US political system can withstand the attacks.   The joint announcement Friday from the two agencies said the US wasn’t yet ready to attribute blame for a series of additional hacks and attempted hacks of voter registration websites in several states. But US intelligence and law enforcement officials told CNN that there’s strong evidence Russian intelligence services are also behind the cyberattacks against state voter registration websites.   There has been debate within the intelligence community about whether to "name and shame" the Russians for the cyberattacks.
