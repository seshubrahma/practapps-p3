Washington (CNN) Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States on Friday, vowing to drain power from Washington elites and always put "America first" in its dealings with the world at a moment of transformative political change. He arrived at the White House for the first time as President just before 5 p. m. ET following a day of tradition marking the power shift in the nation’s capital.   In a   ceremony on the   West Front of the Capitol earlier in the afternoon, Trump placed his left hand on a family Bible and another that belonged to Abraham Lincoln and promised to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
