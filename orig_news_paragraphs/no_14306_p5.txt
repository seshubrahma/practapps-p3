It also imposed a literacy test, requiring newcomers older than 16 to demonstrate basic reading comprehension in any language. Moreover, the law kept out people from what it called the "Asiatic Barred Zone," which included modern day India, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Southeast Asia and the   islands. China was not included, but the Chinese were already denied immigration visas under the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act    which became more discriminatory over the years until it was repealed in 1943 after Beijing became a World War II ally. Exempt were Japan and the Philippines.
