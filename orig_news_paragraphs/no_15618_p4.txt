After being appointed by President Donald Trump to take over the Education Department earlier this year, DeVos has spoken only in general terms about how the Trump administration plans to pursue school choice. But she has indicated the federal government will leave many of the details to individual states    and the administration’s budget is expected to allow states to use some federal grant money for school choice initiatives.   " We all fundamentally know one size doesn’t fit all    and that we won’t accomplish our goals by creating a new federal bureaucracy or by bribing states with their own taxpayers’ money," DeVos said Monday.
