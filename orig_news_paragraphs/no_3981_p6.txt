Saeb Erekat,   of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and chief Palestinian negotiator, said that moving the embassy would "destroy" the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians and would cause the region to descend further into "more chaos, lawlessness and extremism. " Erekat also warned that if Trump were to go ahead with the move, the PLO will revoke its recognition of Israel and the U. S. will be forced to shut down all of its embassies in the Arab world. In an interview with CBS News on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that such a move would cause "an explosion, an absolute explosion in the region, not just in the West Bank, and perhaps even in Israel itself, but throughout the region.
