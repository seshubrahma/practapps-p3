In both word and action, @POTUS sent a strong and clear message today that the use and spread of chemical weapons will not be tolerated. Japan: "The Japanese government supports the US governmentâ€™s resolve that it will never tolerate the spread and use of chemical weapons," Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters. United Kingdom: "The UK government fully supports the US action, which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime, and is intended to deter further attacks,"  a UK government spokesperson said in a statement.
