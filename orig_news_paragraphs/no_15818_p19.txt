Lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and fellow California Democrats Adam Schiff, Ted Lieu, and Maxine Waters, are scheduled to address activists Sunday at the various marches and challenge them on how they can better respond in the current political climate. Outside the Beltway, meanwhile, legal teams and organizations that once fought for   marriage in courthouses across the country have been training their sites on a new purpose  —     religious freedom bills at the state level that would allow individuals and businesses to deny services they feel are contrary to their religious beliefs. While defenders of the bills say they protect First Amendment rights, LGBT groups say they merely legalize discrimination.   Vice President Mike Pence signed the country’s first state religious freedom bill into law in Indiana during his governorship in 2015.
