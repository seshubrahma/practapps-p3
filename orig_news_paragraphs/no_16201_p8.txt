While Cotton acknowledged "geniune and serious concerns" about Clinton’s conduct during the Benghazi attack, the junior Arkansas senator said the American people would judge the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee. " I think her extremely careless handling of classified information, to use FBI director Jim Comey’s term, disqualifies her from being president, but I think the way to handle that is to let the American people make the choice and render their verdict this November," Cotton said. Baldasaro called Clinton a disgrace for lying to the families of the four men killed in Libya and for her use of private email servers while secretary of state.
