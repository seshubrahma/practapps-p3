Ms. Vargas entered the United States from Argentina at the age of 7 under a visa waiver program, which meant that she and her family were allowed to stay for only 90 days. By staying longer, they became ineligible for an immigration hearing, L. Patricia Ice, the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance Legal Project director, said last week. But under a program started by President Barack Obama in 2012, Ms. Vargas became one of hundreds of thousands of people allowed to stay in the United States through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program gave immigrant children who had mostly grown up in the United States the opportunity to become eligible for work permits and to stay temporarily.
