Stein told Breitbart News that Bernie’s campaign "was not the most strategic way to make this movement succeed" and said "It’s a movement, not a man, and it will not be stopped. " In a small room with reporters, Stein was impressive, talking at length about how Hillary Clinton and the foreign policy establishment helped to create ISIS and other terrorist groups around the world by knocking out sovereign dictators and allying closely with the   Saudis. Considering Breitbart News’ bombshell ongoing coverage of the   administration’s secret support for the al Qaeda group that became ISIS, Stein could be a real asset for America in exposing these and other foreign policy shenanigans.
