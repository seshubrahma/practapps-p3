" I thought it was one of the most important speeches Secretary Clinton has made throughout this campaign because it drew a line that for most of this campaign has not been drawn," said Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary, arguing that Mr. Trump had "gotten away with murder" with his incendiary proposals and statements. Mrs. Clinton’s speech in San Diego drove home that "this is not just the fun and games of a primary, but a choice for the American people about who is going to sit in the Oval Office," Mr. Panetta said. Democrats across the country expressed relief on Friday that Mrs. Clinton had finally delivered a comprehensive indictment of Mr. Trump’s fitness for the presidency.
