Guy Verhofstadt MEP, the European Parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, insisted that, despite the opposition to its immigration policies, the people of Europe still support the EU and want "more Europe". " People are not against Europe, they want more Europe to face these challenges. But they are critical, that’s true, towards the way the European Union works today," he said.
