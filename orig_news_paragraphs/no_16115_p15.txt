Then there is the horrifying video of    Alton Sterling, in Baton Rouge, pinned to the ground, an officer repeatedly firing into him at the closest possible range. And the breathtaking images from Dallas    so unreal they seem like a movie, but they’re unfolding on a city street in America, all so shocking and sad that a former NYPD officer could hardly hold back tears talking about it. It’s all there: live, online, available to watch over and over, available to discuss, to stir our emotions time and time again. And then the raw emotions are steered in specific directions, tinting the events with political agendas.
