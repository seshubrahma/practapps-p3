 (CNN) President Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday began with references to the threats against Jewish community centers and last week’s violence targeting two   engineers in Olathe, Kansas, which is being investigated as a hate crime.   While important, President Trump’s statement provides little consolation to communities facing backlash and criminalization in America today. A few words of condemnation cannot erase months of President Trump’s own divisive rhetoric and his administration’s   policies targeting and stigmatizing the very communities most vulnerable to hate violence.
