Trump thanked Governor Scott Walker for joining him at the event together with Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson. Walker presented Trump with a personalized NBA Wisconsin Bucks jersey and a parody of his campaign hat. Since the @Bucks are in the #NBAPlayoffs tonight, we made a special hat to give to the @POTUS. #MAGA pic.
