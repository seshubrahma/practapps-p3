Reuters tracking has also shown a drop in Trump’s lead. Although it is probably too soon to show up in polling, it is possible that some of the drop in Cruz’s support is fallout from controversy over the delegate voting process in Colorado. The Fox poll was conducted as that controversy was intensifying in the media, but there is generally a lag time before big events show up in polling. It is also possible that the Fox poll is simply an outlier, since it is based on a large move between Cruz and Kasich, rather than a surge of support for Trump.
