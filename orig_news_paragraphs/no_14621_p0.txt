 (CNN) Donald J. Trump hates a lot of things, from "fake news" to intelligence leaks to even Nordstrom.     But my money says the thing Trump hates the most is being laughed at.   And one of the worst comedic beat downs Trump ever took on national TV was in 2011, the last time Trump attended the White House Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner (WHCD) where he was comically crushed by comedian Seth Meyers (not to mention President Obama, who also got in a few good jabs).
