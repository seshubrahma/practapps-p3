I don’t pretend to know if God would vote for Donald Trump, or for that matter what state He is registered to vote in. But I do know that the God of Abraham who shed his grace on America had a purpose and a vision. He would not turn his back on a country and a people that has achieved so much under his blessings. Donald Trump wants to make America great again, and so far as I know, if he did he would be doing God’s work.
