As someone who suffered through every moment of Romney’s feckless presidential campaign, the first thing I thought to myself was "Where the hell was this killer when we needed him most? "  Listen, I have no issue with Romney dropping a dirty bomb, especially on a Donald Trump who is the master of launching these kinds of insinuations. Politics, especially at the presidential level, is not about Marquis of Queensbury. It’s about proving your skill as a campaigner, your ability to keep the other guy on defense.
