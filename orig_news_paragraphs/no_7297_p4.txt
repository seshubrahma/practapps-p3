Martin rejected the   reaction to describe the murder as mere "tragedy. " "I’ve been in this business for over 40 years, and every time I hear the term ‘senseless tragedy’ or ‘terrible accident,’ I cringe. When our federal and state laws are not enforced, all we really have is predicable consequences," he testified. In August, Martin fiercely denounced the refusal to enforce immigration law on the state and federal level.
