The company also said all emerging small car models will be made south of the border. The move to shift all production to Mexico should not come as a major surprise, as in April, Ford had already launched a $1. 6 billion building plan for enlarging facilities in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The brand new Mexico facilities were announced just as President Barack Obamaâ€™s deputy signed the unpopular Trans Pacific Partnership   deal earlier this year. In February, Ford Motor Company announced it was set to double production capacity at a previously built Mexico factory, instead of enlarging U. S. factories.
