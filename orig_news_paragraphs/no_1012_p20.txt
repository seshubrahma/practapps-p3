a room of people on laptops, half consuming caffeine, half enjoying one of   varieties of craft beer. Even the most casual of burger joints, like Crazee Burger, have a healthy selection of craft beer on tap. One does not live by drink alone, however, and so I headed to Pacific Beach on a different day to walk along the ocean and take in the sea air. After enjoying a brisk walk and inhaling an unreasonably large breakfast burrito stuffed with egg, bacon, cheese, potato and hot sauce from Konoâ€™s Cafe, I struck up a conversation with Dennis Miller, who has lived in Pacific Beach for over 50 years.
