That same weekend in Philadelphia, Republican members of Congress were caught on tape fretting aloud about what the "something far better" to replace the law should be. Should they allow states to accept expanded Medicaid benefits, as Obamacare had done? Should they enter what Representative John Faso, a New York Republican, called the "political minefield" of defunding Planned Parenthood as part of the package? For that matter, should they really be rushing to repeal the A. C. A. before they had any idea of what would replace it?
