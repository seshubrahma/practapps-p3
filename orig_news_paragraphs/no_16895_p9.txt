If a man    with or without a Tic Tac in his mouth    swoops in for an unwanted kiss or grope, context may be everything. On a date or in the workplace, as a minor or an adult, the where, what and who all matter in terms of how an incident is handled.   The US Department of Health and Human Services defines sexual assault as "any type of forced or coerced sexual contact or behavior that happens without consent," and it’s very common. About one in five women in the United States has been raped, and almost half have experienced another type of sexual assault, according to the Office on Women’s Health.
