If an executive seemed energetic, aggressive, ambitious, and ruthless in the Trump mold, he or she got the job.   The President’s past hiring practices help to explain why he has surrounded himself with so many people with no previous experience in government but an abundance of loyalty and nerve. When he built skyscrapers, he didn’t require that his executives know how the buildings were constructed, but he wanted them to be so loyal that if he ordered them to climb to the roof and jump off, they just might do it.    We now have a government filled with Trump hires whose flaws seem consistent with the President’s own.
