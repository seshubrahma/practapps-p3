This is a particular problem when the incidence of rape in the military is so severe. I received a letter from a known but confidential source in the naval service who asked me to inform the command structure in Washington about the damaging effects of these policies: As part of the policy, CO’s must facilitate the requests of individuals for transgender treatment (surgery,   therapy, etc.)   …    .   [O]nce the service member is considered "stable" in their preferred gender, and their "gender marker" is changed in a DoD database, they must be accommodated in the berthing and bathroom facilities of their preferred gender regardless of whether they still possess their opposite sex anatomy!
