Even within universities, there have always been optimistic champions of America, those who   believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work   on formulating concrete, actionable policies that would make the country more just.

Kennedy was visiting poor white families in Appalachia Lyndon B. Johnson was building the Great Society.
