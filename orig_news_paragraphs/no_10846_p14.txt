In a May 13th address to the Council on Foreign Relations, Rubio described TPP as the "second pillar" of his   foreign policy and declared, "It is more important than ever that Congress give the president [Barack Obama] trade promotion authority so that he can finalize the   Partnership. " However, by a nearly    margin, Republican voters believe that   free trade deals reduce wages rather than raise them. And now, according to a report from the Tampa Bay Times, Rubio told reporters on Jan. 7 that he will not reveal his position on the very trade deal he endorsed and voted to   until May 18th â€”  two months after Super Tuesday.
