President Donald Trump has been handing out his   cellphone number to world leaders and urging them to call him   directly, an unusual invitation that breaks diplomatic protocol   and is raising concerns about the security and secrecy of the   U. S. commander in chief’s communications. " ’   Trump has urged leaders of Canada and Mexico to reach him on his   cellphone, according to former and current U. S. officials with   direct knowledge of the practice. Of the two, only Canadian Prime   Minister Justin Trudeau has taken advantage of the offer so far,   the officials said.
