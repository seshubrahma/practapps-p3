" It wouldn’t bother me, it wouldn’t bother me," Trump said when asked whether he would allow a Scottish Muslim into the U. S. under his policy. His campaign spokeswoman, Hicks, then told CNN that Trump does not support banning all foreign Muslims from entering the U. S. but instead would ban Muslims from "terror states"    though he did not specify which states he believed supported terror. Trump’s national finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin, who accompanied Trump on his Scotland trip, also suggested Trump’s policy had changed.
