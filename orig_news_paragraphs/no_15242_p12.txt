Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House oversight committee, said on CNN’s "Erin Burnett OutFront" that there is "no question" Flynn had committed a crime. Additionally, Connolly said he considers Kushner’s failure to detail his foreign contacts as in the same category as Flynn’s potential crime. " We’ve got an outbreak here of violations of the law and nondisclosure," Connolly said.
