Support for John Kasich, meanwhile, has surged 8 points, rising from 17 to 25 percent support. Trump leads within every demographic group, while Cruz and Kasich are tied in all except evangelicals and "very conservative" voters. Trump’s lead in this Fox poll is the largest he’s recorded in the poll since the middle of December, when he led a much more crowded field by 21 points. Interestingly, he had gained just 6 points of support since then, rising from 39 to 45 percent support.
