 (CNN) A new poll finds that many Americans are not optimistic about what the GOP health care bill will do to their coverage.   Although President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress promise that their plan will cover more people and cost less, nearly half of Americans donâ€™t believe it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Wednesday.   And while many Republicans are confident that defunding Planned Parenthood is the right move, the greater majority oppose that idea, it says.
