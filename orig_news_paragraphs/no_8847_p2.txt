The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls earlier this week conceded that a Le Pen win next year is "possible" with her bid boosted by the shock election of   Donald Trump in the US Presidential elections. Mr Valls said: "If she does make it to the second round she will face either a candidate of the left or the right. This means that the balance of politics will change completely. "
