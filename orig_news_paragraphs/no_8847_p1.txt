At the last Presidential elections in 2012, a year after taking the reins of her party, Ms Le Pen came third in the first round of the with 17. 9 per cent of the vote, behind Mr Sarkozy on 27. 2 percent and eventual winner Mr Hollande with 28. 6 percent. Since then, however, the party has gone from strength to strength with a string of electoral successes, making her a serious contender for the 2017 Presidential race. The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls earlier this week conceded that a Le Pen win next year is "possible" with her bid boosted by the shock election of   Donald Trump in the US Presidential elections.
