Once I got into the parking garage, I was stuck in there with all the other drivers for over an hour as the protesters were successful in blocking us in! We were "hostages" of those idiots. I took video from the 3rd floor at my car looking down at the protesters. A police man told me to get away from the edge since they had people throwing bottles at the cars already.
