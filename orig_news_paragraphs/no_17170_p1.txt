Trump caused diplomatic ripples Tuesday when he tweeted that Farage would "do a great job" as Britain’s ambassador to the United States. And Farage, who’s interim leader of the   UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the figurehead of the Brexit movement, was the first UK politician to meet with Trump   when he spent time with him at Trump Tower 11 days ago.   By contrast, Trump called 11 other world leaders before placing a call to Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May following his election win, suggesting that the two countries’ much vaunted "special relationship" might be a little rocky.
