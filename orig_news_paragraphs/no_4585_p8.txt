As Breitbart Texas reported, only 30 percent of Americans say companies bringing in foreign workers to fill jobs is necessary. Additionally, some 44 percent said those foreign workers take jobs away. The vast majority of Americans also said the number of   visas allotted every year to companies should either be decreased or kept at the current levels. The use of the   visa was panned by President Donald Trump on the campaign trail last year, often holding rallies with fired Disney and tech industry employees who were forced to train their replacements.
