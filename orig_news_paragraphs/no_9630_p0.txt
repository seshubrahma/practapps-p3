Residents of West Hollywood, California woke Thursday morning to find their city plastered with   Gadsden flags affixed with the   message "#ShootBack" in the wake of the Orlando terrorist massacre earlier this week. [WeHo residents took to Twitter to post photos of the signs, which feature the signature Gadsden snake with the phrase "Donâ€™t Tread on Me," above the hashtag #ShootBack.   The signs were reportedly placed all over West Hollywood, including in front of City Hall, at the Pacific Design Center, and in front of popular gay lounge The Abbey.
