â€”    can you imagine if the attacks in Turkey had happened in the United States?" On Friday, Hilal Kaplan, a columnist for Daily Sabah, a newspaper close to the government, lashed out at Western news coverage, including an article in The New York Times, that has emphasized conspiracy theories coursing through Turkish society that the United States is behind terrorism in Turkey. Describing the article as "an attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand Turkey," Ms. Kaplan said that Turks have good reason to be suspicious of the United States.
