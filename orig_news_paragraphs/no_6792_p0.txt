A Harvard study has documented the mainstream media’s blatant   bias and found that while the President dominated news coverage in his first 100 days, that coverage was almost entirely negative  —   with 93 percent of CNN and NBC’s Trump coverage critical of the new president. [The study, by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center, released Thursday concludes that Trump’s coverage "set a new standard for negativity. "  Looking at the coverage of President Trump’s first 100 days from 10 major American and European outlets, the study found that Trump was the topic of 41 percent of all news stories   —   three times that of previous presidents. It also found that Trump was the featured speaker of 65 percent of the coverage.
