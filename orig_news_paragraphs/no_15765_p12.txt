The morning after the attacks, British Prime Minister Theresa May insisted "enough is enough," and that we needed to reevaluate our   strategy and work harder to stamp out Islamist extremism, which she claimed has received too much tolerance in our country. As someone who has been engaged in critiquing Islamist extremism for more than a decade, serving as the deputy convenor of the government task force on tackling radicalization and extremism in the aftermath of the 2005   bombings, I’m sympathetic. But I’m also cautious. We do need to reevaluate our strategy.
