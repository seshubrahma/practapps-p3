Cam Newton reminded me of Ben Roethlisberger when he was playing at Auburn. He has to shred Denver’s defensive like Big Ben did at Pittsburgh, but it will be difficult because he doesn’t have the talented receivers Roehtlisberger has around him. Panthers offensive coordinator Mike Shula, the former Alabama quarterback, needs to take a page out of Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin’s playbook and find creative ways to utilize tight end Olsen in the second half like Kiffin did with O. J. Howard against Clemson in the college football title game.
