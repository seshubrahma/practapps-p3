The statement continued: "In that spirit, I called Australia’’s   ambassador to the United States this morning to express my   unwavering support for the   alliance. I asked   Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their   American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor   the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving   by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better   world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect   and promote. " ’ ’’ ’    McCain also noted the long history Australia had of aligning with   the US in conflicts including two world wars and conflicts in   Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
