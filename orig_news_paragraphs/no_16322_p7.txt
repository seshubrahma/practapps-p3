Trump and Pence, the sources said, had discussions early on in their relationship about how they would disagree on certain issues    and that such disagreements would be fine. The campaign believes the American people will find it refreshing to have two candidates who say what they really feel, rather than going over every statement with a   comb and making sure the candidates agree.

So Trump aides are comfortable with Pence putting out statements that create distance from Trump.
