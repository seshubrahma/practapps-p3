This year, the park streamlined the   process and introduced a   system that sends skaters text messages when it is their turn. The New York Botanical Garden accommodated the growing numbers at its train show by increasing the exhibit space by half, to 12, 800 square feet, last year. It has also added more   night hours where alcohol is served, with 11 "bar car nights" this year, up from three in 2011. And it has timed tickets so visitors do not have to wait in line.
