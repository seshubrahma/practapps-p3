While Trump and his advisers have argued that Clinton did not learn from the mistakes of the Iraq War    for which she voted as a senator    and drove the US into another blunder by arguing in favor of military intervention in Libya, Trump supported both of those military interventions. Despite his words to the contrary on the campaign trail, Trump said he favored invading Iraq one month before Congress voted to authorize the use of military force and continued to praise the invasion in its first months. He also called on the US to intervene militarily in Libya to stem the worsening humanitarian situation in the country. The Trump campaign, in a statement Wednesday night, denied any flip flops in the Republican nomineeâ€™s position.
