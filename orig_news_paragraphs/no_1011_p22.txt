The corals may save themselves, as many other creatures are attempting to do, by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms, establishing new reefs in cooler water.

And even if the corals do survive, that does not mean individual reefs will continue to thrive where they do now. Coral reefs are sensitive systems, built by unusual animals.
