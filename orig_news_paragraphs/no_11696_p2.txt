On Saturday afternoon, Cruz spoke at a rally held at Provo High School in Provo, Utah, less than an hour south of the state capital, Salt Lake City. The Texas senator addressed a packed crowd, along with Utah Senator Mike Lee, Carly Fiorina, and Glenn Beck. Drawing a contrast with Donald Trump, Cruz pledged that there are fundamental rights on which he would never compromise, specifically including that he would never negotiate on religious liberty and the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Cox announced his endorsement in a statement.
