Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,   who opposed the Democrats’ nuclear option, nevertheless has kept the option open for the Supreme Court. If Democrats were to successfully filibuster a Trump justice, the pressure from the right on McConnell could grow immensely.    "President Trump has a list of about 20 Americans who he is considering nominating to the Supreme Court. These men and women have different professional backgrounds, different life experiences," McConnell said on the floor, pleading with Democrats to confirm Trump’s choice.
