Washington (CNN) Another woman stepped forward Saturday to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault, saying he kissed her without her consent at his estate in Florida. Cathy Heller joins a rapidly growing list of women who are accusing the GOP nominee of sexual assault in the week since a 2005 tape surfaced in which Trump bragged about being able to grope women and get away with it. Heller, now 63, said she met Trump at    nearly 20 years ago while she and her family were having brunch, she told The Guardian newspaper.
