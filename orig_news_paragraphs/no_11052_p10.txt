" The Competitive Enterprise Institute, Ebell’s employer, "has done everything it can politically and through litigation to block any forward movement on climate and to try to harass anybody who is trying to get forward movement," Goldston says. Ebell is also the chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, more than two dozen nonprofit groups "that question global warming alarmism and oppose energy rationing policies," according to the coalition’s website. Those positions line up nicely with Trump’s goals, which include "saving" the coal industry, reviving the Keystone XL oil pipeline and expanding offshore oil drilling.
