Annika Soder, deputy foreign minister of Sweden, which represents US diplomatic interests in North Korea, said, "it’s important for this council to reflect on how tensions can be reduced."  Ethiopian Foreign Minister Workneh Gebeyehu urged deliberation "to ensure that matters do not get out of hand by accident" and warned against "a slide into war from which no one would benefit."   There was also international condemnation of North Korea’s missile test. Uruguay UN Ambassador Elbio Rosselli, who sits on the Security Council, called it "very disgraceful," adding that it was "against international law and humanity. "
