Hong Kong runs its own finances, education, immigration policy and judiciary, and people in the city enjoy basic rights like freedom of expression and freedom of the press    rights that people in communist mainland China do not have. Before the U. K. handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, it worked out a deal that allowed Hong Kongers many of the rights they enjoyed as British subjects for 50 years after the hand over.    The term "one country, two systems" is the crux of Hong Kong’s de facto constitution, known as The Basic Law.   It’s supposed to guarantee the city a high degree of autonomy from China.
