Republican nominee Donald Trump is projected to win Iowa’s 6 electoral votes, beating his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by a large enough margin that several networks have called the race with less than two thirds of ballots counted.   Iowa was considered a key battleground state headed into Tuesday’s election. Located in the influential Midwestern region and known for holding the first primary in the nation, Iowa was long considered a Republican stronghold until the state went blue in both 2008 and 2012 for President Barack Obama. Chuck Grassley has also won reelection for a seventh term, saving his Senate seat from Democratic challenger and former lieutenant governor Patty Judge.
