The report, which was published by the Presidentâ€™s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, says that a "concerted push by China to reshape the market in its favor, using industrial policies backed by over one hundred billion dollars in   funds, threatens the competitiveness of U. S. industry and the national and global benefits it brings. " "We strongly recommend a coordinated Federal effort to influence and respond to Chinese industrial policy, strengthen the U. S. business environment for semiconductor investment, and lead partnerships with industry and academia to advance the boundaries of semiconductor innovation," it continues. The report adds that U. S. authorities must "push back against   Chinese industrial policy" by reducing the number of acquisitions from Chinese companies, which they also argue could represent a threat to national security.
