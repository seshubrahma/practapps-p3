Not that I have anything against 1950s housewives —   but gays shouldn’t imitate them. Like the dull parents of the 1960s, older married gays are now trying to tell younger fags that fun is overrated, that we should be good little leftists and that we should conform. No thanks. With mainstream acceptance has come cultural castration.
