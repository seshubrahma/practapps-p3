Defense Secretary James Mattis on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to NATO while meeting with member nations for the first time in Brussels: Pay more, or the U. S. will "moderate its commitment" to the organization. ["I owe it to you all to give you clarity on the political reality in the United States, and to state the fair demand from my country ’s people in concrete terms," he said during a   meeting, according to remarks provided to reporters traveling with him.
