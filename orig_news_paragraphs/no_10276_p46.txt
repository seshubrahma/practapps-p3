There are currently 8 justices, and they often deadlock   on cases, which means the lower court ruling stands and no precedent is set. The 4 liberals on the court are predictably almost always in lockstep. The conservatives, being more independent, donâ€™t all vote together. Justice Kennedy, like Hillary Clinton, swings both ways, and has voted with the liberals a number of times.
