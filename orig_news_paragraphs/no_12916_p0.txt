United States presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has lashed out at UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage during a speech at a rally today. Mr. Farage has told Breitbart London her comments are "extraordinary" and suggested she spend more time speaking to working people in her country than attacking him. [Mrs. Clinton has ranted about the outgoing UKIP leader who appeared at a rally for her political rival for the presidency Donald Trump. Clinton slammed Trump for having Farage appear on stage to talk about the Brexit vote and even went as far as to suggest the former UKIP leader of being in bed with Russian president Vladimir Putin because he had appeared on Russian television broadcasts.
