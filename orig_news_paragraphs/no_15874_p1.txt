" Being a refugee is like having a new lump in your body that you had nothing to do with, and it will stay until the last day, so you better deal with it," Al Omari told CNN. In the series, President Trump is portrayed as a refugee holding a young child his belongings and a sleeping mat on his back, a photo of his family clutched in his right hand. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Al Assad also feature.
