When you look around your state and you see the   factories, the empty buildings and the long unemployment lines, remember Hillary Clinton did much of this to you," Mr. Trump said, invoking the names of the Big Three automakers and bringing Bob Knight, the storied former Indiana University basketball coach and Big 10 icon, onstage to introduce him. Mr. Trump’s   gambit was reminiscent of Mitt Romney’s late effort four years ago to make forays into a handful of   battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania and Minnesota, and crack the political firewall assembled by Mr. Obama’s campaign. Mr. Romney did not succeed. Russ Schriefer, an adviser to Mr. Romney’s campaign, said Mr. Trump was engaging in the "wishful thinking" of a candidate cornered on the electoral map.
