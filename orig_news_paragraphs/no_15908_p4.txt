Ryan, Cohenâ€™s   attorney, is the head of government strategies at McDermott, Will and Emery. Cohen is just the latest Trump adviser to hire an attorney in connection with the widening probe into Russian election meddling and allegations of collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia. Vice President Mike Pence has also retained a lawyer to respond to inquiries related to the investigations, which include an inquiry led by special counsel Robert Mueller and investigations by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo has also hired Dennis Vacco, a former New York attorney general and US attorney, to represent him in the matters, a source familiar with the situation said.
