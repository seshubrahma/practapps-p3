Trump’s entire presidential campaign revolved around several alleged massive conspiracies: "Crooked Hillary," as he called his opponent, had used secret private emails to discuss classified information and hidden her actions from the public. The entire media was "rigged," he said, trying to throw the election to the Democrats even as he enjoyed endless airtime and coverage for his every statement. During the final days of the campaign he turned Bernie Sanders’s populist critique    the way that financial and economic policies hurt the poor    into an    campaign ad that showed the faces of some prominent Jewish officials along with a speech about the global economic elite. Trump continues to use the media as a foil, now blaming them for pouring out "fake news" that covers up every one of his alleged accomplishments    from the crowd size at his inauguration, to the "real" outcome of the election, to his policy "success" in the First Hundred Days.
