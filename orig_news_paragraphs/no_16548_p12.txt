I would encourage Mr. Moore to not discourage   and instead, help us get the millions of Republicans disaffected by Trump to the polls.   I don’t agree with all of Clinton’s policy positions, but I am confident she will be a better president than Trump. In my admittedly limited experience    I worked for Republicans in my 20s and not as an operative but as a nerd, writing memos     he simply does not have the temperament for a serious job, and she does.
