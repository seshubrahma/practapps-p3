Hillary Clinton, despite deploying a raft of   surrogates including the Obamas, LeBron James, Beyonce, and her husband, failed to convince large enough numbers of black voters that she offered the same kind of transformational politics that had catapulted Barack Obama twice into the presidency.   The institutional racism that diminished voter protections for poor black and brown citizens along with black voter ambivalence, especially by millennials to Clinton’s candidacy, created a perfect storm of electoral failure.   But we should note that without the participation of voters of color, Clinton’s loss would have been a landslide. Blaming blacks for Clinton’s defeat is not only wrong, but it also feeds the same appetite for racial animus and division that have led us to this dispiriting moment.
