And that’s saying a lot. But Trump isn’t in this election to win he’s in this election to spout off his own fringe views    cheered on by a tiny but equally loud right wing of the Republican base.

We are an increasingly pluralistic and global nation, and hopefully increasingly inclusive nation as well.
