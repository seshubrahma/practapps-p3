Washington (CNN) Betsy DeVos,    Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Education Department, is seeking to dismiss questions about donations to Focus on the Family from a foundation tied to her.   She said at her confirmation hearing Tuesday that a "clerical error" led to her being listed as an officer of her mother’s    foundation, which made the donations. That error, however, dates back as early as 1999, when the Edgar  Elsa Prince Foundation filed its 1998 federal tax returns, according to IRS documents obtained by CNN.
