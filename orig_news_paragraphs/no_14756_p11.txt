Former Obama administration Immigrations and Customs Enforcement chief and DHS counsel John Sandweg, now in private practice, says that changes in the flow of legal and illegal immigration depend on a range of factors, including seasonal and   trends, economic situations around the world and the availability of money to pay smugglers.     "It may be premature to point to the rhetoric as the cause of the numbers dropping," Sandweg told CNN. However, "it’s true that deterrence is a piece of the puzzle, and if there’s a perception that people will be returned, there may be a decrease in flow. "
