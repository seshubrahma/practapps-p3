The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan,  told his cityâ€™s residents following these "barbaric" and "cowardly" attacks, that there was "no reason to be alarmed" about the heightened police presence in the city. He has reminded them that London is one of the safest cities in the world and they need to protect their democratic institutions and values rather than letting the terrorists destroy those. The Mayor said: "We are all shocked and angry today    but this is our city. We will never let these cowards win and we will never be cowed by terrorism.
