The numbers fluctuate on a monthly basis, but the GOP advantage was about 177, 000 in November 2004, when George W. Bush carried the state. Republicans continued to lead Democrats on the voter rolls even as Barack Obama won Colorado in 2008 and again in 2012. Clinton leads by 11 points over Trump in a   race, according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday.   Shifts in registration don’t necessarily indicate which party is attracting new voters    that’s because people switch parties, move to new states, and are scrubbed from the rolls when they die.
