Mr. McCrory’s campaign announced on Wednesday that it was establishing a   fund in preparation for an "ongoing legal battle" over the vote tally. " No one knows for sure the outcome of the election, and tens of thousands of ballots remain outstanding and not yet counted," Jason Torchinsky, the fund’s chief lawyer, said in a statement. Chris LaCivita, the McCrory campaign’s strategist, said in a separate statement that the campaign also had "grave concerns over potential irregularities" regarding 90, 000 votes in Durham County.
