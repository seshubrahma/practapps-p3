Chicago is currently at 742 homicides in 2016, it will probably go up by the time people watch this speech on Youtube.   Thatâ€™s close to doubling the 2015 numbers. About 78% of the victims are black, and the vast majority of those people were killed by guns shot by other black people. But Chicago has some of, if not the tightest gun laws in the country!
