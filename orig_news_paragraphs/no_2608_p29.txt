Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado, a Republican who served in combat as a Marine and now represents a crucial swing district in the Denver suburbs, said Mr. Trump had disrespected American troops. " Having served in Iraq, Iâ€™m deeply offended when Donald Trump fails to honor the sacrifices of all of our brave soldiers who were lost in that war," Mr. Coffman said. The pressure on Mr. Trump and other Republicans is unlikely to relent soon.
