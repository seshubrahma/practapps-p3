Enough is enough with this PC nonsense. The Obama administration right now is litigating against a junior high, trying to force the junior high to let a teenage boy shower with teenage girls. That’s not a reasonable public policy position. That is foolishness and it’s dangerous, and those are the policies that Donald Trump supports and those are the policies that the liberal Democrats that Donald Trump has funded support as well.
