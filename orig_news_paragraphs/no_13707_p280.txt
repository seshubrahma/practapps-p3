This fiery endorsement blew me away because it demonstrated how Trump was directly engaging with a diverse coalition in ways that the mainstream media had completely missed.   I felt, and still do, that Trump is far too impetuous and   in his amusingly rambling, improvisational style.   The American president, who can spook markets or spark a war with a rash phrase, must be more coolly circumspect.   And aspirants to the presidency shouldnâ€™t care what small fry like   TV hosts say or do.
