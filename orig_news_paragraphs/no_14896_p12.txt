Len Stevens, the Liberty University spokesman, told CNN in February that Falwell would lead an education task force put together by Trump, where the evangelical leader would push to stop regulations coming out of the Education Department, especially those that apply to colleges and universities. Liberty University regularly hosts political speakers. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spoke ahead of the 2016 campaign. Sen. John McCain spoke in 2006 and Ronald Reagan addressed the school in 1980.
