Massachusetts senate candidate Elizabeth Warren has thus far refused to acknowledge that her claims of being Cherokee have been proven false. She continues to perpetuate myth and stereotype regarding indigenous Peoples. Elizabeth Warren and others like her must understand OUR history belongs to us and no one has the right to try to rewrite it or make up fictitious stories so they can fit in it or take advantage of it. Only those who meet the requirements under Cherokee law should claim to be Cherokee.
