In July, the most conservative federal appeals court in the country  —   the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans   —   found that the law had a discriminatory effect on minority voters and set in motion a loosening of the ID rules for the November elections. The judge in Corpus Christi  —   Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, who oversaw a trial on the voter ID case in 2014   —   is weighing the evidence on whether Texas enacted the law with a racially discriminatory intent.
