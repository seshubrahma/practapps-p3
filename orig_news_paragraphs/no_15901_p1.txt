Again and again during the Senate intelligence committee hearings into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, Harris, who is of black and Indian descent, has been reprimanded by her   male colleagues for simply doing her job: asking direct questions and expecting direct answers in return.   By her colleagues and by pundits, sheâ€™s been called too tough, too rude, even hysterical by one former Trump campaign adviser.   The only senator to be cut off for asking tough questions in these hearings has been Harris, once last week while questioning Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and then again Tuesday when Attorney General Jeff Sessions was testifying. This reaction to Harris is a double standard.
