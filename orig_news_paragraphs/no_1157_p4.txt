At least 114 political prisoners are behind bars in Venezuela, according to Penal Forum, a human rights organization that tracks political arrests in the country, a number that rose from 89 a year ago. The group says that since Mr. Maduro took power in 2013, the government has arrested 6, 893 people and jailed 433 for political reasons. " The level of repression has risen to a brutal level," said Alfredo Romero, who heads the group.
