And something the president repeatedly promised to do while campaigning    build a physical border wall between the U. S. and Mexico.   President Trump says this will help the U. S. get back control of its borders and that the wall would help Mexico as well by discouraging illegal immigration from countries south of Mexico.    Mr. Trump plans to use U. S. government funds to pay for the construction and then get Mexico to pay America back.   That’s something Mexican leaders have said they won’t do and critics say the wall would be a monumental waste of U. S. taxpayer money.
