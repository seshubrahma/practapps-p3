Any legislation is likely to include elements on which Republicans generally agree: tax credits for health insurance new incentives for health savings accounts subsidies for state   pools, to help people who could not otherwise obtain insurance authority for sales of insurance across state lines and some protection for people with   conditions who have maintained continuous coverage. Republicans said they hoped that the certainty of repeal would increase pressure on Democrats to sign on to some of these ideas. Democratic leaders, for now, feel no such pressure. Republicans "are going to have an awfully hard time" if they try to repeal the health law without proposing a replacement, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next Democratic leader.
