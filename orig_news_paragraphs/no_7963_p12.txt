Cruz should have gone hard after Trump for his campaign manager’s assault on Breitbart News’s Michelle Fields. On Tuesday night, Corey Lewandowski reportedly grabbed Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields "tightly by the arm and yank[ing] me down," according to Fields. Not only did Jake Tapper neglect to ask Trump a single question about the incident, instead swerving to a broader question about violent campaign rhetoric, Cruz didn’t bring it up either.
