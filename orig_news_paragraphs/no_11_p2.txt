He added that the commander, who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart, had immediately described the death as "the worst thing that happened" under his watch in the Iraq war. " I was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it, considering many of the other deaths, including American deaths," Colonel Dengler said. Colleagues say the generalâ€™s handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment, which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief.
