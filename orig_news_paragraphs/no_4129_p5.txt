The Mexican government will place attorneys in these facilities to provide assistance to those facing deportation, the AP reported. The consulates are also working with private law firms to provide assistance. During a meeting at the New York Consulate, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray called the effort a "moral imperative. " "It is something that we will continue to do by obligation and conviction," the foreign minister told the AP.
