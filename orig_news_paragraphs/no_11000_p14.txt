As for GOP "unity," while Ryan did end up securing support from many House Freedom Caucus members —  more than a majority of them —  he actually never earned an official endorsement from the group for his Speakership bid. To have gotten that, Ryan would have needed 80 percent of the group to support him in a House Speakership race. Ryan failed to achieve that. Interestingly enough, Ryan pledged to the American people —  and to House Republicans —  that he wouldn’t run for the House Speakership without an endorsement from the House Freedom Caucus, so his decision to run for the Speakership in the beginning was, like so many other things he’s done, built on an abject lie.
