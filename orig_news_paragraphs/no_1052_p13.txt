" Critics of President Trump have accused him of playing down hatred and violence against minority groups and charged that his   remarks are fueling conflict. He did not publicly condemn the   threats and vandalism until Feb. 21, weeks after Jewish groups began calling on him to speak out. On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Mr. Trump suggested that some of the threats and vandalism could be a politically motivated effort to "make people look bad," rather than actual expressions of bias, according to people who took part in the meeting.
