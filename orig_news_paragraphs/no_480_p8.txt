Employers in many sectors have complained about the difficulty of finding and keeping suitable workers, which has driven up pay in several sectors. " Weâ€™re still continuing to see wage pressure as the candidate market continues to shrink," said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing USA, which has 300 branch offices. In addition to the omnipresent hunger for engineers and other   workers, demand is strong for people with   trade skills like welding that fell into disuse during the recession, and for   warehouse and light assembly workers, Ms. Glaser said.
