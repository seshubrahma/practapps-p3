The ban comes six days after the North Korean test of a ballistic missile that the Security Council condemned as a violation of its resolutions that prohibited the country from developing and testing ballistic missile technology. In the test, North Korea claimed that it had successfully launched a new type of   missile. It said its     missile used a   technology that American experts say will make it harder to detect missile attacks from the North. In the resolution it adopted in November in response to the Northâ€™s fifth and most powerful nuclear test, the Security Council said that North Korea should not be allowed to export more than 7. 5 million metric tons of coal a year or bring in more than $400 million in coal sales, whichever limit is met first.
