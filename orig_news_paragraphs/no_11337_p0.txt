Citing a study that shows Middle American whites are dying in increasing numbers, like a twisted and bitter eugenicist,   Fareed Zakaria doesnâ€™t even attempt to contain his glee. By painting those who are supposedly dying as useless,   ragers, he paints a picture of a weak, angry, and ultimately stupid ethnic group getting what it deserves. [If this were any other group, Zakaria would not be using the pages of the Washington Post for a victory dance. Instead, he would be launching an emotional blackmail campaign to cure this "epidemic" with hundreds of billions of federal dollars.
