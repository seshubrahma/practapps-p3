In the   to this year’s elections, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) detailed the disproportionately negative impact regulations have on smaller businesses. Although the average cost per employee to comply with federal regulations is advertised as $19, 564, it is only $13, 750 for large companies with over 100 employees, $18, 243 for companies with 50 to 99 employees, and $34, 671 for firms with fewer than 50 employees. NAM wrote that given that almost all the employment gains each year are created by small business, this explained why the   hourly wage for middle class workers peaked at $21. 60 in 1978 and is still down after 38 years at $21.
