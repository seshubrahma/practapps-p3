That is the ONLY thing I support about Saudi Arabia by the way. I once thought that if feminists took over the world, there would be immediate global nuclear war. It would be touched off by the smallest of things, like not Retweeting a selfie fast enough, or speaking to a man without accusing him of rape.   Now I recognize that feminists are far too   for nukes, theyâ€™d rather destroy western civilization by importing murderous barbarians and teaching boys that masculinity is evil and cuckoldry is noble.
