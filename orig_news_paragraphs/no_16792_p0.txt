Novi, Michigan (CNN) Donald Trump on Friday challenged President Barack Obama to pledge not to issue a presidential pardon to Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while leading the State Department. Clinton, however, has been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by the FBI and the Justice Department. Trump issued his "demand" during a rally here as he repeatedly railed against Clintonâ€™s tenure at the State Department and her subsequent misleading and even false statements about whether she had sent or received classified information through her personal email account.
