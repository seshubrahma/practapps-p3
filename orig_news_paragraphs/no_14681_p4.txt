The Intelligence committees have taken the lead on the investigation instead of armed services or foreign relations.   Although the chairman of the committee in the Senate, Richard Burr of North Carolina, has promised to conduct a thorough investigation, he has been extremely close to Trump throughout his campaign serving as his national security adviser. There have been disclosures that Burr helped the White House to push back against critical stories about the   connections.   The problem with the standing committees is that partisanship is too powerful a force in contemporary politics to trust them to do a good job.
