Trump, the New York celebrity tycoon, has caused alarm in Europe with his abrasive style and pledges to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. His proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States drew the ire of Britain’s Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the idea "stupid, divisive and wrong". Trump has criticised the continent’s leaders as "weak" and accused them of taking inadequate measures to combat terrorism following the Islamist attacks on Brussels in March.
