The people who construct, repair, and create with their own two hands are the people who make this nation run. And lots of those people voted for me. Thatâ€™s also why, in my Administration, I am so deeply committed to technical and vocational education. I want you to know that my administration is working every single day to create new opportunities and to reverse years of stagnant growth, falling wages, and disappearing jobs.
