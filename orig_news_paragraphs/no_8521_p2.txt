The suspension is in response to the interview Beck did with fiction author Brad Thor last Wednesday, in which Thor likened the GOP’s presumptive nominee Donald Trump to a South   dictator who would cause an "  event" for the country if elected. Thor then declared that in such a case, Congress would not be able to remove Trump from office by "legal means" through impeachment, so Thor asked "what patriot will step up and do that" if Trump oversteps his Constitutional restraints. Beck agreed with Thor’s assessment.
