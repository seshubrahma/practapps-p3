Americans have to borrow from foreigners or sell U. S. real estate, intellectual property and businesses to finance the trade gap. For example, the more than $1. 2 trillion in U. S. Treasury securities held by the Chinese and the sale of GE appliance business and other private American corporate assets to the Chinese. Much of the lost business activity and ownership is in manufacturing —   that sector supports a lion’s share of RD spending.
