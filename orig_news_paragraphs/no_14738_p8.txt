Today, "Deep State" shows up frequently on message boards used by Trump supporters and websites like InfoWars. In one post on the message board   a user accused it of staging a coup against Trump by leaking information to discredit members of his Cabinet, including Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.   " The deep state has erupted into a clandestine war between hostile elements loyal to their alternate power structures and friendly elements loyal to the US and its lawfully elected government," one user wrote.
