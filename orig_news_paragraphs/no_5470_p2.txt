Velayati, who also served as Iranâ€™s foreign minister, said the Islamic Republic was not seeking war against any country, but would not waste a moment defending itself if necessary. His comments come after Rouhani addressed the Iranian people on Friday in an event to commemorate the 38th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. " We are experiencing conditions in which some novices have come to power in the region, in the world and in the U. S. as they should all know that they have to talk to the Iranian nation with the language of respect and dignity," Rouhani said.
