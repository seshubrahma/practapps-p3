North Korea’s relationship with China    its most important ally    has kept Pyongyang afloat as sanctions have crippled and isolated it from the rest of the world.   But in recent years, China has taken a tougher line on the North Korean nuclear program, voting in favor of UN sanctions and issuing condemnations when it conducts provocative military tests. Russia’s Foreign Ministry also spoke out against the test, the first since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, saying in a statement that it was in "defiant disregard" of UN resolutions. Russia and China were both members of the Six Party Talks    a diplomatic attempt to curb North Korea’s nuclear program that started in 2003    along with the US, Japan, and North and South Korea.
