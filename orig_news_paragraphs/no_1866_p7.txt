President Obama is on his way to Europe, where he will face leaders he had long assured that Mr. Trump could not be elected. Their meetings will now be shadowed by uncertainty over the United Statesâ€™ commitment to NATO. Mr. Obama will visit Athens and Berlin before heading to Lima, Peru, for a summit meeting of the   Economic Cooperation forum. For about half the member states, the gathering will be clouded by the death of the   Partnership trade deal.
