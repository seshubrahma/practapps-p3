Politically, Russia has won a                   beachhead in the European Union through its                   support for a number of   parties,                   including Austria’s Freedom Party, whose leader                    at the Kremlin last                   week .                 ’ ’                   A  from                   the   Center for the Study of                   Democracy in October argued that in several                   Eastern European countries, including Bulgaria,                   Hungary, Latvia, Serbia, and Slovakia, "Russian                   influence has become so pervasive and endemic                   that it has challenged national stability as well                   as a country’s Western orientation and                     stability. " And, of course, Putin                   achieved something the Soviet Union could only                   have dreamed of: influencing, if not outright                   altering, the results of a U.
