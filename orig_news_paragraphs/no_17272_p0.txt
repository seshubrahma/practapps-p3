 (CNN) Congressional Republicans are using the short term government spending bill to expedite a vote on retired Gen. James Mattis,   Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee to lead the Defense Department. Mattis, who retired from the military three years ago, and who was formally nominated Tuesday, needs a special waiver from Congress to serve as the top civilian at the Pentagon. A World War   law aimed at preserving civilian control over the military bars those who served in the military in the last seven years from leading the Defense department.
