Oddly enough, the only profitable quarter Tesla has seen in a long time was selling $139 million in pollution tax credits to other automakers. To me, the lesson of Elon Musk  —   who, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times in May of 2015, has been the beneficiary of almost $5 billion dollars in government subsidies   —   is that these green tax credits allow businesses to subvert the   to their own advantage. I don’t blame Musk, nor is this piece meant to be a critique of him.
