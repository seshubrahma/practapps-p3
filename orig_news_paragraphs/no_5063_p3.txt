Many experts have warned that Hawaii may be the first point of any potential North Korean attack, with its location in the   ocean far more reachable than the American west coast. The remote island is located 4, 660 miles from North Korea, while Los Angeles remains approximately 5, 800 miles in distance. An analysis carried by the BBC suggests that North Korea possesses over 1, 000 missiles, all with ranging capabilities. Some of their weapons, including the   ballistic missile, have an intercontinental range, meaning they can travel up to 5000 miles, just short of the American coastline.
