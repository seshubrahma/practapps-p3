Snooker uses a larger table, and narrower pockets than the older game of billiards. It’s played with 15 red balls, a white cue ball and six balls of other colors. In short, once all 15 red balls have been pocketed, the colored balls  —   each worth a different number of points   —   must be sunk in a specific order.
