super PAC almost raised more money in August than all of Donald Trumpâ€™s super PACs have combined during the entire 2016 campaign, collecting more than $20 million in what the group called their most successful month so far. Priorities USA raised $21. 6 million from wealthy Democrats, according to spokesman Justin Barasky, more than twice what it raised during the prior month. The organization had $41. 5 million on hand as of August 31, money it is pouring into swing states to finance what has so far been a relentless paid media campaign against Trump, though his poll numbers remain competitive.
