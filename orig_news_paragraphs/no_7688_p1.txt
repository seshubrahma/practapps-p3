The appointments are the first signs that the Trump administration is mending ties with Silicon Valley, who apart from PayPal   Peter Thiel, overwhelmingly opposed his candidacy for the presidency. Before these announcements, only IBMâ€™s CEO Ginni Rometty had been chosen to serve on the board of economic advisory, whilst Peter Thiel confirmed he would serve the administration as an informal technology advisor. " My administration is going to work together with the private sector to improve the business climate and make it attractive for firms to create new jobs across the United States from Silicon Valley to the heartland," Trump said in a statement.
