The connections extend to family: Until recently, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, was one of five people overseeing a nearly  $  trust fund for Murdoch’s daughters from a previous marriage. (Ivanka Trump resigned as a trustee after Election Day.) The   connections might all seem like harmless coincidence    just a couple of billionaire buddies whose families get along    but it goes much deeper than that. In several cases, Trump appears to be using his presidential powers to provide a commercial benefit to Murdoch.
