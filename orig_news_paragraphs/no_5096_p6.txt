In Táchira, a Colombian border state that has borne the brunt of much of Maduro’s   violence, multiple reports estimate that over 40, 000 Venezuelans took the streets of the capital, the college town San Cristóbal, to demand an end to the Maduro era. Táchira was among the first states to rebel against Chavismo, beheading a statue of Chávez during the 2014 wave of protests. The mayor of San Cristóbal, Daniel Ceballos, was arrested by secret police (Sebin) in 2014 for supporting the   protests. Ceballos was sentenced to 12 months in prison in 2014, but remains detained in what his mother has condemned as deplorable conditions.
