But in the recent New York   News   survey, just 9 percent wound up in those categories. Mrs. Clinton was the beneficiary: She held 82 percent of Mr. Sanders’s supporters, but just 55 percent in the YouGov poll. (Mr. Trump did fare better among Mr. Sanders’s supporters in the YouGov poll, earning 15 percent of the vote, than in The New York   News poll, where he won 10 percent.) My guess is that Mr. Trump would still fare slightly better in the online surveys than in the   polls, even if the number of undecided voters was equal.
