And unlike Mitt Romney, whom President Obama effectively portrayed as a cold corporate titan in the 2012 race, Mr. Trump enjoys some of his strongest support among   white voters who believe he cares about people like them. The issue of trade particularly hurt Mrs. Clinton in the primary in Michigan, which is heavily reliant on manufacturing jobs. She narrowly lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, like Mr. Trump, sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton for her previous support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which her husband signed into law, and the   Partnership, which she supported as secretary of state. Before Mrs. Clintonâ€™s speech, Mr. Trump used an address to the National Association of Home Builders in Miami Beach to assail former President Bill Clinton for signing Nafta into law, which Mr. Trump said devastated upstate New York, and he hammered Mrs. Clinton for failing to deliver on a promise she made in her 2000 Senate campaign to bring 200, 000 jobs to the state.
