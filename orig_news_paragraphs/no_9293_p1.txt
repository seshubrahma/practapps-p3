" Sen. Ted Cruz raised almost $20 million for his presidential campaign in the fourth quarter   —   a 66% increase over the previous   period, according to campaign officials and a memo that shows how the Texas Republican’s fundraising pace accelerated as he has gained in the polls," the Wall Street Journal’s Janet Hook wrote. In a staff memo that Hook obtained, Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe recounted how the Texas Senator and conservative firebrand’s campaign has raked in more than $45 million in 2015.
