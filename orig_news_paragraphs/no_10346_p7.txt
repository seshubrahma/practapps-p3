Now I am not a Trumpster (I grew up under, and was formed by, the leadership of Maggie Thatcher, a very different kind of leader) but can we just stop for a moment and look at what the presidential candidate actually said? He said: it if our allies keep to their commitments (hear an echo Senator Cruz?) we will defend them.
