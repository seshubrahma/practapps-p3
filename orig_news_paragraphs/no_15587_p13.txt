Section 4 of Article Two of the United States Constitution provides that the president "shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."   Paradoxically enough, this was not an express limitation to criminal conduct.    The framers likely understood "high" to be read with the preceding crimes (treason and bribery) as wrongs against the public or of a political character.   Political wrongs recognized under English common law included misapplication of funds and abuse of power, and even interfering with another branch of government.
