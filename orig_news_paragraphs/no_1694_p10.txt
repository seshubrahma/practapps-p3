Passthrough businesses, which range from    shops to law firms and large real estate partnerships, have become increasingly common in recent decades and now produce more than half of all business income. Under current law, that income is passed through to the tax returns of the business owners, where it is taxed at the same rates as a workerâ€™s wages. Corporations generally pay a lower tax rate, but shareholders must also pay a second round of taxes on any corporate profits distributed as dividends. Both Democrats and Republicans want to overhaul the corporate tax system, which combines a high headline rate with endless loopholes.
