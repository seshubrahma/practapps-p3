Industry groups are pushing back against an   regulation meant to exert pressure on companies to better comply with   rules. A provision of that rule, which was supposed to take effect last month, would require companies to electronically submit accident data to OSHA so the agency could post the information on a public website. As recently as early January, OSHA said on its website that it expected the site to be live in February. But in recent weeks, the agency changed the wording so that it now states, "OSHA is not accepting electronic submissions at this time. "
