 (CNN) A gay man is suing a funeral home in Mississippi, alleging that it refused to cremate his husband because it did not "deal with their kind. "  John "Jack" Zawadski, 82, and his nephew filed a lawsuit against the Picayune Funeral Home’s owners seeking damages for breach of contract and emotional distress.   The lawsuit accuses them of backing out of a verbal agreement to provide final services for Zawadski’s husband, Robert Huskey, in May 2016 after discovering he was gay.
