Gov. Chris Christie‘s   presidential campaign has sold its email list of supporters and donors to his former chief Republican rival Marco Rubio, the governor ’s campaign spokesman confirmed Monday. That means those who supported the governor are now getting messages from Rubio, who was Christie’s prime target during the New Hampshire primary. The first   message went out Sunday afternoon.
