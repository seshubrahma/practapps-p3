Every week or so during the spring, I met with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the party headquarters on Capitol Hill. We fell into a familiar routine. I would enter his office, usually chaperoned by Sean Spicer, the R. N. C. â€™s chief strategist and head of communications. Priebus has a healthy appreciation for gallows humor, which is not a bad thing for an R. N. C. chairman these days.
