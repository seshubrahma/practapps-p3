—    From the "You Have to Go Back" file: An Egyptian Muslim man who threatened to kill Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will leave the US of his own accord this week, his lawyers say.     aviation student Emadeldin Elsayed was arrested in February by US Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) agents, after posting an article about Trump on Facebook, along with the comment: "I literally don’t mind taking a lifetime sentence in jail for killing this guy, I would actually be doing the whole world a favor.
