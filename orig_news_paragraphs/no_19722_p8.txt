Under Ronald Reagan and the two presidents Bush, the executive branch often tied itself to the mast of a strong executive, one with "inherent" powers over war, peace, and law enforcement that Congress could not limit in any way. (After Congress passed the sweeping 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, for example, Bush legal adviser John Yoo sent the president a memo advising that the Congress was out of line for passing it, because it suggested he needed authorization to attack any nation or group he chose at any time for any reason.) Obama has never formally subscribed to this   theory. On paper, at least, he has insisted that he is working hard to fulfill the intent of Congress as expressed in statutes.
