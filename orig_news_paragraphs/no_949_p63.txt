Days after the Feb. 11 resignation of Mubarak, one of the worldâ€™s   tyrants, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, a transitional military body, sent a bus to pick up Maher and three other protest leaders and took them to a villa owned by   officials. Sisi, then the intelligence chief, and two other generals greeted them respectfully, Maher recalled.
