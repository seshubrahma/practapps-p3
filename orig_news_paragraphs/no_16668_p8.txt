This was a rookie error. Rahami also used the   bomb ingredient HMTD, which is rarely used by terrorists because it is both unstable and not as powerful as another   explosive, TATP.    The US Department of Homeland Security says that one of the few terrorists in the States to have tried to launch an   attacks is Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian   member living in Canada. Ressam built an   bomb in Canada that he planned to detonate at Los Angeles International Airport in December 1999.
