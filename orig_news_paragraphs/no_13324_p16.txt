I think the thing that really made my decision about who to vote for this time is that I believe whole heartedly that Donald Trump has both feet firmly planted in America. I believe Marco Rubio has one foot here and one foot wherever his backers need him to be. I want someone who loves America again —  who will stand up and commend our military, our policemen, the border patrol agent [and who will] get out of the way and let them do the jobs they’ve been hired to do.
