In a televised address at a Hanukkah   ceremony honoring wounded soldiers and the victims of terrorism, Mr. Netanyahu excoriated the Obama administration for not vetoing the Security Councilâ€™s measure. He said he would work with the incoming administration of   Donald J. Trump to rescind it. Describing the resolution passed on Friday as "distorted," "delusional" and "absurd," Mr. Netanyahu said it was "part of the swan song of the old world that is biased against Israel. " "
