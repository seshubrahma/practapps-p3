MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki warns that pundits who argued that Trump can’t win the GOP nomination are making the same arguments about his chances in a general election. Chris Jansing says that Hillary Clinton supporters who feel that Clinton will win the general election because she is more of a policy wonk than Trump should look at what happened to Jeb! ’s candidacy. Kornacki notes that Trump may win over a lot of   Democrats in a general election.
