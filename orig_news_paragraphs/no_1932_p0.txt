  Donald J. Trump’s foundation has acknowledged that it may have run afoul of   rules that guard against using money meant for charity to benefit principals of the organization, according to its 2015 tax filing. On the filing, the  ’s charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, checked "yes" to answer a question about whether its resources had been directed or used to benefit a "disqualified person "  —   meaning one of the organization’s central people. The tax filing offers new details about Mr. Trump’s charitable giving, which became the subject of intense scrutiny during his presidential campaign after news reports raised questions about whether he had followed through on pledges he made to donate money and his lack of financial support for the foundation.
