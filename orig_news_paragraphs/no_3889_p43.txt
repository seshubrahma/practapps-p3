(You can already see how the media is growing reluctant to mention that this entire "scandal" is based on a single question and the   reply.) The media would also interpret a Sessions resignation as a confession that he did discuss some nefarious scheme to "hack" the 2016 election with Russiaâ€™s ambassador. Democrats would frenzy, shrieking about "blood in the water" and drawing up lists of the targets they want their media pals to go after next, if they do not have those lists written up already. There might already be some people in the Trump White House regretting that they did not fight harder to save National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, whose name pops up in many stories about Sessions, with reminders that he only resigned two weeks ago.
