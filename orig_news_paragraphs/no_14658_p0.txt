Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump appeared to put responsibility on his generals for the death of a Navy SEAL in a mission he approved. Asked in an interview with Fox News Monday about the controversial US raid in Yemen last month, Trump repeatedly emphasized the role others played in planning the mission before he signed off on it. The operation against an al Qaeda target resulted in the Trump administrationâ€™s first combat death, Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens, after Special Forces came under enemy fire.
