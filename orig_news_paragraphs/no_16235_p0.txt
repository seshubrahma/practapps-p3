 (CNN) Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine was spotted at the Newport Shipyard Friday night just minutes before his phone rang at 7:32 pm, and then he disappeared from view. He ducked inside the office of a dock worker to take the call discretely. There, surrounded by ropes, flags and other nautical equipment, he accepted Hillary Clintonâ€™s offer to join the Democratic ticket as her running mate.
