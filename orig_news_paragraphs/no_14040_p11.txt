Before Trump’s inauguration, Clinton’s official account posted a tweet about her presence: "I’m here today to honor our democracy  its enduring values. I will never stop believing in our country  its future."   She was composed throughout the ceremony, but Friday was the day she had warned supporters about.   "Imagine that on January 20, 2017, it is Donald Trump standing in front of our Capitol and taking the oath of office," Clinton had said in a dire warning to supporters in Las Vegas, just three days from the election.
