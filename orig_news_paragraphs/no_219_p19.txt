But Michel Paradis, a lawyer for Mr. Nashiri, argued that Mr. Obama’s decision about his presidential records was insufficient, because Mr. Trump might seek to withdraw the report from the archives and destroy it. Last week, in response to a request by Mr. Nashiri’s lawyers to secure a copy of the full report in the hands of the judiciary, Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the Obama administration to provide a copy to the court’s security officer. (Lawyers for Mr. Zubaydah are separately making the same request.) But in court filings, the Obama administration asked Judge Lamberth to reconsider, making two arguments: Preserving it would interfere with   branch relations, and giving a copy to the court was unnecessary in part because of Mr. Obama’s archived copy.
