But few people in Mr. Trump’s circle are offering support for Mr. Christie these days   —   even if he was the first national political figure to embrace Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Among the remaining contenders for the job are Ronna Romney McDaniel, chairwoman of the Michigan G. O. P. and a niece of Mitt Romney’s Nick Ayers, an aide to Vice   Mike Pence, and Mercedes Schlapp, a Republican strategist. Ms. McDaniel, who strongly supported Mr. Trump during the campaign, is said to be favored by a number of people in his circle.
