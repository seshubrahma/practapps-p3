London’s Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan has continued his   Clinton tour of the United States by declaring that immigrants into the West should not be forced to assimilate. [His comments come hot on the heels of the Chicago press exposing his connections to radical Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.   Mr. Khan, who was elected to be London’s mayor in May 2016, has also used his trip to claim that Republican candidate Donald Trump is "playing into the hands" of the Islamic State. His trip runs contrary to the U. S. visit from former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who presented an upbeat message of defeating the political establishment on stage with Donald Trump.
