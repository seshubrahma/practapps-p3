The poll shows strong support for Trump among Independents, who prefer the GOP nominee over Clinton, 30 percent to her 23 percent and Johnson with 15 percent, Stein six percent. Easley and Yokley make the case that Johnson and Stein are in a position to become disruptive as they pull support from Trump and Clinton, but were that to happen it would be contrary to the patterns witnessed throughout presidential campaigns in American history, with the exception of third and fourth party candidates with regional bases of support. The   national presidential poll conducted Aug. 9 showed Clinton at 42 percent, Trump at 37, Johnson at nine percent and Stein at three percent. Although Morning Consult polls both for the   race and the   between Trump and Clinton,   only polls for the   contest because the 2016 election is a   race.
