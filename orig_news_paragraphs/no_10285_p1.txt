Trump’s   lead comes after FBI Director James Comey announced on Sunday that the FBI did not find any information that would change the decision issued in July, when the FBI announced it would not recommend prosecution against Clinton for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. The poll surveyed 1, 026 likely voters   —   including 322 Republicans, 319 Democrats and 344 Independents. The results have a 3. 1 percent margin of error.
