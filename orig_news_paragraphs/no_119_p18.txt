Among the Chinese tycoons expected to attend Davos are Wang Jianlin, founder of the Wanda Group, a property and cinema company, and Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group, China’s biggest   company. They are commonly referred to as the two wealthiest men in China. Both are investing in the United States, and Mr. Ma met with Mr. Trump on Monday at Trump Tower in New York to discuss business opportunities between companies in the two countries. (Within Mr. Trump’s family, his    Jared Kushner, has been involved in personal business negotiations with top Chinese executives.)
