After another terrorist attack, this time at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June, Madge took to Twitter to mourn the 49 victims of the attack, though not in a way some people found appropriate for the situation. The singer posted two Tweets one featured a gay couple touching tongues, and another was a photograph of herself kissing Britney Spears on the mouth during the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Love is Love. Stop Hate Crimes.
