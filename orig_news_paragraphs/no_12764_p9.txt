The last edition of the Independent is expected to be on 26th March and the last Independent on Sunday on 20 March. ESI Media, which also owns TV station London Live and the British capitalâ€™s Evening Standard daily, said it would be "the first national newspaper to embrace a global,   future". " A significant number of employees are expected to move across to Johnston Press," it said, warning that there would be "some redundancies".
