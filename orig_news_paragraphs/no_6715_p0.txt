Electronic dance music DJ Moby announced to his Instagram followers that he is in possession of intelligence that proves that "the Trump administration is in collusion with the Russian government. " [Without providing any of said proof, Moby wrote in an Instagram post that after "spending the weekend talking to friends who work in dc," he could "safely" post what he claimed were five intelligence points he believed to be accurate.   The    dance music star went on to claim that a discredited dossier of unsubstantiated allegations about Trumpâ€™s connection to the Russian government is "100% real," and that Trump is being "blackmailed by the Russian government for much more nefarious things.
