A spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. Mr. Page, a former   investment banker for Merrill Lynch who later founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital, has been on the F. B. I. â€™s radar screen for years. In early 2013, he met with a Russian intelligence officer posing as a banker in New York. The Russian agent was part of an espionage ring the F. B. I. had been investigating, and court records indicate that the spy tried to recruit Mr. Page.
