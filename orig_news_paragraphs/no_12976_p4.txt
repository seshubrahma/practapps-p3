According to Miller, Trump is the only candidate in the GOP field who has explicitly and historically been   manufacturing. He argued that Trump’s opposition to trade deals like the the   Partnership for voters, and in particular South Carolinians, make him the best candidate to protect American jobs and companies. " Do you believe as a country that we should have manufacturing, that ‘Made in the USA’ should be not just a slogan, but a reality for millions of people," Miller said.
