But while giving Xi what he needed, Trump also set the agenda for the rest of the year to focus on what he wants: specifically, demonstrable movement in reducing China’s persistent bilateral trade deficit in ways that will allow Trump to claim that he has added good American jobs, and stopping North Korea’s nuclear advance. A working group led by Secretaries Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin and their Chinese counterparts has 100 days to report on a specific program of actions to address the economic front. The Chinese have already signaled that they are prepared to make significant concessions, including ending the ban on beef imports that they imposed in 2003, buying more agricultural products and making investments in American infrastructure projects. While it is too soon to be confident how Xi read Trump’s position on North Korea, my bet is that he is at least uncertain about whether Trump will attack North Korea.
