Though Washington may be some 180 miles down the road, as long as I’m the president of your great country, each and every day I’m fighting for you and I’m fighting for all the forgotten men and women in our country. It’s not easy, we have a lot of bad opposition, we have a lot of bad, bad phony opposition, but together we will all make sure that our nation is a land of prosperity and opportunity for all.
