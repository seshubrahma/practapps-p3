Some of the most successful convention moments were often the result of careful planning, stagecraft and writing. For some Republicans, Ann Romney delivered the best speech of the party’s gathering in 2012 because she went to great lengths to present a loving portrait of Mitt Romney that was more fully rounded than his reputation as a wealthy businessman. The energetic performance of Sarah Palin electrified the 2008 Republican convention, and the 2004 Democratic keynote address by Barack Obama, then a Senate candidate from Illinois, catapulted him to national prominence. And Bill Clinton enjoyed one of the biggest   bounces in the polls in 1992 after several nights of uplifting speeches and pageantry, from the glowing documentary film "The Man From Hope" to memorable moments from Hillary Clinton, a beaming Virginia Kelley (Mr. Clinton’s mother) and the nominee himself.
