The level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking in the past  —   and particularly in this past year   —   is simply not sustainable," Tillerson said at a brief news conference in Tokyo, the first stop on a     tour of Asia. " Tillerson, for most of his career a top executive at Exxon Mobil, said he expected more aid from other countries would help to cover the shortfall as the U. S. recedes, and he said he was ‘confident’ the State Department would continue to fulfill its mission," the Times reported.
