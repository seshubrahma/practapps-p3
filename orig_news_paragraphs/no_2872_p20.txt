Saudi Arabia has held the upper hand in recent years, but Iran was a major player at the latest OPEC meeting, as the cartel decided to cut production for the first time in eight years. Iran wants to ramp up production at the very moment that Saudi Arabia wants to cut output to lift prices. Using its recovered production leverage, Iran agreed to go along with the decision to collectively cut 1. 2 million barrels a day of production only when the other members conceded to its demands that it be allowed to increase production by about 90, 000 barrels a day next year. It remains to be seen whether the agreement to scale back production, not slated to take effect until January, will hold up.
