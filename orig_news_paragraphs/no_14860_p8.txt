We believe they wanted to avoid the time consuming competition they would have had to organize to hire the law firm legally, so they drew up the undervalued contract  and probably arranged to pay the real fee in cash," Gorbatyuk told CNN, speaking in Russian. However, when Tymoshenko’s legal team publicly pointed out that the government could not have secured Skadden’s services for just $12, 000, Skadden asked Ukrainian officials to draw up a second contract that reflected a more realistic fee, prosecutors allege. Asked to comment on its involvement in the matter, Skadden released a statement to CNN: "We have been and will continue cooperating with appropriate requests."  Members of Gorbatyuk’s office showed CNN a record of seven separate occasions when they asked the US authorities for help. The first letter was sent in December 2014 to the US Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs, and was a request to question Skadden partner Gregory Craig, who also served as a White House counsel in the Obama administration.
