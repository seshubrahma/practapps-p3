The Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for America’s largest companies, called the move a "reckless and dramatic overreach" and an "act of aggression" against a company and a sovereign government. In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe. The European Commission "is using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view," Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend’s meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies.
