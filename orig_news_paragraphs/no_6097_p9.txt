In December 2015, Hope Not Hate labelled Jasser an "  extremist" alongside the   practising Muslim Raquel Saraswati, who campaigns against regressive forms of Sharia law, in a report on what it termed the "counter jihad movement". " Their Orwellian approach is actually doing takfir" Jasser added, referring to the Islamic practice of declaring a Muslim to be an apostate. By lauding Hope Not Hate, Asim aligns himself with the organisationâ€™s controversial views on Islam, calling into question his suitability to advise the government on Sharia law.
