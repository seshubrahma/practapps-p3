Mr. Trump won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. Now, according to a tally published this week by NBC News, three of his Republican rivals  —   Mr. Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  —   are spending a combined $1. 5 million on television ads in the 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s bill? Zero.
