Hawaii was the first state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, and itâ€™s the birthplace of my friend Patsy Mink who authored Title IX, which brought equal education opportunities to girls and women nationwide. It elected the first governors of Japanese, Native Hawaiian and Filipino ancestry. And when he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, Derrick Kahala Watson became just the fourth Native Hawaiian federal judge in the history of the United States. My path to the US Senate was improbable, but the same immigrant story is shared by so many in my home state and across the country.
