Almost everybody, whether an existing citizen or a new immigrant, needs government subsidies to afford health insurance now, thanks to ObamaCare. Another way of looking at the fairness issue is that immigration restrictions and law enforcement tend to poll worse when they’re personalized   —   not abstract discussions about law enforcement, but personalized stories about individual people and families who will suffer, if immigration laws are enforced. That only works when the people who suffer from open borders immigration are   and rendered invisible, much the way ObamaCare can only be presented as a "success" if everyone harmed by it is completely ignored.
