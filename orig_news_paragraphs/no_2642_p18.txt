Mayor Fulop had represented a Port Authority tenant in its bid to get a lease extension. Mr. Wildstein and Mr. Baroni had helped him get the terms he wanted and Mr. Christie’s campaign manager urged them to "continue throwing the   name around when discussing this with him," so the mayor would understand that the governor had helped him, and expected help in return. When Mr. Fulop told the Christie campaign he would not give his endorsement, the administration canceled a special "mayor’s day" of meetings between Mr. Fulop and   Port Authority and Christie administration officials. Mr. Wildstein also said early on that "evidence exists" that Mr. Christie knew about the lane closings as they were happening.
