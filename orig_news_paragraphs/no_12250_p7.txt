On May 10, 1975, Shelton got into the truck of a local paper factory worker who said he would take her to get a soda. She was only twelve years old at the time, riding her bike around her neighborhood before she encountered the man, Alfred Thomas Taylor, and a    male acquaintance of his. Taylor drove his truck into a ravine and raped Shelton while beating her, calling the child a "bitch," and saying, "you like it, you know it" as he violated her. Shelton managed to flee to a nearby home, falling unconscious and waking up in a hospital.
