The stock market has jumped to record highs and the job market has been particularly strong since President Trumpâ€™s inauguration, causing the consumer comfort index to rise. Respondents to the index view the buying climate as the most favorable it has been in 15 years, a sign that there might be an uptick in household spending after a slow start in 2017. Sentiment has been strong among Republicans as well as political independents, who were the most confident about the economy and the buying climate since July 2001.
