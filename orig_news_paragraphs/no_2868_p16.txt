General Mattisâ€™s selection has also resurfaced an accusation from "The Only Thing Worth Dying For," a 2010 book by Eric Blehm, who wrote about a group of Green Berets after they were hit by an American smart bomb in Afghanistan in 2001. In the book, Mr. Blehm quotes a former Army Special Forces officer accusing General Mattis, then a brigadier general, of refusing to send helicopters to rescue the Green Berets. The general declined to be interviewed for the book. Mr. Trump has so far shown an affinity for retired military officers as he assembles his government.
