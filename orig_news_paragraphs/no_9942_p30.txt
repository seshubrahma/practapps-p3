Have enough Cruz supporters become state convention delegates to be able to elect a number of national convention delegates greater than the 25 percent of the Republican votes he received in the straw poll? Have enough Trump supporters become state convention delegates to be able to elect a number of national convention delegates greater than the 47 percent of the Republican votes he received in the straw poll? When Trump was here in Arizona last year, he could have explained to his supporters that what he really needed them to do was get appointed to a vacant Republican precinct committeeman position so that they could be in a position to vote for one another to become state convention delegates. Like Ben Carson, he failed to do this.
