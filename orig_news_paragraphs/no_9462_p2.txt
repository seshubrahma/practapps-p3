The idea you would take this loyalty of I  and I take an oath to you, to the people —   that’s who’s working for whom. The idea that a candidate running for office wants the people to pledge loyalty to him like subjects to a king, well, we’ve had seven years of a president who thinks he is an emperor. I’ve got to say, the only   I’m interested in is on January 20, 2017, when I hope to raise my right hand and have my left hand sitting on the Bible when I make a promise, a pledge to every American to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
