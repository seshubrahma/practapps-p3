WASHINGTON   —   President Trump, flanked by company executives and miners, signed a   executive order on Tuesday to nullify President Barack Obama’s climate change efforts and revive the coal industry, effectively ceding American leadership in the international campaign to curb the dangerous heating of the planet. Mr. Trump made clear that the United States had no intention of meeting the commitments that his predecessor had made to curb   carbon dioxide pollution, turning denials of climate change into national policy. At a ceremony, Mr. Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency to start the complex and lengthy legal process of withdrawing and rewriting the   Clean Power Plan, which would have closed hundreds of   power plants, frozen construction of new plants and replaced them with vast new wind and solar farms.
