The Saban event reportedly drew around 80 attendees, and Clinton is said to have participated in a    session focusing on policy and the positive achievements of the Clinton Foundation. The candidate also filmed an appearance on ABCâ€™s Jimmy Kimmel Live! earlier Monday. Clinton was scheduled to travel to Laguna Beach Tuesday afternoon for two more fundraisers before heading north to the Bay Area for yet two more events, one hosted by Apple CEO Tim Cook and Vice President Lisa Jackson and another at the home of Integrated Archive Systems CEO Amy Rao. The events are part of an aggressive fundraising push by the Democratic nominee ahead of Labor Day weekend, the unofficial start to what will be a contentious showdown with Republican Donald Trump in the general election.
