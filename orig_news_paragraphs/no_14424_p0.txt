Mexico City (CNN) Mexicans took to the streets Sunday to air their grievances against President Donald Trump and to protest corruption in their home country.   Two separate demonstrations, which together drew an estimated 20, 000 people, merged on Mexico City’s main avenue, Paseo de la Reforma, in a march mostly focused on the new US President.   Marchers convened on the avenue near the US embassy, where riot police and barricades were staked out.
