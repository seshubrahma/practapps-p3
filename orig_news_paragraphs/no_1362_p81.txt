Once his first marriage started to collapse, Mr. Trump faced his most serious allegations of aggression toward women. When "Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump," by the journalist Harry Hurt III, was released in 1993, it included a description of a night in which Mr. Trump was said to have raped Ivana in a fit of rage.
