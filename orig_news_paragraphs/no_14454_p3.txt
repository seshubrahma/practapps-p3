During Trump’s campaign, he encouraged Israel to "keep going" with settlement construction. Trump also stepped back from other components of his campaign’s rhetoric endorsing Israel’s positions on several sensitive issues.

And he made no mention of his campaign pledge to recognize Jerusalem as the "undivided" capital of Israel, another campaign promise.
