["What’s disturbing to us is that experts are telling us Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these emails, and other experts are now saying that the Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of actually of helping Donald Trump," Hillary’s campaign manager Robby Mook said Sunday. Mook was desperately trying to deflect attention from some lecherous emails that treated the LGBT and Hispanic communities, to name a few, less than honorably.   The Kremlin denied any involvement but Republican nominee Donald Trump saw an opening. In a fiery Florida press conference Tuesday, Trump asked the Russians to help locate Clinton’s 30, 000 missing emails.
