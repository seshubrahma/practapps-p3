Clinton is supported by 81 percent of Democrats, including 60 percent of Bernie Sanders supporters, many of whom loudly stated during the primary that they would never consider voting for Clinton. Clinton gets 60 percent of Sanderistas even though roughly the same percentage of them (57 percent) say the Democratic primary process was unfair. Only 8 percent of those voters say they support Donald Trump, who has expressed confidence he would be able to win far more of them over. Trump, meanwhile, gets only 73 percent support from Republicans.
