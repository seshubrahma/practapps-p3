Mr. Trump, for example, vastly understated his role, saying he "became very much less involved with the company" during years when he was actually chairman of the board and chief executive, and "was on the board in a very minority position" during years when he had been chairman. As in previous cases, others warned that Mr. Trump’s promises should not be trusted. This time it was Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor who had a major stake in the company. (The two men now describe themselves as friends and Mr. Icahn supports Mr. Trump’s candidacy.)
