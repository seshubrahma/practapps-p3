A giant rooster sculpture, sporting the  ’s signature hairdo and hand gestures, has been erected outside a shopping mall in Taiyuan, in China’s northern Shanxi Province. The sculpture was commissioned by the company that owns the mall and will be its mascot, Cao Mingliang, the deputy director of planning department from N1 ArtWalk Mall, told CNN. Cao said a series of products and smaller replicas will be available for sale in the future, though some are already being sold on Taobao, the Chinese   giant owned by Alibaba. Wei Qing, whose Shenghe Yangtai Business is selling replica roosters, told CNN he thought sculpture was hilarious.
