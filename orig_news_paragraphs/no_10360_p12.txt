In John chapter 3, before the famous sixteenth verse, Jesus discusses this new kingdom with a prominent Pharisee named Nicodemus. He reveals two things: No one can see the Kingdom of God (v. 3) unless they are born again, and no one can enter the Kingdom of God (v. 5) unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Again, this is a very difficult thing to explain, and I certainly canâ€™t do it in 900 words. If you want to know more about it, I urge you to ask a Christian about it
