Mr. Bannon and Marc Short, Mr. Trumpâ€™s legislative affairs director, both favored holding the vote. But Mr. Ryan, reluctant to suffer an embarrassing loss or to ask his fellow Republicans to take what could be a politically perilous vote on a measure that had little chance of passing, argued vigorously against it. White House officials still believed as much as half of the   Freedom Caucus could be pressured into supporting the bill, and Mr. Bannon demanded to see a confidential   list that demonstrated otherwise. The numbers were grim, and Mr. Trump called Mr. Ryan to acquiesce into calling off the vote.
