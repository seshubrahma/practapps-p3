Muslim women harassed and physically attacked in Chicago while walking to their car. During the Islamic Society of North America convention that started here on Friday, official speakers said these actions had become all too commonplace in the United States. " In this political climate, weâ€™ve seen a normalization of bigotry," said Altaf Husain, an associate professor at Howard University and a vice president of the society, whose convention here is the largest Muslim gathering in the United States and Canada.
