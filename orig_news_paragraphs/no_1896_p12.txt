General Keane declined to discuss the advice he had given Mr. Trump. But he said the new president’s greatest challenge would be to maintain America’s leadership in a world in which radical Islamic militancy was threatening to metastasize into a "global jihadist movement," and hostile powers like Russia, China and Iran were seeking regional dominance. During the campaign, Mr. Trump called into question the network of security alliances that the United States had maintained since World War II, saying the country’s partners in Europe and Asia were not paying their fair share for the American umbrella of protection. Few allies were as rattled by Mr. Trump’s campaign statements as Japan.
