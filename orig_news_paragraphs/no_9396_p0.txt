Bloomberg News’ former top editor, Al Hunt, says GOP candidate Jeb Bush has been "savaged" by   Donald Trump. [Alongside various   mistakes and hits from Sen. Marco Rubio, "Jeb Bush suffered most from being savaged by Mr. Trump, the billionaire developer, who derided him, insulted his family ties and mocked him with the lasting epithet that he was ‘low energy,’ " Hunt writes in a column at the New York Times.   Hunt explains that Bush missed an opportunity in the first half of 2015 to define himself as a reform candidate and to showcase conservative credentials that appeal to the base of the Republican Party.
