The U. N. also teamed up with the African Union to release a report on womenâ€™s rights. It showed the strides women had made, such as participation in various legislative bodies, but also highlighted the strides other countries have made. Several nations have passed measures against   discrimination and   violence, according to the report. In six African countries, however, legal protection for women against domestic violence does not exist.
