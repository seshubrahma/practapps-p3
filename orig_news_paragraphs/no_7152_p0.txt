Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States, tells Breitbart News he plans to continue the rich GOP tradition of standing up for women’s and civil rights in the face of opposition from Democrats.    He also says he plans to help the Republican Party, which led the way on ending slavery, the Civil Rights movement and women’s suffrage and women ’s rights —  among other big picture moral leadership causes in American history —  take more credit for its victories for women’s and civil rights while fighting Democrats who opposed those measures.
