Trump has told donors their money will be used for the campaign, not for himself. " I have absolutely no intention of paying myself back," Trump said in a statement last month.   Other expenses include $577, 000 for payroll and rent at Trump Tower, which doubles as campaign headquarters, and $4. 7 million to Ace Specialties, which supplies Trump’s online store and whose owner is Christl Mahfouz, who sits on the board of directors of Eric Trump’s foundation.
