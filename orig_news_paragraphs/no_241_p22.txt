Until this year, a federal investment tax credit worth 30 percent of the development cost could be claimed. That has dropped to 24 percent for projects that begin this year and is set to be phased out by the end of 2019. To qualify, the project would need to demonstrate construction activity by then, which could be open to interpretation by the Treasury Department. But wind developers and advocates say the credit is also important to red states in the middle of the country, where it has helped drive the spread of   wind farms.
