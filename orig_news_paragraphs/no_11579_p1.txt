If you thought Donald Trump couldn’t sink any lower you were wrong. His continued insistence that if the first woman president is elected it will be illegitimate, ‘rigged,’ and now worthy of ‘second amendment’ remedies is beyond the pale, but not surprising from a man whose life has been dedicated to denigrating women and whose campaign has been built on espousing violence against his   political enemies. This kind of rhetoric from a presidential candidate is dangerous and it ought to horrify every American.
