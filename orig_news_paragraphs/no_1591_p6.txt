After the conventions in late July, Mrs. Clinton’s support among young people rose 12 percent, and she gained ground among liberals and moderates, according to an analysis of a New York   News poll before the conventions and a CBS News poll after them. Mr. Trump improved only with voters who held bachelor’s degrees but did not attend graduate school. " Undecided voters still have a long way to go before they vote for Trump," said Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who holds focus groups with voters.
