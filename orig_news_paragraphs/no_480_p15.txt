9 percent in January, from 62. 7 in December, a sign that at least some people have returned and that still more might do so if prospects brighten. That growth in the work force raised the official unemployment rate to 4. 8 percent last month. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes the millions who are working part time but would prefer   jobs and those so discouraged by rejections that they have given up searching, also rose, to 9. 4 percent in January from 9. 2 percent in December. Revised estimates from December and November cut 39, 000 jobs from previous totals, although other routine adjustments by the Labor Department showed the overall job creation for 2016 was better than previously reported.
