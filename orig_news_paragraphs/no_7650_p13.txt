The first bombing of the World Trade Center misfired but still killed six people and wounded 1, 000 others. Clinton never visited the site while his administration insisted on treating it as a criminal act by individuals who needed to be tried in criminal courts, an attitude that would culminate in Barack Obama’s refusal to recognize that we were in a war at all, and certainly not one with fanatical Muslims. To a man and woman, the Democratic Party’s elected officials continue to participate in and support this denial. Following the first World Trade Center bombing, there were three more devastating attacks on American assets by  ’s barbarians during the Clinton administration, with no response and no change of mind towards the nature of the threat.
