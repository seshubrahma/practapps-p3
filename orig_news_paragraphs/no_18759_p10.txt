In a word: chaos. In a few more: Roughly 95 percent of the 2, 472 GOP delegates will arrive at the convention "bound" to a candidate —   that is, they will be required by their state party (or, in a few cases, state law) to vote for the candidate they were assigned to as a result of their state’s primary or caucus. (The other 5 percent arrive "unbound" and can vote however they like; we’ll get to them later.)
