Sandberg, who will be at the meeting with Trump on Wednesday representing Facebook, personally gave $416, 100 of that to the Hillary Victory Fund. By comparison, Facebook employees only gave $3, 965 to Trump’s campaign and don’t appear to have spent on the RNC or Trump Victory. But Facebook did give both to the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee and the Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee, but gave more to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia than the GOP one in Cleveland. To the Democrats, Facebook gave $1, 450, 000 and to the Republicans it gave $1, 000, 000.
