Trump will face off against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Sunday night in a town   debate. It is the second of three scheduled debates between Trump and Clinton before the November 8 general election. Pence squared off against Clinton’s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine on Tuesday in the only scheduled debate between the VP candidates. Even a   CNN poll of debate watchers declared Pence the winner and found that almost 30 percent of those watching were more likely to vote for the   ticket after watching Pence’s performance.
