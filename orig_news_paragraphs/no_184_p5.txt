Ms. Allred pointed out that if the defamation case moves forward, Mr. Trump could be deposed or asked to testify, and that if he were to lie under oath, it would be grounds for Congress to impeach him, as happened with Mr. Clinton. If it got to a point where Mr. Trump did not testify truthfully under oath in this case, she said, "Then I think Congress will have a very important decision to make. " Ms. Zervos kept her comments at the news conference brief, saying that Mr. Trump had left her with no choice but to take legal action and that she would press forward until he acknowledged that she told the truth.
