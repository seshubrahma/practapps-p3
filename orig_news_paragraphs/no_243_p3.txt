Other nominees have been impeded by attempts to untangle their conflicts of interest, a process that Mr. Trump’s transition team started far later than its predecessors and that has led to embarrassing revelations. A committee vote for Betsy DeVos, a billionaire who is Mr. Trump’s nominee for education secretary, has been delayed by a week to give senators more time to review her voluminous ethics paperwork, which was released after her hearing last week. Other nominees have been delayed for similar reasons. Last week, Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, Mr. Trump’s choice for White House budget director, disclosed that he had failed to pay more than $15, 000 in payroll taxes for a household employee.
