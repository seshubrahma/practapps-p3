Thousands of protesters are expected in the city when the Republican Party holds its convention here from July  . Groups opposed to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, and those supporting him, are planning big rallies. City officials cited security concerns in arguing for restrictions on the demonstrators. The changes agreed to by city officials will most likely increase the visibility of the demonstrations and other activities along the cityâ€™s parade route, said Stephen David, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, which sued the city over its original rules.
