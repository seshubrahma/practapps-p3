A breakdown of voting patterns in the December referendum in Italy, which resulted in the fall of the   government, revealed that urban centers, the southern half of the country and young, unemployed workers overwhelmingly rejected the reform measures put forward by Matteo Renzi, then the prime minister. " Those very voters who were traditionally represented by the left in this case, veered to the Five Star Movement," said Marco Damilano, a political commentator for the newsmagazine Lâ€™Espresso. He added that the new party had built on popular anger even though it did not offer answers for the malaise.
