Support for civil               society groups is not the same thing as regime               change.

S. should have no qualms               about saying so. But understanding that Russia has               viewed itself as operating from a defensive crouch               for 25 years is necessary for talking about how it               will operate now that it’s recovered some of its                 swagger.              ’ ’
