There’s an app for that. Over the summer, the city introduced "Get it Done San Diego," an app and companion website that allows residents to report problems along the streets and sidewalks using their smartphones. After six months of operation, we checked in with city officials to see how it’s going. Almis Udrys, San Diego’s director of performance and analytics, said the app had been downloaded roughly 9, 500 times and was used to send more than 38, 500 reports to the city.
