The context of the speech    days after the US abstention at the Security Council over a resolution criticizing Israeli settlements    really did drive much of its content. Kerry spent a fair amount of time defending the US action at the United Nations, rejecting charges that the United States had colluded with others, while laying out the case for why the US has been staunchly supportive of Israel. But the central portion of the speech was a harsh attack on the settlement enterprise and why they undermine the prospects for a   solution. And even though Kerry conceded, rightly, that they are not the only or even main obstacle to a   solution, and while he did identify numerous forms of bad Palestinian behavior, the level of detail on the settlement question left the clear impression that addressing the settlement enterprise was a priority.
