In a period when Mexico was reluctant to send its drug lords for trial in the United States, Mr. Curielâ€™s job involved working with informants and   Mexican officials to win convictions in this country and in Mexico. In one 1990s case, when he was pushing to extradite two men accused of being Arellano gunmen to Mexico, he found himself defending witness testimony against the men that had most likely been obtained through torture by the Mexican police. " The government is not here to deny there is a possibility of torture," Mr. Curiel told a federal judge.
