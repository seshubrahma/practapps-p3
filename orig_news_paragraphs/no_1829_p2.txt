The more than 2 percent gain in the Standard   Poor’s 500 appears to be linked to the announcement on Sunday by James Comey, the F. B. I. director, that an examination of newly discovered Hillary Clinton’s emails revealed nothing  warranting charges. Market swings over the course of the election suggest that people and institutions with money on the line view a world with Mrs. Clinton as president offering a less volatile economic and financial environment than one with Donald J. Trump in charge. It’s a risky game to try to tie swings in financial markets to political news.
