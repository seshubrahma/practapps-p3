You have said you joined the Gang of Eight to get the most conservative bill out of the Senate, but your bill was endorsed by every Senate Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and La Raza. So that does mean you are an incompetent negotiator, or that you misrepresented the contents of your bill to the American people? You continue to insist that your 2013 immigration bill —  which would have granted citizenship, and by extension, welfare access and voting privileges, to illegal immigrants —   is not amnesty. Why do you believe that every single Republican who campaigned in the 2014 midterm elections against the Gang of Eight bill and called it amnesty —  such as Tom Cotton —   is wrong and that your bill did not in fact grant amnesty?
