Last week, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat suggested that Trump’s presidential campaign would end with an assassination attempt. " Good news guys I’ve figured out how the Trump campaign ends," Douthat wrote in a   tweet that included a short clip of a fictional presidential assassination from the film The Dead Zone. Douthat later apologized for the tweet.
