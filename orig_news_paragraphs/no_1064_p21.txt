In the coming weeks, Mr. Trump is also expected to announce that he will direct the E. P. A. to dismantle   regulations on pollution from   power plants. The E. P. A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said he does not think carbon dioxide is a primary cause of global warming, a statement at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change. Bonnie   of the American Lung Association of California, one of many health and environmental groups that spoke at the board meeting, said moving away from strict emissions standards would hurt public health and the health of the planet. She urged the state to stay its course.
