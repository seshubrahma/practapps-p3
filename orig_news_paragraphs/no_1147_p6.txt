The documents appear to be slides from a presentation about a technology that uses metadata from cellphones to identify couriers for Al Qaeda. One slide contained a picture of Mr. Zaidan, alleging that he is a member of Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood, in addition to being an employee of Al Jazeera. It also showed that he had an identification number in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, the lowest level of the governmentâ€™s terrorism watch list. After the information was published, Mr. Zaidan, fearing for his life, fled Pakistan for Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based, according to the lawsuit.
