The Hill (@thehill) March 25, 2016,  3:14: Trump releases personal statement: I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week ’s issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it, and have not, as yet, read it. Likewise, I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin’ Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman and then pretend total innocence. Ted Cruz’s problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O. J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin’ Ted Cruz.
