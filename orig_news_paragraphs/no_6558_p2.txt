The report indicates that Jeffrey "shot himself in the head with a rifle," live on the platform, before police arrived. The suicide is just the latest incident of a livestreamed death on the platform, which has become increasingly more common. This week, a Thai man also livestreamed himself hanging his    child on Facebook Live, before committing suicide. After reportedly being alerted to the livestream by friends of the man, police "rushed to an abandoned hotel near the international airport on Monday afternoon," only to find both people hanged.
