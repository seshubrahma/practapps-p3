Thank you for reminding everybody that the rain chased her away. There werenâ€™t a lot of people there at her rally to begin with. And the rain just left them running for cover. I think she got has to sort of travel nonstop with Beyonce,   and the likes of that just to prop her up and get a decent crowd.
