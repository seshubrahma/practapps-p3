An issue like the Saudi influence on the government and the Kingdom’s support for terrorism is where Donald Trump’s populism comes into all its glory. I don’t care whether you’re a staunch conservative or proud progressive , almost nobody likes or trusts Saudi Arabia. Everyone knows that the Saudis are out for themselves and are our "ally" in the same way a scorpion is an ally to a frog when it needs to get across the river.
