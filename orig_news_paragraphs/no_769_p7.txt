The appointment of Mr. Ross fulfills Mr. Trumpâ€™s promise to stock his cabinet with proven dealmakers. But it also opens the president up to criticism that he has veered away from his vows of populism by surrounding himself with plutocrats.

"Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself," Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote  on Twitter.
