We are tired of the American political class that run deceptive campaigns and say whatever they have to in order to gain votes. Many of us are long time conservative activists like Sen. Jeff Sessions, but among us you will find political neophytes that have been awakened into activism by the Donald Trump movement.   You find evangelical Christians and preacherâ€™s kids like me and also those that are not religious.
