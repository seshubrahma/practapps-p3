Sessions said he answered the question honestly and correctly, because the meetings were part of his work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a Trump campaign surrogate. Missouri Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill, who called for Sessions to resign over the flap, tweeted on Thursday that in her role on the same committee, she never met or had a call with the Russian ambassador. However, older messages from her own Twitter account contradict that, and she later blamed Twitter’s character limit for confusing her point.    Asked on CNN’s "Outfront" if there is any difference between Sessions and McCaskill, Gutierrez told Erin Burnett, "He was under oath, and when you lie under oath, that’s called perjury and you go to jail for doing that."
