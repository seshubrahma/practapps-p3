Like most Democrats, Obama expected his party’s primary to conclude far sooner than it did. The Orlando terrorist shooting last month further postponed Obama’s first campaign event, as the President grew increasingly revved up to appear alongside Clinton, according to aides.   Originally, Obama and Clinton were set to appear in Wisconsin, a state whose Democratic primary Sen. Bernie Sanders won handily. But with Sanders hinting that he’ll soon offer Clinton his   backing, the campaign opted instead for a stop in North Carolina, which Obama lost narrowly in 2012.
