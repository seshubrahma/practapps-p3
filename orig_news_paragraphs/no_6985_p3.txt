Manchin’s decision to support Tillerson essentially guarantees full U. S. Senate approval of the energy executive to serve as Secretary of State whenever the vote occurs. The vote in the full U. S. Senate may not happen until next week, as Republicans and Democrats head into their party retreats later this week, and Democratic leadership in the Senate has been using a variety of procedural measures to slow down confirmation of Trump’s nominees. Tillerson was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday, after Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) dropped his opposition and joined with all his fellow committee Republicans to support approval —   all the committee Democrats opposed Tillerson —  setting up a floor vote sometime soon.
