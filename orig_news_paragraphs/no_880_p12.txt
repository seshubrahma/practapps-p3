It remains unclear precisely why Iran has continued what appears to be an arbitrary pattern of arresting Americans of Iranian descent, with no obvious evidence of wrongdoing. But many   advocates of   views in Iran, including Ayatollah Khamenei, see   as particularly dangerous spreaders of seditious ideas. Other Americans known to be held in Iran are Karan Vafadari, 55, a Tehran art gallery owner, arrested in July along with his wife, Afarin Niasari, 44, an Iranian citizen with permanent United States residency status and Robin Shahini, 46, a rights activist and San Diego State University graduate student, arrested in July while visiting his sick mother. What charges, if any, Mr. Vafadari and his wife face have not been disclosed.
