Okay, so in truth I wasn’t banned from the entire city   —   though that’s surely only a matter of time. Just The Chapel restaurant and event space in Mission District, which cancelled a planned Breitbart meetup after learning of my attendance. The owner said I was the "biggest problem" at the event, and that he had concerns about the venue’s capacity.
