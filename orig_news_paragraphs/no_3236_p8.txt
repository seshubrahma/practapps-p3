The reaction on YouTube to Dear White People is clear, regardless of race. As of this writing, with just over 2. 1 million views, the video has 267, 000 dislikes to just 25, 000 likes. Some people are concentrating on the raw number of dislikes, which is impressive for a video in its first week, but not necessarily historic. The video may never match the   YouTube losers, like this video game trailer with 3. 4 million dislikes.
