Scottâ€™s family has said he was disabled after being in a   motorcycle crash last year. " My understanding (is) that he had had an accident last year that was pretty traumatic, and as a result, made him at least disabled in some particular instances (and was) taking medication for it," Curry said. The Scott family said it released the video in the "name of truth and transparency," according to a statement released by attorney Charles G. Monnett.
