Right before we taped the show, a prominent fellow journalist, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, scolded Mr. Friedman for engaging in "hyperbolic" and "excessive" criticism in the column by mentioning Mr. Trump’s children as he did. " That makes no sense," said Mr. Woodward, who argued that there should be a "zone of protection" around a candidate’s children. On today’s episode, Mr. Friedman rejects that argument, saying that Mr. Trump had forfeited any such "zone of protection" when his children became top advisers to his campaign and highly public spokesmen for it.
