We believe that Mr. Fayyad has the relevant experience and would be an excellent SRSG for the very important work relating to Libya," Swedish Permanent Representative Olof Skoog said in a statement. The move by Haley to block the appointment of Fayyad to lead the United Nations political mission in Libya has been described as unconscionable by PLO Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi.    Ashrawi called the decision a "blatant case of discrimination on the basis of (Fayyadâ€™s) nationality," in a statement released Saturday, adding that it constituted a "blanket license for the exclusion of Palestinians everywhere.
