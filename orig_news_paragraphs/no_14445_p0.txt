Washington (CNN) Congressional Republicans are trying to clamp down on    employees from the Environmental Protection Agency who have turned to secret messaging platforms to voice frustration with the new Trump administration. Claiming possible violations of the Freedom of Information Act, two senior Republican congressman asked the EPA Tuesday to review the use of Signal, an encrypted messaging application, within the agency to conduct official business. Some at the EPA are reportedly turning to the app to speak out confidentially against current administration policy on the environment.
