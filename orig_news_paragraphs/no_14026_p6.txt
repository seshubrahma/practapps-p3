Thatâ€™s largely because at DOJ    223 positions    presidents get to choose every US attorney nationwide, along with the head of each office for the US Marshals. At State    269 positions    the list includes all of the US ambassadors posted around the world. Other agencies with   numbers of appointments include large departments such as Treasury, Commerce, Energy and Transportation.   But is also includes ones you may not have thought much about: roughly two dozen jobs at the National Endowment for the Humanities, about a dozen at both the US Postal Service and the American Battle Monuments Commission, as well as eight of nine board members of the Broadcasting Board of Governors.
