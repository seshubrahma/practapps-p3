We appreciate todayâ€™s Senate action to repeal unwarranted F. C. C. rules that deny consumers consistent privacy protection online and violate competitive neutrality," the cable industry lobby group,   Internet  Television Association, said in a statement on Thursday. With Republicans now in charge across the government, ATT and Comcast are also poised to benefit from further deregulation. Since the presidential election, the companies have pushed the new   F. C. C. lawmakers and the White House to roll back net neutrality, the requirement that broadband providers give equal access to all content on the internet, saying the rules hamper their ability to invest in new networks and jobs.
