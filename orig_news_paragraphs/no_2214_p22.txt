In Oregon, Phyllis Fread was in her 80s, dealing with Parkinson’s disease and had been retired from teaching for almost two decades when Cambridge started calling her at home, where she lived alone. Cambridge salespeople telephoned Ms. Fread   —   who did not use the internet   —   42 times trying to sell her networking services, a website and other products she did not need, according to an investigation by the Oregon attorney general’s office.
