Bradley observes the move to adopt Common Core in many secularized or independent "Catholic" schools is consistent with the fact that the "Catholicism" in the schools is already of the   variety. He writes: These schools are already far down the path of transition from providing a truly Catholic education (as it is so aptly described in "After the Fall") to being more like a religiously inspired, affordable private alternative to dysfunctional public schools. The appeal of this denouement is undeniable: urban "Catholic" schools might be the best route up and out of the ghetto for thousands of   children who deserve that opportunity. But this encouraging effect is and must be just that: a welcome   of providing a genuine Catholic education.
