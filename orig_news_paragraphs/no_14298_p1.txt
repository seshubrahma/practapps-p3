Catholic Community Services of Utah staff planned to welcome the family, but after staff members began inviting others to join, "it exploded," Stamos said, and about 400 people were on hand at the airport to greet them. Pamela Atkinson, an adviser to Herbert, was among those at the airport, and she snapped the photo and sent it to his office. The governor saw the photo and wanted to post it. His caption: "A great Utah moment as we welcome Utahâ€™s newest pioneers."
