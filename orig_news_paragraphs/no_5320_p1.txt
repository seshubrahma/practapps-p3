I don’t agree with him that   Trump is illegitimate. I believe it was a legitimate election and that he was elected through that electoral process. I also don’t agree with his decision not to attend the inaugural although it certainly is his right because it is not about   Trump, it’s a peaceful transfer of power which is a distinguishing characteristic of our republic.
