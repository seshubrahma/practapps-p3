On December 4th, Obama ordered a CIA investigation into Russia’s alleged interference with the presidential election and now, remarkably, less than four weeks later, it would appear the investigation has been completed as he prepares to impose sanctions against Moscow.

Of interest too is Obama’s claim he knew about the Russian interference for months prior to the election.
