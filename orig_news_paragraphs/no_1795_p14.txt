The Clinton campaign has refused to verify the authenticity of the transcripts, which came from the hacked email account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman. The campaign has blamed the Russian government for the hack and WikiLeaks   —   whose founder, Julian Assange, is a critic of Mrs. Clinton   —   for releasing the emails in a coordinated effort to help Mr. Trump, a view echoed by the Obama administration.
