AZUZ:   The U. S. stock market said to be a bull market when investors feel good about it and buy stocks, causing prices to rise.   Itâ€™s one indicator of an improving U. S. economy.   A bull market can be triggered by an economy boom or an economy recovery, and the U. S. has been in that, an economic recovery, since the Great Recession dragged the market to its rock bottom on March 9th, 2009.
