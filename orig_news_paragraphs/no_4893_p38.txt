Republicans should always and everywhere push back against the false narrative that insurance lost under Obamacare doesn’t count because most of the losses were temporary, but only insurance that might be lost under repeal proposals counts, and all of those losses must be treated as permanent.   If that ridiculous argument isn’t killed during the Obamacare repeal debate, reformers will face a new version of it every time they attempt to scale back any government program. It’s a key element of the "progressive" strategy to ensure that ground seized by the State is never returned to the people.   Another aspect of that strategy is the notion that only benefits provided or subsidized by the government really count.
