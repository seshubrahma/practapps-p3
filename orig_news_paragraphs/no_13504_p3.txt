Political discourse should occur in this country without a threat of violence, without anger and rage and hatred directed at each other," he said in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, just north of downtown Chicago. He continued  Earlier today, over 30 people were arrested in one rally, and then tonight, as violence broke out, the rally was cancelled altogether. Now the responsibility for that lies with protestors who took violence into their own hands, but in any campaign, responsibility starts at the top. Any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign and when you have a campaign that disrespects the voters, when you have a campaign that affirmatively encourages violence, when you have a campaign that is facing allegations of physical violence against members of the press, you create an environment that only encourages this sort of nasty discourse.
