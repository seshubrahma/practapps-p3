Tony Lee: Frenchman Thomas Piketty (author of Capital in the 21st Century) gushes over Bernie’s candidacy: Sanders makes clear he wants to restore progressive taxation and a higher minimum wage ($15 an hour).

Meanwhile, the Republican party sinks into a     and   discourse (even though Islam isn’t a great religious force in the country) and a limitless glorification of the fortune amassed by rich white people.
