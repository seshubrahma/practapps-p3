" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said many of the politicians who have said they won’t attend have never participated in a convention and wouldn’t necessarily be expected to attend. Walters added that those up for   who won’t attend would rather spend time in their districts, "shaking hands of voters," rather than attending the party convention in Cleveland. Trump will still have a well of prominent supporters and party favorites to pull from, but the campaign is working to line up speakers    both political and   types    and Trump has been intimately involved in approving and nixing ideas for the convention, a source familiar with the planning told CNN.
