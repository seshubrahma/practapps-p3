Pennsylvania was seen as a "      lead" for Clinton â€”  especially worrisome since poll respondents thought she won the debate by a huge 57% % margin. " With neighboring Ohio leaning to Donald Trump, critical Pennsylvania stays true to Clinton who barely holds her ground from her   numbers," said assistant poll director Tim Malloy. It should be noted that all of these topline results included Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party, except for North Carolina, where Stein is not on the ballot.
