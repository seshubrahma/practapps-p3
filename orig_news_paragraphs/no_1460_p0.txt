WASHINGTON   —   Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union sent a shudder through the capital on Friday as the forces of economic nationalism and   fury forced American political leaders to wonder: Could it happen here? Driving the "Brexit" vote were many of the same impulses that have animated American politics in this turbulent election year: anger at distant elites, anxiety about a perceived loss of national sovereignty and, perhaps most of all, resentment toward migrants and refugees. These are the themes that Donald J. Trump harnessed during the Republican presidential primaries to explosive effect, and that he aims to wield to his advantage again in his race against Hillary Clinton.
