Following Donald Trumpâ€™s victory in the South Carolina GOP primary, talk radio host Glenn Beck urged his Facebook followers to join him and his family in fasting for GOP candidate Ted Cruz. ["I would like to ask you to join me and my family Monday in a fast for Ted Cruz, our country and the Nevada caucus," Beck wrote on his Facebook page after the South Carolina election results showed a decisive   victory for Trump, whose candidacy Beck has been staunchly opposed to.   In an earlier Facebook post, Beck stated: It was a fair fight. Congratulations Donald Trump on South Carolina.
