In 1992, Mr. Clinton denied Ms. Flowers â€™s claim of an affair, but years later, when asked in a deposition whether he had engaged in "sexual relations" with Ms. Flowers, he admitted having done so one time, in 1977. Ms. Flowers, in recently broadcast interviews, has accused Mrs. Clinton of being an "enabler" and has said the scandal is a relevant issue in 2016. Inviting Ms. Flowers would be risky for Mr. Trump, because he faces a potentially   gender gap with women, who might be troubled by such an aggressive and personal move.
