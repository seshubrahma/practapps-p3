Indeed, the Acosta Deep Mine in Somerset County, Pennsylvania promises up to 100 jobs and an operation that will create countless tons of metallurgical coal, the ingredient used to make coke, the building block to produce steel  —   a commodity that’s builds much of what America and the world uses, from buildings and bridges to technological devices. The mining will take place at this site over at least the next 15 years, revitalizing an area that was hard hit by the Obama energy policies. The miners will earn between $50, 000 and $100, 000 a year, according to the New York Post   —   a boon to an area where the median income is around $29, 000 a year.
