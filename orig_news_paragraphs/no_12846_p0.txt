Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump appealed to a core group of voters,   during his speech where he blasted presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s immigration policies on Wednesday, suggesting her policies disenfranchise minority workers. ["Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States," Trump stated on Wednesday morning, speaking from Trump SoHo in New York City. " She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States. "
