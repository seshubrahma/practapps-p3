He stressed that the Tomahawk strikes were conducted in self defense, were limited in nature and were approved by Obama after a recommendation from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.   The intent of the strikes was to deter further aggression against US assets in the region, Schultz said. It does not signal a greater US role in Yemenâ€™s civil war, nor will it distract from the mission against ISIS, he said.   Pentagon officials said that they have put more assets into the area for protection.
