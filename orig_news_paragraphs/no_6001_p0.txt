An en banc panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order curtailing travel and immigration from seven   countries Thursday. [The   majority, in a   opinion, affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in essence holding that even an executive order that makes no mention of Islam in its text can be invalidated for violating the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause because of comments Trump and his associates made during and after the 2016 presidential election.   Calling the Establishment Clause a "untiring sentinel for the protection of one of our most cherished founding principles," Chief Judge Roger Gregory’s opinion for the court calls the travel ban "an Executive Order that in text speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination. " "Congress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute," Gregory writes, discounting that the wide latitude given to the President under the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny entry to classes of travelers and immigrants on national security grounds justifies President Trump’s executive order.
