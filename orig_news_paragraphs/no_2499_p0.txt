WASHINGTON   —    Terry Branstad, the Iowa governor who has long embraced China as a market for his state’s pork and soybeans, was tapped Wednesday by   Donald J. Trump to represent the United States in one of its most complex and increasingly contentious foreign relationships, as his ambassador to China. In choosing Mr. Branstad, 70, an amiable politician who likes to describe President Xi Jinping of China as an "old friend," Mr. Trump sounded a softer note alongside his unrelenting criticism of China’s economic relationship with the United States.
