Voters may not trust Clinton, but if they’re afraid of a Trump presidency, it won’t matter.

He argues that she should make campaign finance reform the centerpiece of her campaign. Last year, Clinton committed to changing the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution in order to achieve campaign finance reform by reversing the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling, which recognized that corporations (and unions) have free speech and may speak about candidates in elections.
