The stakes are even higher when it comes to Cuban and Haitian migrants. When thousands of Cubans abandoned their homes, they expected to take advantage of   special immigration privileges extended to those who made it to US borders, the       rule.

Cuban migrants accumulating along American borders are pleading with President Trump to take them in as political refugees, as part of his pledge to take a   stance against Cubaâ€™s Communist government.
