Venezuelans recently gave a vote of no confidence in the government as part of a recall referendum, which was consequently crushed by Hugo Chavez’s chosen successor, and now dictator Nicolas Maduro. Tensions are rising across the country as people take to the streets to demand the government secede from power.
