Gorka also explained how he accidentally ended up at the airport with a handgun: On January 31, 2015 I was traveling by Defense Department official request to U. S. Special Operations Command to give a briefing on ISIS. On the way to Reagan National I grabbed the wrong bag, one I had just used at the range, which contained an unloaded handgun. I was not aware I had done this but of course it was picked up on the   machine by TSA.
