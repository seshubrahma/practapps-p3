—    The Trump administration has lifted federal     guidelines that said  students should     be allowed to use public school bathrooms and locker rooms     matching their chosen gender identity.   ’ ’      The Wednesday decision is a reversal of an   directive     issued in May. It will now be up to states and school districts     to interpret whether federal sex discrimination law applies to     gender identity.
