Admins of the lighthearted political page "Liberty Memes" have been suspended from Facebook and had images mocking Hillary Clinton deleted from their page. [The Facebook page, boasting over 100K likes, has had multiple images removed as they apparently don’t "follow the Facebook Community Standards". One of the most recent images removed was one that poked fun at Hillary Clinton and the recent recommendation by the FBI not to press charges following Clinton’s email scandal.    The image received approximately 10K likes, 50K shares and 4 million views before it was promptly removed from the page for violating community standards.
