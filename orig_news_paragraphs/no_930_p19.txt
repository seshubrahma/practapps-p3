Under the Republican plan, health insurers would be free to charge older people more, raising that person’s premium to $19, 500. But the tax credit would be only $4, 900, and that person’s share of the premium would then be $14, 600. House Republicans would allow insurers to sell health plans covering a smaller share of consumers’ medical costs, and   subsidies for   people would be repealed in 2020.
