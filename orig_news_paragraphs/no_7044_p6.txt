While the U. S. initially saw its interests achieved only with the removal of Assad from power, American officials later said they would accept his leadership if elected. This chemical attack against his people has more recently underscored the need to dethrone him. Today, we support "moderate" Muslim Sunni groups against Assad, which we may well find tomorrow are not so friendly. It must be kept in mind our interests are directly opposed by Iranâ€™s which, contrarily, lie in keeping Assad in power so as to continue with the expansion of the regional Shiite caliphate on which its mullahs remain focused.
