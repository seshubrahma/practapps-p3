Under the 2010 law, "at least we were on a path" to addressing coverage and access concerns, said Elly Kugler, the federal policy director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a coalition that represents home care providers. If it goes away, she said, itâ€™s not so clear how these workers will access health care. Currently, home care workers on average earn less than $20, 000 per year.
