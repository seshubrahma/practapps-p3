On Saturday, Somali refugee Dahir Adan attacked ten people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, before an   police officer shot and killed him. That same day Ahmad Kahn Rahami, an Afghan immigrant and likely refugee, allegedly planted bombs that detonated in New York City and New Jersey. Refugees may also pose a public health threat. In Michigan, as Breitbart News reported previously, nineteen refugees have been diagnosed with active tuberculosis over the past six years.
