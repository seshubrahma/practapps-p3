This hypocrisy is what has led so many Trump voters  —   groups who have in many cases not voted since the 1970s or 80s  —   to come out of the woodwork and stand up for their values and culture. The Establishment need to read their Haidt and realise that this group isn’t going away. There will be no "progress" that erases the natural affinities of conservatives. We can no longer pretend that divides over free trade and the minutiae of healthcare reform really represent both sides of the political spectrum in America.
