The Hill reported Wednesday that the Comey Memo was causing more GOPers to try and detach their legislative agenda from the president. McCain has been a proponent of the Russian   narrative, and a central figure in Senate hearings on the issue. He expressed his dismay over President Trump’s decision to dismiss Comey last week. The   senator and 2008 GOP nominee for president has been a pillar of   Republicans since shortly after Trump’s announcement in 2015 when the two became embroiled in a controversy over Trump’s comment on McCain’s time as a Vietnam POW.
