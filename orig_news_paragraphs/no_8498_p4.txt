The statement from Trumpâ€™s White House transition team reflected the same tone as the remarks in Xinhua. " During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and   Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward," the transition office said. Chinese state television reported that the two leaders agreed to meet "at an early date" in person.
