" Law enforcement officials say that not every   member is an undocumented immigrant, but that the gang recruits from a base of unaccompanied Central American minors who entered the country illegally. Since Sept. 13, the police in Suffolk County have arrested more than 90   members, with many in federal custody as officials gather evidence to charge them under organized crime law. The gang, also known as La Mara Salvatrucha, was responsible for the killings of 11 people in Suffolk County last year, the police said.
