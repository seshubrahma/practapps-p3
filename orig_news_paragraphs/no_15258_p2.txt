Conaway told House intelligence committee members Tuesday that they should plan on spending more time in Washington as the investigation gears up. It’s a complete reversal from just a few weeks ago, when the House Russia investigation was on life support    the victim of a partisan showdown sparked by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes’ clandestine trip to the White House which ended in his recusal from the investigation amid a House ethics probe. Nunes’ recusal, House Russia investigators said Wednesday, coincided with renewed access to intelligence documents that, they said, were denied to them during the three weeks that followed Nunes’ trip to the White House. The "reset"    as House members are calling the reinvigorated House investigation    started before lawmakers returned from their recess, with a request from Conaway that House Democrats cool their barrage of criticism in public that stemmed from Nunes’ maneuver with the White House.
