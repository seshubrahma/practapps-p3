Compare the promises made by Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders of massive new taxes that would weaken America’s competitiveness and cripple job creation with the promises made by Trump to bring jobs back to America and negotiate trade deals that actually make sense for our country, and you will know which candidate is actually capable of ensuring our country’s economic success. Compare the Democrats’ association with   BDS supporters and those who demonize our staunch ally Israel with Trump’s   support of Israel and his unwavering dedication to the one true democracy in the Middle East, and you will know which candidate will be a true friend to Israel. Let us choose wisely while the choice is still ours to make. We need Donald J. Trump.
