Some Hispanic students later claimed the chants "scared" them and on the day the chant erupted in the schoolâ€™s cafeteria, school officials even called police on the kids. Local news reports noted that the Royal Oak police department stationed officers outside the school on the day the chant rang out and for several days afterward. CNN deemed the video an example of "racism" and recently noted that the "collateral damage" from the video is growing. Many parents, for instance, are upset at the Hispanic student who took the cell phone video of the incident and posted it online, saying that the girl unfairly put their children at risk.
