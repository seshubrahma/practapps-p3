Pope Francis threw himself into the middle of an already overheated Republican presidential race when he questioned frontrunner Donald Trump’s Christian faith. [Pope Franics made it appear as if his unprecedented remarks were motivated simply by a concern over Trump’s goal of building a wall along the U. S.  border, but I have little doubt the pope’s broadside has less to do with whether or not there should be a border wall and more about pandering to Mexican Catholics.   In fact, the pope is taking on Trump to boost his own popularity with Mexican Catholics and also to divert attention away from long simmering questions about the Mexican church’s relationship with narco donations. Because the Catholic Church is struggling to stem defections among Mexican Catholics to Pentecostal Christian sects, the pope came prepared to demonstrate he was a friend of working class Mexicans.
