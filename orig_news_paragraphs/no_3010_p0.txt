A number of   officials appear to suggest that the Obama administration may have actually wiretapped the Trump campaign, but that if they did it would have been justified by a court and part of an investigation by the Justice Department —  not led by or ordered from the White House or the former president himself. [On Saturday, former President Obama’s spokesman Kevin Lewis denied that the former White House or the former President himself would have given such an order to wiretap Trump Tower —  or any other type of surveillance in any case —  but that such an order would have come from an "independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. "   " A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice," Lewis said.
