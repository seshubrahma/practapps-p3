Instead of pressuring the Palestinians to be a partner for peace, President Obama chose to break with long standing diplomatic practices and allowed the     United Nations to be used as a tool to bludgeon Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East. We applaud the efforts of Republican Senators, led by Senator Graham, to strip funding to the United Nations, which has time and again showed their   bias. What happened today will forever be on the heads of the President, his Party, and groups like J Street that remained silent. The passage of the resolution marks the Obama administration’s final stab in the back against Israel, on its way out the door and in defiance of the results of the November election, when voters chose Trump’s more assertive U. S. foreign policy.
