Likewise, in the New York Times, former U. S. ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer, who served under George W. Bush, complains that Friedman believes that  "Israel has a right to build settlements and annex parts of the West Bank. " As Kurtzer ought to know, Friedmanâ€™s position is close to past U. S. policy, as established by Bush (and, sadly, ignored by President Barack Obama.) As former Bush administration official Elliott Abrams recalled in 2009, Bush recognized in a 2004 letter to   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon that some Israeli settlements would remain part of Israel in a future peace agreement, and that there would be growth within existing settlements in the West Bank, among other provisions.
