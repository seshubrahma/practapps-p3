It is unclear when the president was informed of the attack, as he is currently on vacation in Hawaii. White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price issued a statement in response to the Berlin attacks while the president was golfing: The United States condemns in the strongest terms what appears to have been a terrorist attack on a Christmas Market in Berlin, Germany, which has killed and wounded dozens. We send our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those killed, just as we wish a speedy recovery to all of those wounded. We also extend our heartfelt condolences to the people and Government of Germany.
