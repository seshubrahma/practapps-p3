A judge who is pleased with every ruling he reaches, Judge Gorsuch added, "is probably a pretty bad judge, stretching for policy results he prefers rather than those the law compels. " Judge Gorsuch thanked Mr. Trump and did not mention the president’s attacks on the judiciary since taking office, leveled against judges who have ruled against the administration in its push to enact a travel ban from certain predominantly Muslim countries. He spoke generally of the hard and noble work of judges, perhaps signaling an indirect rebuttal to Mr. Trump’s comments, which he called "disheartening" during private meetings with senators last month.
