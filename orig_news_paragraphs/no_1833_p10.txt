â€¢ Australia will not legalize   marriage anytime soon. A bill that would have allowed for a plebiscite on the issue was shot down in Parliament over the $140 million cost and concerns that it would become a platform for hate speech. Polls show around 70 percent of Australians want marriage equality, and many supporters of legalization want action in Parliament, not a nonbinding plebiscite.
