Driven more by personal loyalty and a ravenous appetite to win than by any fixed political philosophy, the   president has been received warmly by some mainstream conservatives. At the same time, even ideological   who share the president’s pugilism but not his pragmatism have stuck by him because Mr. Trump has made the right enemies  —   and gleefully ridiculed them with public insults rarely heard from a president. These loyalties have upended the Tea    divide, which has dominated fratricidal primary seasons since 2010 but increasingly has the air of fins on the back of a car, a quaint relic from an earlier era. With Mr. Trump in charge, the political market for purity on the right has been devalued.
