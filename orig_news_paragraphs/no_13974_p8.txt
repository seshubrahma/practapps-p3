Spencer is a white nationalist who believes that there should be a "peaceful ethnic cleansing," where people who are not of European descent voluntarily leave the United States.   He says he briefly entertained a run for the US House seat from Montana expected to be open when Rep. Ryan Zinke is confirmed as Trump’s interior secretary. Spencer said he decided against it, although that doesn’t mean he has any intention of sitting things out. He said he is planning to purchase a house in Washington, where he plans to hold events and create a video production studio.
