As MIT Emeritus Professor Richard Lindzen has explained, the decline in storminess is a consequence of reduced temperature differentials between the tropics and   that arise when global average temperatures are warmer. Professor Reif wrote, "As the Pentagon describes it, climate change is a "threat multiplier" because its direct effects intensify other challenges, including mass migrations and   conflicts over existential resources like water and food. " Milder temperatures and increased CO2 levels green the planet, instead of browning it. Deserts are retreating, and vegetation cover has increased throughout recent decades.
