Mr. Johnson, a   operator known for his focus on building Starbucks’ mobile payments systems and executing the company’s global strategy, has been on a listening tour with employees over the last year.

The succession plan is the second time Mr. Schultz has sought to step back from overseeing the company. He became the company’s chairman in 2000 but returned as chief executive in 2008 after firing the installed chief, James Donald, as sales faltered.
