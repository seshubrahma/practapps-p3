On April 30, 2015, Judicial Watch sued Kerry after the State Department failed to take action on a letter sent to Kerry "notifying him of the unlawful removal of the Clinton emails and requesting that he initiate enforcement action pursuant to the [Federal Records Act]," including working through the attorney general to recover the emails. After initially being dismissed by the district court, Judicial Watchâ€™s lawsuit was revived on appeal by a decision of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on December 27, 2016. While at the State Department, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton conducted official government business using an unsecured email server and email accounts. Her top aides and advisers also used  "state. gov" email accounts to conduct official business.
