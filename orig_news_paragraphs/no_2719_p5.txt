Mr. Trump, who has claimed that global warming is a hoax, said this week in an interview with The New York Times that he now saw "some connectivity" between humans and climate change, and that he would "keep an open mind" about whether to pull out of the Paris climate accord, as he threatened to do during the campaign. Yet at the same time, some key positions on his transition team are occupied by people with a long history of rejecting the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. Other than climate change, there are numerous environmental issues that he has never talked about and that he might be content to leave untouched. And once agency heads are in place, they may choose very different tactics from those discussed during Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign or by his advisers.
