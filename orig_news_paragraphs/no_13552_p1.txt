Trump made the statement on Tuesday after news broke that healthcare premiums under Obamacare will increase more than 20 percent in 2017. ["Today’s admission by the Obama Administration that ObamaCare is an unaffordable disaster should come as a surprise to no one, and this only reaffirms the American public’s belief that the entire program was one big lie," Trump stated in a press release on Tuesday, adding:  Not only are they now willing to admit that health insurance premiums under ObamaCare are going to skyrocket by 25% they still aren’t telling us the truth! Rates are going to go up much higher, maybe as high as 80% or even 100% in some places due to the lack of competition.
