[sic] As a post on Foreign Policy in Focus reported: Bryan Hunt,   officer at the US consulate in Lahore, reported a string of troubling findings on his forays into southern Punjab, where he "was repeatedly told that a sophisticated jihadi recruitment network had been developed in the Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan Divisions. "  …     Saudi Arabia, home to the fundamentalist Wahhabi brand of Islam, is seen as funding some of Pakistan’s hardline religious seminaries, or madrassas, which churn out young men eager for holy war, posing a threat to the stability of the region. " At these madrassas, children are denied contact with the outside world and taught sectarian extremism, hatred for   and     government philosophy," said the cable. In that November 13th, 2008, cable, Bryan Hunt made the claim: Government and   sources claimed that financial support estimated at nearly 100 million USD annually was making its way to Deobandi and    clerics in the region from ""missionary"" and ""Islamic charitable"" organizations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ostensibly with the direct support of those governments.
