—   sent a letter to congressional leaders this week rejecting the House bill as written. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Thursday that she opposed the House bill, explaining that it would not do enough to help   older people afford insurance. " We don’t want to in any way sacrifice coverage for people who need it the most," she told The Portland Press Herald.
