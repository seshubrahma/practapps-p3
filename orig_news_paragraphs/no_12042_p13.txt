Bannon stood with the Jewish community in opposing the Iran nuclear agreement. which gives the world’s largest state sponsor of terror $150 billion with which to blow people up. Bannon stood with the Jewish community by fighting the BDS movement and the Israel haters, who ignore the gassing of Syrian children while trying to boycott tomatoes grown in Shiloh. For all my friends who are supporters of the foreign policy of President Obama: Where was your outrage when he wouldn’t even impose a   zone to stop Arab children from being gassed from the air?
