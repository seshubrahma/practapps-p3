Wednesday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Democratic strategist and Clinton ally James Carville offered his thoughts on the possibility of an election being rigged, as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and some of his supporters have suggested was a possibility.   Carville called such claims a a fundamental attack on the country. " This is a fundamental attack on the country itself the underpinning of it that somehow or another it’s rigged or it’s not fair," Carville said.
