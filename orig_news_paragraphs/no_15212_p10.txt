Convincing local populations and the international community that our actions are legitimate whereas terrorists’ actions are not is at the very heart of effective counterterrorism it is integral to sound policy, not simply a way of talking about it. Again, the Trump administration has privileged the use of violence over the explanation of why it is being used.   Media reports indicate that President Trump has provided expanded authorities for using force against terrorists in parts of Yemen and Somalia, resulting in an increase in the pace of US actions and of noncombatant casualties.   Without a public explanation of why these authorities have been granted and what their provision is intended to achieve, they become untethered from the real heart of the counterterrorism struggle: a contest for achieving legitimacy by restoring the state’s monopoly on the use of violence, under the rule of law.
