It is increasingly unlikely that Clinton can clinch the nomination by winning a majority of the pledged delegates won through state primaries and caucuses. She will need the full backing of the superdelegates, Democrat elected officials who cast individual votes for the nomination, to win her partyâ€™s nod. The   of this equation is that, a switch of superdelegates to Bernie Sanders would be enough to make him the nominee. In 2008, Hillary Clinton won more votes overall in Democrat contests than Barack Obama, but a swing of superdelegates padded his slim lead with pledged delegates and made him the nominee.
