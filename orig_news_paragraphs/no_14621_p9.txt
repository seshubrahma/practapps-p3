Last year Stewart even suggested that this Trump tweet was   saying, "I think this guy’s trying to let people know I’m a Jew."  That same year, Trump was so upset by Bill Maher’s joke that Trump was "the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan," that he sued the comedian for $5 million. (Trump later dropped the lawsuit.)    And Trump has gone after "Saturday Night Live" and Alec Baldwin numerous times in the last few months for the show’s comedic barbs at his expense. Trump even called for the cancellation of the iconic late night show that has skewered multiple presidents since it premiered in 1975.
