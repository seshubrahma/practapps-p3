Only 47 percent have an unfavorable view of Trump, while three percent are unsure. Ryan, meanwhile, has only 49 percent in his district who have a favorable view of him, while 44 percent have an unfavorable view and seven percent are unsure. That means more people in Paul Ryan’s own district like Donald Trump more than they like Paul Ryan.   If that news was not bad enough for Ryan, his own constituents are aligned against his Obamacare 2. 0 bill —  also called   Ryancare, or Obamacare Lite —  the American Health Care Act.
