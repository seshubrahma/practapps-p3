WASHINGTON, D. C.  —    Emerging from the Senate chambers on Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence said President Donald Trump "made the right decision at the right time" with Tuesday’s announcement that he has fired FBI Director James Comey. ["The administration is very confident that with the appointment of a new director of the FBI, [and] because of the president’s strong leadership, we’ll be able to give the nation’s leading law enforcement agency a fresh start," Pence told a handful of reporters in the nation’s Capitol.
