Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised as much as $100 million from   donors contributing $200 or less to his campaign  —   in less than three months. [Trump’s campaign has surpassed a "threshold no previous Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign," according to Politico, which looked over Federal Election Commission filings and spoke with operatives familiar with the campaign’s fundraising efforts.   John McCain and Mitt Romney raised less than $64 million each in small donations in 2008 and 2012. Barack Obama set the record in 2012 with $483.
