Pew Research Centerâ€™s estimate of around 3. 3 million. Pew says that number will climb past 8 million by 2050, when Muslims will become the   religious group in the United States, a surge driven by immigration, large families and the relative youth of American Muslims (their median age in 2010 was 23). Even in 2050, though, Muslims will only make up 2% of the US population.   Islam is the only American religion without a majority race or ethnic group.
