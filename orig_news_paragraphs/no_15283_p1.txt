So it was a bit surprising to hear him say in an interview Thursday night that he expects South Korea to reimburse the United States for the Terminal   Area Defense (THAAD) system we will soon be deploying to Seongju, a system that Trump said costs about a billion dollars.

But more broadly, he apparently doesn’t understand the contours of our alliance with South Korea or the importance of allies themselves.
