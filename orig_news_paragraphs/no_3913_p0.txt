A Berkeley student argues that free speech puts student safety at risk in an   for the Daily Californian this week. [Juniperangelica Xiomara   a   transgender transfer student at UC Berkeley, argues in an   for the Daily Californian this week that she will "not put down [her] lighter fuel" as long as speakers like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter are permitted to speak on campus.   " The concepts that America is great because of our ability to share perspectives and differing opinions, that UC Berkeley is beautiful because we can discuss and organize with opposite sides of the political spectrum   â€¦     are bullshit,"   argues, claiming instead that free speech sustains institutional structures of oppression.
