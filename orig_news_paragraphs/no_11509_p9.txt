According to NBC News, Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon said: "It is absurd that at a time when thousands are being massacred in Syria, the Security Council is devoting time and energy to convene and discuss condemning the only true democracy in the Middle East. " In the past, the U. S. has vetoed such resolutions at the Security Council, but the   Obama administration has suggested it will not do so, in a parting shot at the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu   —   and at Trump.
