Clapper, a retired Air Force intelligence officer who served under every president since John F. Kennedy, said there were a range of emotions he experienced when he left office last month.    "I think the overriding feeling I had at 12:01 a. m. on the 20th of January was a sense of relief," he said.    While he is "quite anxious" for Sen. Dan Coats to be confirmed to succeed him, Clapper said there is still a sense of apprehension that hangs over him.    "Well, I worry," he said.
