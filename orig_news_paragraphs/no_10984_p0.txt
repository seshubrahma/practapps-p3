Hillary Clinton’s "basket of deplorables" smear is a crucial political mistake says Frank Luntz, a GOP consultant long used by the establishment to pick words and messages that promote particular policies and candidates. ["You know, to just be grossly generalist, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables   …     the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it," Clinton said.   Shortly after Clinton’s comments flashed through social media, Luntz began posting a series of tweets criticizing her.   Hillary Clinton just insulted millions of   Americans simply because they don’t want to vote for her.
