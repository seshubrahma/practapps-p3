Thursday on Fox News Channel’s "Hannity," former House Speaker Newt Gingrich doubled down on a claim he had made earlier in the day regarding some in the GOP abandoning either of the leading two Republican presidential contenders, Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz ( ).   Gingrich warned that by not falling in line behind Trump or Cruz is effectively supporting Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton. " Let’s be honest, if you want to help elect Hillary Clinton, then help elect Hillary Clinton and a radical Supreme Court, but don’t give us any pious baloney that you’re gonna be for some virtuous middle way," he said.
