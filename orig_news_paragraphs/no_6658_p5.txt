The debate over female rabbis is a theological one, not for these pages. Suffice it to say that one of the main arguments against the female rabbinate is that its proponents do not wish to increase or enhance observance of the Jewish faith, but rather to denigrate it. Wise has made herself Exhibit A. She, and her group, are simply   activists  —   and, in this case, terrorist accomplices  —   who abuse Judaism as a cover to attack other Jews and the Jewish state. At best, it could be said that JVP is hypnotized by the supposedly authentic voice of the "other," and therefore give that voice a privileged status, no matter how warped the moral result.
