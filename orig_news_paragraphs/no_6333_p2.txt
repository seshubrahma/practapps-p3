Despite the news appearing widely in sports media the Warriors insist that no such decision to skip the White House visit has been made. According to the AP: The Warriors issued a statement Tuesday saying that "today is all about celebrating our championship" and that they have not received an invitation to the White House. The statement added the organization would make those decisions when and if necessary. Still, with the   sentiment coming from so many inside the team, it would not be much of a surprise if the offer to visit the White House was declined.
