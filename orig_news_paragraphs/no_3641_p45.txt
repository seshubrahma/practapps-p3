Surely we should be feeling guilty for all those fake news stories spread by evil   people on the internet in order to deceive the   by acting against their interests by voting for Brexit and Donald Trump? But no, far from apologising it seems that we on the right have been on the attack. If anyone is responsible for pumping out fake news these last few decades its the liberal elite and their mouthpieces in the MSM, not us. OK.
