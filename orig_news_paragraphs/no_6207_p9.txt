In August of 2015, Collins joined fellow Planned Parenthood Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski (AK) and  . Mark Kirk (IL) in legislation that would protect the abortion vendor, even though videos had recently been released alleging that Planned Parenthood profits from the sale of the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics. Collins said on the Senate floor that she was "sickened" by the videos and found "the callousness" of Planned Parenthood employees discussing the sale of body parts "appalling. " "We do, however, need to keep in mind the fact that Planned Parenthood provides important family planning, cancer screening, and basic preventive health care services to millions of women across the country," Collins nevertheless continued.
