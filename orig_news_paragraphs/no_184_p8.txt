When numerous women came forward last year to accuse Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct, Ms. Allred agreed to represent several of them, organizing news conferences where they could speak out. Ms. Allred said she had not had any communication with Mr. Trump or his lawyers about Ms. Zervos. Like other accusers, Ms. Zervos said she was inspired to share her story publicly after Mr. Trump was caught on tape bragging to the "Access Hollywood" host Billy Bush about sexually assaulting women, and then, in a presidential debate, denied ever engaging in such behavior. The lawsuit states that during the campaign, Mr. Trump described "Ms. Zervos’s experience, along with those of others, as ‘made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED’
