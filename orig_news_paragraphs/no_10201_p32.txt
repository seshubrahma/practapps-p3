Impoverishing a country by flooding its borders with unskilled workers is no way to help anyone. In my own life, I recognise that it’s all very well giving speeches to students at my own expense, but I won’t do my best work unless I first treat myself to some new Gucci loafers and a briefcase from Louis Vuitton. Pope Francis should realise that liberation theology is a mistake. It’s like an updated version of the Spanish Inquisition.
