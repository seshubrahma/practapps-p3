Rubio came in a distant third place in Iowa’s caucuses, an embarrassing fifth place in New Hampshire’s primaries, and is expected to come in third place or lower in this Saturday’s South Carolina primaries here. A new CNN poll out Wednesday shows Rubio in a distant second place in Nevada —  where he actually spent several years living as a kid and has spent an inordinate amount of time and resources campaigning —  to a commanding lead held by Donald Trump there. Cruz is nipping at Rubio’s heels in Nevada, too. Rubio’s campaign spokesman Alex Conant has not responded to a request for an explanation of why Sen. Rubio abandoned the nation’s defense infrastructure in 2015.
