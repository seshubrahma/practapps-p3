Maybe the   lesson to draw from Rove’s focus groups is that a substantial portion of the Republican electorate, and some Democrat crossover voters, are fed up with a polished Establishment that doesn’t work for them   —   indeed , it actively preys on them, while handing out lavish subsidies for such boondoggles as expensive electric sports cars   —   and they’re looking to hit back at that establishment.
