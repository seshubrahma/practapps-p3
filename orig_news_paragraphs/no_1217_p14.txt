" Mr. Reid, the retired Nevada senator, moved to curtail the filibuster in 2013 when he removed the   threshold to advance confirmations of federal judicial nominees and   appointments after Republicans repeatedly blocked President Barack Obama’s nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
