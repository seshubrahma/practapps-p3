 (CNN) Two years after the White House was adorned in rainbow colors to commemorate the Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing   marriage nationwide, gay rights activists and lawmakers are preparing to march on Washington again, saying the current President threatens to erase those gains. Gay rights activists plan to air their concerns at the "Equality March for Unity and Pride" in Washington on Sunday as well as at 50 sister marches at cities across the country this month. The march Sunday, which will commemorate the upcoming anniversary of the shooting deaths of 49 people and wounding of more than 50 others at gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, comes despite Trump’s promises during the campaign to be a "friend" to the gay community.
