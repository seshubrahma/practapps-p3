Across the nation, literally tens of millions of ballots are already in the mail and will be returned by mail, with the only security tool being signature verification. That verification is by an election judge who is given an average of three seconds to compare the signature accompanying the ballot to the one in an electronic record. In Billings, Montana, police are investigating reports of ballots being stolen from apartment mail boxes. In thousands of apartment buildings and nursing homes, millions of mailed ballots await   by their owners â€”   or by a  ballot harvester who will gladly vote the ballot or offer assistance in filling out the ballot and then delivering it to a polling place.
