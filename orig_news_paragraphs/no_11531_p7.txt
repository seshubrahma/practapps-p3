Reporter Reid recently did a segment about the local activists supporting the American girl who was raped by three refugee boys in early June. Reid’s story completely ignored the actual substance of the press conference that called on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to come to Twin Falls to see the impact of immigration to this local community themselves. Emails to TV station KMVT from Breitbart News about their biased reporting in that story have received no response. The bad publicity resulting from these crimes by Muslims is something that the town’s political leadership clearly wishes to avoid.
