Thanks to the efforts of groups like #CripTheVote and #RevUp from the American Association of People with Disabilities, the disability community has never been more organized.   Gregg Beratran, one of the founders of the #CripTheVote movement, told me, "I think that this has become an alarming trend. More and more we seem to see disability used as a means of disparaging people we disagree with. They all seem to think that their politics justify or outweigh the harm they do to the disability community."
