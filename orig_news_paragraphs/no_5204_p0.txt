The Philippines has threatened to protest the launch of a building project on the Scarborough Shoal, a land formation within the Philippines’ sovereign territory that also falls within China’s "  line," a territorial claim struck down by an international tribunal. [In a bizarre twist, however, the Chinese government denied any projects planned for the Scarborough Shoal and distanced itself from the   Hainan Daily newspaper report claiming otherwise.   That regional newspaper reported that Sansha City mayor Xiao Jie had announced new development projects in the Scarborough Shoal, including a new monitoring station. The Philippine Star notes that "Sansha" is a name typically used for a number of islands and shoals within Philippine and Vietnamese sovereign territory, including the Spratly Islands and the Scarborough Shoal.
