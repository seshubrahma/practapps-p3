Organizers said that some 20, 000 people had participated in the protests, which started from the Colosseum and wove through parts of downtown Rome, blocking traffic and shutting down public transportation. To mark the deaths of women killed by   and former partners, flags were flown at   in front of Italy’s lower house, Montecitorio. In Russia, where International Women’s Day is a   holdover that is sometimes called  St. Valentine’s Day, President Vladimir V. Putin lauded women, saying: "Even today, on International Women’s Day, you are still caught up in your routine, working tirelessly, always on time. We often ask ourselves: How do they manage it all?"
