Cruz is   to win over Trump voters, with some who don’t really like him willing to at least trust him more than Rubio. He’s done playing nice with Trump to woo his supporters, as demonstrated by his fiery Super Tuesday speech, but he didn’t get into the juvenile   that makes Trump supporters roll their eyes and dismiss Rubio as a desperate wannabe punk.   Cruz also has a better chance of winning the primary outright, especially if Rubio ends up losing his home state of Florida. Cruz is already hitting that point in the spin rooms, and making a "strong play for Florida" that could clip Rubio’s wings and ensure the defeat Cruz needs.
