But Pulitzer also engaged in the kind of sensationalism that led to the term "yellow journalism," a phrase inspired by the "Yellow Kid" comic strip that appeared in both Pulitzer’s newspaper and that of its chief rival, William Randolph Hearst’s New York Morning Journal. In one newspaper promotion, Pulitzer crowdfunded the money needed for a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty by offering to print on the front page the name of every person who donated to its construction. You may hear his name pronounced as   today. Pulitzer said his name as    and that’s what the Pulitzer Board follows.
