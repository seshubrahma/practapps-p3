Even lawyers and former senior officials who supported the interrogation program years ago now say the obstacles are too great. " Restarting this would be extraordinarily difficult," said John Rizzo, who served as the C. I. A. ’s top lawyer during much of President George W. Bush’s administration. Mr. Obama, in one of his first acts as president, issued an executive order banning many of the harshest interrogation techniques and prohibiting the C. I. A. from running secret prisons.
