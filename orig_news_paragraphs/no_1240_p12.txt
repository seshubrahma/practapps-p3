When GEF was created, he made the cut by completing a punishing survival course in which candidates endure jumping out of helicopters, protracted treks through the jungle, foraging for food, treating snakebites, going for long stretches without food and sleep, and training for gun battles and knife fights. " Obviously, this kind of work isn’t for everybody," said Eduardo Rafael de Souza, 39, a bearded,   military veteran who often pilots the helicopters used for GEF’s missions. The unit’s members returned in a closelipped mood to Santa Inês after the first day on patrol with nothing to show for their efforts after flying for hours over remote logging roads in search of deforestation crews.
