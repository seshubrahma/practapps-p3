Last year, Mr. McConnell led his party in refusing to consider President Obama’s choice for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland, during a presidential election campaign. On Thursday, Mr. McConnell accused Democrats of engaging in "obstructionist tactics" to block a   nominee. " Despite the judge’s outstanding performance, his exceptional background, and the extensive support he’s received from people of all political leanings, we know that some Senate Democrats will continue trying to come up with any reason to delay the confirmation process," Mr. McConnell said of Judge Gorsuch.
