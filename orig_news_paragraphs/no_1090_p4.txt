I was not willing to gamble with the care of my constituents with this huge unknown," said Representative Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey, a member of the centrist Tuesday Group caucus, noting that in three of the counties in his district in the state’s more conservative southern half, over 30 percent of all residents are covered by Medicaid. In the Senate, many Republicans, echoing their states’ governors, had worried about jeopardizing the treatment of people addicted to opioids, depriving the working poor, children and people with disabilities of health care and in the long run reducing funding for the care of elderly people in nursing homes. The Republican bill would have largely undone the expansion of Medicaid under the A. C. A. which added 11 million   adults to the program and guaranteed the federal government would cover almost all of their costs. It would have also ended the federal government’s   commitment to pay a significant share of states’ Medicaid costs, no matter how much enrollment or spending rose.
