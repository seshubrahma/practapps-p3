the BBC has consistently failed to do this in its woefully   treatment of environmental issues. Indeed, the BBC hasn’t just failed to remain impartial on the issue it has actively proselytised on behalf of the climate change scare lobby across a range of programmes from the hysterical reportage of its     Roger Harrabin on BBC Radio 4 news, to the doddery laments of its house Malthusian Sir David Attenborough, to the     of Chris Packham, to the rampant global warming alarmism promoted by its entire celebrity science team from Adam Rutherford (see above) to   pouty boy physicist Brian Cox and its     lefty comics Robin Ince and Daragh O’Briaiaiaan. All this would be absolutely totally fine if the BBC were a private subscription channel whose sole purpose was to reinforce the   prejudices of the liberal elite. But it’s not.
