Li Keqiang, China’s premier, called on Sunday for economic growth this year of "around 6. 5 percent or higher, if possible," slightly more modest than last year’s target of 6. 5 to 7 percent. Actual growth last year, according to official data, was 6. 7 percent. Even with the slight drop in projected growth, many economists argue that China’s annual target remains too ambitious and is adding to its   problems. But Mr. Li defended the target.
