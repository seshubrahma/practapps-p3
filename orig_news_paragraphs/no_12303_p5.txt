Rickers is a lifelong Democrat and voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary in Virginia, and, like many other Trumpocrats, has not supported a Republican until Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee and Trump offered such disaffected Democrats a way out of their party. The PAC is leading efforts in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and others to free Democrats from the Democratic Party under Clinton and to encourage them to vote for Trump for president. In addition to calling out Hillary Clinton for her "deplorables" comment —  for which she has still not apologized, only saying she "regrets" saying it about half of Trump’s supporters, while declining to specify exactly how many Americans she thinks are "deplorables" —   Rickers’ team has also released a video going after her husband, former President Bill Clinton, for attacking the "coal people" across America.
