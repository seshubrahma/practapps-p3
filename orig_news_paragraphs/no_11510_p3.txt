Given Trump’s tendency to generally underperform his polling, and the   advantages that Kasich has as the state’s governor, a tight race for Ohio’s delegates is to be expected. Kasich’s standing in the Ohio contest is helped considerably by the fact that 79 percent of Republicans in the state approve of his job performance. This is allowing him to cut into voter groups that normally support Trump by large numbers. Kasich leads Trump among women by 10 points, but he also edges him among men by one point.
