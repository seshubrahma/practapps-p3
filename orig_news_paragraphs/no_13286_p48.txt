Disraeli described English workingmen as "angels in marble. " That is, they were natural Tories, in terms of basic attitude so just as a sculptor, confronting a block of solid rock, chisels away everything thatâ€™s not an angelic form, so, too, would One Nation Tories carve out new voters from the lower levels of English society. In no sense was Disraeli a redistributionist leftist.
