In a statement about the ESSA, Cruz said: The Every Student Succeeds Act unfortunately continues to propagate the large and   role of the federal government in our education system —  the same federal government that sold us failed   standards like Common Core. We should be empowering parents and local school districts instead of perpetuating the same tired approach that continues to fail our nation’s children. In many ways, the conference report was worse than the original Senate bill —  removing the few good provisions from the House bill that would have allowed some Title I portability for   students as well as a parental   from onerous federal accountability standards. The American people expect the Republican majority to do better.
