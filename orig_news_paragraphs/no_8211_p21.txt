It’s ironic and ridiculous that Huffman and his bosses in the environmental movement are always quick to drone on and on about conservation, and that ‘farmers need to be more efficient. ’   Yet when they demand 90, 000   of water be released for salmon on the Trinity River, or that the people of the state of California get starved of water for some smelt, all of a sudden they forget what the word ‘waste’ means. Billions of gallons flushed to the ocean to protect fish, while kids soccer fields’ go dry up and down the state, and the fish are no better off for it.
