It’s a familiar sentiment for the xx, an English band known for   introspection and dialogues of estrangement sung by Mr. Sim and Romy Madley Croft. But now the band is visible by daylight, and they even smile now and then. The video clip for "On Hold" is set under the cloudless blue skies of Marfa, Tex. the town known for Donald Judd’s Chinati Foundation, a Minimalist monument.
