While North Korea has yet to carry out that nuclear test, it did launch a   missile that achieved an altitude of more than 2, 100 kilometers (1, 300 miles) on Sunday, according to the North Koreans, the highest launch to date in their missile test program. Pyongyang said the test was "aimed at verifying the tactical and technological specifications of the newly developed ballistic rocket capable of carrying a   heavy nuclear warhead," according to the   Korean Central News Agency. After the test, North Korea warned the United States not to provoke it, saying the "US mainland and Pacific operations" are within range of North Korean missiles. KCNA said the test showed North Korea "has all powerful means for retaliatory strike" should Washington take any military action to stop its nuclear weapons program.
