This is a mistake. Getting tough on China on everything at once isn’t going to induce Beijing to cooperate or make difficult concessions. A purely muscular approach, if this comes to pass, will make Beijing a more truculent partner for Washington across the board. The consequences will be negative for   relations globally    making it harder for the two powers to work together on issues of mutual interest, such as crisis management and environmental protection, while deepening friction in major areas of disagreement, like Asia’s future strategic order.
