My son is an infantry officer who takes control of his first platoon Monday so these are issues that matter to me personally," Kaine told a crowd of about a dozen veterans at the Culpeper VFW Post 2524 back in 2014. A Kaine aide told reporters Saturday that the Virginia senator’s son is deploying to Europe on Monday. On stage at a campaign event with Hillary Clinton Saturday, Kaine said his son was helping "to uphold America’s commitment to our NATO ally," a thinly veiled swipe at Donald Trump, who has spoken of diminishing US commitment to the longtime European alliance. While none of the four candidates on the ballot in November have military experience, making this the second election in a row with no veterans on a major party ticket, candidates with children in the armed forces has become a recent trend.
