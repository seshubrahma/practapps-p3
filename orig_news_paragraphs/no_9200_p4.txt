In most cases, these delegates will be bound to support a particular candidate on the first ballot at the convention, but could otherwise be free to support any candidate on subesquent votes for the nomination. As a result of the Nevada caucus, Donald Trump won 14 delegates, Marco Rubio seven, Ted Cruz six, Ben Carson two and John Kasich one. The delegate votes for Rubio and Carson are currently up for grabs, according to Nevada law. All remaining candidates are able to compete for these nine votes for support on a first ballot at the convention.
