Like Jackson, Trump is reflexively dismissive of overly detailed policy positions, which to populists are but smoke signals to the tribe that dissipate into thin air once the candidate is elected. Bernie Sanders is currently the tribesman most obviously consumed with sending up signals to call the progressive tribe together. But it is the     Hillary and the ideologically zealous who are the most devious tribalists in this race. Populist nationalists wisely dismiss their smoke signals as political inventions that have no relationship to the reality of governing.
