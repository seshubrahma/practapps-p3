PolitiFact, a website devoted to checking the veracity of claims by public officials, published 12 "of the most misleading claims" Mr. Trump made during his first White House interview. The Chicago Tribune found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he claimed two people were shot and killed in Chicago the very hour President Barack Obama was there delivering his farewell address. (There were no shootings, police records showed.)
