In 1952, the Eisenhower forces unseated Taft delegates from Texas in a celebrated credentials fight, handing Ike the nomination. They did so by challenging irregularities in the way the delegates were elected. There are currently over 600 reports in at least six counties, including Dallas County and Travis County, of voter fraud in Texas. In virtually every case, votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Senator Marco Rubio.
