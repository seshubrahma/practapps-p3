One close US ally had to reach out to multiple contacts in the Trump world before successfully arranging a phone call between the   and their head of state, a diplomatic source told CNN. The call finally took place a full day after his victory and after Trump had spoken to other leaders.   This diplomatic source said the delay did not spark anger as much as confusion as to how to establish contact with the incoming president. The State Department has not heard from the transition to coordinate at all, State Department spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday.
