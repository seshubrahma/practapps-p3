  Donald Trump is establishing a Strategic and Policy Forum, which will meet with him for the first time at the White House in February, to share ideas with Trump as he "implements his plan to bring back jobs," according to Trump’s transition team. [The Forum will be comprised of many business leaders, but at least three of the 16 members have a history of supporting the importation of foreign workers.   For example, Disney’s CEO Bob Iger oversaw the firing and replacement of hundreds of American workers in late 2014. Iger had been a Hillary Clinton supporter during the 2016 election and even hosted a Hollywood fundraiser for Clinton in August at a billionaire’s gated home in Beverly Hills.
