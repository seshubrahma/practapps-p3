Treadstone, a social media strategist, recently came out in support of Trump, despite working at America’s most liberal media company. He is not thought to be taking the implied threats seriously, but in an interview with Breitbart this weekend, Treadstone pointed to the   rhetoric the political Left often deploys, referring specifically to recent protests at the Republican frontrunners’ rallies, where police cars have been destroyed and Trump supporters beaten. i am friends with people of all political views, these (emotional) children can’t handle a different opinion these days. sad!
