Disaster in Colombia: The death toll is more than 230 and still rising from a devastating mudslide that struck the southwest city of Mocoa, near the border with Ecuador. Heavy rains had caused a river to overflow, creating a giant wall of water carrying tons of mud and debris that crashed through the town in the middle of the night. President Juan Manuel Santos delared a state of emergency and said "the entire capacity of the state" was focused on search and rescue.
