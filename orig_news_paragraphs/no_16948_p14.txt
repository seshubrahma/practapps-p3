Reality Check: Trump justices would overrule Roe v. Wade ’automatically’ By Steve Vladeck, CNN, Trump’s claim that the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade would be overruled by justices he would appoint to the Supreme Court "automatically" is belied by history. Although Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush appointed justices who they believed would overrule the 1973 decision recognizing a woman’s constitutional right to choose an abortion, three of those appointees    Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter    famously voted to preserve the Roe decision in 1992.
