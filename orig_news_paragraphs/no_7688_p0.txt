  Donald Trump has added three top level executives to his administration as advisors on economic affairs, including SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk as well as the CEO’s of PepsiCo and Uber. [In a press release on Wednesday, the Trump transition team confirmed that Musk, who previously said Donald Trump "was not the right guy" for the presidency, as well as Uber and Pepsi CEO’s Travis Kalanick and Indra Nooyi, will join the Trump administration to advise on economic issues.   The appointments are the first signs that the Trump administration is mending ties with Silicon Valley, who apart from PayPal   Peter Thiel, overwhelmingly opposed his candidacy for the presidency.
