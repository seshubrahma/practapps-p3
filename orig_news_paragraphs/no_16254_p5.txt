Earlier on Monday, the FBI confirmed it was investigating a hack into the DNC, the first acknowledgment from the agency that they are probing the incident, which U. S. officials suspect came from a Russian cyber attack.   Fallout over the emails led DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to announce her resignation Sunday.   " The FBI is investigating a cyber intrusion involving the DNC and are working to determine the nature and scope of the matter," the agency said in a statement.
