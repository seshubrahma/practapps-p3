We don’t want   roving our streets, we’re getting rid of them by the thousands, they’re going to be out of here. But I’m proud to tell you that the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety, and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come. Thank you very much. You’re going to love the end result.
