If he had still been at third base, he likely would have been the first target of the gunman because he would have been within about 20 to 30 feet of where the gunman was shooting through the fence.    We had Chuck Fleischman, he was around the batting cage with me Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Jeff Flake, they were both in and around home plate. Jeff might have gone to left center field to shag some fly balls that we hit out there during the batting practice.    At second base, of course, was Steve Scalise, where he was shot.
