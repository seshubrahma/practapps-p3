Harvard Law School emeritus professor, liberal Democrat, and noted defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz has penned an   in the Hill opposing the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the investigation into possible ties between President Donald Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. [Dershowitz makes a   case against the special counsel. First, he says, the Trump campaign is not facing criminal accusations. Second, he says, even if collusion were to be found between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, or if Trump were found to have divulged secrets to the Russian foreign minister, none of that would be illegal, and ought to be punished by voters, not prosecutors.
