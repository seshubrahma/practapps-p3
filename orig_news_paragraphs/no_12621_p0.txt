On Tuesday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow asked veteran pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell about the CNN poll that shows a   swing toward Donald Trump, putting him two points ahead of Hillary Clinton nationwide. [Caddell anticipated "panic" at what Marlow dubbed "Clinton News Network headquarters. "   He noted that polling averages, such as the one maintained by RealClearPolitics, showed Clinton’s lead slipping from an   high to about 2. 4, a movement he attributed to fading negative influence from Trump’s "disastrous August   period. " "All the polls since late last week have shown her lead at two points or less, or Trump ahead, or tied, except for the NBC Monkey poll, which it’s four points in the   race," Caddell observed, coining an amusing nickname for the poll conducted by NBC News and Survey Monkey.
