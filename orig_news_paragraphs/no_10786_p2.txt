With voting just 8 months away, The Wall Street Journal reports that Bloomberg could probably compete in only 21 states. The polling, however, is a bit suspect. According to the numbers, Bloomberg would sap 10 points from Sanders and 4 points from Trump, and yet Sanders would still win by 10 points. That means that without Bloomberg, Sanders would beat Trump 53% to 37% which is way outside polling averages where Sanders beats Trump by 8 points, not 16 points.
