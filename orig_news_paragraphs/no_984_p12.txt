William J. Perry, who was secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton, argued on Friday that it was no longer realistic to expect North Korea to commit to dismantling or surrendering its nuclear arsenal. The Trump administration, he said, should instead focus on persuading the North to commit to a   freeze in which it suspends testing of nuclear weapons and   missiles and pledges not to sell or transfer any of its nuclear technology. " I see very little prospect of a collapse," he added.
