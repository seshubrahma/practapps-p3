Similarly, after a surge of criminal prosecutions against people who leaked secret information to the news media and bipartisan outrage at aggressive investigative tactics targeting journalists, the Obama Justice Department issued new guidelines for leak investigations intended to make it harder for investigators to subpoena reportersâ€™ testimony or phone records. It also decided not to force a reporter for The New York Times to testify in a leak trial or face prison for contempt. But the Obama administration also successfully fought in court to establish that the First Amendment offers no protection to journalists whom the executive branch chooses to subpoena to testify against confidential sources. Mr. Trump, who has proposed changing libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations, could abandon the   internal restraints and invoke the   court precedent to adopt more aggressive policies in leak investigations.
