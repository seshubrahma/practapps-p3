We are shunning God, and now openly mocking Him. We have chased Him from our public spaces and conversations, His laws are not recognized anymore in most of our courtrooms, schools, businessâ€™ nor our homes and not only can we as a people not name the basic ten laws of God, we break them as individuals and as a nation on a regular basis. We have become lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without   brutal, and haters of good. We wonder why our nation is in trouble.
