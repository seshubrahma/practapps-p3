HOUSTON, Texas  —   GOP frontrunner Donald Trump won three of the first four states during the GOP primary election cycle without securing a single endorsement from a sitting governor or member of Congress, something experts say is "significant" and "unusual. "["The most recent ‘outsider’ who scored high in public surveys was Ross Perot. But he ran as an independent, and he quit and then reentered the race, so a comparison to Donald Trump is far from perfect," the Director at the Hobby Center for Public Policy, Jim Granato, explained to Breitbart News when asked if it is a rare occurrence for a candidate to be successful without endorsements from key sitting politicians.
