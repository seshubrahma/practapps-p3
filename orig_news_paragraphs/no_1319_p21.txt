Homeless people must leave Grand Central and the bus terminal around midnight when the stations close for several hours. Penn Station is open 24 hours, but many homeless people there said they were not allowed to sleep on the floor or on benches overnight. The solution for many is to hop on a subway train, said Caryll Corlear, 48, a homeless man who called Penn Station "the nicest pit stop in the city. "
