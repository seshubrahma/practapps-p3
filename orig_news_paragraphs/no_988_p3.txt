Jonathan   Tran, 26, of Milpitas, Calif. breached the outer perimeter of the White House by the Treasury Department building while carrying a backpack holding two cans of pepper spray, a book by Mr. Trump, a letter to the president and other items, the authorities said. After an officer ultimately detained him, Mr. Tran  —   who appears to have a history of mental illness   —   said, "I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment," according to a court filing.
