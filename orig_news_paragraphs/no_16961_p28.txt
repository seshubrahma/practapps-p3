Schumer, who has spent decades steadily climbing the ranks on Capitol Hill, is set to take over the helm of the Senate Democrats replacing Harry Reid, who is retiring. The only question is whether Democrats pick up enough seats to make him majority leader    a very powerful post     or minority leader if they fall short. Kentucky, Rand Paul went to great lengths to preserve his ability to run to keep his Senate seat at the same time he was making an ultimately unsuccessful run for the White House.    Paul is expected to be   to the chamber, where he will join former presidential rivals Ted Cruz,   and, possibly, Marco Rubio,   if he wins Tuesday.
