Senator Cruz’s defense of Sessions puts the Democratic party’s pernicious past in the national spotlight. Cruz accused Democrats of imposing "Jim Crow" laws. Every former Confederate state (including Kentucky, Kansas, Wyoming, Missouri, Ohio, Utah, and Oklahoma) had enacted Jim Crow laws, which prohibited everything from interracial marriage to racially integrated public school systems. While Democrats lost the war to keep blacks in slavery, Jim Crow laws in states in the   "Solid South" served to place blacks back on a virtual plantation.
