WASHINGTON   —    The Justice Department said in a brief filed on Monday that it would continue to defend President Trump’s targeted travel ban in the federal appeals court in San Francisco, which on Thursday refused to reinstate it. The department did not say whether it would try to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court.
