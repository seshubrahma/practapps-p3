The developments came the same hour the New York Times reported that two White House officials played a role in providing Nunes the intelligence he received at the White House last week, a report Spicer would neither confirm nor deny Thursday. Schiff said he wants to know why the materials appeared to be "laundered" through Nunes if they originated at the White House and expressed "deep concern" in a letter to the White House that the materials were being made the same day the Times story broke. " If that was designed to hide the origin of the materials, that raises profound questions about just what the White House is doing that need to be answered," Schiff said.
