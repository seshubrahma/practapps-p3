Ballistic missiles, The Korean Peninsula remains divided and technically at war despite an armistice that ended hostilities between the forces of the communist   North and     South in 1953. Relations remain tense. North Korea tested four ballistic missiles last week, which experts say was almost certainly in reaction to joint military exercises between South Korea and the US. The next day, Seoul said the first pieces of the   Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)    a defensive missile system opposed by China    had arrived in South Korea.
