If Sessions was a mostly lonely figure on the   fringe of previous immigration debates, he is now at the fractious center of the most virulent debate on immigration the country has seen in decades, with Hispanic immigrants, Syrian refugees, and even foreign doctors, engineers, and Ph. Ds among those coming under withering scorn. Sessions hasn’t budged rather the GOP has come to him. Sessions has spent most of his tenure in the Senate trying to limit even some legal forms of immigration to the United States, railing against many moderate Republican or   efforts to soften the GOP’s record with Latino voters as the party desperately grappled to expand its base.
