Maybe the network just doesn’t believe it’s going to be very good. The move to Friday does make at least a little bit of sense for Once Upon a Time after a stellar first four seasons and a modest drop in Season 5 (and after the departure of most of its core cast members) the sixth season of the fantasy drama averaged just 3. 2 million viewers and a 0. 94 in the key demo, down 28. 3 percent and 31. 6 percent, respectively. Then again, the network just renewed Once for a total reboot in its seventh season.
