The company also stated that they had made great progress with Twitter features on the platform such as the "Home Timeline. " "We also improved the relevance of notifications to increase engagement and bring people back to Twitter. These changes improved retention for both monthly active and daily active usage, as well as increased Tweet impressions and time spent on the service," the company stated. It is believed by some that President Trumpâ€™s tweets may have a large effect on the platform in both positive and negative capacities.
