Another government incentive that Elon Musk benefits from is the Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) tax credit. This policy allows people who purchase   in vehicles to deduct $7, 500 from their federal taxes. This credit phases out after any manufacturer sells 20, 000 qualified vehicles. The only automaker even coming close to this 20, 000 threshold is Tesla and Elon Musk.
