So far, there have been more than 30 airstrikes in the first two months of Trumpâ€™s presidency. Davis said all the targets had been developed before the January raid. In his remaining year, President Obama had ramped up airstrikes in Yemen. He also authorized a December 2014 raid that killed two journalists, an American and a South African.
