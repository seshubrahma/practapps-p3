And Rep. Heck is running for Senate this cycle. So for me and countless other Nevadans, the stakes couldn’t be higher.

While I can’t vote in this election, I will dedicate everything I can to making sure the victories we’ve won are protected and that Republican politicians and candidates threatening the immigrant community are held accountable in November and beyond.
