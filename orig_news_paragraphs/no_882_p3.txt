Unions, student organizations and feminist associations were calling for women to start striking at 3:40 p. m.   â€”   symbolically the time of day when Frenchwomen stop being paid, they argue, because of an average 26 percent pay gap with men. With the coming presidential election, the protest organizers unveiled a list of 20 demands, including salary increases, less temporary work and better enforcement of penalties for companies that discriminate against women, including when they are pregnant. In Buenos Aires, small groups of women began taking to the street at noon in preparation for a march later in the afternoon.
