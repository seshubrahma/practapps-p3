Ten days into his tenure as United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara saw his political and prosecutorial worlds collide. He convened a meeting to discuss a sensitive investigation of a  Democratic donor with ties to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. Mr. Bharara had been Mr. Schumerâ€™s chief counsel, and Mr. Schumer had recommended Mr. Bharara for the prosecutorial post. At the meeting, Mr. Bharara asked his prosecutors if there was enough evidence to make a case against the donor, Hassan Nemazee.
