An analysis of voting patterns by The Upshot shows that Mr. Obama did even better in 2012 than previously thought in the mostly white counties around Cincinnati. In Butler, Warren and Clermont Counties, the analysis showed, Mr. Obama improved upon the performance of John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate. The focus on independents and suburban women, and the message from the president on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, are likely to shift as Election Day draws closer. In October, Mr. Obama could be expected to fly Air Force One into places where he can energize turnout among core Democratic supporters.
