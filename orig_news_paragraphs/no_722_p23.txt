Mr. Kerlikowske said Mexican federal police officers were stationed in Tucson and in Laredo, Tex. where they assist American law enforcement in identifying drug cartels and human smugglers by sharing information in Mexican criminal history databases. Likewise, American Customs and Border Protection officers are assigned to a joint program in Mexico City, where they share information on possible drug traffickers through the use of American law enforcement databases. In 2015, joint operations between the Border Patrol and Mexican law enforcement led to the discovery of 30 drug tunnels and about 80, 000 pounds of drugs. Whether policing the southern American border to prevent unwanted migrants from entering the United States or examining passenger manifests to ensure   suspects cannot enter through Mexico, the authorities here have been a critical component of Americaâ€™s national security strategy.
