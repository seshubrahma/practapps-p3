Trump often levies   on those who criticize him, but his denigration of Representative John Lewis on the Martin Luther King holiday weekend sends a message that he intends to fulfill promises to his white voters to try and reverse the course of racial emancipation.    "Be courageous or be complicit," Representative Cedric Richmond recently stated in his testimony against Senator Jeff Sessions. The Trump administration promises to test that wisdom.   Each of us can stand our ground in our own way, but the lessons that come to us from a century of authoritarian rule around the world    and the civil rights movement in America    meet up in one phrase: Do not lose hope.
