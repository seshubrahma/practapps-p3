Last year, the U. S. State Department noted that the South American country remains a "permissive environment" that promotes ideological and financial support for terrorist organizations, namely Hezbollah and ISIS. Investigations citing Venezuelan embassy workers in Baghdad revealed that Venezuelan officials have sold hundreds of passports to various individuals, including members of the Iranian terrorist proxy Hezbollah. Courtesy of the passports, Hezbollah militants are allegedly "moving freely" inside the United States and Latin America, using their Venezuelan documents. The U. S. military, American lawmakers, and various experts, including think tank experts, have warned about the growing influence of Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere where Iran has established a power base.
