Disney’s animated smash hit Zootopia ruled the box office for a second consecutive weekend this week while the thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane performed solidly and Sacha Baron Cohen’s raunchy The Brothers Grimsby tanked in its first weekend of release.   Zootopia, which earned a sterling A CinemaScore, hauled in an estimated $50 million over the weekend to bring its worldwide cume to more than $430 million.
