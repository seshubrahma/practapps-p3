Pa. The recent string of attacks Mr. Trump has unleashed, particularly his criticism of the family of a Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, left Mr. Kinney disappointed. Faced with the choice of voting for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kinney said he may just stay home. Two national polls conducted this month have Mrs. Clinton catching up to Mr. Trump among men over all. An NBC   Street Journal poll shows Mrs. Clinton with 43 percent support among men to his 42 percent.
