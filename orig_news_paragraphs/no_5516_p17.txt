However, the Times does not specify exactly what the FBI suspected Page was doing, or even why his speech drew FBI attention. The Times reported: That trip last July was a catalyst for the F. B. I. investigation into connections between Russia and President Trump’s campaign, according to current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials. It is unclear exactly what about Mr. Page’s visit drew the F. B.
