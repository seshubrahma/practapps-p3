Speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said the country had again been traumatized by grievous violence, which shattered more than 100 lives during a   nightmare early Sunday, with 50 people killed and 53 wounded in the attack. During his presidency, Mr. Obama has repeatedly mourned victims of mass shootings, often expressing anger and frustration at what he has said is the country’s apparent willingness to let them become a "normal" part of life. That anger has been compounded by Mr. Obama ’s inability to persuade lawmakers to impose new restrictions on the availability of firearms, especially the   rifles like the one believed to have been used by the gunman in Sunday morning’s attack in Orlando.
