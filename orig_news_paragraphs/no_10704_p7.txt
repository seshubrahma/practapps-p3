Trump’s appeal to evangelical Christians is not because he is one of them. As a mainline Presbyterian, he doesn’t fit the definition of an evangelical Christian —   someone who is born again in Christ (conversionism) has a personal relationship with Jesus who died for our sins (crucicentrism) believes the Bible is the inerrant word of God (Biblicism) and has a duty to spread the good news of Jesus to   (activism). Instead, it is based on their belief that he is a man of conviction, and will honor his word when it comes to his promises to build a wall and secure the borders.
