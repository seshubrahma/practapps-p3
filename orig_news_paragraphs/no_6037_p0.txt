Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg is suing hundreds of native Hawaiians in an attempt to force them to sell plots of land that they have owned for centuries located around Zuckerberg’s 700 acre estate. [Zuckerberg’s estate situated in Kauai is worth over $100 million, but a few small plots of land situated on the property belong to Hawaiian citizens who received the land due to legislation called the Kuleana Act which was introduced after Hawaii’s 1848 Great Mahele, a land redistribution decision that enabled private ownership of land by Hawaiian citizens.   What this means is that the Hawaiian citizens that own the land are free to walk through Zuckerberg’s estate. This has led to Zuckerberg choosing to sue the landowners in an attempt to force them to sell their property.
