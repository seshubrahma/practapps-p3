With Thanksgiving approaching, the transition team is putting the last touches on   Donald J. Trump’s national security leadership even as Mr. Trump pivots to his domestic and economic policy cabinet posts. One visitor to Trump Tower on Monday is of note: a Democrat, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Another, Secretary of State Kris Kobach of Kansas, let the world see part of his plans for the Department of Homeland Security.    Trump has yet to hold a news conference, but he did release what aides said should suffice for now, a video news  release on his immediate plans: Scrap the   Partnership trade deal with 11 other Pacific Rim countries, junk President Obama’s environmental regulations to boost production of coal and natural gas and ban administration officials from lobbying for five years, among other items.
