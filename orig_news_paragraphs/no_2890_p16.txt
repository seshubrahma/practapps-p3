The issue Mrs. May took with Mr. Kerry’s remarks was not about the legality of the Israeli settlements. The British government voted in favor of the Security Council resolution because, like other European members of the Council, Britain has long considered settlements beyond the 1967 armistice lines to be illegal. " But we are also clear that the settlements are far from the only problem in this conflict," Mrs. May’s spokesman said.
