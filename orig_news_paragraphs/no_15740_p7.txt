The first time I watched the NBC television show "The West Wing," for example, I found myself rooting for and simultaneously embarrassed by the characters Donna Moss, Amy Gardner, and CJ Cregg. These women came through when their male bosses dropped the ball, and did the emotional labor their male colleagues did n’t know how to do, and yet always had an air of being less driven, less professional, and, as a result, less credible.   Creator and executive producer Aaron Sorkin’s chronic inability to intelligently write female characters has plagued him over and over again, and yet, he really doesn’t have much of an incentive to stop doing it because, well, everyone else does it, too.
