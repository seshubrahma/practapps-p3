Those deals were known as "horizontal integration" because similar businesses merged. ATT’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner, however, is considered "vertical" because the two companies largely do not compete against each other but operate on the same supply chain. Still, regulators may look at other ways ATT could affect the media ecosystem if the deal is completed. ATT could make it more expensive for its competitors to gain access to Time Warner’s content or give preferential treatment to its own programming, said John Bergmayer, senior counsel at Public Knowledge, a digital rights advocacy group.
