â€”   David Leonhardt (@DLeonhardt) March 2, 2016, For Democrats, Socialist Bernie Sanders took the   state handily, beating Hillary Clinton by upwards to 20 percentage points. Still, for whatever party they supported, Minnesotans were excited to vote. Reports from all across Minnesota attested to a huge turnout for voters, so many that several caucuses ran out of ballots and began Xeroxing them or writing them down on blank, loose paper.
