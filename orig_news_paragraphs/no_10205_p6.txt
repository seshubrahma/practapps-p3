West has referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a "war criminal," and, in the same speech, to President Obama as one as well. What does it say about the state of a Democratic Party if the drafters of its national platform consider its   for the past eight years a war criminal? For his part, Zogby, one of the leading advocates of the   BDS movement in the U. S. has equated the "plight of the Palestinians" with the Holocaust.
