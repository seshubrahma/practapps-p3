I’m someone who surveys the situation, and I don’t like putting people into camps. I don’t like getting into conservative or liberal, because if you take a label and run with it, what if that label changes? I think I’m just somebody who tries to make the best decision every time. I just think it’s funny that a couple of logical tweets have made me a "conservative," such a strong label.
