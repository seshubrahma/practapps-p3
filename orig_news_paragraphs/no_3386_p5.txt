Just like the     visa program, the   program is unpopular with the public, but lobbyists constantly pressure legislators to increase the annual inflow of foreign workers. In May, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other legislators passed the buck to Kelly, by adding language in the May budget supplemental which allows the DHS secretary to expand   by roughly 70, 000 new workers each year. Lobbyists are now pressuring Kelly to quickly and quietly expand the program via   regulatory changes so that foreign workers can be hired and rushed into jobs later this summer, fall and winter. Lapan’s evasive comment suggests Kelly does not want to be Ryan’s   and is trying to dodge the issue without angering the politicians who control his agency’s budget.
