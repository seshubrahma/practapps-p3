" The fact that Bannon even knows Evola is significant," the article eerily reports, citing Mark Sedgwick, a British intellectual teaching in Denmark. While admitting that the entire connection amounted to "a passing reference by Mr. Bannon to an esoteric Italian philosopher," somehow the Times saw fit to produce a   essay in a desperate effort to tease out a dark association between the two men. Nowhere but in the discredited mainstream media could such   be seriously proposed as anything remotely akin to true journalism.
