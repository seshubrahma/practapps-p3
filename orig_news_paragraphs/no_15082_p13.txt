The US has said the Pentagon is looking for any evidence the Russian government knew about or was complicit in the chemical attack. A US military official told CNN the Pentagon was examining specifically whether a Russian warplane had bombed a hospital in Khan Sheikhoun five hours after the initial chemical attack, with the aim of destroying evidence. Russia flatly denies the allegations. On Sunday, Syrian state media cited a statement by a group calling itself the "Joint Operations Command Center of Russia, Iran and allied forces" saying that the US strike on Syria had "crossed red lines" and that it would "respond strongly to any aggression on Syria.
