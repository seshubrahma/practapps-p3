President Bill Clinton issued a flurry of pardons on his final day in office, including for financier Marc Rich and the presidentâ€™s   Roger Clinton. In sum, Clinton ordered 396 pardons and 61 commutations. No recent    however, has used the powers as liberally as Obama to enact a criminal justice reform agenda.   Writing in the Harvard Law Review earlier this month, Obama said his push toward eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and offering clemency to   drug offenders was informed by his own history.
