The government of Iraq also protested the unilateral airstrikes by Turkey.   " Given the extraordinarily complex battle space in these areas, it is vital that Turkey and all partners in the   effort coordinate their actions closely as we work together to maintain maximum pressure on ISIS and ensure the safety of all Coalition personnel in theater,"   said.   Turkey has long been opposed to the PKK, considered a terrorist organization by both Turkey and the US.
