Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will set aside the presidential campaign for one day as the two candidates pause for the 15th anniversary of the largest terror attack ever in the United States    and in the state they both call home.   Clinton will begin Sunday morning at Ground Zero in Manhattan, participating in an annual moment of silence at 8:46 a. m. ET to mark the moment the first plane hit a World Trade Center tower.   She wonâ€™t speak and is going to pay her respects    not in a campaign capacity    her aides said.
