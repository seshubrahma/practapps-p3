Washington (CNN) A subdued Donald Trump on Saturday directly addressed a largely   audience for the first time as a presidential candidate, delivering a warmly received message of unity that focused on fixing economic hardship in the black community. Trump spoke to members of the Great Faith Ministries, a nondenominational church in Detroit, part of his outreach to what is typically a sizable Democratic voting bloc. His visit, however, was greeted by protests outside of the church ahead of his arrival.
