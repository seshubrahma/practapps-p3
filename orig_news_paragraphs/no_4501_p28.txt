To be sure, some refugees access cash welfare or Medicaid in the first eight months. But for those refugees who have been in the country for more than eight months the rate is higher than 36. 7 percent. The 36. 7 percent represents the use rate for all Middle Eastern refugees in the Annual Survey of Refugees who arrived in prior five years averaged together. For this reason, it is possible to estimate   costs for welfare programs based on published information from the survey, but it is not possible to estimate welfare costs for, say, the first year after arrival.
