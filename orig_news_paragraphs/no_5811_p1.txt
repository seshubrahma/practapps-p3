I’m not with you tonight," Farhadi said in a prepared statement read by   astronaut Anoush Ansari. " My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U. S. " Dr. Firouz Naderi, a director of NASA’s Solar System Exploration program, accepted the award on Farhadi’s behalf along with Ansari two   who should be lauded for their exceptional accomplishments.   The talented Farhadi won the Oscar in the best   category for his gripping drama, The Salesman.
