The attack in Khan Sheikhoun has been widely blamed on the Syrian government, though Damascus denies it had anything to do with the attack and also denies it has any chemical weapons.   Syria has blamed terrorist groups for the attack, and Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that the attack was carried out by "forces" trying to frame the regime of Syrian President Bashar  . Russia is Syria’s most powerful ally and has bankrolled much of the   conflict, carrying out regular airstrikes in Syria to prop up Assad’s regime. The attack in Syria prompted the United States to launch its first military strike on the Syrian regime in the   war, causing a major rift between Washington and Moscow.
