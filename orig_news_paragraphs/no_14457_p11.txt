Black Restaurant Group, Shouk and Taylor Gourmet all told CNN they would see how   they are on Thursday, but said they support their worker’s decisions to protest if they so choose.   Clyde’s Restaurant Group, which operates the popular White   institution Old Ebbitt Grill, said its properties would remain open but could be affected by the demonstration.   " It is going to be a difficult day for us," the company’s president, Tom Meyer, said.
