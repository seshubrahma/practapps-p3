In 2008 and 2012, "Saturday Night Live" broadcast additional episodes on Thursday nights, emphasizing political comedy, in the weeks before Election Day, though NBC has not announced similar plans for this year. Last season, Mr. Trump hosted "S. N. L. " on Nov. 7, 2015, while he was still vying for the Republican presidential nomination.
