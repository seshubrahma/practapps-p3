It is not clear why Zervos would have needed to use Allred to present her allegations, which concern Trump’s behavior on the set of The Apprentice, the reality television show Trump hosted and on which Zervos was a contestant. It is also unclear whether Allred can distinguish in this case between her role as a lawyer, and her role as a political operative  —   and elected delegate   —   on behalf of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Federal Election Commission records indicate that Allred also gave Clinton a $2700 contribution, the maximum allowable individual amount.
