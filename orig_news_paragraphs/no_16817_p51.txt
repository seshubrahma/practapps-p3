The veep debate felt much like an extension of the presidential debate before it, as the two contenders on stage focused more on    targets than each other. Both Mike Pence and Tim Kaine hammered at the opposing side’s   president. Overall, substantive policy discussions took a rear seat to the back and forth of political attacks    and personal insults    directed at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This was a proxy battle, with each surrogate taking the biggest swings at the other team’s presidential nominee.
