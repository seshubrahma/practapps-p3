—   Mayor Hales said "I’m really heartsick that our local small businesses who had no culpability in what happened in this election, far from it, have been harmed by people that just wanted to exploit the protest to raise hell. " Hales’ and other local authorities’ statements that "peaceful protests" are being marred by a few fringe players stands in stark contrast to the protest organizers’ refusal to rule out the use of a ‘diversity of tactics," a term that leftist protesters use to describe a spectrum of action from peaceful protests to outright violence.
