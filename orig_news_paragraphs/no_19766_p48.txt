After Hays’s conviction and death sentence, Sessions served as Alabama attorney general during his appeal, and opposed ameliorating his sentence. He took that stand against the wishes of   groups like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which arranged for Hays’s representation by Rick Kerger during his appeal. The author B. J. Hollars wrote in Thirteen Loops that Kerger was initially surprised by the request made by the NAACP LDF, but was told, "we work against the death penalty no matter who it’s directed against. "
