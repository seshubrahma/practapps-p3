While Mr. Trump said he hoped to have a constructive relationship with Russia, he insisted during one of his debates with Hillary Clinton that he was "no puppet" of Mr. Putin. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who once called Mr. Trump a "faker" who "has no consistency about him," said on Monday what she likely wanted to avoid: Mr. Trump will make the Supreme Court whole again. " Most immediately our vacancy will be filled," she told a meeting of the Jewish Federations of North America at a Washington hotel.
