Former debate team members said Mr. Panton used to duck out of pictures if he determined them to be potentially damaging to his chances of becoming prime minister of Jamaica. Born to a prominent businessman turned Anglican priest in the Jamaican town Mandeville, Mr. Panton had connections to and a familiarity with the islandâ€™s political elite, including the former prime minister of the conservative Jamaica Labour Party. He returned to Jamaica as a businessman after his studies and in 1998   with Mr. Cruz a fund that was created to draw investments for Caribbean ventures. Mr. Cruz put $6, 000 into the firm, and ultimately left with $25, 000 in cash and a $75, 000 promissory note from Mr. Panton that Mr. Cruz had never cashed in.
