Towards the end of the meeting, the U. S. officials requested that the Palestinian representatives ensure that the contents of the meeting were not leaked to the press, especially during the sensitive transition period between the two administrations, according to the transcripts. The Egyptian report substantiates claims made by Netanyahuâ€™s office that it had "ironclad" proof from Arab sources that the Obama administration was behind the   resolution. " We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage," said David Keyes, spokesman for Prime Minister Netanyahu.
