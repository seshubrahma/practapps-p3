Two out of the sixteen 2016 GOP presidential candidates vow never to support Trump, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ). " In November, I will not vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, but I will support principled conservatives at the state and federal levels, just as I have done my entire life, Bush posted on Facebook after Trump was coined the presumptive GOP nominee. Graham, who had a pleasant phone call with the presumptive nominee last week, is still vowing not to support him in November.
