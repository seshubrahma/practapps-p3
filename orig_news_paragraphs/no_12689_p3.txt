" The talk was organised by the UCLA College Republicans as part of Milo Yiannopoulos’ "Dangerous Faggot Tour," and also featured David Rubin, host of the Rubin Report. During the talk, two audience members stood up and screamed, "You are spreading hate!" to which the audience responded with chants of "Build the Wall," a reference to Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall on the Mexican border. The protesters were consequently removed by campus security to the back of the room, but were eventually forced to leave after another interruption just 15 minutes later.
