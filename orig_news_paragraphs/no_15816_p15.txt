Before leaving the island, we took a boat ride up to a place about a mile and a half from Tangier called the Uppards.   What used to be a thriving community is now nothing more than a strip of sand. We took a walk along the shores of Uppards with Tangier resident Carol   as she does every day. The only signs there was once life here were the tiny spice bottles we found washed ashore, broken pieces of pottery and even cracked headstones.
