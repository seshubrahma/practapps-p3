Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior clarified Sessions’ statements in an email, saying the attorney general was questioning one judge’s ability to block the president’s executive order for the travel ban. " Hawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific  —   a beautiful one where the Attorney General ’s granddaughter was born," Prior said.
