There is some   support for Kasich in the Pennsylvania GOP   —   including former Gov. Tom Ridge and national GOP committeeman Bob Asher   —   and that creates the potential that a bloc of delegate votes will favor Kasich. The last time a Republican convention was so unsettled, in 1976, candidate Ronald Reagan picked one of Pennsylvania’s senators, Richard Schweiker, as his running mate in an effort to pick up support from the state’s delegates.
