â€”   that simply meeting with a Russian official is wrong, without any knowledge of what was said," Mr. Beyrle said. In a possible sign that Mr. Trump hopes to put behind him the impression that he is an uncritical admirer of Mr. Putin, he is expected to name Fiona Hill, a respected Brookings scholar, to the top Russia post at the National Security Council, according to administration officials. Ms. Hill, who served as national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia from 2006 to 2009, is viewed as a Putin skeptic, if not as outspoken in her criticism of the Russian leader as are some other academics. Angela Stent, a Russia expert at Georgetown, said Ms. Hill was "realistic about Putin" and praised the 2013 book she wrote with Clifford G. Gaddy, "Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin," as the best biography of the Russian leader.
