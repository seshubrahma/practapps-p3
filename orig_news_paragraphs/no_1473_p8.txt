Joel Maiola, a New Hampshire strategist who helped steer Mr. Christie’s campaign in the state, said he had been "confused and not overly happy" about Mr. Christie’s involvement in the Trump operation. " I think he’s been diminished by the way the Trump organization has used him, and I think that’s really unfortunate," Mr. Maiola said. He described Mr. Christie’s efforts to unite the party behind Mr. Trump as largely futile because of Mr. Trump’s divisive approach to the presidential race.
