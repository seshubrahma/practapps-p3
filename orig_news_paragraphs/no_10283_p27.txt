When asked why Cruz voted against Sen. Portman’s 2015 amendment, Cruz’s campaign stood by the Senator’s decision to continue Chinese currency manipulation and repeated a common talking point of those who support the illicit trading practice (namely, that cracking down on China’s cheating would result in higher prices for American consumers). Cruz’s campaign told Breitbart: "Cruz has said repeatedly that he does not support TPP and will not approve trade deals that are bad for American workers. The Portman amendment would not have fixed the problem and likely resulted in higher prices paid by Americans. "
