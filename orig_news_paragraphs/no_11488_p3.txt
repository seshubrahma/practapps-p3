If one truly believes, as we do, that abortion is the taking of an innocent human life and is committed to the   priorities of ending abortion after five months, and defunding the nation’s largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood, it would be a disaster to have a vice president who disagrees. Moreover, as women, we are disgusted by Mr. Trump’s treatment of individuals, women, in particular.   He has impugned the dignity of women, most notably Megyn Kelly, he mocked and bullied Carly Fiorina, and has through the years made disparaging public comments to and about many women. Further, Mr. Trump has profited from the exploitation of women in his Atlantic City casino hotel which boasted of the first strip club casino in the country.
