Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign unveiled Saturday a modified version of its   logo after the original graphic drew a lot of unintended attention. During Trump’s official introduction of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, the campaign adorned a fundraising email with a simple "TRUMP" atop a "PENCE," ditching an American   interlocking T and P logo that attracted the attention of Trump critics and supporters alike. The campaign shared the original graphic in an email soon after making public Trump’s choice Friday in a series of social media posts, emails and text messages.
