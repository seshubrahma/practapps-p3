Under President Yeltsin, television had a wide array of state and private channels offering a cacophony of views, but now it is largely   and entirely on message with the Kremlin. " We interpret freedom of expression in different ways," Mr. Putin told three Russian journalists who were writing a book to burnish his image before the 2000 presidential election, when he was a   former K. G. B. officer. One of those journalists, Nataliya Gevorkyan, has since been beaten up twice by unidentified assailants in Moscow, and her old and once freewheeling newspaper, Kommersant, was taken over by a   businessman.
