Such distrust in the media has undermined the very possibility of agreed upon facts. Today, one in five Americans believe the president was born out of the country and 29% believe he is Muslim, despite widely available and reported evidence to the contrary, including President Obama releasing a copy of his birth certificate. Nineteen percent of Americans believe the US government was behind the   attacks.   I got a personal taste of this new hostility to facts when I tweeted a quote from   leader Jared Taylor last week in which he explicitly disputed that the races are equal.
