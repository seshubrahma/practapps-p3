The global reach of special operators is widening. During the peak of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly 13, 000 Special Operations forces were deployed on missions across the globe, but a large majority were assigned to those two countries. Now, more than half of the 8, 600 elite troops overseas are posted outside the Middle East or South Asia, operating in 97 countries, according to the Special Operations Command. Still, about   of the 6, 000 American troops currently in Iraq and Syria are special operators, many of whom are advising local troops and militias on the front lines.
