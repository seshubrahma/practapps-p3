Live election coverage, Other names from Trumpâ€™s frequent surrogates list that are rumored as potential picks include retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for national security adviser, CIA director or national intelligence director and Ben Carson for secretary of Health and Human Services. Flynn cannot be secretary of Defense due to a rule requiring Defense secretaries be seven years out of active duty. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is rumored to be in the mix for a position, as is Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.   Campaign staffers for Trump are also expected to have a place in the administration.
