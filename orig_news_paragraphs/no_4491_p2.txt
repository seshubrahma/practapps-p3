Philip Wolgin (@pwolgin) January 25, 2017,   Trump’s push against illegal and legal immigration is a huge threat to the Democrats’ political strategy, which assumes that a growing number of immigrants will provide needed votes to the Democrats’ unruly coalition of gays and industrial workers, Muslims and Jews, Wall Street financiers and government workers, blacks and Latinos, upper income professionals and   service workers. From Janet Murguía, the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, the largest national Latino advocacy organization in the United States. Today, @realDonaldTrump fulfilled a campaign promise: he doubled down on his intent to declare open season on immigrants.
