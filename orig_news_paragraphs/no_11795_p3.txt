As you know CNN put out this false rumor that they were considering pulling out. All of that works against the candidate that I believe in and I believe in him today more than ever because Marco has been positive, inspirational, he’s been about uniting our country. If you will, taking a bad situation and making it better rather than candidates, quite frankly on both sides, who have been trying to play on people’s feelings.
