 (CNN) Democrats are finally back on the offensive on health care, brandishing an explosive new report stocked with damaging information about the Republicansâ€™ plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. Their new ammunition: 24 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under a House Republican proposal, while premiums would skyrocket for some of the most vulnerable Americans, including   elderly patients, according to analysis released on Monday by the Congressional Budget Office.   Democrats mobilized quickly on Monday to begin lobbing a stream of attacks against the Republican health care proposal, marking a drastic role reversal for a party that has struggled to defend the Affordable Care Act for the past eight years    and suffered significant political losses along the way.
