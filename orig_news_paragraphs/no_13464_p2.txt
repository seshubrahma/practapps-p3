Most of the crowd has diapered by now, but the police are holding its barricade on Roosevelt Street and 7th Street. A little pepper spray lingered in the air on Garfield Road and 7th Street. A crowd of about 70 people huddled in smaller groups of   each, seeming to not be sure what to do next. Police continued to tell people to get out of the road and go home.
