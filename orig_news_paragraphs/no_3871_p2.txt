These newly identified records are presumably not the records contained in the   "Congressional Database," which the IRS created in 2013 to house records responsive to congressional inquiries into the IRS scandal. The IRS informed JW Monday that it is producing an additional 694 pages of documents and expects to produce an additional batch by March 24, 2017.   However, at this time, the IRS still has not provided an estimate regarding when it will complete its review of the potentially responsive documents. The corruption at the IRS is astounding.
