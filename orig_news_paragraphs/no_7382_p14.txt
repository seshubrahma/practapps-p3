Wikileaks’ mention of Podesta is not clearly proven. There is no documentation to suggest he was involved in the Uranium One deal   —   though his brother Tony was. However, we do know that Podesta was involved with a company called Joule Unlimited, which received funding from a Russian   company called Rusnano: Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta sat on the executive board of a small energy company called Joule Unlimited  …     Other Joule board members included senior Russian officials.
