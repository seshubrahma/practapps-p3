Supporters of the blueprint understand the importance of reforming our tax code in a way that incentivizes investment in the United States and the production of American goods, in American towns, by American workers," said John Gentzel, a spokesman for a consortium of businesses lobbying for the provision. " Meanwhile opponents of the blueprint are trying to stop tax reform and keep the current broken tax system that puts American workers at a disadvantage."   The Koch lobbying operation has conceded that Bradyâ€™s   committee is "pretty much dug in at this point," said Americans for Prosperity  lobbying chief Chrissy Harbin.
