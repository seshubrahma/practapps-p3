But skeptics may argue that what ails the economy right now is inadequate demand for goods and services, and that   people don’t have enough money. If they had extra cash in their pockets from an expanded E. I. T. C. they would be more likely than millionaires to spend the money, many economic studies suggest. That means that including help for the working class in any tax overhaul would add a "demand side" source of economic growth. That won’t solve the problems of   Americans.
