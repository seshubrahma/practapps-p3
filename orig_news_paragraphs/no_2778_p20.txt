As for Mr. Trumpâ€™s personal travel, he prefers to fly private. In 2009, he decided to sell his Boeing 727, which was by then 41 years old. He replaced it with another used aircraft, the Boeing 757. A company controlled by the billionaire Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft, had bought that plane in 1995.
