Any right that requires you to take measures to access it, is no right at all. Not when patients and providers have to endure harassment and intimidation just to walk into a health center not when making an appointment means taking time off from work, finding child care, and driving   across your state not when providers are required by state law to recite misleading information to women in order to shame and scare them and not as long as we have laws on the books like the Hyde Amendment, making it harder for   women to exercise their full rights. The Hyde Amendment was initially proposed by Rep. Henry Hyde and enacted in 1976. As Arina Grossu notes at The Federalist: Between 1973 and 1977, the years between Roe v. Wade and the Hyde Amendment becoming law, the federal government spent about $50 million annually to fund approximately 300, 000 abortions per year under Medicaid.
