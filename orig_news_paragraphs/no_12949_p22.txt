My   explainer, if Hunter had bothered to read it, clearly differentiated between the hateful and   components of the   movement. Given what I’ve since learned about Hunter’s own past, all I can say is this: if I’m guilty of flirting with racism, he has been   it in the back of a   truck all summer. Hunter previously supported the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, acted as chairman of the "League of the South" and argued that America needed to take action in order to protect the white race. As late as 2010, Hunter was praising   icon Samuel Francis.
