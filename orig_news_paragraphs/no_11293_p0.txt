From Kenneth R. Timmerman writing at The Hill:  Clinton and corruption are two words irrevocably associated with each other since the days of the Whitewater land deal and Mrs. Clinton’s    winnings as a   cattle futures trader in the late 1970’s. Those early deals revealed the Clinton business model that flourishes today. Unlike Donald Trump, it has nothing to do with creating real wealth. Instead, it is all based on selling access and influence.
