Authorities did not release names of victims on Sunday.   The Georgia Emergency Management Agency said seven people died in Cook County, and there were two deaths each in Berrien and Brooks counties, in a largely rural area along   between Albany, Georgia and Lake City, Florida, and three in Dougherty County.    "You can imagine putting a bomb in a mobile home and having it explode. Thatâ€™s about what it looks like," Adel Mayor Buddy Duke said Sunday of Sunshine Acres, a community of about 60 mobile homes outside of Adel in Cook County, about 200 miles south of Atlanta.
