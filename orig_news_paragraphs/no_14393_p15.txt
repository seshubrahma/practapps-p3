The fact that the decision was "per curiam" means all the judges agreed with the result, but they wanted to avoid assigning any particular judge to write the opinion, probably so Trump couldn’t single out one of the judges for criticism. I’m somewhat surprised the court took the time to breathe life into the constitutional arguments. It wasn’t really necessary for the order, but it certainly helps the states. This case is far from over, but this is a huge win for the states.
