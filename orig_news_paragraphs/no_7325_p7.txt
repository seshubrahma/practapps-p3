" philosophy has tied up key infrastructure energy projects, many of which used to be uncontroversial. For instance, the United States currently has more than 72, 000 miles of pipelines safely transporting oil throughout the country, yet the Obama administration has actively worked to stop pipeline development since taking office. Obama   killed the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have carried about 830, 000 barrels of oil per day from Canada to refineries in the Gulf Coast, even though a   analysis by the State Department stated the pipeline would have been safe for the environment. The pipeline would have also benefitted public safety, because transporting crude oil by pipeline is safer than transporting it by rail.
