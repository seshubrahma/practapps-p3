Stopping short of an explicit endorsement, Graham is holding a fundraiser for Cruz on Monday. Also, Rubio told his Minnesota backers on Wednesday that he sees Cruz as "the only conservative left in the race," according to the Twin Cities Pioneer Press. He emphasized hopes that one of the remaining candidates  —   Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz   —   will overtake frontrunner Donald Trump for the nomination.
