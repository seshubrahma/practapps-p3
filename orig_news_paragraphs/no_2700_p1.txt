â€”    the   official arrested in Russia in decades. The minister, Aleksei Ulyukayev, 60, a liberal stalwart with a trademark porcupine haircut, was detained in the middle of the night, a   tactic against officials who had fallen into disfavor that many thought had been retired. Mr. Ulyukayev was charged with extorting a $2 million bribe from Rosneft, the state oil giant, as a   for endorsing a deal for it to buy a chunk of Bashneft, a smaller,   oil company that the Kremlin recently confiscated from an oligarch.
