’ ’    Nunes on Monday said he had gone to the White House last week to   view the documents because Congress didn’’t have "networked   access" to those reports. ’ ’    His spokesman later told Business Insider that Nunes had   been there to view the documents in a secure compartmented   information facility, or SCIF, to "safeguard the proper chain of   custody and classification of these documents," but did not   respond when asked why an executive branch source would not go   directly to Trump, instead of to Nunes, with documents they found   suspicious.
