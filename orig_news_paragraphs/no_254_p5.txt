I have spoken privately with several journalists involved in the reporting last fall, and I believe a strong case can be made that The Times was too timid in its decisions not to publish the material it had. I appreciate the majority view that there wasn’t enough proof of a link between Trump and the Kremlin to write a   story. But The Times knew several critical facts: the F. B. I. had a sophisticated investigation underway on Trump’s organization, possibly including FISA warrants. (Some news outlets now report that the F. B. I. did indeed have such warrants, an indication of probable cause.)
