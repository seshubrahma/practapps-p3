* Don’t put blind faith in any politician, but don’t give up on our forefathers’ charters of freedom that created a Republic to be governed by and for We the People. * Teach your children America’s foundation built on the rule of law ensure they understand consequences for their actions, despite our temporary leaders facing no such thing. * Unite behind those who have no part in the corrupt political machine that would mock, silence and destroy the outsiders committed to serving for the right reasons oppose all who campaign one way but govern another once they get to Washington and get sucked in to both party establishments that reward and protect their own.
