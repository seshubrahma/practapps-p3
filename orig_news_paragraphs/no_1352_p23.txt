In 2015, Americans bought $14. 2 billion worth of Chinese shoes, $2. 5 billion of Chinese jewelry and $593 million of Chinese rugs. And, most of all, cellphones  â€”   $64 billion worth, according to the Commerce Department. All told, the United States imported $481. 9 billion in Chinese goods in 2015, a record. But research suggests that the price of Chinese goods would rise by significantly less than 45 percent because companies would hold the line to preserve their market share.
