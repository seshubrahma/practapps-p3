Travis Kalanick of Uber has been attempting to calm recent anger from Uber users over what was perceived as the company’s refusal to participate in an hour long strike organised by New York taxi drivers to protest President Trump’s temporary travel halt. Kalanick stated that he was attending the economic policy meeting to have "a seat at the table" and added: "I understand that many people internally and externally may not agree with that decision, and that’s OK. It’s the magic of living in America that people are free to disagree. "
