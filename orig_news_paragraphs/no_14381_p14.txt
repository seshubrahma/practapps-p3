The system was moving out of New York by last night, but it was expected to impact Boston through the weekend.   National Weather Service doesn’t expect the temperature there to get above freezing until Sunday.    Despite the storm’s location, though, and despite its affects, it moved from west to east, from land to sea.   It’s not technically a nor’easter, though some folks were calling it that.
