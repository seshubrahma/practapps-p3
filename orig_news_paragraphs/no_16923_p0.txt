 (CNN) Donald Trump cut his routine $2 million monthly check to his campaign last September after repeatedly suggesting that he would increase his donations during the campaign’s stretch run. Trump’s campaign, along with Republican joint fundraising committees, said it raised $100 million last month, more than it has in any previous month though well short of the $154 million Hillary Clinton’s operation took in. But Trump    who largely closed a polling gap with Clinton during much of September    did not give more to his campaign than he had in previous months despite being pressured to invest more of his fortune.
