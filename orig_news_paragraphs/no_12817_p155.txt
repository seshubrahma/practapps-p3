If Trump resoundingly wins Iowa, it may be nearly impossible to stop him if he then wins New Hampshire. It would be a political earthquake. But Iâ€™m more interested to see what will happen if Trump loses an early state primary. Does he have the political sophistication to use a potential loss to set up victories down the road that Obama did after his New Hampshire loss in 2008.
