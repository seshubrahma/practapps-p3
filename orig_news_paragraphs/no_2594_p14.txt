Promoted by National Right to Life and other groups,   bans based on the fetal pain theory have been adopted by 15 states and are under consideration in several more. It was telling, Ms. Balch said, that when abortion rights groups challenged the Texas clinic laws, they did not include the stateâ€™s   ban, which was adopted at the same time and remains in effect. Legal experts for abortion rights say that the laws are a clear violation of existing Supreme Court rulings that women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, which is often about 22 weeks after conception. They say they are waiting for the right occasion to bring a court challenge to these bans, which affect relatively few women, and that fending off the regulations that closed down clinics was a higher priority.
