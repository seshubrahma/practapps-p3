Mr. Trump has even trailed in a poll in strongly Republican Utah, which is one of the   states in the country. It’s unlikely that Mrs. Clinton could win Utah in the end, but it’s nonetheless telling that Mr. Trump trails in a survey of a state where Democrats have not reached 35 percent of the vote in the last 11 presidential elections. The Trump campaign’s aim to compete in industrial   states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio has not looked promising either. That’s in part because of his broader challenge with   whites (a recent   survey showed Mr. Trump trailing by 29 points in the Philadelphia suburbs) but it’s also because he isn’t connecting among white   Democrats the way the campaign had hoped.
