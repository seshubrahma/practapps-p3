Collectively, EU institutions and member states are the largest providers of humanitarian assistance worldwide. The EU institutions are collectively the   donor in development aid, while European institutions run the most extensive election observation missions in the world. Moreover, they host far more refugees than any other developed country (except Turkey). The US, meanwhile, spends well under the 0. 7% target set by the OECD on foreign aid.
