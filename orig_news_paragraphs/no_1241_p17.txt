Indonesians have always been educated that they have   resources that are the envy of the entire world, but that over the years Western colonial powers have hatched schemes to take over Indonesia to exploit those resources," said Matthew Busch, a research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy. Indonesia’s largest Muslim civic organizations have aggressively opposed foreign control over the country’s resources, including calling for a "constitutional jihad" to challenge Indonesian laws that allow foreign companies to control domestic resources. The resulting friction has made Indonesia one of the world’s least attractive mining investment environments, according to the Fraser Institute, a Canadian research organization, which ranked it the 99th most difficult out of 104 nations, states and regions in 2016. Eve Warburton, a researcher at Australian National University who studies Indonesian resource nationalism, said that over the last decade Indonesian politicians had consistently been more assertive toward foreign mining companies.
