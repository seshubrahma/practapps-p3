Courts have also looked at whether the substance of the communications had already been publicly disclosed. The Fast and Furious case is a great example. The Obama administration had already made public disclosures about its deliberations relating to that operation, so there was no need to use the privilege to maintain executive branch secrets.   In this case, Trumpâ€™s media interviews, his termination letter to Comey and his random tweets have already made his meetings with the   chief a matter of public concern.
