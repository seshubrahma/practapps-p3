I believe this is what the President means when he says we will repeal and replace Obamacare simultaneously and what Speaker Ryan means when he says we will repeal and replace Obamacare concurrently. Sen. Alexander is a proponent of repealing and replacing at the same time, an idea that President Donald Trump has signed onto in the past. Any form of repeal would only be effective after there is a practical alternative that includes several of the popular republican reforms to Obamacare, such as shopping insurance plans across state lines, and expansion of health savings accounts. There are number of plans to replace Obamacare, including from Sens. Susan Collins ( ) and Bill Cassidy ( ) a separate plan from Senator Rand Paul ( ) as well as from Speaker Ryan.
