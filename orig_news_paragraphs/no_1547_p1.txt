1. I am thinking about my mother tonight, the child of immigrants, born in 1919 just when women were given the right to vote. I am remembering all the times she dragged me into the voting booth to show me what a privilege it was to be an American and to live in this country. I canâ€™t talk to her about this historic night, but I can talk to my daughter who can see that her future is limitless.
