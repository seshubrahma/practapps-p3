CNN’s delegate expert Mike Shields said that the intervention was not about stopping Trump but "the start of the Ted Cruz 2020 campaign."   But a senior Cruz adviser told CNN’s Sara Murray that the Texas senator’s team was not pushing for the rebellion. A closed primary system could help candidates like Cruz, who drew from more   Republicans during his 2016 campaign than did Trump. Cruz frequently argued that Trump drew support from more liberal voters, and his aides frequently predicted that closed states would lead him to victory.
