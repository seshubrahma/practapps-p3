Mr. Trump had spoken out repeatedly against taking action against the Syrian leader, Bashar   while praising the actions of Russia, Mr. Assad’s biggest backer in Syria’s   civil war, and arguing that the United States should make common cause with Russia and Syria in fighting the Islamic State. During the campaign, Mr. Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration, and as president he has tried to halt entry from Syria and a handful of other   countries, contending that some of the refugees and other migrants could be terrorists trying to slip into the United States under false colors. Mr. Mahmoud and his family left their hometown, northwest of Aleppo, and lived for years in Turkey, before getting permission to go to the United States. Just as they were about to leave, in late January, Mr. Trump’s first pass at an immigration order put their plans on hold when courts struck down the order, they were finally able to enter the country, on Feb. 9.
