Celebrities today act edgy, but restrict themselves to utterly safe belief systems. There can be no better example of this than Madonna’s speech at the Women’s March, where she casually suggested someone bomb the White House. Outrageous, yes, but also an entirely unsurprising sentiment at a time of   panic and hyperbole. It was a ruse: she wanted to sound dangerous while actually buying into the safest opinions you can have.
