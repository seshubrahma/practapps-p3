Further evidence of Barack Obama’s close association with efforts to oppose President Trump has emerged: a group of former top lawyers for the Obama administration have formed an organization aimed at utilizing legal advocacy methods to oppose Trump’s policies. [The organization is calling itself United to Protect Democracy, drawing on the theme of Obama’s farewell speech last month.   The group is already partnered with an organization heavily financed by billionaire George Soros and is led by a former Obama lawyer who previously worked at a   global activist outfit. Politico first reported on the formation of United to Protect Democracy, which has already raised $1. 5 million and hired five staffers.
