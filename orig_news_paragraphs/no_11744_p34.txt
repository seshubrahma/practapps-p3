Crane detailed how Rubio only agreed to meet with him a few hours before the Gang of Eight introduced their bill. Palinkas confirmed this account —  explaining that while Rubio sought the input of big business and special interest groups when crafting his bill, he did not get input from immigration and law enforcement. Indeed, while Rubio waited until just before introducing the bill to meet with Crane, Rubio did not meet with Palinkas until after the bill was already introduced —  meaning that Rubio’s bill did not receive input from the officers responsible for processing all of the nation’s immigration paperwork. Palinkas explained that when he was finally given a meeting with Sen. Rubio, it was clear that Rubio had no intention of remedying the situation by taking their suggestions to improve the bill.
