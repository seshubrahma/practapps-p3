And of course, we have ties of kinship, language and culture to these United States too. As Churchill put it, we "speak the same language, kneel at the same altars and, to a very large extent, pursue the same ideals". And, today, increasingly we have strong economic, commercial, defence and political relationships as well. So I am delighted that the new Administration has made a trade agreement between our countries one of its earliest priorities.
