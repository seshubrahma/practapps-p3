In that case, the court chastised Hebert’s team at the Justice Department, writing that it was "unconscionable" that they would "carelessly" hurl "unfounded allegations" of racial discrimination and impugn a person’s good name without any regard for the truth. The court wrote: A properly conducted investigation would have quickly revealed that there was no basis for the claim that the Defendants were guilty of purposeful discrimination against black voters. Unfortunately, we cannot restore the reputation of the persons wrongfully branded by the United States as public officials who deliberately deprived their fellow citizens of their voting rights. We can only hope that in the future the decision makers in the United States Department of Justice will be more sensitive to the impact on racial harmony that can result from the filing of a claim of purposeful discrimination.
