Wiens said that the Trump election bodes badly for the future of the planet, exacerbated by his appointment of climate change skeptic Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA and his determination to pull out of the Paris Climate Change Accord (COP21). " The EPA in this country, they are the ones supposed to be protecting the environment," he said. Wiens suggested the U. K. should invade the U. S. or the U. S. should swap leaders with Canada, with Justin Trudeau taking over in the White House.
