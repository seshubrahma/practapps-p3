Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) upon being asked about critics who have called him Russian President Vladimir Putin’s favorite Republican, told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Wednesday, "Putin is not a perfect guy at all, but he is not Joseph Stalin or even Nikita Khrushchev. " Rohrabacher made the point that communism, not Russia specifically, was seen as the greatest threat during the Reagan years, and it was, by and large, defeated. [As for talk of his being on the list to become   Trump’s secretary of state, Rohrabacher said he would be content to remain in Congress however, he believes Trump needs a secretary of state whose thinking aligns with his own, and Rohrabacher is not convinced the names being bandied about fit that bill.
