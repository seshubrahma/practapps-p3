Al Qaeda in Iraq   —   has been fueled significantly by the growing chaos in the Middle East that followed the implementation of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy since 2008. The Obama White House’s approach to the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, the fall of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, the Houthi uprising in Yemen, and the teenaged war in Afghanistan have all left significant power vacuums from which jihadist groups have benefitted greatly   —   not just the Islamic State, but formerly moribund jihadist groups like Al Qaeda.
