"After careful deliberation," the statement said, "given the totality of the circumstances here and absent additional evidence, we do not intend to bring federal criminal charges against the mayor or those acting on his behalf relating to the   efforts in question," the statement said. Among the reasons he cited were "any changes in the law," an apparent reference to a recent United States Supreme Court decision overturning the conviction of the former Virginia governor, Bob McDonnell, a ruling that made it harder to prosecute public corruption cases. " Although it is rare that we issue a public statement about the status of an investigation, we believe it appropriate in this case at this time, in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and mayoral election," the statement said.
