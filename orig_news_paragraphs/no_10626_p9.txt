I would like to invite Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence to return to Louisiana soon. I would ask them to bring their solutions and to bring the good news about the greatness of America with them. Louisiana has shown time and again that we can weather great adversity. We have suffered through more than our share of catastrophes, racial division, and government corruption.
