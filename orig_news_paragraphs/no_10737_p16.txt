Caddell said the next question: "Do you think Hillary Clintonâ€™s previously mentioned comments reflect contempt for average Americans?" went back to the    paradigm, so it came up with 46 percent agreeing and 44 percent disagreeing. Then, with the emphasis shifted from the candidates, they were asked: "Do you think her comments are shared by many in the political establishment and major media?" This time 66 percent of respondents said they agreed and 17 percent said they disagreed. Caddell said the people are not with Clinton on the issues and they know the media is with her against the New York City developer, as well.
