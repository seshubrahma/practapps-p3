Such views, widespread in   communities in the Baltics and beyond, contrast starkly with the alarm, even panic, at Mr. Trump’s triumph among an   political and foreign policy elite in the country ’s capital, Tallinn, where Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, is viewed as a threat who must be resisted, not appeased. During the campaign, Mr. Trump raised alarms in Baltic capitals by calling NATO "obsolete" and questioning why the United States should defend alliance members that fail to shoulder their share of the costs. But President Obama has said that Mr. Trump assured him during their Oval Office meeting last week that he remained committed to the security guarantees that have underpinned NATO’s system of collective defense and peace in Europe since 1949.
