If Trump has veered   Republican leaders have managed to maintain   control over their bill, successfully passing it out of both the Energy and Commerce and the Ways and Means committees without a single substantive amendment    despite sessions of a combined 45 hours.   Rep. Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas, filed an amendment in the Energy and Commerce Committee markup that would have sunset the Medicaid expansion sooner than the 2020 deadline in the bill, but he pulled the proposal before it came up for a vote.    Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden told Trump behind closed doors Friday that the Medicaid language in the House health care bill is here to stay, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Walden made clear that the provision that would sunset Obamacareâ€™s Medicaid expansion in 2020 was drafted in consultation with key players, including wary   governors, lawmakers and the White House itself.
