A recent report from Breitbart Texas showed illegal immigrants crossing the border from Mexico and entering the U. S. inside the city limits of Laredo, Texas. In that case, the foreigners were able to overcome U. S. border security with nothing more than a breaststroke and a cheap inner tube.   As Breitbart Texas recently reported, the numbers of illegal immigrant families and unaccompanied minors crossing the border from Mexico are up dramatically in the federal Fiscal Year 2016. The apprehension of families has increased by 95 percent over FY 2015 numbers to 77, 674 according to a report from U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
