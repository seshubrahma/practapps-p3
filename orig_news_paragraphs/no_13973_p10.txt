When Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago and when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there’s a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it’s important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn’t go away," he said.   Jarrett described the president as "emotional" as he spoke with her about Martin’s death in the Oval Office and said it was important to him to try to personalize the experience to help people have a better understanding of what life in America is like for young black men. But even in the midst of the conversation on race these incidents sparked, the president has frequently admitted to being skeptical about the usefulness of "talking" about issues of racial inequality    arguing such talk can be a distraction and that what was needed was concrete action to prevent discrimination.
