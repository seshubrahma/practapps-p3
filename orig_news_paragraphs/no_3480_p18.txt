That number includes 10 percent who want the country to accept 500, 000 or more migrants. Another 26 percent of Americans said they would accept up to 10, 000 refugees. The survey did not say that the country already accepts 70, 000 refugees per year.    percent said they want no additional refugees above the 1, 500, and 29 percent declined to answer the poll, indicating quiet opposition to greater inflows.
