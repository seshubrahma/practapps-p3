Democrats expect the first major test of the investigation  —   and Mr. Nunes’s stewardship   —   to come on March 20, when the committee holds its first public hearing. An initial list of invited witnesses included James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence under Mr. Obama and Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired by the Trump administration after refusing to defend the president’s first travel ban. Absent from the witness list was Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, who resigned after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.
