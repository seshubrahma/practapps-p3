The group is expecting to receive a $3 million donation early this week, along with two matching $3 million donations. That cash, combined with the $20 million gift and the $32 million that they had previously said to expect, means Rebuilding America Now would have about $60 million at its disposal for summer advertising. It comes from both traditional,   Republican donors alongside people drawn by Trump. If realized, that sum would leapfrog the Trump super PACs over similar groups, who have struggled to raise large dollars.
