Family old and new, This year, Nowruz falls at half past six in morning for me. Iâ€™ve never been the best early riser but I know the hour well these days since the election, my nights are a mess of   insomnia keeping me up close to dawn. Then, early in the morning, my dog has taken to waking me up with a sermon of barks    something he never did before.
