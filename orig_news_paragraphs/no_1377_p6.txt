Deportations have peaked recently at about 400, 000 a year, so the increase in scale to reach Mr. Trump’s goal would be exponential.

" I can’t even begin to picture how we would deport 11 million people in a few years where we don’t have a police state, where the police can’t break down your door at will and take you away without a warrant," said Michael Chertoff, who led a significant increase in immigration enforcement as the secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush.
