Only 43% of respondents expressed a great deal of confidence that their votes would be counted accurately. (In an interesting side note to that last dismal statistic, respondents were evenly divided about whether illegal voters, or eligible voters unfairly denied the right to vote, were a more serious problem, but only 9% thought "voter apathy" was the biggest problem with American elections. The media and political class thinks voter apathy is a much bigger problem than the actual electorate does.) To be sure, the terms in many of these questions are highly subjective.
