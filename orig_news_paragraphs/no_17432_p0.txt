Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats said Friday they will scrutinize the health industry stock trades of   Donald Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services, saying they want to ensure that Rep. Tom Price didn’t break insider trading laws while sitting on a major health care subcommittee.   The Georgia Republican’s trades over the past four years will be front and center in his confirmation battle, according to a senior Democratic aide, who told CNN his party will try to determine if Price violated the Stock Act, a 2013 law designed to ensure lawmakers don’t profit on private data they get through their official work. While there is no evidence that Price, who is an orthopedic surgeon, used inside information when he made multiple trades on health insurance, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, Democrats and some outside ethics experts think the trades raise serious questions.
