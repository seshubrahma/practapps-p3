The White House issued a statement calling the bombings "heinous actions" and highlighting the inaction by the Obama administration in light of previous human rights violations by the Assad regime. Assad reportedly still possesses chemical weapons despite the Obama administrationâ€™s calling the use of such weapons a "red line" in 2012. Assad has since been accused of using the weapons on multiple occasions, and his officials have mocked the statement, with little response from the White House.
