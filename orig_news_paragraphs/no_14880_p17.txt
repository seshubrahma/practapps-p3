We grew up with few luxuries, so I usually felt so excited that Nowruz was also a time of treats. All Nowruz’s symbolic purification talk was exciting for me as it meant we were to wear new clothes that day    and that meant a mall visit, during which I could make a case for some impractical Wet Seal creation ("We have to do it for Persia!" I’d cry, waving some lacy tube top on sale).   And all sorts of   foods entered our lives then and only then too.
