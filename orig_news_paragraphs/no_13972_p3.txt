The new revelation is the latest example of Price trading stock in a healthcare firm at the same time as pursuing legislation that could impact a company’s share price. The issue has become a major liability for the congressman after The Wall Street Journal reported last month that he traded roughly $300, 000 in shares over the past four years in health companies while pursuing legislation that could impact them.   The purchase of the Zimmer Biomet shares is the latest such example, raising new concerns among ethics experts that Price may have inappropriately used inside information while purchasing shares in a company. Concerns over insider trading on Capitol Hill    where members of Congress allegedly traded stock based on intelligence gleaned from the legislative process    prompted the enactment of the STOCK Act in 2012 aimed at combating the practice.
