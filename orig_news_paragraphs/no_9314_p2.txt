After the decision to drop the charges was made public, the cityâ€™s FOP released a statement decrying the move. " Apparently, assaults recorded on video are prosecuted everywhere except in Philadelphia, particularly when the victims are police officers," FOP president John J. McNesby wrote in a public letter on Monday. The FOP rep added that video of assaults elsewhere have led to arrests.
