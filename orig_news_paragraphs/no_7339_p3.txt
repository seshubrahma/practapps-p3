Justice Scalia was a lion of the law, he loved the Constitution, he loved freedom. I had the blessing of knowing Justice Scalia for 20 years   â€¦    Justice Scalia, in three decades on the court, changed the arc of American legal history, singlehandedly shifted the Constitution and the interpretation of it back to the original understand, back to the text and words adopted by the framers. As Ronald Reagan was to the presidency, so too Justice Scalia was to the US Supreme Court.
