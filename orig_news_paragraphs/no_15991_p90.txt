To make this claim, Trump cited several examples from the book "Clinton Cash" by Peter Schweizer. Among the accusations: Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America’s uranium holdings to Russia while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. While the deal to sell Uranium One to a Russian company was completed in 2010, there’s no hard evidence of a quid pro quo. Even Schweizer admits there’s no smoking gun.
