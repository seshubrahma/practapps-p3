the barracks, the marine barracks at the airport in Beirut were attacked by a truck coming in with explosives, and blew up the building and killed a large number of marines and navy corpsman, and when that happened people started to put revetments around these buildings so that a truck can’t get in there. And they’d create an outer perimeter. Then what the terrorists would do is they’d shoot   grenades. And then at that point, along the Corniche in Beirut, they started draping wire mesh over the building to bounce the   grenades off so that they wouldn’t blow up the building.
