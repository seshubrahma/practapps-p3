During MSNBC’s coverage of former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier in the day, MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace called Donald Trump, Jr. ’s tweets criticizing Comey "pathetic. "  Wallace said, "This idea of the son as the only person sort of channeling this president in attacking the character of Comey, I think, speaks for itself. A normal White House on a day like today would have, you know, former attorney general and people in law enforcement sort of making legal arguments. "
