A passenger on the flight who asked The Milwaukee   not to be named said that Bluntson was loud and disruptive, directing his comments to Clarke sitting at the back of the plane. " The guy was very abusive," the passenger said to The Observer. The sheriff got up from his seat and told the guy to "chill out" after Bluntson started harassing passengers and flight crew, according to a statement from the Milwaukee County Sheriffâ€™s Office.
