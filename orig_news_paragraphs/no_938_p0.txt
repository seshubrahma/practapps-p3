Richard Simmons is not being tormented by black magic   â€”   or so says Mr. Simmons, the fitness guru, whose disappearance from public view three years ago has at least one close friend fearing he is under the spell of a witch. He is not being held hostage inside his Hollywood Hills mansion, he and his publicist insist, contrary to suspicions of several longtime associates. He is not transitioning and becoming a "softly spoken woman named Fiona," as the National Enquirer claimed last summer and Mr. Simmons rebutted on Facebook.
