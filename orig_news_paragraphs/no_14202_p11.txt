Democratic House and Senate leaders have planned a protest outside the Supreme Court for 6 p. m. ET Monday.   The chaotic scenes around airports Saturday came in part because Trumpâ€™s administration had reportedly not allowed career Homeland Security Department staff to see the executive order.   One key question for many is how the order will affect US green card holders and people who hold dual citizenship with a Trump approved country and one of the seven banned nations. Adding to the confusion, Trump administration officials seemed to at times contradict themselves during appearances on Sunday news shows.
