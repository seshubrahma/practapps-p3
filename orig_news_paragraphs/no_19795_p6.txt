So it is possible the FBI was slow in reacting to the initial "over the transom" communication in Rome.

Four possibilities: a) Organizational fragmentation. The FBI is highly decentralized into 56 field offices, with a history of left   hand coordination problems —  which explains why, before   three different field offices each had clues about the plot, but nobody knew what the others knew, so more concerted action was never taken.
