By the start time of 11 a. m. there were dozens of journalist but only a few protesters. A   later, the number of protesters  —   at least those being vocal and carrying   signs   —   seemed stuck at four, including a guy wearing a Mexican wrestling mask, while the number of journalists topped 50. By 12:30 p. m. there were no more than 10 demonstrators, while the journalist pack continued to balloon.
