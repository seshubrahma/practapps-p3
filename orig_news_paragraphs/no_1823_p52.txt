The bathrooms didn’t have toilet paper, and the only way to differentiate the men’s from the women’s room was if you could read the Chinese symbols   on the door. The search for the "real" Brooklyn goes far beyond its art and food, however  —   being a Brooklynite, I learned, means being active. In the summer, there is free   kayaking every Saturday and Thursday between Piers 1 and 2 in Brooklyn Bridge Park. (I made my voyage before the summer season ended.)
