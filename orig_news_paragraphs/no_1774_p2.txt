Whatever the president opts to do would probably not be announced in advance and may never be acknowledged or disclosed if it is carried out, Mr. Earnest said. On Friday, the Obama administration publicly acknowledged for the first time that it believed that the Russian government was responsible for stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee and a range of other institutions and prominent individuals, most recently Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. The emails were posted on the   WikiLeaks site and two newer sites, DCLeaks. com and Guccifer 2. 0.
