A letter released by Clinton’s physician in July 2015 dubbed Clinton in "excellent physical condition," but noted she was diagnosed at the time with hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies and was taking the medications Armour Thyoid and Coumadin daily. The letter, from Clinton’s physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, further stated that in 2009 she suffered from deep vein thrombosis and an elbow fracture that year. Bardack provided some information about a 2012 incident in which Clinton was said to have suffered from a blood clot and concussion. Time magazine reported at the time: Bardack’s letter provides the most detailed accounting of the 2012 episode, which came as Clinton was set to testify before Congress on the 2012 Benghazi attacks shortly before leaving office.
