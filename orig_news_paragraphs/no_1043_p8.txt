The marketing for the Paddy Power brand includes a    blog, irreverent television advertisements and a variety of stunts. For example, the company sent a hearse to the stadium used by the British soccer team Leicester City after the team fired its manager, Claudio Ranieri, last month, less than a year after winning the English Premier League. The unexpected title run of Leicester City last year proved costly to gambling companies in Britain, costing Paddy Power alone more than Â£2 million. The club had a    chance of winning the league entering the   season.
