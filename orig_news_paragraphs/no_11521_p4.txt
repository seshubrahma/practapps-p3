With regards to Middle Eastern migration, Clinton’s 65, 000 Syrian refugees would be added on top of the roughly 96, 000 Middle Eastern migrants the U. S. resettled on green cards in a single year. Based on the minimum numbers Clinton has put forth thus far, as President, she could potentially resettle approximately 644, 000 Middle Eastern migrants during her first term alone. According to a September 2015 Rasmussen survey, women voters oppose Clinton’s Middle Eastern refugee plan by a remarkable    margin.
