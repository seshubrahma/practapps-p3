Pence repeatedly opposed George W. Bushâ€™s proposals to expand government. When Republicans lost the U. S. House in 2006, Pence took the ultimate   step of running against John Boehner to be the leader of House Republicans. He lost that bid, but garnered almost 30 votes against the future Speaker, making a name for himself as someone willing to oppose anyone who Pence believed would not lead as a conservative.
