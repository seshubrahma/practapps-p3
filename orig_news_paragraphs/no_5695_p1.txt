The plaintiffs asked for a temporary restraining order to halt the order on an emergency basis.   In its amended complaint, the plaintiffs argue that "practices that discriminate against any of [Washington’s] inhabitants because of race, creed, color, or national origin are matters of public concern that threaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public welfare, health, and peace of the people. " Washington argued that roughly 7, 280 aliens in the Evergreen State are from countries impacted by the president’s order, and that the state has legal standing to litigate over possible economic detriments that companies within the state would endure as a result of the order. The   lawsuit argued that President Trump’s executive order violated a host of constitutional rights and federal statutes.
