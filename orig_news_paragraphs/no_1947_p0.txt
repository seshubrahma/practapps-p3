Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor expected to be nominated as the next commerce secretary, has made his fortune through the tricky business of buying deeply troubled companies. With wealth estimated at $2. 9 billion, Mr. Ross, who turns 79 on Monday, would join a cabinet that is already expected to include one of the superwealthy in Betsy DeVos, the nominee for secretary of education, and that may soon have others. In choosing Mr. Ross to be the face of American business for the rest of the world,   Donald J. Trump is turning not to a cautious corporate chieftain, but to a   speculator. Like his presumptive boss, Mr. Ross has been considered either a hero or a villain during his career.
