In this regard, an Attorney General Jeff Sessions will provide a marked contrast to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who made clear that she does not believe in basic job protections for American workers. It was Sessionsâ€™ tough prosecutorial style of questioning of Lynch during her confirmation hearing that prompted her to admit her belief that foreign nationals illegally present in the United States are entitled to the same rights as American citizens to get U. S. jobs. Sessions pointed out that her view on this matter was not only directly at odds with our immigration laws, but it also represented an affront to American workers. "With Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, American workers will finally have a seat at the table in Washington D. C.," said civil rights attorney Sara Blackwell, who represents   American workers of all backgrounds, races, and ethnicities that have been displaced and discriminated against in their own country by virtue of their American nationality.
