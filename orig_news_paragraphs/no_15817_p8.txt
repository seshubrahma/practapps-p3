Kasowitzâ€™ s other assertions that Comey leaked "privileged" information are patent nonsense, as Comey did not have an   relationship with the President, the leaked memos were not classified, and the President explicitly waived executive privilege. (Executive privilege would be inapplicable here in any event.)   If prosecutors pursue the crime of obstruction of justice, it would create a " " exception to both executive and   privileges in the unlikely event that they were even relevant to the conversations in question. The Kasowitz charges against Comey are going nowhere, though the Trump strategy has always been to punch back hard when attacked.
