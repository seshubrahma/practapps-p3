 (CNN) FBI Director James Comey was on Capitol Hill with other intelligence leaders on Tuesday to testify over the various email breaches of Democratic National Committee computers during the election campaign. It is unclear whether the testimony    or the analysis by 17 civilian and military intelligence agencies that all point to the role of Russia in the breaches    will persuade   Donald Trump to accept the evidence of what happened. But whatever his response, we can only hope that he accepts another troubling reality: The Internet as we know it is under threat.
