Cuban’s newfound   political platform has left him with a growing set of critics.    One  is Frank Zaccanelli, a Dallas   mogul who   was a part of the Mavericks ownership group headed by Texas   billionaire Ross Perot Jr. who sold the team to Cuban in 2000. " ’   Zaccanelli, who calls himself a "pretty good student of Mark   Cuban" although he "wouldn’’t say we’’re best friends or get along   great," blasted Cuban for some of his statements and decisions   during his   tenure as Trump’’s foil in the business world.
