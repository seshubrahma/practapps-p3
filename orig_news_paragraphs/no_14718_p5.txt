Moving the embassy to Jerusalem would mean that the US effectively recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, overturning decades of US foreign policy, and, many argue, would effectively signal the end of efforts to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Ziad Khalil Abu Zayyad, a spokesperson for the Palestinian party Fatah, warned that moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would set off an "explosion in the situation" in Jerusalem and the Middle East, according to the Palestinian Maan News Agency. Palestine Liberation Organization    Saeb Erakat has said the PLO would consider revoking its recognition of Israel if the US embassy was moved to Jerusalem.
