Alex Whiting, a Harvard Law School professor and former war crimes prosecutor, said much has changed since 2002, when Justice Department lawyers accepted C. I. A. assurances that there would be no   consequences for prisoners. " Evidence showing that the techniques employed by U. S. officials after   resulted in lasting psychological trauma will make it much more difficult for future lawyers to sanction these techniques as not amounting to torture," he said. Even lawyers and former senior officials who supported the interrogation program years ago now say the obstacles are too great.
