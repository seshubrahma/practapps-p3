Rubio says as he travels the country, people tell him that they feel like they are being left behind. He says the reason is simple â€”  in 2008, America elected a president who wants to change America instead of fixing America and make it more like the rest of the world. Rubio accuses Obama of undermining the Constitution and betraying our allies. A solid closing argument from Rubio.
