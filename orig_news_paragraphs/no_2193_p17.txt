If Brock Turner had been driving the victim in a car, and gotten into an accident resulting in the victim breaking several bones and bleeding profusely, nobody would consider calling him a violent person, even if the victim had been too drunk to stay out of the car. The victim has chosen to remain anonymous, presumably because she doesn’t want strangers who don’t know her passing judgment on her. I completely understand a father’s desire to speak kindly of his son.
