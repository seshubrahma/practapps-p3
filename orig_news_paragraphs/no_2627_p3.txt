The Clinton campaignâ€™s choice of Thomas E. Donilon, a former national security adviser to President Obama, to oversee this part of the transition reflects continuity with the Obama administration and underscores the differences between 2016 and 2008. When Mr. Obama became   he faced a Democratic foreign policy establishment that was split between those who supported him and those who backed Mrs. Clinton, but was eager to be back in power after eight years of Republican rule. This time, Mrs. Clinton would get to choose from a largely unified Democratic Party, with a strong bench of policy makers in diplomacy, defense and intelligence who have served in the Obama administration. And she would have the option of drawing from Republicans who have publicly disavowed Mr. Trump, including Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency, and Robert B. Zoellick, a former United States trade representative.
