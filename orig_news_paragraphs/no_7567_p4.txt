Of the others, interestingly, I thought that Trump and Cruz didn’t hurt themselves very much, but they didn’t help themselves, each of them had fairly rocky nights. I thought Trump on the defensive in the way he was kind nasty with Bush in saying, you know, attempting to shush him. Cruz interestingly, retreated when he was offered a chance to hit   —   or repeat his hit on Trump about personality and temperament.
