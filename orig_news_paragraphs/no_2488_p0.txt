When Donald J. Trump hosted a foreign leader for the first time as   the guest list included a curious entry: Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who looked on last month while he and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan chatted on a white couch high above Manhattan. Some 6, 700 miles from Trump Tower, in Tokyo, another exclusive gathering was already underway: a   private viewing of Ivanka Trump products, teeming with   treasures like a sample of the pale pink dress Ms. Trump wore to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention. Ms. Trump is nearing a licensing deal with the Japanese apparel giant Sanei International, both parties told The New York Times. The largest shareholder of Sanei’s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government.
