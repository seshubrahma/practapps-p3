Like her famous predecessor as a   Justice official, the Nixon administration’s Robert Bork who played a key role in the "Saturday Night Massacre," the recently confirmed Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand may soon inherit a key responsibility in the Justice Department chain of command. If Rosenstein recuses himself or is fired, it could be Brand’s role to supervise the Mueller investigation and execute any lawful orders issued by her boss, the President of the United States. The President’s Twitter trail suggests that firing Mr. Mueller could soon be on Ms. Brand’s busy agenda. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the chain of command within the Justice Department.
