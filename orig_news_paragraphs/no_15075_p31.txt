Syria just changed Donald Trump’s presidency, Schiff’s war authorization bill, which he first introduced during the Obama administration, would set limits on the war against ISIS, including not allowing the use of US ground combat forces in Iraq and Syria. It would also give temporary authority for military action   —   a change from the 2001 AUMF that critics say have been used for an   war on terror across the globe. The war authorization from Sen. Todd Young and Rep. Jim Banks, two Indiana Republicans, would not set the same limits.
