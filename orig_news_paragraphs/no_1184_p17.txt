" Seems like everything is moving to Boise or Twin Falls," said Janice Jacobson, 56, the manager of the King’s discount store in Gooding, a town of about 3, 500 people 45 minutes from Twin Falls. King’s, a chain of department stores that has been in business around the West since 1915, announced in February that it would close, unable to compete. Housing construction also never fully recovered from its boom years before the recession, leaving a shortage and prices that were out of reach for Cody and Becky Murphy.
