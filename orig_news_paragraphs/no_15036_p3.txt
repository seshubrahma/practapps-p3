A new retrospective exhibition of his work in Milan, titled "Oliviero Toscani: More than 50 years of Magnificent Failures," showcases 400 of Toscani’s powerful images and campaigns. Speaking to CNN at the exhibition, it’s clear the    photographer is still not afraid to voice his strong opinions, sounding off on freedom, migration and Donald Trump.   " Very few people are free," he explained, "and the few people who are free, they have to work harder to show other people how to get to their freedom."
