The Wall Street Journal writes that TPP —   which Sen. Rubio has said would be the "second pillar" of a President Rubio   foreign policy strategy —   would harm the U. S. automobile industry by dramatically favoring foreign imports over   exports. According to a study by Peter Petri, a professor of international finance at Brandeis University, under the TPP, the U. S. "auto sector is set to see a tangible impact. In the transportation sector, led by cars, the TPP could boost imports by an extra $30. 8 billion by 2025, compared with an exports gain of $7. 8 billion," the Wall Street Journal reports. While the Japanese auto industry has "hailed" the TPP agreement, American automakers including Ford —  recognizing that it would handicap domestic automobile production —   have come out against it.
