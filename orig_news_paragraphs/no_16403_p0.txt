 (CNN) Donald Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, said Saturday he plans to release his tax returns before Election Day, even as the GOP nominee has continued to resist calls to release his own tax returns. " When my tax returns are released, it’s going to be a quick read," Pence said Saturday in an interview on WABC Radio, adding that he is also in the process of completing his financial disclosure forms as required under federal law.
