Rarely has the European issue held such a   place on all the candidates’ platforms as in this electoral campaign," said analyst Pierre Vimont of the Carnegie Europe think tank.

None of the four main French candidates can afford to be neutral on the EU, whether they portray it as the source of all woes or a guarantee of peace and stability. Like Macron, conservative candidate Francois Fillon is bullish on Brussels, highlighting the   leadership axis and defending the euro.
