Lemon is 100% correct. Trump no doubt prefers tweeting to holding a press conference because there’s no one to challenge him to his face on factual inaccuracies or ask him   questions.   But if the media ignored his tweets, it could compel Trump to actually hold a press conference    which he hasn’t done since July    to explain the details of his proposals. Or possibly spur Trump to give a policy speech, complete with supporting data so we can properly evaluate it.
