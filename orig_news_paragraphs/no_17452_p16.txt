Kerry argued that current Israeli settlement policy in the region was leading toward a future of "one state and perpetual occupation" and slammed the arguments of   Israeli officials who argue settlements are aimed at bolstering Israel’s security. He also reserved special criticism for Netanyahu, whose governing coalition Kerry called "the most   in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements." " They’re leading towards one state," he said.
