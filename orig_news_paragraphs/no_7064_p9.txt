Matheny emphasized the importance of holding judges at both the state and federal level accountable for decisions that are not constitutional. There are three branches of government, Matheny noted, and the judiciary is just one of those three. It is not superior to the other two branches â€”  the executive and the legislative. Judges at the federal level who make decisions counter to the Constitution can and should be removed by the legislative branch, as is both their right and their duty, Matheny noted.
