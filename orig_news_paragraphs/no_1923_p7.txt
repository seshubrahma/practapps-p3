But Priebus, in a sense, filled a more exotic role. He would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up.

The simpler reading is that Trump hasnâ€™t thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign.
