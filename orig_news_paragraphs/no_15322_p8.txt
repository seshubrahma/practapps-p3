A small crowd of protesters that organized at Grand Central Station in New York marched west near Bryant Park. They carried signs with slogans, some reading, "Every species has a right to freedom" and "We’re here, we’re queer, we’re fabulous. " The group then marched Macy’s Herald Square and began chanting within the department store.
