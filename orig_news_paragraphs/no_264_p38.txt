Mr. Trump announced that he will nominate former Representative Heather Wilson as secretary of the Air Force, making her the first graduate of the Air Force Academy to serve in the role. Ms. Wilson, a Republican, represented New Mexico in the House from 1998 to 2009 but lost two races for the Senate. Since 2013, she has served as president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Her name had been floated for other administration positions, including director of national intelligence.
