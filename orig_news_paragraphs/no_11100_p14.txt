Other documents obtained by Judicial Watch show that the United States was also complicit with arms shipments from Benghazi to the jihadi rebel groups in Syria. These particular shipments were distinct from the more publicized case of al Entisar, a Libyan fishing vessel that arrived in Iskanderiyah, Turkey, crammed with weapons in late August 2012. The shipments described in this recently declassified document were sent directly to small Syrian ports under rebel control and included RPG   sniper rifles, and ammunition for 125mm and 155mm howitzers.
