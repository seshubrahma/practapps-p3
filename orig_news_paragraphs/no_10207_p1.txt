That’s right : Kasich has sat back, seen why Donald Trump has gotten more votes then any Republican in primary history, and, with that ridiculous   grin on his face, has the gall to totally give back most of what Trump has been saying since June 16th, when he first announced for the presidency. This is the same Kasich who said just the opposite in some instances, and yet the host sat there and didn’t bring it up! Friends, the fix is in: they want to throw the election to the Democrats.
