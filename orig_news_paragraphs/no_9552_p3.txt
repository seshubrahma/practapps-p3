When asked to reflect on his decision to commute the sentences of thousands of drug offenders, Obama indicated that he would not issue   political pardons before leaving office. Any presidential pardons, he explained, would go through a rigorous legal process to avoid looking political. " It’s going to be reviewed by the pardon attorney, it will be reviewed by my White House counsel, and I’m going to, as best as I can, make these decisions based on the merits, as opposed to political considerations," Obama said during a press conference.
