Even for those from the right countries or with the right skills, our bureaucracy makes it ridiculously slow and cumbersome to come here legally. If it took months or years to get a driverâ€™s license, how many of us would throw up our hands, get behind the wheel, and take our chances driving without one? You know who you are. The way to stop illegal entry is to spend our resources making legal entry efficient for people coming here for the right reasons.
