Public support for Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to launch airstrikes against the Syrian regime is low compared to support for previous foreign actions, according to the latest Gallup poll. [Polling data reveals that just 50 percent of Americans approve of airstrikes against the Assad regime, while 41 percent disapprove, while 10 percent have no opinion.   This figure is historically low compared to other military interventions, such as in Afghanistan in 2001, which had 90 percent approval rating compared to just 5 percent disapproval. George.
