NINA SIEGAL Parliament is expected to appoint an "informateur" to begin consultations with other parties on forming a government as soon as Friday. Next week, the new Parliament will meet for the first time and deliberate the process of creating a government. The process could take a few months, given the number of parties. Then the coalition names a cabinet, and King   swears in the ministers.
