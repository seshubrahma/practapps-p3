We are going to send in the red group to attack the police  …     to stop the police from stopping the yellow group from locking down. Then the red group runs off, goes into the crowd of peaceful demonstrators, the green group, takes their masks off and most of the people in the green group have no idea what just happened. So now the yellow group is successfully locked down across the road, the police have been attacked, they’re going after the violent protestors who attacked them, but they have to go into the crowd of peaceful protestors to find those violent people.
