You know seven years ago I was working for a call center owned by Lehman Brothers, trying to get people to pay for their mortgages they were defaulting on. At one point I was asked whether or not I wanted to do a training course to become a certified mortgage advisor. I thought that was a great idea. Thatâ€™s basically what I aspired to do.
