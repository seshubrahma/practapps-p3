ORLANDO, Fla.  —    The corner of Kaley Street and South Orange Avenue offers a tableau of American déjà vu, a sprawl of Subways and   so common in communities across the continent. This one just happens to include a gay nightclub popular with Latinos called Pulse, where gaping holes in the   exterior now reflect the infliction of a national traumatic injury. It’s easy to see Orlando as a place apart, our sanctuary of fantasy and escape, where fun trumps work and mouse ears are an accepted fashion accessory.
