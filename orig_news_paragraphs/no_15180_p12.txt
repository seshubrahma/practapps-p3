" A valid visa allows a foreign national to come to an international US airport and present themselves for inspection where a CBP officer will determine the travelerâ€™s admissibility."   The spokesman would not comment on the individual cases but he  pointed to an official list of more than 60 grounds for inadmissibility including security and health reasons, including stipulations over pregnancy and associated costs.
