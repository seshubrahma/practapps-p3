From Kristin Salaky writing at Talking Points Memo: Donald Trump brought the families of people killed by undocumented immigrants onstage with him to speak at a Thursday night rally in California. Trump said he found the families taking pictures outside of his rally and asked them to come onstage and share their stories. " Heâ€™s going to do everything he says," Jamiel Shaw, whose son was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant in 2008, said.
