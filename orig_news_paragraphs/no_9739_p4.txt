You have to understand the nature of the threats weâ€™re facing and how you deal with them. We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them. Frankly one concern I have with Donald is although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us.
