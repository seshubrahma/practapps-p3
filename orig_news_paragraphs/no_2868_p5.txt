Military officers and foreign policy specialists say General Mattis will most likely advocate some buildup in the 6, 000 American troops currently in Iraq but will argue for the increase only if it is tied to an overall strategy for the country after   Iraqi security forces defeat Islamic State militants in Mosul, as expected. " He does not fundamentally simplify the world in   military terms," said Michael E. O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. And unlike other candidates whom Mr. Trump has considered for top national security posts in his administration, like Mitt Romney or Rudolph W. Giuliani, General Mattis "will have the credibility to tell Trump when a military solution will not work," Mr. O’Hanlon said.
