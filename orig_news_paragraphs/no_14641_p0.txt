 (CNN) The FBI has joined the investigation of vandalism at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia to determine whether a hate crime occurred. Philadelphia police estimate 75 to 100 headstones were toppled Saturday night at Mount Carmel Cemetery, though people who visited the cemetery say the number is much higher.   Police have not offered a motive or made any arrests.
