Again" was the 1980 campaign slogan of Ronald Reagan, the last conservative to win the presidency, and his vice president George H. W. Bush. Even so, establishment Republicans like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Rubio and others have dismissed the slogan as Trump has risen to the top of the polls with it. Now, though, with Rubio saying it’s time to "  the principles that made America great," it appears he’s reversing his stance on even that to more fit the mood of the electorate as he’s struggling to rise in the polls any more than he has. In many ways, Rubio has been the GOP establishment’s last best hope.
