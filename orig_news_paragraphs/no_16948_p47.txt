That time didn’t even count early releases of prisoners under good behavior laws. Trump is arguing that regulations like bans on assault rifles won’t necessarily reduce gun violence, because Chicago’s tough laws haven’t stopped its gun violence. But using Chicago as an example doesn’t work: its regulations have been scaled back, its gun violence is affected by more lenient laws in other states and its punishments are not always tough on gun crime, potentially enabling repeat offenders.   Trump’s correlation between gun regulation effectiveness and Chicago’s gun violence is egregiously misleading, making his claim false.
