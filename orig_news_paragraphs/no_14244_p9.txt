Last summer, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) partnered to host a summit in Washington, D. C. focused on helping LGBTQ refugees in the age of ISIS. We issued guidance on what more the US government could do to help this population. Our report highlighted the need to provide LGBTQ Iraqis the opportunity to claim refugee status while still in their own country, reducing their processing time and allowing them to reach safety more quickly, and permitting lawyers to accompany LGBTQ refugees to protection and resettlement interviews. Never in our wildest dreams did we expect that in less than a year the entire United States refugee admissions program would grind to a halt.
