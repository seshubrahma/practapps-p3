Unlike the Davis and Maury statues, the Lee statue had "KKK" sprayed on it, as well as an expletive directed at Donald Trump. The defacement occurred as dozens of   marchers coursed through the streets of Richmond protesting against the peaceful transfer of power in Washington D. C. Richmond police spokesman James Mercante told the media, "Richmond police detectives take vandalism very seriously and remind everyone that any vandalism that is $1, 000 or more in damages can result in a charge of a felony. " At least ten protesters were arrested for blocking roadways during the unruly protests in Richmond on Wednesday.
