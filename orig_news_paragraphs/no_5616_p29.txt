If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing â€”  then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God.

This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between Good and Evil.
