On Friday morning, just off the House floor, Rep. Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican who announced his opposition to the bill Thursday, said he had felt "calm" about his plan to vote against the bill. No phone call, leadership pep talk nor Trump   would have convinced him to get to "yes. "  If his voters disagreed with him at the ballot box in 2018, so be it. "
