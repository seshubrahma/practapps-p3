"Rudy Giuliani is an extraordinarily talented and patriotic American. I will always be appreciative of his   dedication to our campaign after I won the primaries and for his extremely wise counsel," Trump said in the statement. " He is and continues to be a close personal friend, and as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date."
