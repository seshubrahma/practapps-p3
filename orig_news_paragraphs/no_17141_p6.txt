The event was held at the Ronald Reagan Building on Saturday. The day before, the group met at the Northwest Washington restaurant Maggiano’s which issued an apology Monday and told CNN that it would donate $10, 000 to the D. C. office of the   League. In a statement, the restaurant’s management said the booking was made last minute Friday and under a different name than the organization.   Trump’s transition team responded in a statement Monday saying Trump has "continued to denounce racism."
