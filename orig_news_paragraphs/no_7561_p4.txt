Those are the issues, frankly what I think is that people in the democratic process want real debate about the real issues. Youâ€™re right, inspector general just came out with a report, it was not a good report. But that is something that the American people, Democrats and delegates are going to have that take a hard look at. But for me right now I continue to focus on how we can rebuild an disappearing middle class, deal with poverty, guarantee healthcare to all of our people as a right.
