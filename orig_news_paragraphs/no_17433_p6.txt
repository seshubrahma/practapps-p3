Some studies determined that charter schools are not necessarily better, as a rule.   " We believe that the chance for the success of a child should not depend on winning a charter lottery, being accepted by a private school, or living in the right ZIP code," said Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, the largest teacher’s union, in a statement after DeVos was nominated in November.   Charter schools answer to the local bodies that oversee them, known as authorizers.
