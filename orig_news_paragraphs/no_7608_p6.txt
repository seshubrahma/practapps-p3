We had more than a hundred attacks on our facilities around the world since 2001. So we live in a complicated, dangerous world.   And so we do want to have a, a good conversation where people come to the table ready to actually learn about what we can do.   I’m afraid that’s, you know, not necessarily what this particular committee is doing, but we have learned a lot from our previous investigations, and I’m certainly, you know, committed to doing all I can to make sure we do save lives.
