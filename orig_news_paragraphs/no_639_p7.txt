Now, the Israeli political establishment, moving rightward, clearly believes it is the time to put its thumb on the scale. " I think what the president and prime minister were saying was any solution is possible and now we have to look at alternative solutions, and there are alternative solutions," said Michael Oren, a deputy minister for diplomacy in Mr. Netanyahu’s office. These, Mr. Oren told reporters, could involve "interim measures and recognition of the fact that there may be a   reality on the ground, which may not conform to what we know as a   solution, but would enable the Palestinians to lead their lives in prosperity and security"  —   and also benefit Israel.
