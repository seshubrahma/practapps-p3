The two issues are not linked under the deal    and if the US were to reinstate sanctions over Iran’s alleged ties to terrorism, the US would be in violation of the deal. Should the US break the terms of the agreement, it would upset the other partners of the deal, which was signed in July 2015    and Iran could consider the move a green light to restart its nuclear activity. Under the terms of the deal, Iran has agreed to reduce its stockpile of   uranium by 98% and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges.   In exchange, the United States and the European Union agreed to lift the sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy.
