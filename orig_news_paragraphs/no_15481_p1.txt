They include former Michigan Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, former George W. Bush homeland security adviser Fran Townsend, former Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher, special agent Adam Lee, acting Director Andrew McCabe, Sen. John Cornyn and judges Michael Garcia and Henry Hudson, all of whom were either spotted by CNN entering the building or were expected to be seen later Saturday. Interviews with additional individuals are expected Sunday if they can be arranged, a senior White House official said. President Donald Trump will read reports and recommendations from the interviews and then meet with a few leading candidates himself, the official said. There is no set number of finalists that the President has pledged to interview personally.
