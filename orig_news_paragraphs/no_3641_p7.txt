We will always remember that we are better than them, I’ll give you an example: the dumbass lecturer at Drexel who tweeted that what he wanted for Christmas was "white genocide". Should we be demanding that the university authorities sack him at once? Of course we shouldn’t. The man has performed an invaluable public service: he has provided the perfect example of how ingrained the values of the left are in academe he has shown prospective applicants to the Politics and Global Studies course at Drexel University in Philadelphia that unless they want to be indoctrinated with   lunacy they might want to reconsider he has further shown alumni of Drexel University who believe in old fashioned stuff like free markets that maybe they shouldn’t include their alma mater in their million dollar bequests, after all.
