As one of the video clips shows, the blue haired suspect is walking down the sidewalk, then crosses over some grass to a wall, where the suspect pulls out a can and shakes it before applying paint to the structure. On Tuesday officers with the Los Angeles Police Department detained a female suspect for possession of an open container while in public. The LASD reported that officers immediately recognized the   woman being sought for the vandalism of the historical landmarks. That woman is Victoria Jayne Bay, 37, a transient.
