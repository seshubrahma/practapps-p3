There, his course, Trump International Golf Links, has been rived with controversy, with Mr. Trump trying to push locals out of their homes, promising jobs that never materialized, fighting over an offshore wind farm and even suing the Scottish government. Mr. Trump, whose comments about Mexicans and Hispanics have enraged many, including members of his own party, is expected to be met with a giant Mexican flag flying in view of his clubhouse   —   an act of protest by two local men. Frank Cruickshanks, 52, who is a caddy at Mr. Trump’s property, including for Mr. Trump’s son Eric, said he appreciated the work Mr. Trump had put into overhauling the golf course.
