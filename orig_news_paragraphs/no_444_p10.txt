Though lawyers say they have repeatedly asked the government for a detailed list of those who were both detained and deported since the ruling went into effect, federal officials have not yet provided one. The government has said that no immigrants are currently in custody, but lawyers say that could be because some of them have already been improperly sent back to their homelands. " It is unlikely we have found the entire universe of people who have been removed," said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued for the immigrants at the hearing.
