While about nine in ten of the immigrants who came to the United States during the 19th and 20th century hailed from Europe, the 1965 law inverted that figure. Today about nine out of every ten new immigrants brought into the country on green cards come from   countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia or the Middle East. Following the lawâ€™s passage, 59 million immigrants entered the United States. Including their children, it added 72 million new residents to the U. S. population.
