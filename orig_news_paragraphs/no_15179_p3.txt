On Sunday, as part of celebrations to mark the birthday of late North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, state television aired a concert which included a video showing the US engulfed in flames.   The audience can be seen applauding as a band plays against the backdrop of a big screen showing tanks and missiles being fired.   The previous day, Pyongyang paraded its military hardware, including what could have been two intercontinental ballistic missile canisters. Tension has been building on the peninsula in recent days, amid warnings that the countryâ€™s nuclear site is "primed and ready" for another test.
