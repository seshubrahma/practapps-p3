" Going into Election Day [2012] we   were down about 326 votes. This time we were down, I want to say   a little over 700. We didn’’t translate that to being down double,   we knew we were going to have a big Election Day, knew   Republicans were going to turn out, because we had a state poll   that showed 62% of Republicans were going to vote on Election   Day.
