At press conference on Monday in New York City, the Stein camp defended its efforts to press forward with the recounts, saying they were taking their suit to federal court because of the "absolutely ridiculous and obscene form of bureaucratic obstruction"  that Stein said was occurring in Pennsylvania.   " It’s clear that the fix was in against a verified vote in the state of Pennsylvania," the Green Party candidate said. Still, Stein downplayed expectations that the recount effort would change the outcome of Pennsylvania’s vote in the 2016 election, saying instead that the effort was primarily aimed at ensuring the integrity of the voting process, discovering any irregularities, and sparking voting rights and voting infrastructure reforms.
