In addition, a large sculpture of aluminum and steel by Siah Armajani, an American artist born in Iran, was placed in the   lobby courtyard overlooking the garden. The   additions rupture the museum’s traditional narrative of Western modernism before 1945. Only very rarely has MoMA interrupted its succession of art from   to Cubism, Dadaism, and after  —   which still reflects the modernist vision of its first director, Alfred Barr  —   with works of postwar and contemporary art. Further additions are planned for the weeks ahead.
