In an official statement released later Saturday morning, Trump   referred to Castro as a "brutal dictator" who "oppressed his own   people" for decades. ’ ’    "Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft,   unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental   human rights," Trump said in the statement.      He added: "While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my   hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for   too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people   finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.
