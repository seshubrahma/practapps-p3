Even among Trump backers, 79% see them as a civic duty. The poll, conducted entirely after last Monday’s presidential debate, finds Clinton’s supporters increasingly enthusiastic about voting for president this year (50% are extremely or very enthusiastic now, up from 46% earlier in the month) while Trump backers’ enthusiasm has ticked downward, from 58% to 56%. Some of Clinton’s edge in this poll can be attributed to the effects of that enthusiasm shift on the makeup of the likely electorate.   In the   poll, Clinton’s backers were less likely than Trump supporters to be classified as likely voters because of the responses they gave to questions about their interest in the contest, intention to vote, and past vote history.
