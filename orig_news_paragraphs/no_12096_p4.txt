Though she has avoided making public statements about the number of total refugees she wants resettled annually, critics of the federal refugee resettlement program are convinced she supports the 200, 000 annual level put forward by the Refugee Council USA, the lobbying arm of the politically powerful refugee resettlement industry, whose executives include a number of former Obama and Clinton administration appointees. Breitbart News reported previously that 2, 058 refugees (subsequently restated by the Department of State as 2, 131) were resettled during the first five days of FY 2017, a daily average of 411, which set the Obama administration on a pace to bring in more than 150, 000 refugees  in FY 2017. In contrast, the daily average of arriving refugees in FY 2016, when 84, 995 refugee were resettled in the United States, was 233 (see chart above). The acceleration of refugee resettlement is even more stunning if the first three days of October are compared to the next three days.
