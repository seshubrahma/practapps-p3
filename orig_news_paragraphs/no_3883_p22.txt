They highlighted the fact that this was purely a response to what the Democrats had done, by phrasing the procedural issue as whether "the precedent of November 21, 2013," applied to Supreme Court nominations. By a vote of   senators issued a "judgment of the Senate" that the Democrats’ own rule applies here, abolishing the remaining judicial filibusters.
