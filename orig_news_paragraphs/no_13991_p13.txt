The inaugural event itself is a tightly formal affair on Capitol Hill and attendance is managed by a bipartisan team of congressional leaders and the  â€™s inaugural committee. Members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, members of the transition team, family members and other invited guests can attend, with some sitting on the inaugural platform where the President takes the oath office.   Former presidents and their families have also agreed to attend, including former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the election. Former President George H. W. Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush, had agreed to attend, but they have both been in the hospital since Saturday.
