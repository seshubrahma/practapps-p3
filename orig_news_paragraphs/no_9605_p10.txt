Microsoft does appear to have given more to Republicans in terms of the conventions, as it gave $1. 8 million in   contributions to the GOP convention’s host committee in Cleveland but gave $650, 000 in cash to the Democrats’ host committee in Philadelphia. PAC spending from Microsoft as an organization also includes $45, 000 to the RNC from the company’s PAC arm. Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos is "likely" to attend the meeting per the Recode report, saw its employees give $330, 895 to Clinton’s campaign while donating just $3, 112 to Trump’s campaign. Bezos also now owns the Washington Post, the biggest newspaper in the nation’s capital Washington, D. C. which faced enormous criticism for its     media coverage of the 2016 election.
