White House officials had sought the help of the bureau and other agencies investigating the Russia matter to say that the reports were wrong and that there had been no contacts, the officials said. The reports of the contacts were first published by The New York Times and CNN on February 14. The direct communications between the White House and the FBI were unusual because of   restrictions on such contacts. Such a request from the White House is a violation of procedures that limit communications with the FBI on pending investigations.
