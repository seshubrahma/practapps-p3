And so party activists, instinctively and ideologically   gathered around the iconic Sen. Barry Goldwater as they looked ahead to the next election in 1964.

And so whereas Nixon the establishmentarian lost narrowly in ’60, Goldwater the   lost in a landslide in ’64. We can quickly observe: In this election year, the country was looking for an outsider, and yet sometimes, as in ’64, the country is looking for an insider.
