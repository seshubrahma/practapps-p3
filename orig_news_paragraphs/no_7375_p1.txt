Barkley was indicted last week in Tompkins County Court on felony counts of   murder and menacing a police officer or peace officer," the Ithaca Journal reports: After fleeing from the scene, court papers say, Barkley fired a "sound shot" from his rifle to keep law enforcement officers from coming after him once he pulled into the driveway of his Dryden Road home. After a nearly   standoff, Barkley was taken into custody without a struggle and no injuries to himself or police.
