And unlike other candidates whom Mr. Trump has considered for top national security posts in his administration, like Mitt Romney or Rudolph W. Giuliani, General Mattis "will have the credibility to tell Trump when a military solution will not work," Mr. O’Hanlon said. To that end, General Mattis has advocated working more closely with allies in the region to strengthen ties with their spy agencies and to expand naval exercises, including international efforts to stop Iran from using mines to cripple the flow of oil and other global traffic. As the head of Central Command, the general pushed for "maintaining and diversifying the U. S. military presence in the Middle East amidst the Iraq drawdown, budget pressures and the rebalance to Asia," said Derek Chollet, a former assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. Three years later, General Mattis’s   views on Iran have not softened as he points out the country’s "malign influence," whether it is shipping weapons to rebels in Yemen or training Shiite militias bound for Syria or Iraq.
