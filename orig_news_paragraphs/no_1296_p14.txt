Until the 1990s, the most influential writer on the subject of the American right was Richard Hofstadter, a colleague of Trilling’s at Columbia University in the postwar years. Hofstadter was the leader of the "consensus" school of historians the "consensus" being Americans’ supposed agreement upon moderate liberalism as the nation’s natural governing philosophy. He didn’t take the   conservatives of his own time at all seriously. He called them "pseudoconservatives" and described, for instance, followers of the   Republican senator Joseph McCarthy as cranks who salved their "status anxiety" with conspiracy theories and bizarre panaceas.
