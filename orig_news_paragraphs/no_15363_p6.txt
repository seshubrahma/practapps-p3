Instead, the House, aided and abetted by President Trump, voted to cut taxes on the upper half in order to seriously gut the promise of universal health care.   As it happens, the taxes cut were only a third of the value of the tax break that was not changed (roughly $900 billion compared to $2. 7 trillion).   In sum, the top earners get to keep their full $250 billion a year of health care tax breaks, the thing that was supposed to be temporary.   The people at the top also get back the $80 billion in taxes they were paying to help the people at the bottom of the income scale get some insurance, the thing that was supposed to be permanent.
