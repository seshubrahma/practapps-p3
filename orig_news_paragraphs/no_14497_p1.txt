Ramirez is originally from Mexico and had twice been granted deferred action and employment authorization under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, his lawyers said. The program, created by President Barack Obamaâ€™s executive order in 2012, is meant to shield qualified individuals from deportation. Ramirez was detained by US immigration officials in Washington state last week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said Medina had admitted to being a gang member, while his attorneys denied that accusation and said he was not a threat to public safety.
