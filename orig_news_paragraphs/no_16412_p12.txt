Birthers in 2008 contacted nearly 80% of electors and urged them to withhold their vote for Barack Obama because of their concerns over his citizenship. They called upon electors to exercise their independence as a last defense against an Obama presidency.   I am certain members of the 2016 assemblage will also be lobbied    especially if Trump manages to win.    Given the acrimonious nature of the Republican primaries and his departure from many traditional Republican beliefs, it would appear that Trump would be ripe for elector defections.
