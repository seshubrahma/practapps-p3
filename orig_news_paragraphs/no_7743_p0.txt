Authorities are suspecting terrorism as the cause of the Egyptian jet crash over the Mediterranean Sea early this morning, but the White House doesn’t want to jump to conclusions. [White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest released a statement reminding Americans that it was unclear what caused the crash.   "At this time we do not yet know definitively what caused the disappearance of Flight 804," he said, while offering the country’s "deepest condolences" to the 66 people who were killed aboard the flight. The statement was released after a full day of investigating the crash, and a cautious response from the White House.
