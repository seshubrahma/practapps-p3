But only a few months ago that spread was at 48 percent for Clinton to Trump’s 35 percent. While the state’s big cities favor Clinton 58 percent to Trump’s 28 percent, it is the outlying areas and suburbs where the GOP nominee is gaining. In the suburban areas, for instance, Trump leads Clinton 41 to 37 percent while, in the rural sectors of the North Star State, Trump tops Clinton by a more lopsided 44 to 28 percent. In addition, independents are choosing Trump over Clinton by a wide margin with 42 percent going for Trump and 32 percent for Clinton.
