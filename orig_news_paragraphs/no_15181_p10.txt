Entitlements are unlimited reimbursements to states that expand to cover anyone eligible for help during times of need, such as a recession or disaster.

If thereâ€™s more demand for social services, states must make up the difference or cut benefits.   Congressional Republicans proposed block grant plans in their budgets last year and Trump discussed them during the campaign.
