[Sanders won over all four Democratic voters in the tiny town of Dixville, while Kasich sneaked past Donald Trump,   among Republicans.   Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. While that happened in three locations, Dixville traditionally gets most of the spotlight due to its   setup at the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel. Located about 20 miles from the Canadian border, Dixville exists as a town only for voting purposes.
