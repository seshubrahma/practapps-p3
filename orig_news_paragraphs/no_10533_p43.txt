The last time now Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, for instance, backed reducing immigration —  something he once supported strongly, but no longer does —   was in 1993, just after George H. W. Bush’s only term as president and as Bill Clinton began his first term as president. That was before the establishment of both parties officially veered away from protecting American workers toward the bitter —  and often meaningless —  partisan bickering on Capitol Hill, back when Congress used to represent Americans not special interests. Open borders style trade and immigration combined are a double whammy against American workers.
