And it’s been that way since well before Perry’s comment in 2011. (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a landmark report in 2007 stating that "warming of the climate system is unequivocal" and that "most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the   century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic [greenhouse gas] concentrations. " If Perry has somehow evolved his views since 2011 he should say so.)
