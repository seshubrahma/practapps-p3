Harvard University will not designate itself as a "sanctuary campus," which would have shielded illegal immigrant students from federal immigration law, university President Drew G. Faust announced. [Faust, who was lobbied by students advocating for   university policies, denied a request to transform Harvard into a campus where federal immigration officials with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency are banned from campus, the Harvard Crimson reported.   " [The sanctuary campus policy] also risks drawing special attention to the students in ways that could put their status in greater jeopardy," Faust said during a Harvard faculty meeting.
