In Shakespeare’s plays, the fool was able to address social and political realities in ways that the lead characters rarely could    using humor as his shield. And even before Shakespeare, Dutch writer Erasmus wrote that the fool "can speak truth and even open insults and be heard with positive pleasure indeed, the words which would cost a wise man his life are surprisingly enjoyable when uttered by a clown."   So here’s to the fools! May you fearlessly continue to use your wit and humor to resist Trump.
