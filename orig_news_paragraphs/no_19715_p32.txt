Some of my work, at least, is clearly exploring the weird things that markets do. They screw up the value of baseball players they screw up the value of   securities. Even the political book I wrote, I found myself drawn to a candidate the process had no time for because his type wasn’t valued. So the distortion of value that goes on in markets or in people’s minds directly connects up to [Kahneman and Tversky’s] work.
