Ryan and other leaders discussed ideas for adding replacement into an upcoming budget reconciliation bill    the vehicle through which Republicans plan to roll back Obamacare. But the speaker admitted that they haven’t decided yet how much of the law they can dismantle or replace with this approach, pointing out that there are rules limiting what the budget reconciliation bill can include.   "We will pass as much as we can through whatever vehicle we’ve got and then we will pass all the other things through regular order outside of reconciliation that show you the full scope of what a real replacement effort will look like," Ryan said.   Florida GOP Rep. Dennis Ross told reporters that the hope is to "do as much replacement as we can get away with in the reconciliation package" before throwing the ball back to the Senate.
