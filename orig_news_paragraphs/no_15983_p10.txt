Nearly    Democrats say their party is united now (31%) or will be by November (48%) while on the GOP side, just    think the party will unite by November (11% united now, 49% by November). Beyond their    favorability ratings, questions about Clinton’s honesty and Trump’s temperament have been persistent throughout the campaign.   The poll finds Clinton widely viewed as having the better temperament for the presidency (56% say so vs. 32% who feel Trump is temperamentally   for the White House) while Trump has picked up some ground over Clinton when voters are asked who is more honest and trustworthy (45% say Trump, 37% Clinton, a near reversal since March).
