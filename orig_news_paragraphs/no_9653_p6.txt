More interesting, perhaps, is that, while Trumpâ€™s favorable rating is low, the rating for the Republican party as a whole is far worse. Only 34 percent of voters have a positive view of the GOP, while 60 percent have a negative view. Trump is actually seven points more popular than the Republican party itself. In the case of Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, though, the opposite is true.
