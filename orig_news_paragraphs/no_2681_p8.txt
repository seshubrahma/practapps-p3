Why does the F. B. I. care if there is classified information in the emails? Under federal law, mishandling national security information is a crime, one that the F. B. I. is responsible for investigating. In 2015, the bureau began investigating the personal email account that Mrs. Clinton had used exclusively as secretary of state. As part of that investigation, the bureau tried to find every electronic device  —   phones, tablets, computers  —   that Mrs. Clinton and her aides used.
