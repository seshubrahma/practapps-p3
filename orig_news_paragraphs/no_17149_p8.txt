This proposal, already under negotiation, will now receive renewed interest from states who were previously part of the TPP arrangement.   Before Trump’s announcement, Prime Minister Abe said that there would be a shift in thinking towards participating in China’s proposal were the TPP to fail.   Indonesia, which had not taken part in the TPP, has forwarded a different suggestion.   At the recently concluded APEC summit held in Lima, Peru, Indonesian   M Jusuf Kalla proposed an economic group comprising the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) together with The Pacific Alliance, a collection of four   American states.
