Alptekin told CNN on Friday that his firm is in no way funded by the Turkish government and said he contracted Flynnâ€™s firm because "my company has clients that are best served when   relations enjoy continuity. " Alptekin said Flynn "made no representation about what he would do for Turkey" in a potential US admininstration and said he "did not say a single word about any position that he would occupy. "
