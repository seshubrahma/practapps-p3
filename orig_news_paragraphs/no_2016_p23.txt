" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s announcement that he will visit Pearl Harbor, the U. S. naval base that Japan attacked in World War II, effectively reciprocates President Obama’s May trip to the Japanese city of Hiroshima, above, where the U. S. used a nuclear bomb to end the war. Mr. Abe’s visit to Hawaii is set for Dec. 26 and 27, just weeks after the 75th anniversary of the attack in Hawaii, which happened on Dec. 7, 1941. _
