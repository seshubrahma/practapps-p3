In a major address in   Ohio, Trump sought to recreate the strongman persona that powered his political rise. The Republican nominee, reeling from   wounds that played into his rival Hillary Clintonâ€™s charge that he lacks the temperament to be commander in chief, promised an   struggle with Islamic terror modeled on the Cold War. He demanded tough values tests for   immigrants to the United States and pledged to come down hard on American Muslims suspected of radicalism. He vowed to keep Guantanamo Bay open, to join Russia to battle terrorism in the Middle East and to launch a "commission" on radical Islam.
