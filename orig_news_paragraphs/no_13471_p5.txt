Sessions, whose favorite book is To Kill a Mockingbird authored by his fellow native Alabamian Harper Lee, was credited during the hearing for helping to obtain the first death penalty conviction of a white man for the murder of a black citizen in Alabama since before World War I. Throughout the hearing, multiple civil rights leaders testified to Sessions’ dedication and "unequivocal commitment to the prosecution of criminal civil rights cases " —   describing him as a prosecutor who went "above and beyond" the call of duty to aid the civil rights division of the Department of Justice at a time when it was not always politically popular to do so in the South. During the course of the hearing, Judge Cain Kennedy, an African American judge on Alabama’s 13th judicial circuit court, testified to Sessions’ "excellent" reputation in a letter he signed with the other circuit judges.
