CNNâ€™s Bash points out that Eric Trump is doing what his father failed to do last week before a record debate audience. Eric Trump says the difference between his dad and Clinton is that Clinton has lived off the government. He says his father has paid a "tremendous amount" of taxes, including federal income tax. He says Clinton has never signed the front of a paycheck while his father has employed tens of thousands of people.
