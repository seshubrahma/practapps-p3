A year later, despite the passage of a bill that required warning labels on cigarette packages, not much had changed. In our September 1965 issue, Elizabeth Drew explained why: Behind the facade of a requirement for printing a warning on cigarette packages (which is not expected to deter smoking much) Congress tied the hands of the Federal Trade Commission by forbidding it to proceed with its own plans to apply much more stringent regulations. Had it not been for Congress, the FTC, which is charged with preventing unfair and deceptive trade practices, would have required a warning both on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising. The effect of the advertising regulation is what the cigarette industry most feared Congress obliged by forbidding it for at least four years.
