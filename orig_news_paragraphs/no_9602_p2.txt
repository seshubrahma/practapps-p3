Students from the   school were offended by what they believed were racially motivated chants to "build a wall," a reference to   Donald Trump’s pledge to secure the U. S.  border. The incident occurred on Friday night during the Class 2A regional match held in the west Texas community of Snyder. Carlos Urias, a Van Horn, Texas, resident, posted a photo (shown above) that showed a group students from Archer City High School holding up a   sign and waving the Texas and Gonzales flags. The Gonzales flag is a Texas historical flag from the state’s war of independence from Mexico.
