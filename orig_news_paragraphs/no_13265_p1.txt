The Federal Register grew slowly to 80, 250 pages over the next seven years, and then a little faster to 81, 640 pages in early November 2016. Obama grew the Federal Register by less than three percent in 7. 8 years, but the bureaucratic regulatory machine has gone ballistic over the last six weeks. Breitbart News reported in May that a study that found increased "regulatory drag" had not only eliminated about a third of U. S. economic growth since 1980, but it also explained why the top "one percentâ€™s   share of income has tripled, while the middle class has lost income," according to the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Mercatus researchers documented that the annual cost to the U. S. Gross Domestic Product for regulatory expansion since 1980 has averaged a negative  .8 percent per year.
