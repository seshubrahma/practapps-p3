Saudi Arabia accused Qatar in its statement of "adopting" groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood.   Qatar denies that it funds or supports extremist groups.   However, the   Arab coalition fighting Yemen’s Houthi rebels also expelled Qatar from its alliance, alleging support of "al Qaeda and Daesh [also known as ISIS] as well as dealing with the rebel militias," according to Saudi’s state media agency. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar form a close regional alliance known as the Gulf Cooperation Council, established in 1981.
