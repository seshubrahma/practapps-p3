#NeverTrump is becoming #NeverTed which is bad so Rubio needs to drop out. I helped launch the #NeverTrump movement with my piece written late two Fridayâ€™s ago. That night it got over 60, 000 hits and the #NeverTrump hashtag became a worldwide trend. Credit for the hashtag goes to my friend Aaron Gardner.
