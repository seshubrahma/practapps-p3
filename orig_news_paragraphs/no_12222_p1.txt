The tremendous anger of the current U. S. electorate  —   whether Republican, Democrat or independent   —   is a result of people fearful about the future, concerned with the direction of our country and tremendously frustrated by the abject failure and inability of leaders in Washington, D. C. to make anything better. American voters have made it clear that Washington is broken, but I’m not optimistic that either of the leading candidates for President will put us on a better course. The American Presidency is an office that goes beyond just politics.
