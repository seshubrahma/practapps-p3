All options are on the table," Tillerson said, clarifying to one reporter that these options did include a military last resort. Tillerson also repeated on multiple stops during his Asia trip that he hoped to see North Koreaâ€™s closest ally, China, take steps to ensure that Pyongyang abides by United Nations sanctions. In China, Tillerson emphasized issues on which the two nations agreed, though reports suggest that he privately urged Beijing to cut economic ties with North Korea.
