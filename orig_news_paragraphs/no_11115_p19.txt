Allison noted: The Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, requires lobbyists for foreign governments and political parties to disclose to the Justice Department detailed information about their activities on behalf of their clients. They have to disclose all contacts with U. S. government officials, any campaign contributions theyâ€™ve given, fees they receive from clients and expenses incurred in lobbying. They also have to disclose any "informational materials" (originally called propaganda) disseminated on behalf of their clients.
