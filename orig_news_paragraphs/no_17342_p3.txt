It comes nowhere near to addressing all the missing and relevant information he needs to supply to the Senate Judiciary Committee before hearings can move forward," Marge Baker, executive vice president of People For the American Way, said in a statement. Sen. Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee, announced last week that the Sessions hearing for the attorney general post will take place on January   but the top Democrat on the committee, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, continues to push back. Last week, Feinstein requested more time to review Sessions’ "voluminous record" and noted his incomplete production of certain materials. On Tuesday, Feinstein renewed her call on Grassley to allow her committee staff sufficient time to review the   pages of records Sessions has submitted    this time noting: "(d) espite being voluminous, Sen. Sessions’ production appears to have been put together in haste and is, on its face, incomplete.
