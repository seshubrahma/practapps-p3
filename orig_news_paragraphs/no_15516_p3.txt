May 3, Comey, testifying before senators in a committee hearing, says he’s "mildly nauseous" at the idea he influenced the election when he reopened the Clinton email investigation. Still, he defended his decision to do so. At the time, Trump said that Comey’s decision "took guts" and that the FBI chief "brought back his reputation" by reopening the investigation.    In his testimony, Comey says he publicly announced his conclusions in the Clinton email investigation after deciding the Justice Department’s credibility had been affected by   General Loretta Lynch’s airport tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton.
