In January 2010, the Open Society earmarked $2 million per year for the Fund to provide grants to organizations in North Carolina and Texas. The hacked memo recommended that Soros’s Fund provide $1, 075, 000 in grants to eleven local groups, including $120, 000 over one year to the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP.
