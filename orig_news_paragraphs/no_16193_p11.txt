The focus of the night was supposed to be on the economy, but it was Clinton who was in the spotlight. Michael Mukasey, a former attorney general under George W. Bush, said Clinton lied about her motivations in setting up a private email server while secretary of state and said that disqualified her from being President. " Hillary Clinton is asking the people of this country and the people of the United States to make her the first President in history to take the oath of office after already having violated it," he said.
