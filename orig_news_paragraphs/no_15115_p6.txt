North Korean officials told CNN in Pyongyang this week that the decision by US President Donald Trump to bomb a Syrian airfield, as well as his dispatching a US navy carrier strike group to northern Asia, showed the importance of the nuclear program.   " The aggressive acts of war on the part of the United States are getting increasingly reckless," the official said. Trump has promised to "be effective" on North Korea, and called on China to play a role containing the regimeâ€™s nuclear program.
