Easy" on the whole was aimless and   but this one episode shines thanks to terrific performances, a perfectly depicted    mood, and one of the richest, most beautiful TV scores of the year. Gugu   plays Sophie, an actress going through the final phases of a breakup while poised for a big break professionally. Jane Adams plays Annabelle, one of Sophie’s   and confidants, who’s startled and saddened to find herself single at this point in her life. These two performances are extraordinarily full, especially given how sparse the dialogue on the show is, and Jake Weber’s warm sexiness as Annabelle’s amiable booty call is a special treat.
