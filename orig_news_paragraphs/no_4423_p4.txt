SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked why so many American leaders talk about moving the embassy to Jerusalem but never actually do it. Bolton replied that while there is "strong feeling about moving the embassy" among the general public not just among Jewish Americans, but also among dedicated Christian supporters of Israel, American politicians were given pause by the potential political fallout. He suggested that on the contrary, they should see moving the embassy as a domestic political winner. Another reason the embassy does not get moved is the U. S. State Departmentâ€™s view that "the status of Jerusalem is a matter for the final negotiations in the creation of a Palestinian state. "
