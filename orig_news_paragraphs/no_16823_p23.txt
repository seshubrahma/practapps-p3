In an apparent departure from Trumpâ€™s stated policy on Syria, Pence said the US should be open to military action against Syrian targets of the regime of President Bashar   if what he called Russian provocations    namely attacks on civilians in besieged   areas of the city of Aleppo    continue. " I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength, and if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo," Pence said. He also called for the setting up of safe zones for civilians in Syria    an idea that has been considered by the US government    and also backed by Clinton, But it has been judged impractical given the military complications it could entail    including direct confrontations between US and Russian military aircraft over Syria.
