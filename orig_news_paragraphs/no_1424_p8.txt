A friend, Brandon Wolf, watched people carry Mr. Guerrero outside, his body riddled with gunshot wounds. But no one knew what had become of Mr. Leinonen. His mother, Christine, anxious because of health problems, had woken at 3 a. m. to news of the shooting, and learned from Mr. Wolf that her son had been inside. A   standoff followed the initial assault, with people inside effectively held hostage until around 5 a. m. when law enforcement officials led by a SWAT team raided the club, using an armored vehicle and explosives designed to disorient and distract.
