Gay rights are supported across the political spectrum in the Netherlands. The attack comes as the country has been grappling with growing   sentiment, fueled in part by the   leader Geert Wilders, who has railed against immigrants and Muslims in particular, saying that "Islamization" is a threat to European liberal values, including gay rights and womenâ€™s rights. The populist party of Mr. Wilders, who likens himself to Donald J. Trump, came second in recent Dutch elections. He is an ideological heir of Pim Fortuyn, a   politician who derided Islam, immigration and multiculturalism, and who was openly gay.
