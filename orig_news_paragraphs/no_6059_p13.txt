Melinda Gates Foundation, Google and the National Endowment for Democracy. Poynterâ€™s IFCN is also funded by the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit of liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The Omidyar Network has partnered with Open Society on numerous projects and has given grants to third parties using the   Tides Foundation. Tides is one of the largest donors to   causes in the U. S. Omidyar also recently provided seed capital to the   League (ADL) whose chief has baselessly smeared Breitbart News with claims of   associations, for plans to build a Silicon Valley command center that says it is aimed at combating online hate.
