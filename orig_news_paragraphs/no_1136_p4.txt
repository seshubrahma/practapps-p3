Telecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as   utility services, which are subject to   and   rules. They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers. Mr. Spicer made his comments after Congress voted this week to complete its overturning of   internet privacy protections and to allow broadband companies to track and sell their customersâ€™ online information with greater ease. The vote was seen as a prelude to further deregulation for broadband companies.
