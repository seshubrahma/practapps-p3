On Wednesday, as details of Trumpâ€™s plan first percolated, Secret Service halted all traffic on Belmont Road with newly installed concrete barriers feet from where President Barack Obama and his family are beginning their   House life.   Around the corner on Tracy Place, first daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a   senior White House adviser, showed signs of settling into their new Washington home, installing a swingset in the backyard.   Steps away on Massachusetts Avenue, traffic was temporarily stopped as Trump and his motorcade zipped up to the Department of Homeland Security.   And, like all days, Muslims parked nearby and gathered for prayers at the Islamic Center on the corner of Belmont and Massachusetts.
