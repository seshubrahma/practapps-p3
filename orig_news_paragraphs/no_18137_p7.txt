It was represented to me that these are precisely the     same materials that were provided to the Chairman over a week     ago. While I cannot discuss the content of the documents, if     the White House had any concern over these materials, they     should have been shared with the full committees in the first     place as a part of our ordinary oversight responsibilities.   ’ ’      Nothing I could see today warranted a departure from the normal     review procedures, and these materials should now be provided     to the full membership of both committees. The White House has     yet to explain why senior White House staff apparently shared     these materials with but one member of either committee, only     for their contents to be briefed back to the White House.
