 (CNN) WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeated his claim that the Russian government was not the source of hacked Democratic campaign emails his organization released before the US presidential election. The Obama administration, citing US intelligence sources, has accused Russia of orchestrating the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an attempt to influence the electionâ€™s outcome.   The administration says it is "100% certain" about Russian involvement, but   Donald Trump has frequently cast doubt on the veracity of the claims.
