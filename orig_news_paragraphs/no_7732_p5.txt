So I don’t fault Mr. Trump for his faults. He doesn’t have to pretend to be perfect when he isn’t. We can leave that sort of phony    building to the other side. And when I hear Republican and conservative elites lecture the rest of us about Trump’s supposed deviations from their ideological strictures, or his shortcomings as a human being, I think about what Jesus said about casting the first stone.
