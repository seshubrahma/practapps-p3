Washington (CNN) Utah Republican Gov. Gary Herbert posted a photo of a refugee family arriving at the Salt Lake City International Airport Thursday, the last to arrive in the state before President Donald Trumpâ€™s   suspension of refugees entering the US went into effect. The Afghanistan family fled to Pakistan when the Taliban came to their village, Danielle Stamos, a spokeswoman for the Catholic Community Services of Utah, told CNN. Catholic Community Services of Utah staff planned to welcome the family, but after staff members began inviting others to join, "it exploded," Stamos said, and about 400 people were on hand at the airport to greet them.
