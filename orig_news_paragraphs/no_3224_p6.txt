If getting "outside the box" was the goal of this ad, 84 Lumber definitely achieved that. Still, it’s interesting that the NFL is so tightly policing this particular Super Bowl. They did not exercise such oversight last year when Beyoncé performed her extremely   song "Formation," during the halftime show. Of course, that event occurred during a   and   halftime show and not in a   commercial ad, such as what’s happening here with 84 Lumber.
