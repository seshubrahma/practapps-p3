Q. How did this piece come together? A. "One Dark Night" is sourced entirely from 911 calls, trial testimony and architectural drawings of the condo complex where the shooting took place. Iâ€™m still an investigative journalist at heart, and it was very much the kind of story I used to cover as a print reporter.
