Hosni Mubarak, the former president of Egypt, was quietly freed from a hospital in Cairo where he had been detained, disappointing Egyptians who hoped to punish him further for decades of corruption and human rights abuses.

Mr. Mubarak, 88, will now enjoy the typical benefits of a former head of state, including a security detail. _
