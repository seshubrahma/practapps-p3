The only lingering mystery is why so many Republicans think they can counter this strategy by appeasing Democrats.    At a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars in other people’s money, Republicans purchase a couple of sound bites that allow them to claim they aren’t heartless monsters because they funded every   priority, from "sanctuary cities" to Planned Parenthood.   In reality, these capitulations don’t win Republicans anything. Democrats will still depict them as tightwads on welfare spending, reactionaries on social policy, and footmen to the evil rich.
