One   senator, Chuck Schumer ( ) persuaded most of his colleagues to begin filibustering nominees they did not support, even when some Democrats were willing to join with the Republican majority to confirm them. Roberts got through to the D. C. Circuit anyway, but others —  like Miguel Estrada, another nominee to the D. C. Circuit —  were blocked. As Republicans continued to gain seats in the Senate, Democrats considered taking things to still another low. They decided against filibustering Roberts’s nomination to the Supreme Court, but tried to do so on Alito.
