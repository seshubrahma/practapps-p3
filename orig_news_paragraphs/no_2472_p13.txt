After Britain rebuffed Mr. Trumpâ€™s suggestion to name Nigel Farage, a leader of the "Brexit" campaign to leave the European Union, as ambassador to the United States, The Times of London reported that Mr. Farage may move to America anyway. In many places, there is still much head scratching over Mr. Trump. The   Bild Zeitung in Germany secured exclusive rights to translating into German the whole interview Mr. Trump gave to The New York Times last week. Bungeishunju, the Japanese publisher of "Trump Revealed," by the Washington Post journalists Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, reprinted an additional 10, 000 copies.
