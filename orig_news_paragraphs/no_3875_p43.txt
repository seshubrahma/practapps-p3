Today is my birthday, so I look at this almost as a birthday gift for me. We’re going to open for the first time higher than 20, 000 on my birthday, and it’s largely because we elected a guy who is going to improve the American economy, and it’s going to just keep happening. It’s a very helpful sign, not just for investors. Investors are enthusiastic because they believe the economy is getting better.
