The split between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich is always tough to predict. But in general, the   vote breaks along the lines of cultural liberalism and conservatism. Mr. Cruz does better (and Mr. Kasich does worse) in areas with more evangelical Christians, more white Republicans and fewer people with postgraduate educations. Mr. Cruz also does better in areas that look more like the "traditional" Republican Party  â€”   conservative areas with more families and married couples and people whose heritage is Protestant northwest Europe.
