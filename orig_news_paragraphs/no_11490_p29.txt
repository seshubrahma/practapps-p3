That aside, I agree with, I think, the premise of your point that you just made, and that is Beck, or Breitbart, or you or me, is a distraction. The issue here isn’t what Beck says or his endorsement. And in fact it may be a distraction because of Beck’s personality and his public persona. But I’m not going to allow Beck to become the issue when people ask me are evangelicals being faithful to the very Bible that they hold dear.
