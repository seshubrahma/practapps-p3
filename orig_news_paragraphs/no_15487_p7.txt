As a black person in this country, I am always frustrated by the lack of attention my peopleâ€™s issues get. But at least the news and politicians are talking about not talking about our issues. Native issues are basically ignored.   That was overwhelmingly the case until last year when the media began to report on the camps at the Standing Rock Reservation in North and South Dakota.
