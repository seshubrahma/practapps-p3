 (CNN) Former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson won the backing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Monday to be secretary of state when it voted   to send his nomination to the full Senate. Sen. Marco Rubio was a long   and potential "no" vote after he raised concerns about Tillersonâ€™s views toward Russia and human rights. But the Florida Republican announced earlier Monday that he would support the nomination.
