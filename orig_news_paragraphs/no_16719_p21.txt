Also interesting is the design of the building. Sitting next to the Washington Monument on the National Mall, the exterior is made up of 3, 600   panels. The architects of the building drew on imagery from both African and American history for the outer layer, saying they were trying to reach towards the sky to express faith, hope and resiliency. The building is   and is inspired by a traditional wooden column that features a crown or corona    or African headdress    at the top.
