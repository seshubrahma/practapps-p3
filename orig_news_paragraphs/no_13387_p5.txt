—   Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) October 25, 2016,   Stein is a Harvard Medical School graduate, a mother to two sons, and a practicing physician, who became an   activist and organizer in the late 1990s. As the Green Party’s 2012 presidential candidate, Stein holds the record for the most votes ever received by a female candidate for president in a general election. While third party Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson has received quite a bit of media attention throughout this election, Stein says she has experienced a virtual media blackout.
