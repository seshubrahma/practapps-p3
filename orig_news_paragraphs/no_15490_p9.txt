" Clapper told NBC in March that he didn’t know of any evidence that demonstrated collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. At a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing earlier this month, Clapper clarified that statement, saying he was also unaware of the FBI’s investigation into the matter until Comey made it public in March.   At that subcommittee hearing, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, whom Trump fired in January for refusing to defend his initial temporary ban on visitors from several   countries and suspension of the entry of Syrian refugees, declined to answer the question of whether there was evidence of collusion publicly in her answer, she also noted that Clapper had been unaware of the FBI investigation.
