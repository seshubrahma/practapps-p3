Why don’t they take that presidential plane and fly into Pearl Harbor and have the President of Japan, who’s lecturing a President of the United States in front of the world, why don’t you go to Pearl Harbor and sit there and apologize to the dead that are still at the USS Arizona today! They’ve never been brought out. They’re down there right now. Why don’t we get him to come over and apologize?
