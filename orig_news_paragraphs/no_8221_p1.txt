Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning a majority of pledged delegates on the first ballot. But he is angling to place enough of his supporters on delegate slates that he can overthrow Trump on a second ballot.

Fiorina has been a Cruz supporter for some time, and she recently   her super PAC in an apparent bid to campaign for the vice presidency.
