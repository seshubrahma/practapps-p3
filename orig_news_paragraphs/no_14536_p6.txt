1973    Fred and Donald Trump are named in a Justice Department lawsuit alleging Trump property managers violated the Fair Housing Act by turning away potential   tenants. The Trumps deny the company discriminates and file a $100 million countersuit, which is later dismissed. The case is settled in 1975, and the Trumps agree to provide weekly lists of vacancies to black community organizations.
