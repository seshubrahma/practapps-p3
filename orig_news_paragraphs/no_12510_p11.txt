Although the official policy of the United States is to not supply   weapons to the Libyan opposition, there has been a great deal of reporting that the Obama administration was, in fact, supplying the weapons through the Central Intelligence Agency.   In 2013, Michael B Kelley and Geoffrey Ingersoll reported that there was a "September shipment of        missiles ( i. e. MANPADS) and   grenades from Benghazi to Syria through southern Turkey" and said it may have been connected to slain Ambassador Chris Stevens, who died in the September 11, 2012 attack by jihadists on the Embassy House and CIA annex.
