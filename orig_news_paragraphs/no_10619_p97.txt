It is a curious fact that only 3% of the Syrian refugees brought to America are Christian. Could be the subject of a talk by itself. The best example of how Islam expects to be treated as a minority and how it then treats minorities is in Indonesia, which I wrote about along with my colleague Allum Bokhari. Indonesia is the largest Muslim country on earth, but is considered "moderate" a designation that is essentially mythical.
