Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson is being excluded from the presidential debate, even though heâ€™s pulling 9 percent in many states, and even 13 percent in Colorado. [The exclusion was announced Friday afternoon by the privately run Commission on Presidential Debates, whose board includes many established Democratic and GOP players.   Green Party candidate Jill Stein was also excluded. The board had earlier said it would exclude candidates who did not get 15 percent support in polls.
