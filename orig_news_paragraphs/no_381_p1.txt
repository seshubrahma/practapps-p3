American divisions are rapidly widening over President Trump’s order to close the U. S. to refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Implemented with little regard for basic governance, the measure drew support from Mr. Trump’s supporters but criticism from   protesters, Silicon Valley, some members of his own party, State Department diplomats and even former President Obama. Mr. Trump fired the acting attorney general, a holdover from the Obama administration, after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend the order. World leaders have objected to the order, but the leaders of U. S. allies are faced with either openly criticizing Mr. Trump or facing protests at home, like the one above in Scotland.
