We believe this is a devastating blow to manatees," Executive Director Patrick Rose said in a statement. The club has been concerned about the concentration of manatees during the winter outside power plants, particularly in the northern part of the state. That makes them too dependent on artificially warm water, the club says. While the number of counted manatees increased, so, too, did the losses to   injuries.
