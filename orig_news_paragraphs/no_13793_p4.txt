The press pool, a small group of journalists assigned to cover the president, exists to keep Americans informed about the presidentâ€™s whereabouts. In the case of an emergency, the president and his team often relies on journalists to quickly relay information to the American people. Trump has abandoned his press pool several times since his election victory in early November.
