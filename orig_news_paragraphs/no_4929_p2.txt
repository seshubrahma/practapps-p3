Freedom Coalition is thrilled by this nomination and will work tirelessly for the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch. Michael A. Needham, CEO of Heritage Action for America, said: Judge Neil Gorsuch is a nominee ‘very much in the mold’ of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Trump deserves credit for fulfilling his campaign pledge by nominating an individual who will, based on his record, interpret the text of the Constitution rather than create unwritten rights supposedly hidden between the lines.
