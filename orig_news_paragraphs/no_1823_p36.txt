, visitors may pay what they wish. I went to a great exhibit on sports photography, "Who Shot Sports," as well as a   exhibit of beautiful Williamsburg housing project murals of the 1930s. If you’re going to the museum, it’s worth your time to visit the adjacent botanic garden as well (and maybe stop at the Mister Softee truck parked on Washington Avenue on your way). A combo ticket to the museum and garden is $23
