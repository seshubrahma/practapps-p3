As a   senator at a time of political gridlock, he hasn’t gotten much legislation passed: According to the Thomas database, the only bill to have become law of which Rubio was the main sponsor is the Girls Count Act of 2015. His most   legislative effort, on immigration reform, ended in failure. Silver’s overall thesis is that Rubio might have been generally   or at least    by the media, but he "never had a base" among actual voters. He has a number of interesting explanations for that problem, but the Gang of Eight should loom larger because it was a major breach of faith between Rubio and what should have been his base —  including the Florida voters who elected him to the Senate.
