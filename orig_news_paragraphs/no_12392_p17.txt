As for Rove’s insight about Trump being hard to imagine as president, that doesn’t seem to have slowed him down much so far, even though he has been attacked on that basis by Republican rivals, especially Marco Rubio.   Wasn’t one of the major takeaways from 2012 that identification and empathy are at least as important to voters as "looking presidential?"   Mitt Romney looked so presidential he could have walked right onto the stage at the animatronic Disney Hall of Presidents, and it didn’t save the day for him. Maybe the   lesson to draw from Rove’s focus groups is that a substantial portion of the Republican electorate, and some Democrat crossover voters, are fed up with a polished Establishment that doesn’t work for them
