That is largely because the Chinese have left open large loopholes that have kept the North Korean economy alive and, by some measures, enjoying more trade than at any time in years. The United Nations Security Council, meeting in emergency consultations, agreed early Friday evening to work "immediately" on drafting a resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea, the council’s president for September, Ambassador Gerard van Bohemen of New Zealand, told reporters. In a recent paper, two researchers concluded that sanctions so far "have had the net effect of actually improving" North Korea’s procurement capabilities for its weapons program. To evade sanctions, the North’s   trading companies opened offices in China, hired more capable Chinese middlemen and paid higher fees to employ more sophisticated brokers, according to the scholars Jim Walsh of M. I. T. and John Park of Harvard.
