Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. head of the United States Pacific Command, said on Wednesday that America would not abandon its military presence across the   region. He indicated that American naval ships would continue passing through the South China Sea to show that the United States "will not allow the shared domains to be closed down unilaterally, no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South China Sea. " The Chinese government has said it respects freedom of civilian passage in the South China Sea but also called American naval "freedom of navigation operations" dangerous meddling.
