When it comes to the greater Middle East, McMaster brings to the table his own deep knowledge of Iraq and Afghanistan, countries where he served for many years. Serving under McMaster is a triumvirate of   Middle East hands. The senior director at the NSC for the Middle East is retired Col. Derek Harvey, an   intelligence officer with a Ph. D. who served as the head of the US military cell examining the insurgency in Iraq in 2003.   It was Harvey who first laid out for President George W. Bush at the White House in the winter of 2004 the real scale and nature of the Sunni insurgency at a time when the Bush administration wouldnâ€™t use the word "insurgency," because it implied they were facing something much more serious than the "dead enders" Vice President Dick Cheney was then publicly talking about.
