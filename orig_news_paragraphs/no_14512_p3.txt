Before his political career, Erdogan was a   football (soccer) player.   Erdogan is considered a polarizing figure: supporters say he has improved the Turkish economy, introduced political reform, and has made significant progress in ending the 30 years of guerrilla war with Kurdish separatists. Critics have accused Erdogan of autocratic tendencies and  corruption and extravagance.   Erdogan has also been heavily criticized for failing to protect women’s and human rights, curbing freedom of speech and attempting to curb Turkey’s secular identity.
