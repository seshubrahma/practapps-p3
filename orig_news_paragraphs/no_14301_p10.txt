The information was seized from a staging area, propaganda center and logistics hub for AQAP’s terrorist network this past weekend. The military said the operation, known as a "site exploitation" raid, was geared toward collecting as much intelligence on the terror group as possible to facilitate future raids and strikes against al Qaeda and prevent terror attacks around the world. In the wake of the Obama administration’s raid that killed al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, the military released videos that were among the trove of documents and computers seized in that operation. The release of the new video clips comes as news has emerged regarding how the raid was authorized during the first days of Trump’s presidency.
