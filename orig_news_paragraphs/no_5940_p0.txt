Thursday on the Fox News Channel, in reacting to the 9th Circuit Court ruling upholding the blocking of President Trump‘s executive order banning immigrants from seven   countries from entering the United States, network senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano called the ruling "an intellectually dishonest piece of work. "   Napolitano said, "The statute specifically says the president on his own, by proclamation, meaning he doesn’t have to consult with anybody else, can make the decision. The decision to ban is not reviewable. Judges are incapable of   the president on it.
