Palestinian UN ambassador Riyad Mansour is now pressing the council to uphold the controversial settlements resolution, saying that Israel "should not be allowed to get away with it" by constructing more settlements. The Israeli government has recently approved an expansion of 2, 500 homes in the West Bank in defiance of the resolution, which called for a halt in settlement construction.    The resolution does not specify sanctions or punishments, but it is now international law and could affect Israelâ€™s relationships with other countries down the road. The Security Council discussed the new settlements behind closed doors Wednesday.
