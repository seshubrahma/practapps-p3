If Comey believed that the President of the United States had engaged in an obstruction of justice, he had a moral and a legal obligation to go to the Deputy Attorney General and tell him exactly what had transpired   â€¦      He did nothing like that. He just put it in his files. Commentators, especially those on the left, rushed to invoke the "smoking gun tape" in explaining the Comey Memo Tuesday and Wednesday, a reference to the commonly used name for the   recording of a 1972 conversation between President Nixon and his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman.
