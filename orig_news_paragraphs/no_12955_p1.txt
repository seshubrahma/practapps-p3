That will give the   ticket a full day to make their case to Californiaâ€™s Republican voters.   Frontrunner Donald Trump is scheduled to address the convention first on Friday, while Ohio Gov. John Kasich, running a distant third, is scheduled to deliver a speech on Friday evening. Unlike other state parties, the California Republican Party does not select its delegates to the Republican National Convention (RNC) at its state meeting. Rather, each candidate presents the party with a slate of delegates and alternates, who will attend the RNC in Cleveland in July if their campaign wins the congressional district they are assigned to represent.
