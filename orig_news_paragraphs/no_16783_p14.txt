Update your references, In the first debate Trump referenced Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who died in 1964, to make a point about Americaâ€™s pursuit of the ISIS terror organization. Those who got As in history, know of MacArthur, but the reference surely bypassed millions who watched the debate. Trump must have heard a lot about the general when he attended a military school in the 1960s, but he needs to update himself.
