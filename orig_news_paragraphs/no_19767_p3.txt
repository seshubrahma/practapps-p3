The law defines agency as "an Executive agency," "an office, agency, or other establishment in the legislative branch," "an office, agency, or other establishment in the judicial branch," or "the government of the District of Columbia," and it’s the meaning of those definitions on which Kushner’s eligibility for his new job hinges. Ironically, it’s Hillary Clinton who might bail Trump out here. When Bill Clinton named the first lady to lead a   task force in 1993, the appointment was challenged in court as a violation of the act. But the court concluded that the White House and Executive Office of the President didn’t fall under the statutory definition.
