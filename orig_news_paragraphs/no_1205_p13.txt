A   panel in the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled last month that the law did not apply to her. In a case in New York, an employee at Omnicom Group, a marketing company, said a manager repeatedly taunted him because he is gay. A federal judge dismissed the case, which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. A   panel ruled last week against the employee, but the chief judge, Robert A. Katzmann, noted that legal and societal views had shifted on legal protections and rights for gay people.
