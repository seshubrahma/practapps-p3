SOPRA takes on one of the most important Supreme Court decisions to buttress the regulatory state, the Chevron decision, the 1984 ruling that created "Chevron Deference," a   standard by which federal courts are compelled to defer to how a federal agency chooses to interpret a federal regulation. What began in 1984 as a win for President Ronald Reagan, who successfully defended his administration’s interpretation of the Clean Air Act   —   which allowed Chevron to expand a refinery without having to apply for new permits, as if it was a new plant   —   grew into a chèque en blanc for federal regulators throughout the government.
