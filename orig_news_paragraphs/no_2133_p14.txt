In Japan, NHK, the public broadcaster, played the speeches live, but otherwise, early media coverage of the speeches was muted. There have been suggestions in the Japanese news media that Mr. Abeâ€™s approval ratings will rise in the days after the ceremony, strengthening his hand as he decides whether to call an election in January. Mr. Abe has made closer ties with the United States a central part of his foreign policy, at least under Mr. Obama.    Donald J. Trump has struck a far more hawkish tone toward Japan.
