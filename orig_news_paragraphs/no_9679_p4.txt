Adele hadn’t previously weighed in on the 2016 presidential race, but the singer has become known for her   banter during concerts. It wasn’t immediately clear if Adele knew that Clinton was in the audience Tuesday night. According to the Associated Press, journalists covering Clinton’s campaign were not permitted to accompany the candidate inside the arena for the concert. Clinton was in South Florida earlier Tuesday for a series of events, including a fundraiser at a home in Pinecrest and an early voting rally at Broward College in Coconut Creek, according to CBS Miami.
