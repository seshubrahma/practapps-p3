You’ll see that 84 percent of the nation is colored red, with huge majorities of Trump voters residing in America’s Heartland. The Heartland and its various industries have for many decades depended on fossil fuels in one form or another, and the people living there know it, which is bad news for   Democrats, who could remain out of power in the Heartland for a decade or more. Both the Trump speech and his plan were roundly criticized by media elites, academics, and those who make a living regulating people’s lives. Their argument has been and remains today that Trump’s America First Energy Plan is proof the president is ignorant about the supposed benefits of limiting   production and the potential of the   market.
