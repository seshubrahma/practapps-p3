The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate," the Fed said in a statement announcing the rate hike. The Fed slashed its target rate to zero in 2008 in reaction to the financial crisis. It then deployed various unconventional monetary tools in an attempt to lower   rates even further. The rate increase means that the Fed is confident that the U. S. economy can withstand higher rates, with consumers and businesses less needful of very low rates to sustain economic growth and price stability.
