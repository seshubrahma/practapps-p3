Trump has received unsparing coverage for most weeks of his presidency, without a single major topic where Trump’s coverage, on balance, was more positive than negative, setting a new standard for unfavorable press coverage of a president," the authors of the study wrote. Even by topic, the study found that there wasn’t a single topic where Trump’s coverage was more positive than negative, with 96 percent of stories on immigration, 87 percent of health care stories and 81 percent of stories on Trump’s fitness for office all carrying a negative tone. Only on the economy did the media coverage approach balance, with 46 percent of those reports carrying a positive tone. The study also warns that such negative coverage may not only be harmful to Trump, but also for the way the public view the media.
