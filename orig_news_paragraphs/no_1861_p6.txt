Meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he looked forward "to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. " A day later, in interviews with The Wall Street Journal and "60 Minutes,’’ he said he had decided to retain elements of Mr. Obama’s landmark health care law after their conversation  —   a hint, at least, that he might govern less radically than he had campaigned. White House officials expressed hope that Mr. Obama would be able to impress on Mr. Trump the importance of other parts of his legacy, like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal.
