I need state representatives who will decide everything from whether police must wear body cameras to abortion access to funding for public health services.   I need state school board members who will make decisions that have very real consequences for my little sister and brother, who are still students in Ohioâ€™s public schools. I need state and local judges and county sheriffs who will determine if justice is dispensed, or not dispensed, in my community.   When I turned in my absentee ballot a few weeks ago, I voted on candidates for all of these positions.
