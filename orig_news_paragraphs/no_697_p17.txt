In the documents released on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security is directed to begin the process of hiring 10, 000 immigration and customs agents, expanding the number of detention facilities and creating an office within Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants. The directives would also revive a program that recruits local police officers and sheriffâ€™s deputies to help with deportation, effectively making them de facto immigration agents. The effort, called the 287( g) program, was scaled back during the Obama administration. The program faces resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities, which have refused to allow their law enforcement workers to help round up undocumented individuals.
