Podesta is not the only   figure with ties to the 2016 presidential candidates to have represented entities close to Yanukovych. Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was an adviser to Yanukovych’s presidential campaign. The Associated Press reported Manafort worked with a business associate to help the Centre secure Capital Hill lobbying firms, including the Podesta Group. Much of the media scrutiny following those revelations focused on Manafort while ignoring Podesta’s more significant and longstanding ties to the Centre.
