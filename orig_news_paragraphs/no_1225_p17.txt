In 1991 in Bangladesh, 90 percent of the 150, 000 people killed in the cyclone were women, because they were more likely to be at home. Women in New Orleans experienced an average loss of earnings of 7 percent in the year after Katrina, a 14 percent loss for   women, while men experienced a 23 percent gain in earnings. In many communities, particularly in   Africa, about half the women are still working in agriculture. Agriculture is uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, leaving millions of women around the world, and the family members who rely on them for their wages and food, at risk because of the changing climate.
