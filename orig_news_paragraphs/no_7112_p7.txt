House Speaker Paul Ryan held a press conference on Tuesday evening to tamp down some of the dissent. He said conservatives should be "excited" by the bill, arguing that it repealed Obamacare taxes, Obamacare spending, Obamacare mandates, and Obamacare subsidies. He also said that the bill ended funding for Planned Parenthood. Ryan was optimistic that the House bill would get enough support to succeed in the House despite many House conservativesâ€™ vows to vote against it.
