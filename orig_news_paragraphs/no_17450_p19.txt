Neither of them seemed to notice that once again Israel was being singled out for disparate treatment.   The settlements issue is actually a good example of this phenomenon: While the resolution condemned Israeli settlements as ’illegal’ and obstacles to peace, the fact that the EU has been funding the building of Palestinian settlements in the disputed territories somehow was not even mentioned, let alone condemned as illegal, or an obstacle to peace. Most of the new Palestinian settlements have been built in Area C of the West Bank, territory which, according to the Oslo Accords signed in 1993 between the Israeli and the Palestinians, "falls  under full  Israeli civil and security control," according to the Times of Israel. So when Ban   calls the Israeli settlements illegal, he is not just legally wrong, but also deeply hypocritical.
