The Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment command that no state may "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law nor shall any State deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. " In 1954 the Supreme Court held in Bolling v. Sharpe that although due process and equal protection are separately addressed as separate rights in the Fourteenth Amendment, and despite the fact that there is no clause requiring equal protection from the federal government in the Fifth Amendment, nonetheless the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s Due Process Clause includes an implicit guarantee of equal protection. The central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause was to eliminate government actions discriminating on the basis of race or national origin.
