The governmentâ€™s petition, written in the name of Acting Solicitor General Jeffery B.

It also goes further, asking the court to dismiss the First Amendment challenge to the ban out of hand based on the broad power of the president to exclude aliens outside the United States, to whom the First Amendment does not apply, from entering the country.
