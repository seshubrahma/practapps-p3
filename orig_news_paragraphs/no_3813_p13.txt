CNN in many ways was worse than BuzzFeed in what they did on this front: While CNN did not actually publish the document, anchor Jake Tapper and reporters Jim Sciutto, Evan Perez, and Carl Bernstein lent enormous credibility to the source of the document without verifying any of the now discredited allegations. The episode resulted in a very public blowup for both CNN and BuzzFeed, as at Trump’s first press conference as   earlier in January he blasted CNN’s Jim Acosta —  who broke journalistic norms in his attempts to interrupt the    —  as working for a "Fake News" outlet. Trump also blasted BuzzFeed as a "failing pile of garbage" during that press conference. UPDATE 3:10
