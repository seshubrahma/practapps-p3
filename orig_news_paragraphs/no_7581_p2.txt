Michigan is moving to a toss up because Donald Trump is uniting the Republican base, has a strong lead among Independents, is on the verge of record support in blue collar areas such as Macomb County, and gains a higher proportion of African Americans than Republican candidates usually get in Michigan," said a Facebook statement by John Yob, head of Strategic National, the firm which conducted the poll. He added: We could be headed to a photo finish in Michigan and that explains why both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are spending big on TV in Michigan and visiting the state in the final days. Yobâ€™s clients include Gov. Rick Snyder and other state GOP leaders. Currently, the Real Clear Politics polling site shows Clinton safely in the lead, with a 6. 4 percent advantage over Trump.
