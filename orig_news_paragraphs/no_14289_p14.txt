Maryam’s father sold his carpentry business and used the money for pay for their dangerous journey to Egypt. Since they are refugees, they have to pay for Maryam’s treatment out of their own pockets.   Refugees also aren’t allowed to work, so they are getting by with help from Maryam’s grandparents, who are permanent US residents and have lived in Boise, Idaho, since 2014. Holda Sadeq, Maryam’s grandmother, says she would like to go to Egypt to help file for a medical visa that would let Maryam come to the United States.
