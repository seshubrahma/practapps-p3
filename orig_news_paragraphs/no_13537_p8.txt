If the government would provide   products and services directly to employees without forcing   employers to do anything, then the government would no longer be burdening those employers’ religious faith. With today’s decision, the High Court vacated the lower courts’ decisions against these   employers (striking those decisions from the books) sending all these cases back down to the various federal courts of appeals across the country for new briefs and arguments on the possible compromises. The justices could then decide at a later time whether to review any of the new decisions from those lower courts. There was one small victory today with which conservatives and   employers should be happy.
