At this lunch box museum in Columbus, Georgia, visitors can get their hands on history, picking up pails that safeguarded sandwiches to the 1930s to the 1980s.   The curator describes them as time capsules. And while some stores might have shelved them long ago, saying they’re too stale to sell, their metal has certainly been tested, their place in history is all boxed up.   They’ve proven their usefulness case closed.
