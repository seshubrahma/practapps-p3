These notices, records show, were sent to National Registered Agents it is not a company Mr. Trump owns. It is the Delaware firm that was listed as the "registered agent" when DJT Operations CX was incorporated in 2012, the year Mr. Trump bought the jet. In an F. A. A. filing in 2012, titled "Aircraft Registration Application," National Registered Agents, its address and its phone number were listed as the contact information for DJT Operations CX. The filing is one page, largely filled out by hand, and is signed by Mr. Trump.
