The Harvard IOP poll finds Clinton topping Trump by a 45%  % margin among those most likely to vote in the fall, with 13% behind Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and another 19% unsure who they’d support. And the GenForward Survey, which interviewed the broader group of adults age 30 and younger and did not include Johnson in the list of candidates, found Clinton ahead by a similar margin, holding 38% to Trump’s 17% with 22% backing someone else, 7% undecided and 16% saying they probably wouldn’t vote at all. In almost every election since 1988, younger voters have favored the Democrat over the Republican by a margin of 9 points or more. The exception was 2000, when Democrats’ advantage among younger voters shrank, with Al Gore narrowly topping George W. Bush among voters under 30 by just 2 points.
