AFP   —    If US Republican candidate Donald Trump is elected president it would be a dangerous result and "complicate" relations between Europe and the United States, French President Francois Hollande has warned. ["Those who say that Donald Trump could not possibly become the next president of the United States are the same ones who thought that Brexit would never be voted in," Hollande said, referring to last week’s British referendum which backed withdrawal from the European Union.
