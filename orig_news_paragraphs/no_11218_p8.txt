That resettlement has come at an economic and public health cost to Oakland County taxpayers. As Breitbart News reported previously, a refugee from Iraq who arrived in Oakland County in FY 2015 was diagnosed with active TB this March. In June, Oakland County executive L. Brooks Patterson told ORR director Robert Carey that he and the taxpayers in his county were tired of this continued federal over reach without their consent. In a letter to Carey, Patterson demanded and requested that ORR comply with the Refugee Act of 1980 and initiate consultations with Oakland County prior to the resettlement of any refugees there.
