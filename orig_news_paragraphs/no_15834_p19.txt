Bush hosted the session in his private dining room. Historians said it was the first time all living presidents had convened at the White House. About a month later, Obama placed an unusual phone call to his predecessor to inform Bush he was planning to announce a withdrawal of troops from Iraq    a conversation Obama’s aides said was a "courtesy" to the man who began the war that Obama ran vowing to end. The phone call, made from a holding room at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, was brief, but it did reflect open lines of communication between political and ideological opposites    a channel that thus far hasn’t been dug between Obama and Trump.
