Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP," Trump tweeted Sunday night.   Woodhouse told CNNâ€™s John Berman and Kate Bolduan that roughly 80 county GOP offices were told to close early Sunday, and a temporary mobile office was erected in Orange County, near the site of the firebombing.   A group of Democrats started a GoFundMe fundraising page to help with rebuilding the office. The campaign has accumulated more than $13, 000.
