During a press briefing after the 9th Circuit hearing, Spicer tried to bat down questions about another Trump statement    in the form of a tweet    that implied Trump may have a recording system in the White House.   The President personally put that on the national agenda when he tweeted the veiled threat against former FBI Director James Comey, telling him to be careful because he might release "tapes. " Now the White House refuses to answer any questions on the subject and Democrats are asking to see any existing tapes    and threatening to stall the appointment of a new FBI director unless they do.
