Although Mr. Johnson’s speech was greeted warmly, there were several small instances of protest. A few "boos" could be heard when Mr. Johnson entered to speak, and a couple of people held up a sign protesting the Department of Homeland Security’s deportation policies. The conference also featured a heated debate among several Muslim scholars and activists about the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to counter extremism and recruitment by groups like the Islamic State. Several panelists said the government’s efforts focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities to the exclusion of white nationalist groups, which have been linked to several domestic terrorist attacks.
