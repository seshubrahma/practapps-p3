In northern Syria, a   zone targeted at Assad’s air force and safe zones for refugees fleeing the fighting would help halt the massive flow of refugees out of Syria, many of whom are heading to Europe, and also help reduce whatever remains of ISIS’ appeal to the Sunni population of Syria, to whom it can pose as their defenders against the Syrian regime. It is Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, who is advocating for this common sense measure, which is a policy that could actually help tamp down the violence and killing in which ISIS thrives. Of course, Trump has no real policy ideas about what to do about ISIS because he seems incapable of producing them, other than empty slogans like he would "bomb the s. .. t out of" ISIS.
