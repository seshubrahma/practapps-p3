The panel will hear oral arguments Tuesday and is expected to rule shortly after.   After the   panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court. A rehearing is not required, though, in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court. Given the high stakes, it is expected that whomever ultimately loses before the 9th Circuit will most likely appeal to the US Supreme Court.
