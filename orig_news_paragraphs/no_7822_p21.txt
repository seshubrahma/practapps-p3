Expect to see a lot more coverage about how the sunny Senator was too optimistic for the angry, hateful Republican Party, or more    shootings, suggesting he was undone by   racists. (If Trump bests Cruz for the nomination, that narrative will become easier to peddle.)    The GOP Establishment may use Rubio’s fate as evidence that Tea   conservatives are too demanding and have unreasonable expectations of their elected officials.    News junkies will fixate on the last few cycles and say Rubio blew his shot at Trump, or heroically sacrificed himself in a kamikaze attack to break Trump’s momentum.
