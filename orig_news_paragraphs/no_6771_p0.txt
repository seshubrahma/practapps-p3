Shia LaBeouf has taken his   Trump art exhibit to New Mexico after its original venue, New York City’s Museum of the Moving Image, shut down the project earlier this month. [In a statement on the exhibit’s website, LaBeouf and collaborators Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner said they would move their "He Will Not Divide Us" project to Albuquerque and accused the Queens museum of demonstrating a "lack of commitment" to the project.   "From the outset, the museum failed to address our concerns about the misleading framing of our piece as a political rally, rather than as a participatory performance artwork resisting the normalisation of division," the group wrote.
