In some models, like FiveThirtyEight’s, the states are very correlated in others, like the Princeton Election Consortium, they are much less so. The Upshot’s model lies somewhere between. In general, states move in lock step from one presidential election to the next. The overall picture may change, but the states typically hold their positions relative to one another and swing together uniformly.
