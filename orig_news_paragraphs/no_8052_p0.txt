US Army Major General (Ret.) Paul Vallely, who served in the Vietnam War and was Deputy Commanding General, Pacific Command, has fully endorsed Republican challenger Paul Nehlen, who faces Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in Wisconsin ’s First Congressional District, mostly because he feels Ryan has shown incredible weakness in the face of Obama’s agenda, a failing which has led to a weaker America. [Several months ago General Vallely became one of the first former general officers to endorse Donald Trump and now he is joining those who support Wisconsin’s Nehlen.
