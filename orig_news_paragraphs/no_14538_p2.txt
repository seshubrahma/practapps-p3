Kelly said the goal was "to make sure that there’s no one, in a sense, caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports, which happened on the first release" of the order. Trump’s original order, issued a week into his presidency, barred citizens of seven   countries    Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen    from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely. " The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision," Trump said during his White House news conference Thursday, referring to the courts’ blocking of its implementation.
