The EPA did not return a request for comment about the recommendation for budget cuts and staff reduction. CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment. John Coequyt, a campaign director of the progressive environmental group Sierra Club, called the plan ludicrous and said the administration wouldnâ€™t be able to get signoff on these cuts from the legislative side. He also argued that zeroing out the Environmental Justice program, which focuses on fair protection from environmental and health hazards for people of all races and incomes, has racial motivations.
