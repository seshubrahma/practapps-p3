I think a great foundation for President Trump’s legacy moving forward. On immigration, illegal border crossings are down, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly have increased efforts to enforce the law. President Trump recently, in a meeting with conservative media at the White House earlier this week, compared   —  the drug trafficking connected gang —  to terrorist group Al Qaeda, and the administration has created an office, VOICE, designed to represent families with victims of illegal immigrant crime. Trump, meanwhile, maintains plans to build a wall along the U. S.  border once and for all —  despite setbacks for now in funding from the congressional side of things.
