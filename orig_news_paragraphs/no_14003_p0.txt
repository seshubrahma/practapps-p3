Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats strongly complained Wednesday that Republicans were trying to "jam"   Donald Trumpâ€™s Cabinet picks through the chamber, and warned they would not rush to confirm the nominees on a timetable being advocated by Republicans. " These past two weeks we have seen repeated efforts from the Trump transition, aided and abetted by Senate Republicans, to jam through nominees (in a way) that hides their views from the American people," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, after a meeting with his caucus during which they strategized over a path forward on the nominees.
