Thursdayâ€™s bombing had a feeling of deja vu. A decade and a half ago the US Air Force dropped massive 15, 000 pound "Daisy Cutter" bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001. Achin district is only a dozen or so miles from the Tora Bora region. While those Daisy Cutter bombs certainly killed many members of al Qaeda, bin Laden and many of his senior leaders escaped.
