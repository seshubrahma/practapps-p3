The court ruling does not undo changes ordered by Mr. Obama that require immigration officers to focus on deporting unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes or who repeatedly try to enter the United States illegally. The officers have been directed not to move against   illegal immigrants who have lived here for years. The courtâ€™s decision also will not affect actions Mr. Obama took in 2012 to help the   Dreamers, young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as small children. Under his program, more than 730, 000 Dreamers received documents allowing them to work legally, without fear that they might be sent home.
