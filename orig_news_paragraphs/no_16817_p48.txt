Yet, Tuesday’s debate drew a sharp contrast between the two tickets, laying bare the choice facing white, middle class voters using two people who look just like them.    Kaine made the case for how white men can back a woman for President, support local police while believing racial bias exists, and hold personal religious values dear while not pushing them on the broader public. Kaine used Trump’s tax record to hammer home that Trump cannot relate to middle class economic struggles. Pence helped Republicans feel their conservative values were still present in this election,  shoring up evangelical support for Trump, but doing nothing to appeal to a broader undecided audience.
