Outgoing CIA director John Brennan had stern words for Trump last Sunday, saying he needed to be more "disciplined" in his public comments. " I don’t think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia’s intentions and actions," Brennan said of Trump on Fox News Sunday. Trump, likening US intelligence to Nazis, suggested Brennan himself may have leaked an unsubstantiated report that the Russians had gathered damaging salacious personal information about him.
