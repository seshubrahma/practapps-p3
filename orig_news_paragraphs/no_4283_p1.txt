By my draft research, which I’m opening up for   on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march’s "partners," including "key partners" Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump’s   policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump’s environmental policies. The other Soros ties with "Women’s March" organizations include the partisan MoveOn. org (which was fiercely  ) the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as "a leader of tomorrow" as a march   and another official as "the head of logistics"). Other Soros grantees who are "partners" in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
