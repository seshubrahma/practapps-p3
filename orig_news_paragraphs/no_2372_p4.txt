Clinton had a rally scheduled in a   section of Toledo, the northwest Ohio city that ranked as the   economically distressed of the nation’s 100 largest. It is home to many of the struggling white   men who have made Ohio such tough terrain for Clinton and surprisingly fertile for her billionaire opponent. Clinton has trailed consistently in polls here, even though Barack Obama carried Ohio twice. I drove through town, passing block after block checkered with Trump signs, listening to screed after screed on talk radio about the malevolence of Obama and Clinton, and it sent me into one of those   vortexes where I began to wonder if any Ohioans would be voting for Clinton at all.
