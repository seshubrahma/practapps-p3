Trump also indicated he does not need Congress to pass new legislation to implement the border control and immigration reform agenda he outlined during his campaign for president, saying he would "work within the existing system and framework." "We do not need new laws," Trump said soon after signing the two executive orders. The executive orders Trump signed Wednesday call for boosting the ranks of Border Patrol forces by an additional 5, 000 agents as well as for 10, 000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to carry out deportations. The orders noted that the increases were subject to Congressâ€™s appropriation of sufficient funds.
