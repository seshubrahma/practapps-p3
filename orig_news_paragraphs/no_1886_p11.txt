Google’s new policy, which it said would go into effect "imminently," will extend its ban on misrepresentative content to the websites its advertisements run on. " Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content or the primary purpose of the web property," Ms. Faville said. Ms. Faville said that the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to the election.
