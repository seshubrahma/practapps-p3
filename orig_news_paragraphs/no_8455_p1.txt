Cry me a river. Failed 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was reportedly in tears when he told attendees of his Summit, which has been described as a "safe space" for the "Never Trump" smart set, that seeing Trump as the Republican nomination was breaking his heart. One wonders if Romney is really sad that Trumpâ€™s candidacy has resonated with working Americans more than his inflexible and robotic campaign ever did. Romney also reportedly ripped Ted Cruz and John Kasich for not taking on Trump harsh enough from the outset.
