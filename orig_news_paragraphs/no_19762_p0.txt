The Hollywood Foreign Press lavished attention on   musical La La Land, which won a record seven Golden Globes at the ceremony that kicks off the final stretch of the Oscar campaign every year. La La Land exited the night with trophies for its stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, as well as two for its   Damien Chazelle, though its clean sweep was slightly overshadowed by the triumph of Moonlight, a   independent film about the adolescence of an   boy in Miami, which took Best Picture (Drama) as the last award of the night. La La Land and Moonlight have been tipped as the two contenders to beat at the Academy Awards, which will announce its nominations later this month, but it was clear who the   Hollywood Foreign Press Association preferred. La La Land took Best Director and Best Screenplay along with Best Original Score, Best Song ("City of Stars") Best Actor and Actress, and Best Picture (Comedy or Musical).
