Matthew Chance, CNNâ€™s senior international correspondent based in Moscow, said the latest strikes "are an immensely dangerous episode in the relationship between Russia and the United States, not least because they potentially bring into contact Russian forces who are on the ground in Syria and the US forces. " Russia was warned of the attack before it took place. Nevertheless, Chance pointed out, Russia did not choose to use    missiles systems in place in Syria that are "fully capable of intercepting cruise missiles if they so choose to" which, he said, "implies a degree of tacit Russian consent to the strikes.
