In terms of specific statistics, Trump was accurate when he talked about a 17%    increase in homicides in the nation’s 50 largest cities and the murder rates in Washington, D. C.

Note, in particular, Mahta’s last paragraph, in which she claims that Trump said "the number of police officer deaths has risen nearly 50%.
