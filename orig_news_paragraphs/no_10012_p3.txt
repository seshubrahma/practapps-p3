Luis Villalobos, a 1963 graduate of Cathedral High School, claims that the alumni did the "right and courageous thing" by reversing their August 18th decision to invite Holtz. In a letter to the editor of the El Paso Times, he wrote: "Public figures have to know, even during this election time, their words have consequences. They can speak before a very enthusiastic crowd, but they canâ€™t say things that are insulting to any group, whether it be a minority group, women or whatever group they are railing against. "
