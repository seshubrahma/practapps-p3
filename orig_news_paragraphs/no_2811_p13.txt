Mitt Romney’s 2012 press corps coined the term "slunch" to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the "second lunch "  —   Mr. Trump’s reliance on   fare is driven more by a combination of speed, efficiency and, above all else, cleanliness. Though he often orders from the Trump Grill when working out of Trump Tower in Manhattan, he eats fast food several times a week while on the road because "it’s quick," as he told The Daily Mail last year while munching on Burger King on his Boeing  . Mr. Trump has even suggested doing away with state dinners, in a fit of cost and time savings.
