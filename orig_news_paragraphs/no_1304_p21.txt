Shortly thereafter, Summerbreeze obtained the $3. 5 million loan from the Spruce Capital unit. In November, after Mr. Trump won the presidential election, Summerbreeze received a second loan, for $9. 5 million, from Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, which focuses on affordable mortgages for military veterans and is headed by Stephen M. Calk, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump at the time. The collateral for the loan included Mr. Manafortâ€™s Hamptons home and other assets. In addition to the loans taken out on the Hamptons house, Mr. Manafort has recently obtained mortgages on another property.
