By March 2015, the number of food stamp recipients dropped by 80 percent, to 2, 678 recipients who decided to get a job, participate in job training, or volunteer. Roughly 9, 000 people dropped out of the program, leading many analysts to observe that many of those food stamp recipients worked off the books and used food stamps to save money for other expenses. Others stipulated that many became so dependent on government welfare that they could not volunteer 24 hours a month, or roughly one hour of work per day. Some studies estimate that 4. 7 million Americans receive food stamps who are   not elderly, and do not have children or dependents.
