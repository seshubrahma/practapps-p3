The statement issued by Flynn’s attorney Robert Kelner on Thursday explains why Flynn offered to testify in exchange for immunity. According to Kelner, Flynn "certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit. " After recounting the details of Flynn’s lengthy "life of national service," Kelner states the media is "awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against him.
