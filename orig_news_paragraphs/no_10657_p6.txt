Otis faces up to three years in jail and a $10, 000 fine if convicted. In an interview before his arrest, Otis said he had originally planned to steal Trumpâ€™s star and auction it off to benefit the women who have accused the Republican candidate of sexual assault. " I was just so fed up, so saddened and fed up by Mr. Trump and how he continues to denigrate women, and he continues to joke and make fun about sexual violence and his own exploits against women," Otis told the Los Angeles Daily News.
