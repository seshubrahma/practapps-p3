In the battle for the Senate, two of the nine races most likely to decide control have been called, one for Republicans and one a pickup for the Democrats   â€”   the first of five they will need to win an outright majority. GOP Sen. Marco Rubio won   to his seat in Florida, a race he entered late, only after his presidential campaign faltered. And Tammy Duckworth, the Democratic Illinois congresswoman, defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Mark Kirk in a race that was widely predicted would hand Democrats one of the seats they were looking for.
