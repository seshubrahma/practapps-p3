Iâ€™m pretty well versed in the art of sarcasm. That was not sarcasm. Even the dictionary (a book Trump might call "overrated") tells us as much: "the use of words that mean the opposite of what you really want to say especially in order to insult someone, to show irritation, or to be funny."   But Trump meant exactly what he said about Obama.
