The LAPD have not formally completed their investigation of the incident, but according to another report from Deadline’s Dominic Patten, the department will charge the person responsible with felony vandalism. The perpetrator could face up to three years in jail and a fine of $10, 000 or more. Trump’s star has repeatedly been vandalized since the businessman announced his presidential candidacy last summer. Vandals have drawn large "X"es, a mute button, and at one point, a swastika over the star, but this is the first instance in which the star has been outright destroyed.
