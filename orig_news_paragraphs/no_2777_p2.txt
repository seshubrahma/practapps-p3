Indiana on May 3. It may sound strange, but when you start gaming out the rest of the primary contest, itâ€™s hard to avoid the conclusion that his quest to reach a majority of delegates before the convention could all turn on Indiana. If you divvy up the states by expected results, Mr. Trump wins big in the East and West Virginia, loses the    rural Western states, and earns his expected share of proportional delegates in Washington, Oregon and New Mexico. That puts him about 175 delegates short of the required 1, 237.
