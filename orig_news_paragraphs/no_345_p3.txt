In a briefing for reporters, White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a    waiver to return. Mr. Trump  —   in office just a week   —   found himself accused of constitutional and legal overreach by two Iraqi immigrants, defended by the American Civil Liberties Union. Meanwhile, large crowds of protesters turned out at airports around the country to denounce Mr. Trump’s ban on the entry of refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
