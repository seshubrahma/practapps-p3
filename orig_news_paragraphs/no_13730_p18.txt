Unable to get its cheaper Indian employees to the US to work on short term contracts, Infosys used a different visa  —   the   normally given to foreign businessmen who need to travel to the US to complete deals. According to an official from the Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service, special agents spent two and a half years examining the records of 6, 500 foreign Infosys employees on   visas. " Instead of attending ‘business meetings and discussions’   …     many of these individuals   …     were working for Infosys in the United States, in violation of the conditions of their   visas," the official told GlobalPost via email.
