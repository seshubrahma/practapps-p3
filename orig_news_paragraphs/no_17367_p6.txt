First, rebel fighters can head northeast, to an enclave south of a former   town of Jarablus, where the Turkish army has been pushing back ISIS, using Syrian moderate rebels as their ground troops. Their progress has been slow, and rebels in these ranks say that now their fight is purely against ISIS, taking pressure off the Syrian regime. That option may appear less attractive for some fighters who have just seen their homes pounded by the Syrian and Russian advance in Aleppo. Secondly, those that can escape could head northwest.
