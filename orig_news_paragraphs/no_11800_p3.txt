I am on the death list of   ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban. Since 2004, I have been living under    police protection, but I have a mission: Speak the truth about Islam. However, a   Islamic member of the House of Lords, one Nazir Ahmed, demanded that the then British Labour government ban me from entering the UK. He threatened that he would personally mobilize 10, 000 Muslims to prevent me from entering the Upper House.
