—   and in your knowing that my husband and I, along with the vice president and Mrs. Pence and everyone here at the White House, hold you close in our hearts and thoughts each and every day. In honor of our bravest, we have the United States Army   …    and members of the Marine band performing for us today. Enjoy it.
