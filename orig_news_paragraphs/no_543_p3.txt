It is very difficult to succeed on the battlefield when your enemy enjoys external support and safe haven," said the commander, who added that the United States needed to do a "a holistic review" of its policy toward Pakistan. The issue of safe havens in Pakistan also was discussed Thursday when the new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, spoke by telephone with Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, Pakistan’s chief of army staff. In the conversation, "Gen. Bajwa reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to counter all militant groups operating in its territory," according to a Pentagon statement. In his Senate testimony, General Nicholson also complained that Russia was trying to "legitimize" the Taliban by creating the "false narrative" that the militant organization has been fighting the Islamic State and that Afghan forces have not.
