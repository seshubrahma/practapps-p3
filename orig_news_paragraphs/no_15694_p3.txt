The President also slammed reporters who include the phrase "sources say" in their stories. The volley of tweets represented Trump at his most authentic and defiant, lashing out when he feels he is under attack, and appeared to reflect a belief that only he, and not his staff, is qualified to speak in his own defense. It was a side of the President that had not been much in evidence in his swing through Europe and the Middle East.    While the Russia controversy deepened back home, Trump had remained unusually disciplined    even if his performance at NATO in Brussels deeply alarmed European leaders who already doubted his commitment to the alliance.
