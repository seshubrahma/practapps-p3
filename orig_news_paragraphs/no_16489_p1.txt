Ten percent of likely voters back Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, according to the Quinnipiac poll, while Green Party candidate Jill Stein has the support of 4% of voters.   It continues what has been a strong month of polling for the former secretary of state, as Trump continues to look for a spark following his latest campaign shakeup.   Johnson is hoping to become the first   candidate since Ross Perot in 1992 to qualify for the presidential debates. In order to join Clinton and Trump on stage this fall, Johnson will need to average 15% in five national polls chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
