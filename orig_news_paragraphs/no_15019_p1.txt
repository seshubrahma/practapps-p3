Even before the missile test, North Korea’s nuclear program was expected to be an important talking point between Xi and Trump.   The United States has been pushing China to put pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear program and missile testing, but Trump said on Sunday the United States would be prepared to act alone to stop North Korea. In his first five years as North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un has overseen more than double the number of missile tests than his father did during his   rule, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. A senior White House official on Tuesday said: "The clock has now run out, and all options are on the table," pointing to the failure of successive administrations’ efforts to negotiate an end to the country’s nuclear program.
