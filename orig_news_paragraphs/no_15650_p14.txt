In meetings with foreign leaders, Kushner has become a constant presence, from   sessions with Arab Gulf leaders on Sunday to a day of shuttle diplomacy with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas Monday. Kushner even took the unusual step of issuing a written statement following Trumpâ€™s stop in Riyadh, a valedictory display after a   visit to the Middle Eastern kingdom. " The President asked us to plan a trip that would help unite the world against intolerance and terrorism and we have made great progress towards that goal in Saudi Arabia," Kushner wrote in his statement.
