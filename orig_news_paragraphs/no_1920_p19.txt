Flex assembles Appleâ€™s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4, 000 combinations of features and hardware. Flex added about 2, 000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30, 000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion.
