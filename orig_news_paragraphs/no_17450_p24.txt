(i. e. like the ripping up of Jewish settlements in Gaza, which led not to peace but to Hamas terror tunnels and rockets, or the fact that Israel has already returned roughly 95 percent of the territory it legitimately regained in 1967) and failing to hold Palestinian leadership accountable for their actions (inciting hatred) and statements (refusing to recognize Israelâ€™s right to exist) real peace cannot happen.   These resolutions are annoying and sad     they incentivize Palestinian leadership to try and play end games around Israel instead of engaging directly with their bargaining opponent, and they leave Israel less inclined to even try.   In pulling his veto on the eve of Hanukkah President Obama failed to heed the lesson of the holiday.
