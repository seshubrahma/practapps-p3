The stock market rallied during the press conference. The Fed has said that it expects the economy to grow at 2. 1% this year and next, with growth falling off to 1. 9% the following year. Its long term view is that the economy will grow around 1. 8%. Some Fed watchers had speculated that the Fed might view this as the maximum sustainable pace, so that any attempts to drive faster growth would generate unwanted levels of inflation.
