The reformers also want Trump to reverse Obama regulations which sharply increased the inflow of foreign   professionals who compete for professional jobs sought by young American graduates. Trump is coming under criticism from   immigration reformers for not immediately stopping the renewal of   work permits given to roughly 750, 000 illegal immigrants by Obama’s 2012  . Throughout his term, Obama increased the inflow of legal immigrants so much that his agencies brought one migrant into the United States for every two births during the first half of 2016, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. For much of his tenure, Obama’s agencies annually imported one million new legal immigrants plus one million foreign contract workers, even as 4 million young Americans annually entered the job market.
