But he "continued to receive unsolicited intelligence" and felt compelled to write another memo on December 13, the court filing says. In this final memo, Steele accused Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev, and his technology companies, of secretly working for the Russian intelligence agency known as the FSB. Gubarev, who owns tech firms XBT Holding and Webzilla, denies that he helped Russia with its cyber operations against Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. He is now suing Steele in the UK for defamation.
