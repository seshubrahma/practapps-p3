During the course of the hearing, Judge Cain Kennedy, an African American judge on Alabama’s 13th judicial circuit court, testified to Sessions’ "excellent" reputation in a letter he signed with the other circuit judges. In it he endorsed Sessions and asserted that he was "confident" Sessions "would rule impartially in all matters presented to him" and that the court would be "fortunate" to have someone of Sessions’ stature. Similarly, Larry Thompson, an African American and former U. S. attorney in Atlanta who went on to serve as Deputy U. S. Attorney General under President Bush, described Sessions as a "loyal colleague" and a "good man and an honest man untainted by any form of prejudice. "
