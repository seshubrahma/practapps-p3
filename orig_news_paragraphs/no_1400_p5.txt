Some Republican candidates who ran for president this year, like Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, may have differed with Mr. Ryan on the margins on policy, but they hewed to the same core beliefs. Mr. Trump didnâ€™t simply beat those candidates, he destroyed them, often in a highly personal way. The traditional Republican agenda is not selling this year. The speaker is widely viewed as endorsing Mr. Trump to provide the party with the unity necessary to get House members   and to help Mr. Ryan keep his day job.
