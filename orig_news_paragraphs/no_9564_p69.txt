ELIZABETH, N. J.  â€”    A large explosion was heard in New Jersey early Monday near the scene where a suspicious package that appeared to contain pipe bombs was discovered earlier near the Elizabeth transit station. No damage was immediately visible. There was no immediate word from authorities on whether the explosion might have been a controlled detonation of the device found a few hours earlier, but no warning of such a blast was given beforehand.
