House Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement on Thursday backing President Barack Obama’s new sanctions against Russia. [Ryan’s support came shortly after news broke that Obama had issued an executive order against nine Russian "entities and individuals" based on accusations that Russia interfered in the recent U. S. elections.   " While today’ action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia," Ryan said.
