As Mr. Cooperâ€™s allies called on Mr. McCrory to concede and drop the challenges, a McCrory campaign spokesman, Ricky Diaz, said, "Why is Roy Cooper so insistent on circumventing the electoral process and counting the votes of dead people and felons?" Bob Hall, the executive director of the advocacy group Democracy North Carolina, said that 43 voters were listed in the    challenges as being ineligible felons, but that "nearly half" of them were not serving a felony sentence. More than 4. 7 million votes were cast. Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the state Republican Party, prefers to emphasize that about half of the 43 votes by the supposed felons were, in fact, ineligible.
