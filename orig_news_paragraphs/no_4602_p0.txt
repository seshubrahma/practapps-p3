Vice President Mike Pence took the argument for the House Republican Leadership’s "American Health Care Act" to Americans on a warehouse floor in Kentucky on Saturday morning, admitting that there would be a "battle" in Washington, D. C. over the bill and that they "need every Republican in Congress" to get it passed. [Pence called Kentucky "a textbook example of Obamacare’s failures" as he spoke to the crowd of about 100 on the floor of a Harshaw Trane warehouse. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin introduced Pence, and Pence returned praise for Bevin during his speech that centered around the new healthcare bill.   He made the statement after highlighting health insurance woes from around the country like premiums up 25 percent on average around the country in just 2016.
