The operation in this region was specifically conducted to address the very real public safety threat represented by the criminal aliens arrested," Detroit ERO Field Officer Director Rebecca Adducci said in a written statement. " The vast majority of those arrested in the Detroit metropolitan area have very serious felony convictions, multiple felony convictions in many cases. I applaud the efforts of the law enforcement personnel who, day in and day out, put their lives on the line to protect this community.
