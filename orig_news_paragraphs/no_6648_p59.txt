Instead, the Post claimed the memo was a "Russian intelligence document" that itself quoted secondhand from a purported email describing how Lynch told someone within the Clinton campaign that she would help to ensure that the Clinton email probe did not go too far. The document, according to the Post, cited an email said to have been written by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was chair of the Democratic National Committee. The alleged correspondence cited in the purported document was sent by Schultz to Leonard Benardo, who works at billionaire George Sorosâ€™s Open Society Foundations. The Post reported that the alleged Russian intelligence document merely cited some of the contents of the supposed Wasserman Schultz email to Benardo but did not actually contain a copy of the alleged message.
