Over the last decade, Soros has reportedly provided some $76 million for immigrant issues. In 2014, the New York Times credited "immigrant rights groups" financed by Soros and a handful of other donors for influencing President Obama’s immigration policy. In August, Breitbart Jerusalem first reported hacked documents from Soros’ Open Society Institute boasted that the billionaire and his foundation helped to successfully press the Obama administration into increasing to 100, 000 the total number of refugees taken in by the U. S. annually. The documents revealed that the billionaire personally sent President Obama a letter on the issue of accepting refugees.
