The dam itself has no structural issues, but the two spillways that release water from the lake to prevent overflow have structural problems.   The main spillway, which is lined, or paved, has a hole almost the size of a football field and at least 40 feet deep. Itâ€™s being used to drain the lake at a rate of 100, 000 cubic feet per second in an effort to reduce the water level. Normal flows down the main spillway are about 55, 000 cubic feet per second.
