The fake news crowd did not take a single second to consider that question, judging by their breathless outrage. The supposed evidence of our misdeed is a single comment, out of over 1, 200, which said someone should publish the address of the family responsible. We do not allow doxing in our comment section and delete such messages as we become aware of them, but again, there is no reason this particular family should have taken that comment as a threat against them. Yet the outraged   authors pushing the fake narrative have only this flimsy argument of guilt by association.
