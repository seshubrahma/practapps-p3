Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1, 000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes.
