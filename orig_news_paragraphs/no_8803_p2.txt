The OPT system is also great for universities and colleges because it brings in more student customers from overseas, whose tuition fees greatly exceed the paperwork costs paid by universities to run the OPT program. That’s a big financial benefit for universities. But the OPT   program is bad for the many ordinary American graduates who are being shut out of more than 100, 000 jobs   —   and who also face increased lifetime competition from imported,   foreign professionals.
