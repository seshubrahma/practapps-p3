I think about America’s future, and the destiny of the shining city on a hill. I believe, as Ronald Reagan and the Founding Fathers did, in the providential nature of this country. It was founded for a reason. I don’t pretend to know if God would vote for Donald Trump, or for that matter what state He is registered to vote in.
