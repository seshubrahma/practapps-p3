By slashing the number of refugees allowed into the US from 110, 000 to 50, 000 and bringing the refugee system to a complete halt for 120 days, President Trumpâ€™s refugee plan will cause real harm for real people. And, it appears his administration may no longer prioritize admission for LGBTQ refugees who are escaping extreme violence. His executive order attempts to offer an olive branch to the LGBTQ community by prohibiting people from entering the United States who would "oppress" Americans based on their sexual orientation. As it happens, people who oppress others are already excludable as refugees under current law, so this portion of the executive order is functionally meaningless.
