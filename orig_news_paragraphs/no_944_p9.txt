Talks were underway between Anbang and the Kushners, including Jared, as early as last year, and were first reported by The Times in January. The deal would value the     office tower at $2. 8 billion, a high value for a building that has never been considered a New York trophy. Anbang would eventually take a controlling stake in the property and obtain a $4 billion construction loan, Bloomberg said, for a makeover of the tower, which would have luxury apartments at the top, a multifloor retail mall at the base, and a hotel in the middle. The proposed development comes at an odd time in New York.
