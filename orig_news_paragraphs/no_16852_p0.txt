Washington (CNN) Thousands of hacked emails from Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were posted online Friday evening, including what appears to be excerpts from transcripts of   speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street companies after leaving the State Department. WikiLeaks, which has been alleged to work with Russia, posted more than 2, 000 emails from Podesta and promises to post more from a trove of more than 50, 000 the group said it has access to.   The Clinton campaign would not confirm the authenticity of any of the documents but has not disputed the contents.
