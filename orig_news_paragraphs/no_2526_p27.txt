Let’s begin the week talking about holiday spirits. Dried hibiscus flowers steeped with ginger mean it’s Christmastime in Jamaica. Mulled wine with port and brandy make for a fine glögg in Scandinavia. Christmas by the beach comes via coquito, a Puerto Rican   cocktail. Recipes are like heirlooms for many families there and flavors include chocolate and banana.
