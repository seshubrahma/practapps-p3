A US official with close ties to the campaign says Pageâ€™s claim he spent time on the fifth floor is meaningless since the campaign no longer used that floor starting in early July. The official also says the places he listed as visiting are public spaces visited by millions of people a year. The FBI had Page on their radar for at least four years, according to court documents and US officials.   The bureau also knew about Page from its 2013 investigation into a Russian spy ring in New York.
