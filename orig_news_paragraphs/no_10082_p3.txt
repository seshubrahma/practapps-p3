The video went on to draw attention to the links between Google, its CEO Eric Schmidt, Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration. Schmidt was a founding investor in "The Groundwork," an organization that aims to harness the technological capabilities of Silicon Valley to put Clinton in the White House. Googleâ€™s head of public policy, meanwhile, Johanna Shelton, has made more than 125 visits to the White House while Obama has been in office. In short, the links between Google and the Democrats run deep.
