G. M. for example, has enjoyed success with a new line of midsize pickups that offer consumers an attractive alternative to its larger truck models. Fiat Chrysler, for its part, has expanded its portfolio of Jeep S. U. V.s to feature smaller models that incorporate the rugged styling and capability that has defined the brand for years. In Ford’s case, the company needed to branch out beyond its   pickups with a new Ranger model that could compete with G. M.’s entries in the segment. Similarly, the Bronco adds another S. U. V. in Ford showrooms to rival the Jeep lineup.
