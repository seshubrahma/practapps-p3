Boko Haram has killed more than 20, 000 people and displaced 2 million. Hillary calls herself a "champion of women’s rights," but did not designate Boko Haram a terrorist organization despite being responsible for killing and kidnapping thousands of people, including women and children, using them as sex slaves and suicide bombers. One of the most strategic consequential failures of the Hillary State Department was in 2009 when the U. S. undermined the Iranian Green Revolution. Not only did the U. S. do nothing to help the opposition against the terrorist Iranian regime, but US funding was cut for democratic   in Iran under Clinton’s State Department.
