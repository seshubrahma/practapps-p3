 (CNN) The recent run of bad news for Donald Trump show that the strategies, tone and tactics that he rode to the Republican nomination for president could be the very factors that block his chances of winning the White House.    In the primary, Trump succeeded by being brash, profane, unscripted and unpredictable, insulting anybody who opposed him and promising to reverse most of President Obamaâ€™s economic and foreign policy positions, all while heaping personal insults on Obama along the way.   He vowed to repeal Obamacare, promised to alter the terms of trade deals and called on the nation to ban all immigration of Muslims to the United States.
