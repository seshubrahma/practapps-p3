The UNFPA refuted the US claim that it supported abortion and said it regretted the US’ decision. The group also indicated that they hoped Washington would reverse course. " We have always valued the United States as a trusted partner and leader in helping to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled," UNFPA said in a statement.
