This is what it looks like.   The SP 500 adding an incredible 250 percent.   History made all along the way.   A stimulus, tax cuts, an auto bailout, a new health care law, debt ceiling showdowns and a credit downgrade of U. S. debt, a budget sequester, and then Democratic control giving way to a GOP hold on Congress and the White House.
