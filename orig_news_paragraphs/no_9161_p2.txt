Huffman started off his announcement with an apology.   I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday instigated harassment of our moderators and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything. Huffman then addressed   directly: The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself.
