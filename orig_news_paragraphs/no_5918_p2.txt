Politico reported: The American   website Breitbart, formerly run by Stephen Bannon, now White House chief strategist, has long fixated on Soros, accusing him of trying to bring down Europe’s borders, furthering the migrant crisis and funding Trump’s opponents. The perceived sympathy within the Trump administration for   sentiments appears to have emboldened politicians throughout Central and Eastern Europe to intensify their assault on   groups.    …      These efforts have already borne fruit: two letters, one signed by Republican Senator Mike Lee and the other by six House Republicans, were sent to the U. S. Mission in Macedonia in   inquiring about U. S. funding for Open Society Foundation projects in Macedonia.
