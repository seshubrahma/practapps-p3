The Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) are very unhappy assault charges were dropped against the Buffalo Bills’ LeSean McCoy after he engaged in a brawl with several police officers in a Philly bar in February. [On Monday Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams announced he felt there was "insufficient evidence" to charge either McCoy or the off duty officers involved in the fight in a Philly nightclub on February 7.   Williams said he was not able to determine who started the fight and that whoever was attacked first had a legal right to defend themselves. The fight started over a bottle of champagne ordered by two off duty police officers that a member of the player’s party claimed was his own.
