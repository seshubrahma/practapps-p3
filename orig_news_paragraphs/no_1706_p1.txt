Mr. Adelson once dangled the possibility of giving as much as $100 million to   groups, an infusion that at a stroke would have made the groups financially competitive against Hillary Clinton. But in recent weeks, the mercurial casino magnate  —   who entertained but ultimately rebuffed pitches from an array of Republican candidates during the party’s nominating contest this election cycle  —   became convinced that Mr. Trump’s chances of victory had diminished, according to Republicans briefed on his decision. The Adelson family’s biggest contributions are going instead to two "super PACs" backing Senate and House Republicans, each of which will get $20 million, making Mr. Adelson the single largest known donor to political organizations in the country. Mr. Adelson also gave $1. 5 million in August to a super PAC backing Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire.
