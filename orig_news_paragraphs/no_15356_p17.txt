Puerto Rico has been in an economic recession for about 10 years.   Its unemployment rate is more than 10 percent compared with less than 5 percent on the U. S. mainland.   These are big reasons why the island’s population has decreased by 350, 000 people in the past 10 years.   And fewer working residents means less tax revenue for the island’s indebted government.
