Throughout her second presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton has drawn on the inspiration of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was born into poverty and neglect and taught her daughter, from an early age, to confront bullies and stand up for herself. " She was such a stalwart support in every way, mostly personal, but she would have been excited she would have been proud," Mrs. Clinton said about how Mrs. Rodham would have viewed the events of the past few days. But, Mrs. Clinton also suggested that her mother would be eager to protect her from the attacks to come.
