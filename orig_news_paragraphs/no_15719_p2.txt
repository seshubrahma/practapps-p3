Every nation except Syria, Nicaragua and now, potentially, the United States, is part of the accord, which calls for an end to the fossil fuel era    and limiting global warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius above   levels. (Nearly 200 countries or parties have adopted the agreement and 147, including the United States, at least for now, have ratified or approved it, indicating a stronger level of commitment, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change).   Iâ€™m sure that target    considered the "north star" of climate policy    sounds ridiculously abstract and wonky. But the 2 degrees goal is incredibly consequential.
