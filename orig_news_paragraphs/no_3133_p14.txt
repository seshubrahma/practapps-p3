In a statement Wednesday, the Attorney General was very clear as to how he saw the lawsuit: At the heart of this immigration debate is disagreement over whether illegally entering this country is a crime.   Our duly enacted laws answer that question. Nevertheless, actions that have always been understood to be squarely within the powers of the President, regardless of the Administration, have now been enjoined.   The Department of Justice cannot accept such a result, and as the President has made clear, we will continue to litigate this case to vindicate the rule of law.
