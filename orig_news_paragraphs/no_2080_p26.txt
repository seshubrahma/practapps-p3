Samir Altaqi, a surgeon and former member of the Syrian Parliament who now directs the Orient Research Center in Dubai, said he now avoids images of Aleppo, where he grew up and began his career. " I donâ€™t bear to look too much at this footage because it would mean a full moral collapse, and I would become too extremist," he said. His interactions with younger Syrians who have lived through the war have scared him, he said.
