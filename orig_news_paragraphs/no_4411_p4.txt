The BBC does little to explain how such memes could influence elections, other than implying right wing politicians use them to "connect" with young voters. The example of Florian Philippot is given, a   of the Front National and advisor to Marine Le Pen, who used a meme on his YouTube channel. He flashed the ‘Risitas’ or ‘Spanish laughing guy’ meme at the end of a video, which has been used by both left and right wing activists. Mr. Philippot’s spokesman responded to the BBC’s insinuation that using the meme might be racist.
