On the Democratic side, where the primary is expected to be closer, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders spent the day trying to drum up support. Polls have shown Mrs. Clinton with an edge over Mr. Sanders, but Mr. Sanders is hoping for an unexpectedly strong performance that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton on her adopted turf. Both candidates were knocked off balance this weekend when questioned about an issue with particular relevance in New York: a bill that would allow foreign governments to be held responsible in American courts for having a role in terrorist attacks, such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The New York Times reported on Friday that Saudi Arabia had told the Obama administration and members of Congress that it would sell off hundreds of billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of American assets held by the kingdom if Congress passed the bill.
