Let me give you just the central statistic of American life right now: From 1947 to 2001, our economy grew at an average rate of 3. 5 percent a year. Since 2002, that rate’s fallen to 1. 9 percent a year. For every one percent of GDP growth that we have lost over the last 15 years, we’ve lost 1. 2 million jobs. If you add that up over the   period, that would be over 20 million jobs, which is about what we need to put everybody back to work at a decent wage.
