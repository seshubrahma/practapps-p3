—    a claim officials in this prosperous Scandinavian nation, which has a long humanitarian tradition, have rejected. Lars Bystrom, a police spokesman, said the police were summoned at 8:18 p. m. on Monday to the transit station in Rinkeby, about seven miles northwest of Stockholm’s City Hall, after officers made a   arrest and were set upon by residents. A police officer fired a live round of ammunition as a warning shot.
