It means that the presidential campaigns, like many corporate entities, are all in "deep doo doo" with Latinos, to quote a former U. S. president.   These campaigns seem to have more of an AstroTurf than a grassroots outreach effort.   If their political strategists didn’t see    or worse yet didn’t understand the way major corporations do     the opportunity Trump’s remarks had handed them to capture the hearts and minds of Latinos around the country, then you can be assured that the Latino Spring will rise again to issue course corrections, as needed.
