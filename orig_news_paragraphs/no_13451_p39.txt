—  this time from an Iowa phone number that Breitbart News traced back to a Cruz campaign volunteer hotline. Hello, this is the Cruz campaign with breaking news: Dr. Ben Carson will be [garbled] suspending campaigning following tonight’s caucuses. Please inform any Carson caucus goers of this news and urge them to caucus for Ted instead. Thank you.
