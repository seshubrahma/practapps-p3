Individual industries have successfully lobbied for specific tax breaks that function as subsidies: for instance, drilling for gas and oil, building Nascar racetracks or railroad tracks, roasting coffee, undertaking certain kinds of research, producing ethanol or making movies (which saved the Walt Disney Company $1. 48 billion over eight years, the report says). These   subsidies mean that the goodies were not evenly distributed. Utilities logged an effective tax rate of just 3. 1 percent over the   period.
