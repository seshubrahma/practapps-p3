Friday the St. Patrick’s Day awesome.   This is CNN 10 and I’m Carl Azuz.   First story, two U. S. federal judges have temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s new executive order concerning immigration to America.   His previous order on this subject is tied up in court.   The new one would have kept all refugees from entering the U. S. for 120 days and put a   suspension all people coming from Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
