ESSEN, Germany  —    To loud applause, Chancellor Angela Merkel told her party members on Tuesday that Germany should ban   veils "wherever legally possible" and that it would not tolerate any application of Shariah law over German justice. Accepting her party’s nomination as its candidate for another   term, the chancellor used the moment to broaden her stance on banning the veil, trying to deflect challenges from   forces that have made some of  their deepest gains since World War II. In welcoming nearly one million asylum seekers to Germany a year ago, Ms. Merkel emerged as a powerful voice for tolerance across a Europe gripped by anxiety over waves of arriving migrants and fears of terrorism.
