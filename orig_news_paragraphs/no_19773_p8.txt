And on Monday, a group of Republican senators introduced a budget amendment that could have the effect of putting off repeal of Obamacare until March, a significant delay considering that GOP leaders at one point wanted Trump to be able to sign that bill during his first days in office. Republicans have a more comfortable margin in the House, but even there, members of the conservative Freedom Caucus have urged party leaders to slow down, citing a desire to ensure that repealing the health law does not threaten their desire to balance the federal budget. Because of the taxes in Obamacare, repeal would increase the deficit in the short term. Does this mean the GOPâ€™s longstanding drive to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act is in jeopardy?
