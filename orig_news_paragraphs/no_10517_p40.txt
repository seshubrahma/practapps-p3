CITGO began when Henry L. Doherty started the Cities Service Company in 1910. After determining the company needed a name change, it came up with the name CITGO, keeping the root of cities and combining it with go to imply power. Occidental Petroleum purchased CITGO in 1982 but sold the company to The Southland Corporation the following year as Southland Corporation desired to supply gas to its   stores. Southland then sold 50 percent of the company to Petr√≥leos de Venezuela in 1986.
