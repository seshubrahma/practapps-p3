The U. S. has been providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, whose coalition is blamed for many of the civilian deaths, so Yemeni resentment of the United States is a very real factor to consider when estimating the dangers of radicalization.

The Saudi coalition has also been criticized for bombing Doctors Without Borders hospitals. The   government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi was displaced by an   Shiite insurgency from the Houthi minority, aided by forces loyal to the previous president, Ali Abdullah Saleh.
