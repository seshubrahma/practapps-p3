Trump is much better as a front man. And the polished Pence is a great choice who will do no harm and not make unforced errors. One thing Trump has to be careful going forward, especially since the media and Democrats will be parsing everything he says, is saying things like campaigns pay "millions" for briefing reports. He caught himself today, perhaps now aware that he must be more careful, and said his campaign only pays $10, 000 for the reports.
