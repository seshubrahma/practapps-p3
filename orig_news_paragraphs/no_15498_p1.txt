The President did not directly reveal the source of the information, but intelligence officials told CNN that there is concern that Russia will be able to figure out the highly sensitive source.

The intelligence relates to what is known as a special access program, or SAP, which covers some of the most classified information and is protected with unique access and security protocols. The White House scrambled to respond to the report Monday night, issuing several statements before sending H. R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser who participated in the meeting, out to speak with White House reporters.
