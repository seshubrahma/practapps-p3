The speech is set to begin at 9 p. m. ET. Boyle reports that Jeh Johnson will be the cabinet member who will not attend this year’s speech and be kept in a secure location: Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson is not at the Capitol on Tuesday evening for the State of the Union, and is in a secure location in the case of an emergency that needs the implementation of continuity of government. Every year, while the entire Supreme Court, most of Congress, the President, Vice President and most of the Cabinet are present in the chamber of the U. S. House of Representatives, at least one Cabinet member is kept in a secure location in case of emergency. This year, it’s Johnson.
