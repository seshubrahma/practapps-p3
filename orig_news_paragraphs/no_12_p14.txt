By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq   —   the "good war, " in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration’s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan.
