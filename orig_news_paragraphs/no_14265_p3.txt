Presidents donâ€™t often attend dignified transfer ceremonies. Obama attended several of these ceremonies, including in 2011 after a   joint raid resulted in the deaths of 38 US and Afghani troops. Owens was the only US service member to die in the operation, which killed an estimated 14   in the Arabian Peninsula members. The raid also resulted in the death of the    daughter of former al Qaeda leader Anwar   a US citizen who was killed in a drone strike in 2011.
