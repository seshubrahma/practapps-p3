But after a recent trip to D. C. for some private briefings, both with his transition teams and with key members of the Vast   Conspiracy, I came away more confident than ever that Trump has what it takes —  especially when it comes to dealing with arguably the most dangerous menace of our time: the massively corrupt, overblown, expensive, misanthropic, bullying, insidious, ugly, mendacious and hideously destructive environmental industry —  aka The Green Blob.   Sure there are other geopolitical threats out there —  from ISIS, Iran and the crumbling EU to a   Russia and an increasingly arrogant China —   but there’s probably none which has quite so big an impact on ordinary peoples’ daily lives, on their economic and social wellbeing, and on their children ’s future as the Green Blob.
