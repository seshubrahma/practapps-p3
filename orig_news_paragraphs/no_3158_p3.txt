The corporate tax rate would fall to 15 percent from 35 percent. In addition, U. S. companies would owe little or no tax on future profits earned outside the U. S. putting the U. S. on a territorial tax system similar to those employed in most developed countries. Business income reported on individual returns would also drop to 15 percent, a change that would benefit many small businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economics adviser Gary Cohn set forth the framework at a White House press conference on Wednesday.
