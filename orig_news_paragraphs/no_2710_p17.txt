The Pune towers are the first   project to be completed in India, to be followed in the next few years by a   skyscraper in Mumbai. Mr. Trump’s five current projects in India are worth around $1. 5 billion, making it Mr. Trump’s most active development market outside North America, Mr. Mehta, the managing director at Tribeca Developers and the Trump Organization’s representative in India, told The Indian Express last week. In most cases, Mr. Trump does not invest in the projects, but instead allows the developers to use his name in return for an undisclosed sum in royalties, according to industry analysts. Though each agreement is structured differently, in many cases the brand receives a percentage of sales, meaning Mr. Trump stands to benefit directly from increased revenues.
