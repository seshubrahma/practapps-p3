Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the presidential transition, said that Mr. Price took "his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously," and that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an "exhaustive" review of his financial holdings. Representatives of Mr. Price and Mr. Collins say they have not broken any rules, but what has puzzled Washington and industry insiders alike is how a   Australian biotech, with only one experimental multiple sclerosis drug under development, attracted a coterie of Washington investors, including the man who is likely to become the next health secretary. " Maybe Chris is just a cheerleader for the company and Tom Price jumped in head over heels," said Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, a consumer group, which has asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
