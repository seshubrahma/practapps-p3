This is it. The roots of the health conspiracy theory go back to late 2012, Days before she was first scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill about the Benghazi terror attack in December 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion after becoming dehydrated and fainting. Her appearance, scheduled for December 20, was pushed back as she recovered.   In a bit of dark irony, Clintonâ€™s political opponents then, most notably the Republican former U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, suggested that Clinton was faking it    that the secretary of state, as Bolton put it, had come down with a "diplomatic illness" in order to avoid the congressional inquiry.
