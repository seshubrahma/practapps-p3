Well, I don’t want to comment on media   outlets, but I will tell you that if the Republican Party does   not evolve, the Republican Party is going to die. The Republican   Party cannot be     not out there   practicing the politics of people, you know, the issues   surrounding drug addiction and mental illness and the cost of   prescription drugs and healthcare and student debt and all of   these things are very personal to people now. And if the party   wants to have an ideological debate, it’s never going to win   anything in a major way. So I do believe that the party needs to   evolve, or I won’t be a part of it.
