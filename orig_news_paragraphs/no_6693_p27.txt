In 2015, reports suggested that the Assyrian Christian forces had managed a delicate agreement with Arab rebels and Kurdish militia fighters to all target the Islamic State. Christians are the targets of discrimination from Arab rebels, ISIS, and the Kurds, however, leaving them often to fight for their territory alone. Christian militias have vocally pleaded for help from the United States, which has preferred investing in the Free Syrian Army and the YPG. In addition to the   genocidal acts of ISIS, Christian groups allege that they are the victims of an ethnic cleansing attempt in Rojava.
