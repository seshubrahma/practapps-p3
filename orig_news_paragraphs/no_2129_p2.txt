The speech, the latest salvo in a final conflict between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama as Donald J. Trump prepares to assume the presidency, will make the case that "the vote was not unprecedented" and that Mr. Obamaâ€™s decision "did not blindside Israel. " Mr. Kerry, the official said, would cite other cases in which Washington officials had allowed similar votes under previous presidents. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a coming speech, said Mr. Kerry would also argue that, with the notable exception of Israel, there was a "complete international consensus" against further settlements in areas that might ultimately be the subject of negotiations.
