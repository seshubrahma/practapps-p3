throwing a baseball, writing an essay, driving a car, walking down the aisle    that have shaped us, and we thank our dads for being there with a helping hand and an open heart. Day in and day out, fathers put their children first, creating loving and supportive environments.   Whether by birth, adoption, or foster care, today we honor the incredible fathers in our lives for all they have done and continue to do for us.   Fathers inspire us to better ourselves and to be men and women of outstanding character.
