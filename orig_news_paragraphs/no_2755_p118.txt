The commercially savvy Mr. Ide has cast this book well: It features a hugely famous but   rapper IQ’s sidekick, a petty crook named Dodson Dodson’s loudmouthed girlfriend and IQ’s dead older brother, who serves as his conscience and really, really loved Motown. Aggressively entertaining plotting is paired with the kind of dialogue for which readers love Don Winslow. This series is a Los Angeles classic right from the start. (Read the review.)
