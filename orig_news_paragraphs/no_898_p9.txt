As one of Europe’s most powerful institutions, the central bank serves as an   piñata for nationalist politicians of all stripes. Frauke Petry, leader of the   Alternative for Germany party, regularly accuses Mr. Draghi of endangering Germans’ savings with ultralow interest rates. In Italy, where low interest rates have helped ease a severe credit crunch, sentiment runs the opposite direction. When the European Central Bank does begin gradually reducing its stimulus efforts, perhaps around the middle of the year, expect leaders of the populist Five Star Movement in Italy to accuse Mr. Draghi of selling out to the Germans.
