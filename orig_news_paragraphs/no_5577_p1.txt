Speaking through an Italian translator, Abbas said he had only heard of the proposal by US   Donald Trump to move the embassy to Jerusalem, and couldn’t comment officially unless and until it happens. But he added: "If this is the decision, to transfer the embassy to Jerusalem, it will not help peace and we hope it doesn’t happen. " The Palestinians strongly oppose the move, saying it would kill any hopes for negotiating an   peace agreement and rile the region by undercutting Muslim and Christian claims to the holy city.
