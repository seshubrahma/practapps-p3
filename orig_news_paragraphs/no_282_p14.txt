On the 100th day, Mr. Baumer walked from Defuniak Springs to Mossy Head. He took a photograph of himself standing with his toes near the   word "killed" on the road, with an arrow pointing ahead. The image captured a gas line connection on a grassy lawn, and it was the last one on his blog. He sat on a bench in the rain and spoke to his father.
