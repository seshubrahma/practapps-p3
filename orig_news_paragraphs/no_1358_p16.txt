Over the last two days, more than 70 Republican governors, senators, representatives, officials and donors were contacted directly or through aides for comments about Mr. Trump. Only about 20 replied, with many aides saying their bosses did not want to take a stand yet others begged off by saying the officials were traveling or "too busy" to email, call or release a statement. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said in a news release issued after 7 p. m. Wednesday that Mr. Trump had "the opportunity and the obligation to unite our party around our goals. "
