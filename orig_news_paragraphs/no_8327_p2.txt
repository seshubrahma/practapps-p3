Fast forward to the next time thereâ€™s a Democratic primary for president, this year (since Obama was the incumbent president seeking reelection the primaries in 2012 were largely perfunctory) and turnout has dropped off significantly. Just 19, 155, 825 people have voted thus far in primaries and caucuses this cycle, a decrease of 4, 560, 041 voters or 19. 23 percent. The steep drop off is so significant on the Democratic side that the vast majority of states saw drops in voter participation in Democratic primaries and caucuses.
