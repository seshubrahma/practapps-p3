Chaffetz spokeswoman MJ Henshaw said Thursday that the release of the Flynn documents constituted a violation of trust by Cummings because he never consulted with Chaffetz before releasing them.   " Though we’ve walked    with the Democrats during this investigation, this morning they broke with   protocol and decided to release these documents without consulting us," Henshaw told CNN.   Democrats, including a Cummings spokeswoman, pushed back on the idea they hadn’t worked with Republicans on the committee.
