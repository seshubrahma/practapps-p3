Mr. Zinke has also repeatedly voted to block efforts to designate new national parks that would diversify the National Park System. The League of Conservation Voters, a   lobbying group, gave Zinke a three percent rating on its 2015 scorecard. Environmentalists might not be pleased with Zinke, but neither has he always voted with conservatives, or even Republicans, since joining the House of Representatives with the class of 2015. In July, Zinke voted with Democrats to unsuccessfully block a program to transfer federal land to the states.
