Trump met with Shaw and other relatives of victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.   Then flanked by the families, he gave another lengthy news conference, claiming Mexico was sending its criminals to the United States. " The fact that they are sending criminals and prisoners into our country and there are people stupid enough to put them in jails or let them roam the street, which is even worse, I have to respect (Mexico) for it," Trump said.
