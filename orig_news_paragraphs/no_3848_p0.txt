Robert Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, said Wednesday that ABC News has been "extremely fair" in its coverage of the 2016 election and the Trump administration and that complaints of   political bias on ESPN are "completely exaggerated. " [Disney, which owns both ABC News and ESPN, held its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, where Iger responded to a question about the leftwing political bias at the networks by Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy Research.    Iger insisted that ABC News has been entirely on the level in its coverage of the 2016 campaign and President Trump. He said: ABC News has reported to me, directly or indirectly, for almost 25 years.
