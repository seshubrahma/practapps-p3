Madeline Schildwachter of Wilmington, North Carolina, has posted multiple videos to her Twitter account, calling for Rep. David Rouzer to hold a town hall.   " I started by calling and that wasnâ€™t getting anywhere. So I started selfie videos to not just get his attention but to show people it matters," Schildwachter said.
