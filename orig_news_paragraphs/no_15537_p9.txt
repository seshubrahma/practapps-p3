a dramatic 2004 dispute over the Bush administrationâ€™s warrantless wiretapping program.   Comey was serving as acting attorney general as   General John Ashcroft was hospitalized. Comey refused to reauthorize the controversial Bush administration program over concerns about the legality of the surveillance.   The White House counsel and chief of staff rushed to the hospital to attempt to get Ashcroft to sign the reauthorization    and Comey rushed to stop them, though the program was eventually reauthorized without Justice Department approval.
