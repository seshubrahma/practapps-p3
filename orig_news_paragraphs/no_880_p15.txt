Mr. Vafadariâ€™s sister, Kateh Vafadari, who lives in the Washington area, said nothing of the arrests for a few months. But on Dec. 1, she wrote to Ayatollah Khamenei, imploring him to intervene, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New   advocacy group. The center quoted the letter as saying Mr. Vafadari and his wife had been subjected to "extortion, property seizure and national security threats. "
