Mr. Kushner’s work on the campaign took place behind the scenes, with the notable exception of an   article in support of Mr. Trump in July in The Observer. At the time, Mr. Trump was under fire for a Twitter post that included an image of Hillary Clinton with a shape resembling a Star of David next to a pile of cash, the latest in a list of actions by the campaign that struck many as insensitive to Jewish concerns. In defending Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner told the story of his grandmother’s narrow escape from the Nazis in the Soviet Union during World War II. The article provoked an angry response on Facebook from two estranged cousins, one of whom accused Mr. Kushner of exploiting their family’s history for political purposes.
