The Justice Department asked the trial judge, Judge James L. Robart, of the Federal District Court in Seattle, to "postpone any further proceedings" in his court while the appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, considers whether to rehear the case. Lawyers for the states of Washington and Minnesota, which are challenging the ban, urged Judge Robart to order the parties to start exchanging information in preparation for trial. " Given the gravity of the states’ constitutional allegations, defendants’ stated national security concerns, and the public interests at stake, the states respectfully submit that discovery should proceed without delay," Noah G. Purcell, Washington’s solicitor general, wrote.
