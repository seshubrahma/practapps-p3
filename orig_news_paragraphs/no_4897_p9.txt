Nor were Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George [H. W.] Bush, or Bill Clinton spectacularly successful in their first few months in office. Inexperience and disarray have also made several past presidents susceptible to rookie mistakes during the first 100 days. Jack Kennedy authorized the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, for example, in April 1961. Bill Clinton’s early mistakes doomed his health care plan, while Jimmy Carter’s missteps greatly damaged his relationship with Congress and the federal bureaucracy.
