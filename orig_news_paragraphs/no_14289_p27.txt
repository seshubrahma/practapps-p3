She would have had to start the immigration process over if she remained in Somalia, so she decided instead to leave Mushkaad with a family friend and bring her two other daughters to the United States. Mushkaad had just gotten her visa and was scheduled to fly to Minnesota on Tuesday, but she wasnâ€™t allowed on the flight because of the travel ban. US Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and new Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, made direct pleas to have Mushkaad resettled as a refugee. She was reunited with her mother and two older sisters Thursday.
