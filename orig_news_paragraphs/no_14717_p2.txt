As you know we maintain abilities to be able to respond quickly and intercept missiles from North Korea if they do pose a threat to us or our allies," a Pentagon spokesman, US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said. The North Korean launch involved the first   test of an   missile that, in the past, has been fired from a submarine, two US officials said.   And because it was launched from a missile site on North Koreaâ€™s west coast, it flew farther than any previous North Korean tests, about 300 miles before dropping into the Sea of Japan.
