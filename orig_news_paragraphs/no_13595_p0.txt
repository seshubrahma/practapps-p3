Pollster and political strategist Pat Caddell agreed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Monday that the recount effort now being pushed by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, with the help and support of Hillary Clinton, is an attempt to "delegitimize"   Donald Trump. ["What Donald Trump must understand," said Caddell, "is that this war didnâ€™t end on Election Day. This war will be fought every day. "  "What he has done is now positioned himself to take power away from a group of people in the political elite of both parties and in the unelected media. They will fight back every inch of the way," he added.
