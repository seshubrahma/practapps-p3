Russia also shares with   groups across the world a deeply held belief that, regardless of their party, traditional elites should be deposed because of their support for globalism and transnational institutions like NATO and the European Union. But this means different things to different groups and people. Mr. Putin, for example, has "a natural interest in making a mess in Europe and the U. S.," Mr. Kreko said. But for Mr. Heimbach, whose Traditionalist Worker Party uses the slogan "Globalism is the poison, nationalism is the antidote," the term "international elites" is often an   code for Jews, though he denied any racist intent.
