Some of the individuals involved in the intercepted communications were known to the US intelligence community as "heavily involved" in collecting information damaging to Hillary Clinton and helpful to Donald Trump, two of the officials tell CNN.    Until now, US intelligence and law enforcement officials have said they could not verify any parts of the dossier.   Officials who spoke to CNN cautioned they still have not reached any judgment on whether the Russian government has any compromising information about the President.     Officials did not comment on or confirm any alleged conversations or meetings between Russian officials and US citizens, including associates of   Trump.
