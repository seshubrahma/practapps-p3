However, data from exit polls suggest that the Republican electorate has been receptive to Trump’s positions on these issues. For instance, Wisconsin’s exit polls showed that 7 out of 10 GOP Wisconsin voters support a temporary pause Muslim migration  —   a position that has not been articulated by any candidate aside from Trump. Similarly, a majority of Wisconsin Republicans (54%) said that foreign trade deals take away U. S. jobs. Again, Trump is the only candidate in the GOP field campaigning against globalist trade pacts and arguing that the trade deals of recent decades have not benefited American workers.
