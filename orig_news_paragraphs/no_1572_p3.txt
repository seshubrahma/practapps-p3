Mr. Rigell is the second Republican member of Congress this week to back a candidate other than Mr. Trump in the presidential race the other, Representative Richard Hanna of New York, endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Both Mr. Rigell and Mr. Hanna are retiring from Congress at the end of their current terms. But Mr. Rigellâ€™s support for the Libertarian ticket may be more portentous: Mr. Johnson and his running mate, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, have been seeking to woo disaffected Republicans who view Mr. Trump as unacceptable. Should additional Republican officeholders follow Mr. Rigell in backing the   ticket, it could help Mr. Johnson gain credibility as an alternative choice.
