The increase was mainly due to a movement toward approval among about a third of his own voters who had previously said they "neither approve nor disapprove". Asked if they would vote for their candidate again, 91% of Trump voters said yes, and 89% of Clinton voters said yes. (A recent ABC   Post poll found a larger decline among Clinton voters.) The poll also found significant differences among Trump and Clinton voters in their news diet.
