The immense losses at First Boston in 1986 taught a lesson that eventually shaped BlackRock. Mr. Fink realized that his clients on the "buy side" (the fund managers, insurance companies and pension funds shopping for investments) had become dependent on the ability of the "sell side" (the Wall Street investment banks) to analyze mortgages. That was because few   clients had invested in computers and technology to the level First Boston had. Most money management firms highlight their investment returns first, and risk controls second.
