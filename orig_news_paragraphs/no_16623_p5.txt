In Myanmar, I watched a Buddhist government and its functionaries beat and murder Buddhist monks, the personification of their faith and national identity.

Seeing your opponents as fundamentally different and threatening can come to justify remarkable brutality. Despite diverse cultures, histories, and geographies, there is a surprising uniformity when nations splinter apart.
