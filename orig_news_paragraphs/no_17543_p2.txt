Many of these women are sharing remarkably similar stories of Cosby subjecting them to unwanted sexual contact through the use of drugs, alcohol and promises of success in show business. Until recently, Cosby’s legal team had pursued a tactic of limiting the famed comedian and actor’s public denials of improper conduct to formal documents filed in court, rather than television appearances.
