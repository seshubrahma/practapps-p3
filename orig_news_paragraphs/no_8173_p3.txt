The Clinton email scandal has dominated the news cycle following an inspector general report that found Clinton in violation of government rules, and a Breitbart News report on Clinton’s disclosure of the names of   intelligence sources on her   private email server. Clinton was forced to answer to the scandal in her interview with Fox News host Bret Baier. Clinton said: I have said it wasn’t the best choice to use a personal email. It was a mistake.
