The clashes in the audience quickly subsided, and Mr. Sanders drew some of his strongest cheers as he described his unexpectedly competitive challenge against Mrs. Clinton and his primary and caucus victories in 22 states. In an odd passage for a concession speech, Mr. Sanders said that Mrs. Clinton had "389 more pledged delegates than we have, and a lot more superdelegates"  â€”   a reference to party leaders that drew boos from the audience and a steely look from Mrs. Clinton. One person close to Mr. Sanders said that the senator and his wife, Jane, were "putting on a good face" on Tuesday, but that they were disappointed that his campaign had not been more successful after he gave it so much of his energy and rallied millions of people around his ideas. The person, a longtime top political adviser to Mr. Sanders who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the private views of the couple, also said that the senator had resolved to keep his word to endorse the Democratic nominee and that he had been told by some   Democrats that he could become chairman of the committee that would work on trying to carry out a proposed $15 federal minimum wage.
