In a study published this month in the journal Social Science  Medicine, Yale professor Marissa King found that in states that banned gifts to doctors from pharmaceutical companies, doctors were less likely to prescribe costly new medications that had few advantages over cheaper, generic alternatives. " Pharmaceutical representatives are likable people, and we like doing things to please people that we like," says Peter Mansfield, an Australian physician who founded the   group HealthySkepticism. org and   the 2010 review paper.
