FBI Director James Comey seemed to reference Malik when he said on June 13: "In the course of that investigation, one witness told us, when asked, "Do you know anybody else who might be radicalizing," that he had once been concerned about the killer because the killer had mentioned   videos. The witness had concluded that he later got married, and had a child, and got a job as a security guard, and so he was no longer concerned about him. Comey said the FBI spoke with Mateen about his connection to the suicide bomber.   In his Post piece, Malik said he was writing because presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had said no Muslim did anything to stop Mateen.
