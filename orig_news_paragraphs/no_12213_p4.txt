A 2015 PBS documentary revealed how both Ryan and Mulvaney were at the center of the   La   effort to enact Obama’s amnesty agenda. According to Pew polling data, Ryan’s expansionist immigration agenda is opposed by more than nine in ten GOP voters. Similarly, nearly nine in ten GOP voters oppose Paul Ryan’s vision on trade, according to polling data from a recent POLITICO   survey. It remains unclear whether members of the House Freedom Caucus will vote in January to   as House Speaker a man whose globalist positions on immigration and trade are opposed by the vast majority of their constituents.
