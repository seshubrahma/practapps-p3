The   world around them has also exceeded my expectations in their   attempts to stop them from actually improving the markets. I   think the game is slightly changing, and that because they’re now   an exchange, they can generate data showing what is essentially   the grift that goes on in other exchanges   —   what it costs   investors to trade on those versus on an exchange like IEX that   is actually trying to level the playing field and not give     traders an advantage. The game is going to be   getting that information now.
