How he meshes with Trump, Overall, Mattis and Schake urge that political leaders such as Trump should be making the case for the necessity of America’s wars rather than relying on the military to do so that those wars should be better resourced the United States should be in those wars to win, and the military should focus on waging successful wars rather than being a petri dish for social experimentation.   It’s very much of a piece with Trump’s "America First" sloganeering, but Mattis lays out this thinking with much greater specificity than his new boss. Further clues about how Mattis may guide the Pentagon can be found in a thesis entitled "The Mattis Way of War" written by Maj. Michael Valenti while he was a student at the US Army Staff College.
