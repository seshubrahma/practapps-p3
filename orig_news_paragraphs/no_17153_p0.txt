 (CNN)   Donald Trump brushed aside his campaign promises to jail Hillary Clinton, batted away questions about conflicts of interest over his business empire and denounced the   movement that is celebrating his victory.   Answering questions for just the second time since his election, Trump met for 75 minutes on Tuesday with reporters, editors and columnists from The New York Times.   It wasn’t broadcast live, but some Times reporters tweeted Trump’s remarks in real time.
