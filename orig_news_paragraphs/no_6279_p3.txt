Google’s Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai, sent a note to Google employees saying, "It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.

"   A Google spokeswoman clarified the company’s stance on the executive order and, similarly to Apple, promised to bring their concerns to the White House, "We’re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the US. We’ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.
