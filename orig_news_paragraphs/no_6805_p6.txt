However, the Obama administration granted states waivers during the recession, and many states continue to use waivers for the food stamp requirements. In 2014, Maine dropped its waiver for work requirements, and required everyone who could work and did not have dependents to either get employment for at least 20 hours a week, enter   programs, or volunteer a minimum of 24 hours a month. Before Maine dropped its waiver in 2014, there were 13, 332 food stamp recipients. By March 2015, the number of food stamp recipients dropped by 80 percent, to 2, 678 recipients who decided to get a job, participate in job training, or volunteer.
