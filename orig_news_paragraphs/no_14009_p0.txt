Washington (CNN) Vice   Mike Pence is looking to a former US vice    as a model for his new role as he prepares to assume the   office in the country.   He recently spoke on the phone with former President George H. W. Bush, Pence told CNN’s Dana Bash in an interview Wednesday, and said the Ronald Reagan’s former vice president offered him some advice. Pence, who didn’t divulge what Bush 41 told him, said the two men had a "short call," but that he has been "taking a hard look" at Bush’s years as vice president as he prepares to figure out what type of vice president he will be.
