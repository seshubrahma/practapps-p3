What’s difficult with Trump is that no president in history had had such a casual relationship with the truth. He repeatedly says things that are provably false and, if ever called out on that fact, attributes it to something he heard or read somewhere.   The unfortunate result of that sort of "truthiness" is a numbness that begins to develop around the things he says that are simply not true. There’s a tendency to gloss over the smaller inconsistencies to focus on bigger    or just other    inconsistencies.
