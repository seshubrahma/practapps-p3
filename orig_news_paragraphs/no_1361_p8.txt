I was getting messages from all over the place that if you want to keep doing the show, CBS will do it. And in the beginning of the year, Michelle and Robert came to me and said we’re writing the show as if it were ending, because we’re out. So suddenly I felt like I was put in this very precarious position. If I say yes, I’m screwing them over, because they had a vision for the show, and it’s their baby.
