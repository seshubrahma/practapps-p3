I think the next question he should ask Hillary is: "Mrs. Clinton, is it okay with you that your husband flies around in private jets with a convicted pedophile to a private island called ‘Orgy Island’ and be entertained by underage girls? The real word for that is pedophilia and human trafficking. Is that okay with you?" Willey was referring to Clinton’s association with billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who served eighteen months in prison after being convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.
