Clapper said while the vetting being done on people entering the country was not "perfect," those actions were strong enough to keep the country safe without this new measure.    Clapper, while noting that he’s farther removed from the job each day that goes by, said "I don’t believe we, in (the intelligence community) were aware of any extraordinary threats that we weren’t already dealing with."    He added, "We were using some very rigorous vetting processes to check people, validate the people were who they claim to be."    In his first public comments on the matter, Clapper said the decision to brief both Trump, who was still the   at the time, and Obama on a dossier alleging Russia had compromising information on Trump was partly due to various media outlets and offices on Capitol Hill having the document.
