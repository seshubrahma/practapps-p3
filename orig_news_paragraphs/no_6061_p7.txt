On Wednesday, the NAACP of Portland said the group voted to withdraw its support of the Women’s March on Portland, a satellite   protest. " I didn’t want to be part of the march if it was going to be a   kumbaya march," said NAACP president Jo Ann Hardesyt. The New York Times reports that other   protest organizers from Louisiana to Tennessee have seen race become an issue.
