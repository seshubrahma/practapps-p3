In addition to a large increase in homicides, major cities in the US have experienced more than 1, 000 more robberies, almost 2, 000 more aggravated assaults and more than 600   shootings in 2016 compared to this time last year. The only category of violent crime not reflecting an increase when compared to last year is rape.   The 316 homicides reported by the Chicago Police Department were by far the most of any law enforcement agency included in the survey, a 48% increase over last year. The Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Department said there were 110 homicides so far this year, compared to 85 in 2015.
