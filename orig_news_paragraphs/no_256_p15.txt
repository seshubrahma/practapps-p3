Mr. Govan breaks rules and celebrates the unconventional in a way that, if nothing else, draws attention to the museum and its director. What other museum director would orchestrate the   spectacle of moving a   boulder through the streets of Los Angeles at night before installing it on the museum grounds as "Levitated Mass," a work by Michael Heizer? He has had exhibitions devoted to Tim Burton, Mr. Gehry and Robert Mapplethorpe. Average attendance has doubled since 2007, to 1. 6 million people.
