I hope Donald Trump spells out ambitious, sensible and effective plans for meeting those two challenges. Yet, frankly, I do not care much about the changing details or the numbers in his call for deportations, or how high or how long the wall will be, or how many thousand refugees from Muslim countries will be allowed admission instead of the 100, 000 yearly Hillary will allow. Those details and those numbers will all be subject to negotiation with Congress, including Republican leaders who are not friendly to robust immigration enforcement. What I care about very much and what I know for a 100 percent certainty is that those decisions and proposals by President Donald Trump will be one thousand percent more consistent with my constitutional principles than the decisions made by President Hillary Clinton.
