Thursday, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan posted a video on his Facebook page from "The Cliff Kelley Show" on WVON from earlier this month in which he warned Americans about a Donald Trump presidency,   Farrakhan said, "Mr. Trump is tearing away the skin of the onion of white civility and the more he pulls the skin of that onion back, he’s beginning to show something in the character of the whites that follow him, that they don’t care what he says. He could say one thing this minute, another thing the next minute and you can see that the man has a little problem.
