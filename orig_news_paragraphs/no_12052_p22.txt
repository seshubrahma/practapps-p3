If Governor John Kasich had not managed a win in his home state of Ohio, that effort would be all but over  …     and now #NeverTrump will have to deal with Kasich’s equally vain and doomed determination to stay in the race beyond his utility to their movement. Maybe he’ll land some solid punches on Cruz in that final debate Trump won’t be attending, and further weaken the only viable alternative candidate left in the race.    The Republican primary has been like a shootout from "Get Smart," where a tense standoff ends with everyone except the befuddled Maxwell Smart shooting each other  …     because the Republicans didn’t take their own electorate seriously until it was far too late, and they were too slow to abandon their "Better Dead Than Ted" determination to keep the nomination away from Cruz.
