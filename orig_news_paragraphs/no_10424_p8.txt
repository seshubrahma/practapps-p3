After another Twitter storm, Buzzfeed finally corrected the story accurately, which turned it into the stupid Nothingburger it always was. Like Fareed Zakaria’s victory dance over the death of white people, the hour "Meet the Press" spent comparing Republicans to Nazis, CNN and Politico lying about Ben Carson’s biography, and The Washington Post using its   column to tell serial lies. what we have here is one more example of the   "objective media" engaging in desperate, shrill, demagogic overreach to protect Hillary Clinton by taking down her primary threats. We are so far beyond the   media bias.
