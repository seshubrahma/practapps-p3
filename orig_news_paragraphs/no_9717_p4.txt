Regarding the "creation" of IS, the memo states: "When the U. S. invaded Iraq in 2003 we triggered a massive insurgency against our presence," the memo stated. " Around this time, a Jordanian   named Zarqawi travelled to Iraq with one goal: to establish a religious state just for Sunni Muslims. " "   â€¦    Zarqawi was killed by American forces in 2006.
