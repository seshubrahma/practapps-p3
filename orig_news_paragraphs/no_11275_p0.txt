Sen. Marco Rubio is not only going to go to the Republican convention that will nominate Donald Trump as the presidential nominee, he would be willing to speak for his former rival and release his delegates to him. ["My sense is I’m going to go to the convention," Rubio said in an interview with Jake Tapper aired on Thursday. Rubio admitted that he would he "honored" to speak for the Republican nominee if Trump asked him to speak at the convention.   The Florida senator’s decision is markedly different from many of Trump’s vanquished presidential rivals such as Jeb Bush who vowed not to attend the convention.
