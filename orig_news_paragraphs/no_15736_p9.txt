In October 1948, a poisonous smog killed 26 people and impacted thousands more in Donora, a suburb of Pittsburgh, as well as neighboring communities. Sulfuric acid, nitrogen dioxide and other poisonous gases emitted by the steel industry and usually dispersed into the atmosphere were caught in foggy weather conditions and sickened the population, according to the Donora Historical Societyâ€™s Smog Museum. By the turn of the century, the industry had collapsed and Pittsburgh became a prime example of what could befall a city that did not enact and enforce strict environmental policies. It took years of legislation and action for the city to eventually reclaim its health and beauty.
