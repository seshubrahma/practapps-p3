The state of Marco’s campaign got increasingly grim toward the end. I understand they took to playing a modified version of ‘Marco Polo’ at his appearances, in which a blindfolded Marco gamely chases after supporters in nearly empty halls who answer "Rubio!" when he calls out his first name. Narco Marco has a lot in common with Hillary: neither of them can pull off a public appearance without being severely medicated. Starting with his infamous water break during the response to Obama’s state of the union speech, to his current behaviour during debates including sweating, cottonmouth, and interrupting other speakers, perhaps he should try a debate or two without the   if he ever runs again.
