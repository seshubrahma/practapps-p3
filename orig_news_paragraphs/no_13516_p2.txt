Northside Independent School District spokesman Barry Perez told the   "appropriate action" was taken to reprimand the teacher and the students. He said the students would face disciplinary attention. However, Harold and Melinda Bean, parents of a student in that English class, were outraged by what took place and were not so sure the matter was handled appropriately. They complained about the skit to administrators at this San Antonio area school district and also spoke to the San Antonio newspaper.
