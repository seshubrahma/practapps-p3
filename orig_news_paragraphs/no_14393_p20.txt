The executive has a duty to protect the homeland from security threats that are deemed credible and perhaps imminent. We the people, (not the courts) need to stop dealing in our emotions and start dealing with the uncomfortable realities of the world in which we live. We need to step back from whether we like President Donald Trump, which seems to be driving so much sentiment in the media    particularly social media    and focus on his presidential authority, and that of every other president to follow.   We cannot afford to be naive anymore, to be so concerned about the rights of others outside our country that we jeopardize our own rights and security.
