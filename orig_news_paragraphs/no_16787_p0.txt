 (CNN) Some of Donald Trump’s advisers are discussing an overhaul in how he prepares for his second   with Hillary Clinton, and one option being floated internally is asking Chris Christie to take a leading role to get the Republican nominee ready. The New Jersey governor, a   friend of Trump’s, is one of "the few" in the billionaire’s inner circle who has always been straight with him, and was "brutally honest" about his shortcomings after this week’s debate, according to a source familiar with the discussions. There’s no sign that everyone in the campaign agrees this is the right path forward.
