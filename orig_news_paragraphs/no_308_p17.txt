When it came to hard evidence immune to the measurement error critique, Mr. Richman and his   found one validated 2012 voter who had indicated not being a citizen in both the 2010 and 2012 surveys. But the same noncitizen had indicated in the survey that he or she was not registered to vote. The determination that he or she was a voter was based on voter records: The respondents to the survey were matched to a voter registration file. It is possible that this noncitizen was erroneously matched to the voter file.
