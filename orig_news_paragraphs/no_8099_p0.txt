Rapper Snoop Dogg kept the Democratic National Convention party going until well past 3 a. m. Friday at a   "unity" concert in Philadelphia, just after Hillary Clinton brought the main festivities to a close by accepting the party ’s presidential nomination Thursday night. [Snoop performed a concert full of his greatest hits at the Electric Factory, in a show meant to bring together supporters of Clinton and her primary opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, after what had been a raucous and divided convention.   But despite the party’s billing, the rapper never mentioned Sanders’s name, according to Variety.
