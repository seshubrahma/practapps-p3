Early television awards were widely distributed. The   FX series "Atlanta," about an aspiring rapper and his manager cousin, was honored as best comedy and Donald Glover won for best comedic actor for his performance in the show. Beating the likes of Rami Malek ("Mr. Robot") and Bob Odenkirk ("Better Call Saul") for best actor in a drama was Billy Bob Thornton, honored for his performance in "Goliath," a show with little buzz. Best actress in a TV drama went to Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix’s "The Crown," which won for best dramatic series.
