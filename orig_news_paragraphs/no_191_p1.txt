The concerns include a dollar that has gained too much in value, worries about trade wars with China and Mexico and, most broadly, a fear that Mr. Trump will not be able to deliver on his promises to cut taxes, increase government spending and reduce regulation. The market declines in recent weeks have been very modest, and investors, for now, seem to be prepared to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt on his plans for the economy. Nevertheless, in the wake of his unpredictable Twitter posts, last week’s  news conference and Mr. Trump’s tough talk about China, a mood of caution has tempered earlier bouts of euphoria. Mr. Trump’s comments over the weekend about the dollar being too strong, about the possibility that more countries will follow Britain out of the European Union and his intention to tax German carmakers for not building factories in the United States all heightened these concerns.
