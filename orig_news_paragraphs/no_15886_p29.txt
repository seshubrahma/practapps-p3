I learned about the shooting as Democrats were practicing on a different field for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity. When our team got the news, we gathered in the dugout, put our arms around each other, and prayed. After I checked in with my family, my next instinct was to call my friend and fellow Michigander, John Moolenaar. John plays on the Republican baseball team and was at the site of the shooting.
