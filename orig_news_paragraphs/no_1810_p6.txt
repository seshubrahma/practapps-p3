" This is the 3rd time this week where she has gone to daddy to change a decision or interject herself," Mr. Band, the longtime aide to Mr. Clinton, wrote about Chelsea Clinton in 2011. At the time, she was beginning to exert influence at the foundation, expressing concerns that Mr. Band and others were trying to use the charity to make money for themselves, and accusing another aide in her fatherâ€™s personal office of installing spyware. Emails released on Tuesday contained a memo from Mr. Band essentially defending his work for the foundation, and for Mr. Clinton personally, even as Mr. Band was building up his corporate consulting firm, Teneo.
