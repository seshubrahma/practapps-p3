Millennials are the fasting growing section of the electorate. In Florida, they represent 20% of the electorate and currently outnumber the   age group. Trumpâ€™s marginal victory of 1. 3% in Florida equated to approximately 120, 000 votes. If the millennial voting patterns of 2012 had remained the same, Clinton would have taken Florida, and its crucial 29 electors by around 250, 000 votes.
