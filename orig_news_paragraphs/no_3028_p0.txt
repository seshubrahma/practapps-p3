The former black lives matter spokesman, deposed after the discovery that he is white and not the African American he claimed to be, accused the NFL of being "bigoted" against black people because it hasnâ€™t hired   protester Colin Kaepernick. [King made his proclamation after it became clear that American anthem protester and former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick would not find a team to take him on after he became a free agent at the tail of last season.
