[  Trump’s L. A. headquarters is located at 2338 E. Anaheim Street, #  in Long Beach  —   an area colloquially referred to as "Cambodia Town," and a Democratic stronghold for the last few years. Trump opened his California headquarters in Sacramento this past April. The launch started off with prayers asking "God to bless America and to bless Donald Trump and keep him safe," followed by a traditional Cambodian dance of greetings and good wishes, Robam   (known as the "blessing dance").
