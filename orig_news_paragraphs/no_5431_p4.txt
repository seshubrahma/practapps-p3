The ratings news comes as Fox News    Rupert Murdoch held a   meeting at the network’s New York City headquarters last month to unveil a new   studio, Studio F, which will replace the network’s longtime basement operations center. Murdoch also reportedly discussed the overall direction and future of the company, with the meeting being conducted in two shifts so as to include all employees. The ratings developments also come less than a week after the death of former CEO Roger Ailes.
