Working families finally got a raise. Early on Tuesday, the Census Bureau provided some   good news for the beleaguered working class: The income of the typical American household perched on the middle rung of the income ladder increased a hearty 5. 2 percent in 2015, the first real increase since 2007, the year before the economy sank into recession. Households all the way down the income scale made more money last year.
