Basically, Diane is doing the same job in a different location, and so is "The Good Fight," which will stream online on the CBS All Access subscription service. The first two episodes go online Sunday night, with additional episodes every Sunday. The pilot will show on regular CBS Sunday (edited for time and broadcast standards) after which CBS will have to pray that its traditional TV audience can find the internet. I can sum up how the move from network to streaming changes the show in one word.
