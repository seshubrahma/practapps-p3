Martin Gilens, of Princeton University and Benjamin I. Page, of Northwestern have found that in DC   the views of ordinary citizens don’t really matter. They studied 1, 779 issues over a   period and found that the preferences of the rich were vital to political outcomes —  and that the preferences of the middle class were mostly irrelevant. As Gilens and Page put it, In the United States, our findings indicate, the majority does not rule. Majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts.
