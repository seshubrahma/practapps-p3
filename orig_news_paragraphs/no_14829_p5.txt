Trump has also issued an olive branch of sorts to   reformers, saying in his joint address to Congress "real and positive immigration reform is possible," provided the goal is to help American jobs and wages, protect national security and engender respect for US laws. Earlier that day, a senior administration official had said Trump may be open to legalization for current undocumented immigrants, but Trump did not say that before Congress.   Either way, Trump will be an essential component of any progress.   If Trump were to throw his weight behind a compromise deal, it would likely pick up momentum.
