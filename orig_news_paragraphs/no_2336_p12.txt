His instinct in debates is often to attack and insult opponents, which had an upside during the circuslike primary debates but could be grating during a      debate. Mr. Trump has a tendency to belittle Mrs. Clinton to the point of rudeness when he is speaking off the cuff, such as by making fun of her for recuperating from her recent pneumonia. His advisers want him to project optimism about America and his policies while also showing some heat and energy in the right moments to challenge Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump can get bored with both debate preparations and debates themselves.
