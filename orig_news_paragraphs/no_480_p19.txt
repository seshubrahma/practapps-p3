Employees in Oregon, the District of Columbia and Maryland are scheduled to get an increase later this year. The disappointing overall wage growth can be traced in part to the financial industry, which had a 0. 1 percent drop in pay. Analysts, backed by research from the Federal Reserve, have been recalibrating their assessments of what constitutes a strong number of hires, given how far the official unemployment rate has fallen. Economists estimate that it takes 50, 000 to  110, 000 new jobs to absorb growth in the population and keep the jobless rate steady.
