Other countries will want to avoid similar situations in which they could look like they are caving in to Mr. Trump. (By the way, for those who say, "Who cares about what happens to big businesses that outsource anyway?" think about all the money in all those 401( k) plans that is invested in them.) The Trump economic report cites the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing big business, and its complaints about regulatory burdens. The suggestion is that big business will back Mr. Trump, since he plans to reduce regulation.
