From the Washington Post:[Why doesn’t Hillary Clinton have a   lead over Donald Trump? The fact that she doesn’t is making a lot of Democrats wonder whether hers is a flawed candidacy. Even though Trump is certainly doing his part to alienate voters and supply more material for effective negative ads that use his own words against him, Clinton’s campaign is stagnant. According to today’s RealClearPolitics polling average, her lead over Trump is less than 3 percentage points.
