Among them are Steven Roth, a real estate mogul who owns a building with Mr. Trump Harold Hamm, the billionaire wildcatter John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Feinberg, the   of Cerberus, the private equity firm and Dan DiMicco, former president and chief executive of the steel company Nucor Corporation, who has been vocal about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Wilbur Ross, the famed venture capitalist, was left off the original list but later added on Trump’s website Mr. Ross said that his team hadn’t gotten back to the candidate in time to be included last week. And for those keeping score, Carl Icahn, the activist investor and longtime Trump backer, said he was left off the list so he could start a "super PAC," which he said would not be allowed if he were a formal member of the campaign. Then again, Mr. Trump has made a virtue of his lack of traditional support, depicting himself as an   candidate willing to make difficult choices.
