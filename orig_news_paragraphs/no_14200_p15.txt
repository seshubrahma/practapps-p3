ISIS found a stronghold in the coastal city of Sirte    Gadhafi’s hometown    where Al Qaeda had failed to do so several years earlier. The group was finally swept out of the city in December, but the US continues to strike ISIS targets in the country.   Earlier this month, US   bombers struck and destroyed two ISIS camps in Libya, with initial estimates that over 80 militants were killed, US officials told CNN.   Helping Libya’s recovering oil sector was also a likely factor in the US decision to target the training camps, according to Geoff Porter, president of North Africa Risk Consulting.
