They probably know more about Hillary’s email than the FBI because Hillary’s lawyers erased all those 30, 000 emails that were not turned over to the State Department," Bolton noted, adding: I think he was dinging the Democrats for being more concerned about the just terrible emails we saw out of the DNC than the security risk that Hillary created by her own actions.
