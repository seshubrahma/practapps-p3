A filibuster this week from Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, forced a vote on a series of amendments that will take place as early as Monday. A bill favored by Democrats would prevent people on the FBIâ€™s terror watch list from purchasing guns    a similar bill stalled last year in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting that left nine people dead.   A Republican measure would give federal prosecutors three days to try and prevent someone on the list from purchasing a firearm. According to a December Gallup poll, 71% of Americans think banning gun sales to people on the "no fly" list would be effective way to combat terrorism.
