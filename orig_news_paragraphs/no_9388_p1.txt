The American businessman surpassed 2012 nominee Mitt Romney’s and 2008 nominee John McCain’s primary election vote totals by late in April according to Politico calculations. Previous record holder George W. Bush received just 10. 8 million votes in 2000, a number far surpassed by Trump’s over 13 million votes with the five June 7 primaries. Trump’s total is 13, 266, 277 according to the RealClearPolitics vote count as of Wednesday morning. That count didn’t appear to include the most recent totals for California which they listed at 1, 146, 548.
