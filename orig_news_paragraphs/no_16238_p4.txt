Warren, a favorite among progressives, was considered a possible but unlikely choice for the VP slot. So far, she has notably abstained from weighing in on Kaine, despite several other Clinton VP contenders    including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack    praising her choice.   A message left with Warrenâ€™s office was not immediately returned Saturday. Warren and Trump have regularly engaged in social media skirmishes for months.
