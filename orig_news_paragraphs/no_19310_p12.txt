That propaganda has resonated somewhat, but it is hard to   demonstrate that anything the Russians are doing is more damaging   than the Trump campaign itself. ’ ’    But just like the Crimean annexation (which led to sanctions and   massive costs to the state treasury) the Donbass adventure   (which led to more sanctions and has mired Russia in an   expensive, undeclared war) and the Syrian intervention (where   Putin backed away from an early withdrawal, leaving him stuck in   yet another   war) today’s Russian achievement is   poised to become tomorrow’s debilitating disaster.

S. retaliation and, more   importantly, what this will mean for future     relations.
