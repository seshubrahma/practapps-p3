Those states make up a significant share of the votes cast so far, with about 190, 000 total returned ballots or early votes coming from those nine. Iowa, which has tilted Trump in most polling so far, leads the way, with more than 77, 000 votes cast, Wisconsin, more of a Clinton stronghold based on polling there, follows with 76, 559. Both states are among those where election experts expect a significant share of the vote to be completed before Election Day.   RELATED:
