Iran has deployed tens of thousands of Shiite troops to fight on behalf of Assad in Syria, including members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) terrorists from Hezbollah, as well as fighters from neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan. " Syrian rebels say the United States and its allies are sending them more arms to try to fend off a new push into the southeast by   militias aiming to open an overland supply route between Iraq and Syria," reports Reuters. In Iraq,   PMU fighters are advancing towards the Syrian border, capturing territory along the way.
