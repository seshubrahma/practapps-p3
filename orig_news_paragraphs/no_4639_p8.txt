The Sunni government of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein enraged a generation of Shiites by abusing the Imam Ali mosque. Ali did not win the title of "caliph" in an election, either. Abu Bakr only reigned for a few years before he died. Ali got the job after Abu Bakrâ€™s second successor, Caliph Uthman, was killed by his own troops in the Muslim holy city of Medina.
