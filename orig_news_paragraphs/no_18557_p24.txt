’ ’    Republican Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence   Committee, concluded the hearing by asking Sessions if he could   "go back and work with the White House" to see if he can provide   answers to any questions to the committee in writing "if there   are any areas of questions that they feel comfortable with you   answering," which is far from signaling the potential for a   subpoena. ’ ’    As Alan Dershowitz, the renowned attorney and professor emeritus   at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider in an email,   Congress "can compel" Sessions to answer the questions and   override any Justice Department policy, so long as privilege has   not been invoked.
