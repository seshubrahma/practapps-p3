Throughout the campaign, Michael G. Flynn served as a gatekeeper for his father, and he now appears to have a job with the Trump transition team. Email sent to an address at the Flynn Intel Group returned with an automated response that provided a new email contact for both Flynns, and each had a Trump transition email address that ended with . gov. The main difference in the son’s Twitter feed is that he appears to have shown even less restraint than his father when it comes to spreading conspiracy theories about Mrs. Clinton and her campaign. He used Twitter to spread others’ suggestions that Mrs. Clinton and President Obama were "at the center" of the conflict in Syria and profiting from it and that both would be tried for treason if Mr. Trump was elected.
