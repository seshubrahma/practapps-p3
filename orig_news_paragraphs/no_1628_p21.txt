Mr. Trump likes to boast about going it alone   —   an impulse that helps explain the rapid turnover among advisers in his campaign, and that has raised serious concerns among national security experts and foreign policy observers, who note that his extreme   and certainty ("I’m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain") come coupled with a startling ignorance about global affairs and an impatience with policy and details. Passages in his books help illuminate Mr. Trump’s admiration for the strongman style of autocratic leaders like Russia’s Vladimir V. Putin, and his own astonishing "I alone can fix it" moment during his Republican convention speech.
