On this weekend’s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," Washington Post columnist George Will explained why he left the Republican Party over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.   Will said, "I left it for the same reason I joined it in 1964 when I voted for Barry Goldwater, because I was a conservative. I leave for the same reason, I’m a conservative. To give you a time line, shortly after Trump became the presumptive nominee he had a summit meeting with Paul Ryan where they stressed their vast shared ground, which is more important than their differences.
