Washington (CNN) A pastor poised to interview Donald Trump Saturday says he "never tried to be deceitful" about submitting questions in advance to the Republican nomineeâ€™s campaign. The New York Times published a report Thursday revealing "an   draft script" with twelve questions the campaign had worked out for an interview with Bishop Wayne Jackson, the pastor of Great Faith Ministries Congregation in Detroit. Trump is set to visit the   church Saturday as part of his effort to make inroads with minority voters.
