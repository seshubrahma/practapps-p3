For instance, Politifact, the Associated Press, CNN, FactCheck. org, and The Washington Post have all tried to argue that it’s not true that Clinton supports open borders. In doing so, these "fact checkers" have demonstrated that they either don’t know what "open borders" means, or they are deliberately parroting talking points provided by the Clinton campaign to cover up Clinton’s record on the issue. Interestingly, these   "fact checks" rarely mention how many migrants would be imported into the country under a Hillary Clinton Presidency. While Bill Clinton has described our current immigration policy as one of "open borders," his wife has championed policies that would open our borders even further.
