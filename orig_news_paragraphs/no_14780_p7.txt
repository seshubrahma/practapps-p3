Resignations from two prosecutors, acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente and his permanent replacement, Rod Rosenstein, were declined by Trump, according to a DOJ spokesman. Ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein said she was "surprised" and "concerned" by the news of the firings, saying the actions contradict what she was told by the Vice President and other administration officials. " In January, I met with Vice President Pence and White House Counsel Donald McGahn and asked specifically whether all U. S. attorneys would be fired at once," the California senator said in a statement.
