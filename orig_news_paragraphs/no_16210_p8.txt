" The weekend debut of the Democratic ticket is designed to build anticipation for the partyâ€™s convention starting Monday in Philadelphia. After they are formally nominated, Clinton and her new running mate are expected to embark on a bus tour to key campaign battlegrounds, similar to the "First 1, 000 Miles" caravan in 1992 that took the Clintons and Gores to eight states on their way to winning the White House in November. For her part, Clinton has intentionally not informed anyone who has gone through the vetting process of her final decision, Democrats close to the process said, in hopes of keeping her choice a secret until the last possible moment.
