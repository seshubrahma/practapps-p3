U. S. coverage of the election lacked the urgency of the European reporting, for the most part. The New York Times pushed the establishment view in its editorial, claiming that Macron’s election "was a victory of hope and optimism over fear and reaction of a future in Europe rather than in resentful isolation". But the newspaper also conceded that "the outcome was a watershed for [Marine Le Pen’s] party, giving it new legitimacy". Marine Le Pen didn’t win France’s election.
