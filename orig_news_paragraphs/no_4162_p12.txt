In January, Dean of Students Amy Badal attended a candlelight vigil held at Bucknell in response to President Trump’s executive order on immigration. Can students feel comfortable expressing their support of such legislation on campus if administrators like Badal are willing to take such a strong and public stance? Instead of defending my peers and I against Andrews’ threat and accusations of racism, Badal and the administration claimed that I had "mischaracterized" the email (which you can read in its entirety here). The administration argued that the university "values and encourages the free exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives," despite the texts assigned throughout my economics curriculum consisting almost exclusively of leftist and   market perspectives.
