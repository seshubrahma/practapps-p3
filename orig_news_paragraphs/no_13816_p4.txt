Top US intelligence officials have been scheduled to brief Trump on the full report on Russian hacking President Barack Obama ordered once it was completed, but the meeting was not set to take place until later in the week, according to US officials. The meeting was never scheduled for Tuesday, as even Obama has yet to receive the   briefing on the Russian hacking, one US official said. And a US intelligence official told CNN that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was never scheduled to be in New York City, where Trump is, on Tuesday    and was perplexed about the "delay" Trump claimed was taking place. Trump on Tuesday did receive a classified intelligence briefing    the Presidential Daily Briefing    which Trump has elected to receive only sporadically.
