If improperly calibrated, the screen could be off   to   an inch, and other factors    including whether voters have long fingernails, were wearing jewelry, had long sleeves or were leaning on the machine    could be responsible as well. The Bryan County Board of Elections said in a statement that all machines were successfully tested ahead of this cycle’s elections, and it was not immediately known why the machine in question wasn’t initially working. King said the machine in question has been in use in the state since 2002. He added that this particular machine had been used by about 20 other voters on Tuesday, but because of confidentiality rules, it’s impossible to say whether other ballots were miscast, though he said no other voters reported problems.
