News of Singleton’s dismissal was first reported by The New York Times. Singleton expressed concerns in his     about Trump’s approach to addressing issues of high concern to many black American voters.   "Hearing the nominee of my party ignore these harsh truths and opt for words like ’law and order’ sounds like a coded message from an era in our history that should stay in the past," Singleton wrote.   Trump has been repeatedly criticized for his rhetoric when discussing the black American urban experience and for mainly discussing inner cities when talking about black people.
