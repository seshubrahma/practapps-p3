That’s the focus of my campaign is jobs and economic growth and raising wages and protecting America and keeping us safe from radical Islamic terrorism. I have no interest in going down in the mud with Donald Trump. I’m going to stay focused with the voters and where Americans are focused, which is how we turn our country around and how we bring back jobs.
