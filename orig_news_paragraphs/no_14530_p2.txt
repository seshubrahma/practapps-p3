I’m going to be working for you, I’m not going to have time to go play golf," Trump said at the time. Trump has visited his two golf courses near his    estate    Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Course in Jupiter    six times in his first month in office. Aides would not confirm that Trump played golf each time, but through a series of social media posts and interviews with the professional golfers who joined him, it is clear the President golfed during most of these visits. By comparison, Obama played his first round of golf as President on April 26, 2009, at Andrews Air Force Base.
