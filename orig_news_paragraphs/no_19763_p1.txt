Senators Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said the change was made to accommodate the Senate leadership. In addition to highlighting the ethics issue, Democrats had complained that Republicans had jammed several confirmation hearings into a single day to dilute public attention and make it easier for Trump nominees to survive a rocky hearing. Alexander, the HELP committee chairman, said in a statement that the panel still plans to vote on DeVos’ confirmation on January 24, which would set her up for a final vote on the Senate floor in the first weeks of Trump’s presidency. Republicans have prioritized confirming the  ’s   team by the time he is inaugurated on January 20.
