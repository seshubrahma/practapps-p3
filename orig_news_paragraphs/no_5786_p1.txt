TFN will reportedly take on the guise of a legitimate news station, not unlike CNN or Fox News, but will deliver ludicrous stories in a deadpan comedic style. As well as presenting TFN as Ted Nelms, Helms will executive produce along with Mike Falbo through their Pacific Electric Picture Company. Helms was briefly reuinted with his Daily Show   Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, and Rob Corddry earlier this month in a   segment on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. A release date for Helmsâ€™ comedy special has not yet been announced.
