Under a 2013 document called the Presidential Policy Guidance, issued under President Barack Obama but still in effect, only people judged to pose a "continuing, imminent threat to U. S. persons" can be targeted outside a conventional war zone. In addition, the rules say that targeted killing should take place only if capture is "infeasible," which usually means the target is in a lawless area where arrest would be impossible or hazardous. Mr. Zaidanâ€™s inclusion in the   TIDE database would get him additional attention if he tried to fly to the United States. But by itself, it would not come close to meeting the standard necessary to put him on a kill list, according to government officials and outside experts, who requested anonymity to discuss a secret operation.
