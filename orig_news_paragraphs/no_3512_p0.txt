Actress Meryl Streep became the toast of the Golden Globes Sunday night after using her Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech to bash   Donald Trump and defend Hollywood, which she said has become one of the most "vilified" segments of American society. ["Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners," Streep said, listing several actors who were born in Canada and other places outside the United States. " And if we kick them all out, youâ€™ll have nothing to watch but football and Mixed Martial Arts, which are not the arts. "
