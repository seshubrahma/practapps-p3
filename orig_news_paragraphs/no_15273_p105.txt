If you are judging his presidency by his literal use of words    something he does casually and without the same meaning as journalists or traditional politicians    he has fallen behind on his pledge on a number of things reforming Obamacare, the travel restrictions from countries with known terrorist activities and building a wall between the US and Mexico. But if you voted for him you view his actions differently. Voters have told me in hundreds of interviews across the country that they understand that negotiations take time on Capitol Hill (health care, the wall, the budget) that activist judges have always been a thorn in every president â€™s side (travel restriction executive order and sanctuary cities).
