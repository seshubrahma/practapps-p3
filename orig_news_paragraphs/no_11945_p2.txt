The spokesman would not say why exactly the student would not cooperate with campus police and why she did not want to pursue the investigation. Similar stories brought to police by college students have ended with the student being charged for hoaxing hate crime complaints. In one incident, a Muslim student at the University of Lafayette in Louisiana filed a police report in which she said she was attacked by white male Trump supporters and had her hijab ripped from her head. The student fabricated the story and was subsequently charged for filing a fake police report, as Breitbart Texas reported.
