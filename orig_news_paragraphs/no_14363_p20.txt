Finally, I would tell President Trump that Iâ€™ve read that his grandfather came to America from Germany. And I would ask him how he would have felt as a young man to be sent to Germany with no money and told to learn a new language and start a new way of life because America had no room for him. President Trump has accomplished great things in America. We Dreamers can as well.
