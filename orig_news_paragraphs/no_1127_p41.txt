It is this last contention that seems to be the crux of the S. P. L.

But Nawaz justifies the move by arguing that the distinction between violent and nonviolent Islamism is far less rigid than many liberals would like to think. " Now when these guys are joining ISIS, the arguments have been made," he told me.
