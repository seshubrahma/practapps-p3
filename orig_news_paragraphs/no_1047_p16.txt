The March 15 cable suggests areas of inquiry during a required interview, including: the applicant’s travel history, addresses and work history for 15 years and all phone numbers, email addresses and social media handles used by the applicant in the past five years. Another cable, sent two days later, indicated that consular officers should not begin asking for the   travel and work histories until the State Department received authorization for those questions from the Office of Management and Budget. It is unclear why that permission had not been granted. The State Department also urged its embassy officials to delay or reschedule interviews if an applicant was unable to provide all of the information demanded.
