As president, Mr. Sanders would have the ability to appoint the committee chair, though it is not likely he will get that chance, as Mrs. Clinton is close to clinching the nomination. Nevertheless, he can try to draw a little blood from Ms. Wasserman Schultz with his endorsement of her primary opponent, Mr. Canova, the underdog in the race. Mr. Canova, a Nova Southeastern University law professor, has echoed Mr. Sanders’s messages about the need to combat economic inequalities and reform campaign finance. He has also mirrored, on a small scale, Mr. Sanders’s   model by raising more than $1 million through small donations that have averaged about $19 each.
