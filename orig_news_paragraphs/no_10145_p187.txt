1:52: A glum Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton’s press secretary, says they always knew that Michigan would be close. But he says "this is a delegate contest" and Clinton moved closer to securing the nomination yesterday with her landslide win in Mississippi. When CNN’s Blitzer questions Fallon’s about Clinton’s stance on trade, Fallon claims that Sanders has mischaracterized Clinton’s record even though Clinton has tried to have it both ways on trade. Fallon says Sanders will try to parlay Michigan’s success into other wins but even in the rosiest scenario, Clinton will still come out on top in the delegate count yet again next week.
