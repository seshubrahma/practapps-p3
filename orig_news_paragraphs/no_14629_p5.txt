Multiple officials have also made clear over the last 48 hours that the EPA and foreign aid will be cut significantly under the new plan. The budget, one OMB official said, expects "the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding" over the years. Foreign aid makes up roughly 1% of the federal budget and includes a host of programs meant to help implement national security policy. While foreign aid has long been a target for conservatives, cuts to these programs are unlikely to get the Trump administration close to the $54 billion in proposed overall cuts.
