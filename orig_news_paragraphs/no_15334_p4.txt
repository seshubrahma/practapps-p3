On February 14, the day after Flynn’s firing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that Yates had simply "wanted to give a ’heads up’ to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he (Flynn) had sent the Vice President."   Yates is highly motivated to set the record straight about her warning regarding Flynn, one source said. But because of the classified nature of the information, she is unlikely to explain in detail what specific information prompted her to raise concerns with the White House about his alleged ties to the Russians. She is, though, expected to give her version of events when she informed the White House about her concerns that Flynn may have been "compromised" by the Russians, contradicting Spicer’s comment that Yates was simply giving officials a "heads up" about the   security advisor, the source said.
