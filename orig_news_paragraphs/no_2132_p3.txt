On Saturday, Mr. Trump said he would shut down the organization, a move that the New York attorney general’s office said would require state approval. Last month, in its 2015 tax filing, the foundation itself indicated that it may have violated rules meant to protect against   such as using charity resources to benefit one of the organization’s central people. The filing came after The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump had used $258, 000 from the charity to settle legal disputes involving his businesses. There were other unusual donations from the foundation, including $12, 000 for an autographed helmet from the football player Tim Tebow and $20, 000 to an artist for painting a portrait of Mr. Trump.
