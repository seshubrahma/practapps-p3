President Bill Clinton invited guests for prayer events at the White House on the National Day of Prayer. While President Barack Obama did sign National Day of Prayer proclamations in the standing presidential tradition, he chose "not to personally participate nor host events for the National Day of Prayer at the White House," according to the NDOP Task Force.
