True The Vote agrees with Trump that millions of illegals voted in this past election, having a negative impact on the election. The   group said in a statement, True the Vote absolutely supports   Trumpâ€™s recent comment about the impact of illegal voting, as reflected in the national popular vote. We are still collecting data and will be for several months, but our intent is to publish a comprehensive study on the significant impact of illegal voting in all of its many forms and begin a national discussion on how voters, states, and the Trump Administration can best address this growing problem. Meanwhile, during the campaign for president, Hillary Clinton slammed Trump for saying that he might not accept the outcome of the election if he lost.
