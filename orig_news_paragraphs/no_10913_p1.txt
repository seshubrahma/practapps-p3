Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an early supporter    Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, cautioned about the prospect of former Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and vocal opponent of Trump during the 2016 GOP primary, being nominated secretary of state.   Gingrich said it was important to make sure Romney would be acting to advance Trump’s foreign policy and not his own ideas.
