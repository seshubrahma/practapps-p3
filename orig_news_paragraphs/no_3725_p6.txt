A coalition between House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows ( ) and Tuesday Group   Tom MacArthur ( ) worked to strike a deal to allow states to repeal Obamacare regulations known as essential health benefits and community ratings. The essential health benefits rule prevents health insurers from pricing health care plans based on age, gender, or health status, while the essential health benefits provision requires that health plans cover services such as mental health, pregnancy, and hospital visits. However, states can only receive these waivers if they opt into the bill â€™s $100 billion   pool fund to subsidize coverage for older and less healthy patients.
