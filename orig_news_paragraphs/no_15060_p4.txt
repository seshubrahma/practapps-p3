To dump O’Reilly, Fox News would likely have to undergo a conversion that would make St. Paul go green. Fox has, for its entire existence, metaphorically pounded its hairy chest and boasted of its unapologetically macho culture. In large part that reflected the leadership of the network’s creator, Roger Ailes, who was deposed last year after he, too, was hit with sexual harassment allegations. But it also reflected    and still does    a substantial portion of the most loyal audience for Fox News that is, conservative white men over the age of 65.
