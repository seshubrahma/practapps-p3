Live interview pollsters can do that, since the respondent is free to say "other" or "I don’t know," and the interviewer can record it as such. In the   poll, 9 percent volunteered "other" or "neither," and 2 percent weren’t sure. But this is a lot more challenging for an online pollster. If you put "don’t know" or "other" as an option, a lot of people are going to take it.
