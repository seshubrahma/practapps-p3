I would sit in leadership meetings, in that room, amid baseball bats signed by her beloved San Francisco Giants and bowls filled with her favorite chocolates (I always appreciated the symbolism of sweets and baseball bats) while elsewhere, House Speaker Paul Ryan or   John Boehner were struggling  to round up Republican votes to pass legislation vital to the administration of our government.   Whenever they fell short on their side of the aisle, her phone would ring. They called to avoid government shutdowns to raise the debt ceiling to provide Hurricane Sandy relief to preserve the   Bank. Even when she was house speaker in 2008, President Bush implored her to secure Democratic votes to pass his Troubled Assets Relief Program and avoid financial collapse.
