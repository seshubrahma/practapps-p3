The Huffington Post, installing new leadership after the recent departure of its   Arianna Huffington, reached into the senior ranks of The New York Times on Tuesday and hired Lydia Polgreen as its top editor. Ms. Polgreen, who joined The Times in 2002, has been serving as an associate masthead editor overseeing The Timesâ€™s ambitious global expansion project. " To me this felt like an unmissable opportunity to take a massive journalistic platform that was at an inflection point and think about what the possibilities are of what it could be," Ms. Polgreen said in an interview.
