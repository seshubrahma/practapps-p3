A source familiar with the Republican National Committeeâ€™s     effort in Florida told Breitbart News the party is working    with the Trump campaign. The source said the party rebuilt its GOTV organization in 2013 based on lessons learned from 2012 and has devoted resources to a "permanent ground game" in key battleground states, such at Florida. " Republicans in Florida have requested more than 335, 000 absentee ballots than they did in 2012," the source said.
