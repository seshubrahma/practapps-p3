Johnson represents a set of policies that do not line up perfectly with Republicans or Libertarians. He embraces fiscal conservatism, but not to the lengths that some hardline   libertarians would like. He considers himself a liberal on social issues, supporting   marriage and abortion rights. And he supports a   foreign policy that focuses on Americaâ€™s challenges at home.
