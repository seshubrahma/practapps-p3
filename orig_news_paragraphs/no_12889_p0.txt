Wednesday on his syndicated radio show, conservative talker Sean Hannity criticized several   Republicans for how they have treated their party’s nominee Donald Trump.   According to Hannity, if Trump loses in November, House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) will be to blame for the loss because they have spent more time criticizing Trump than President Barack Obama. " If in 96 days Trump loses this election, I am pointing the finger directly at people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and John McCain and John Kasich and Ted Cruz if he won’t endorse  —   and Jeb Bush and everybody else that made promises they’re not keeping," Hannity said.
