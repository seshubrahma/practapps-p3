The same moment is captured in a brief   video by Kristinn Taylor of Gateway Pundit. In that video, as well as in the WPTV video, as Trump moves, Lewandowski is clearly visible on Trump’s   side.   Fields can be seen again at 16:08, at Trump’s right, apparently at about the same moment when the ABC News photograph was taken.   The altercation itself is not shown, but Fields quickly disappears from view, as if pulled back.
