I’m currently in Girdwood, Alaska. You may wonder what has caused the gay European population of Alaska to climb, well, 100% and the answer is that I am in the United States because I no longer recognise the Europe I grew up in.

It is important that Americans understand these problems because Europe’s problems today will be America’s tomorrow if y’all don’t act to prevent them.
