Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles project began under Bannon’s leadership and the issue is dear to his heart. The project allows clandestine citizen journalists in several Mexican states that are under direct control from Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel to have a platform to expose the evils of the transnational criminal groups and has a stated goal of warring with the criminals and exposing them for the purpose of ending them. In addition to providing a voice to the courageous citizen journalists in Mexico, the project singles out cartel commanders one by one and focuses media attention on them until the Mexican authorities are forced to act and go after the criminal boss, thus picking them off one at a time. Bannon   and presided over the project until he went to the Trump campaign and someone with his knowledge on the cartels leading the campaign makes it inevitable that Trump wouldn’t also have the Mexican cartels on his mind each day —  along with the grief of the loved ones of the cartels’ countless victims.
