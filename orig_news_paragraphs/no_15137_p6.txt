In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February, Gen. John "Mick" Nicholson said that the present troop level of 8, 400 US soldiers was insufficient and noted, "We have a shortfall of a few thousand" advisers to train and assist the Afghan army. The Obama administration had a counterproductive policy of announcing scheduled withdrawals from Afghanistan even as it surged troops into the country. Take, for instance, a speech at West Point on December 1, 2009, where President Obama announced a surge of troops into Afghanistan and also announced their withdrawal date. That withdrawal date, of course, came and went    as did a number of others.
