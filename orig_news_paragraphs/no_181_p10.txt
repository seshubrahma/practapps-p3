Ms. DeVos began to demur, saying that "not all schools are working for the students that are assigned to them" and that she would work to find "common ground" to give parents "options. " "I take that as not being willing to commit to not privatizing public education," Ms. Murray said. Mr. Alexander, himself a former education secretary, argued that Ms. DeVosâ€™s support of charter schools and vouchers put her in the "mainstream" of public opinion, and that her critics were outside it.
