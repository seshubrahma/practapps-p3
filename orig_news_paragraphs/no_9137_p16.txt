As Breitbart News has reported previously, numerous medical reports confirm that high rates of LTBI among resettled refugees pose an active TB risk for the entire population of communities with resettled refugees. This is due to several reasons, including lower immunity suppression rates among refugees and, significantly, high failure rates among refugees in latent TB treatment programs. The Iraqi refugee who was diagnosed with active TB in March 2016 in Oakland County is an example of this phenomenon. This refugee was diagnosed with LTBI in the overseas medical examination conducted prior to arrival in the United States in June 2015.
