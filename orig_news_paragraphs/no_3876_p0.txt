The Department of Justice filed a petition for a writ of certiorari just before midnight on Thursday, asking the Supreme Court of the United States to take up the hotly contested travel ban executive order blocked in the lower courts. [Should the Supreme Court accept the petition for Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Program, the nine justices, including the recently seated Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, will consider overturning the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit’s injunction blocking enforcement of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning most travel from six   countries. The case will be heard if four of the nine justices agree to take it up.   The   temporary travel ban has now been through a revision and been the subject of several hearings at both the trial and appellate level.
