One of the nation’s largest grocery chains has announced it is adding up to 10, 000 new employees as it plans expansion in the new era of Trump. ["Kroger’s growth trajectory continues to create opportunities for our people to advance their careers   —   and to do that in a fun, team environment with great benefits," Kroger group vice president of human resources and labor relations Tim Massa said in a press release.   The grocery giant also reported adding over 12, 000 jobs in 2016, a number that doesn’t include temporary jobs such as the construction jobs needed to build its new outlets.
