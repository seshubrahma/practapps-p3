Mr. Pinchuk has been a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, a relationship that drew scrutiny during the presidential campaign as an example of Hillary Clinton’s complex ties to foreign business interests. Douglas E. Schoen, a senior adviser to the board of Mr. Pinchuk’s foundation, said in an email that the payment to Mr. Trump’s charity was "in support of appearance he did by video link at a conference Mr. Pinchuk’s foundation organizes every year in September in Kiev, Ukraine. " Mr. Schoen said that Mr. Pinchuk and Mr. Trump had met many years ago in New York, prompting the invitation for Mr. Trump to speak at the September 2015 conference.
