OXON HILL, Md.  —    In an administration hardly five weeks old, Stephen K. Bannon’s reputation has taken on almost mythic proportion as a   populist, emerging power center, man of mystery. When Mr. Bannon, President Trump’s chief strategist, appeared in public on Thursday for the first time since the president was sworn in, it was to deliver, in his own combative way, a message of soothing reassurance to the conservative activists gathered here for their annual assessment known as the Conservative Political Action Conference. Do not believe the "corporatist globalist media" that was "crying and weeping" on election night and is still "dead wrong" about what the Trump administration is doing.
