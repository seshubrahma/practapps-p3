In "Baseball Life Advice " (McClelland  Stewart, paperback, $18) the Canadian novelist Stacey May Fowles, an avid Toronto Blue Jays fan, raises topics not often discussed, starting with an affecting account of how, during periods of intense depression, the game kept her going when nothing else would. And her analysis of everything from Jose Bautista’s epic bat flip (she favors it) to Jose Reyes ’s public rehabilitation after his suspension for domestic abuse (she’s opposed, mostly) brings a perspective that’s all too rare.
