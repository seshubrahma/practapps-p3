Washington (CNN) The US cut funding for a UN program for women and girls, a move that critics said was based on faulty information, could lead to greater instability in the Middle East and hurt women around the world.   The United States, as promised, has drastically cut funding to the United Nationsâ€™ most significant population agency, which helps women in 155 countries around the world. The Trump administration announced the move late Monday, sending notice that it would pull $32. 5 million from the United Nations Population Fund because it works with the Chinese government, which forces its citizens into coercive abortions and involuntary sterilization.
