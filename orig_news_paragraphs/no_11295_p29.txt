the American people have a right to question anyone’s economic plan. And so to win back public confidence, more must be done to convince folks that the benefits will actually flow to them, as opposed to some other country.   As I wrote earlier this month, Yes,   reductions, on individuals and businesses, are a help to investment, but what if the money gets invested, not in the U. S. but in Mexico —  or China?   Until that question can be answered in a satisfactory way, many, perhaps most, Americans will be skeptical of, even hostile to,   tax cuts.
