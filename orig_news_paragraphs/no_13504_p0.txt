Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Gov. John Kasich all suggested Friday night that Donald Trump was partly responsible for the   mob shutdown of his own rally in Chicago. ["I wouldn’t say Mr. Trump is responsible for the events of tonight, but he most certainly, in other events   …     bears some responsibility for the general tone of the things that have [been] happening before," said Rubio, as he tried to blame Trump for prior protests   —   and clashes   —   at his rallies.
