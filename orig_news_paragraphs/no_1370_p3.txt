Republican rivals criticized Mr. Trump similarly on his comments about women and on his business record during the party’s nominating contest, but the effort came too late to stop his momentum. One of the super PAC’s ads, called "Speak," shows voters   some of Mr. Trump’s caustic remarks about women as they wear shirts with Mr. Trump’s visage   on them. The other, "Respect," shows quick interviews with the candidate in which he outlines his positions on abortion and Planned Parenthood. The super PAC had initially invested $130 million to reserve time for broadcast and digital ads that would start running the day after the California and New Jersey primaries in June.
