When it comes to sticking a stiletto into a fellow Republican, suddenly Romney is Mitt the Machiavellian! Unfortunately, when it came to beating beatable incumbent Barack Obama in 2012, Romney couldn’t even deal with Candy Crowley couldn’t prosecute Benghazi couldn’t competently handle the questions around his own taxes could neither shun nor embrace his wealth couldn’t comprehend that in 2012 maybe you should assume everything is recorded before writing off 47% of voters couldn’t do one damn thing effectively to win even a single news cycle against a failed incumbent.
