We have listened to Mr. Trump encourage his supporters to ‘knock the hell’ out of protestors offering to pay their legal fees and suggest that he’d like to ‘punch (a protestor) in the face. ’ We have listened to him disparage his fellow republican candidates, denigrate the democratic candidates, belittle the press and deprecate all who disagree with him. On this day we will come together, and say no to his thirst for hatred, and violence.
