But let     me be clear : the appointment of special counsel does not     relieve Congress of its responsibility to conduct oversight of     the Trump Administration. I am disappointed that Congress     has taken precious few meaningful actions to investigate     President Trump’s decision to fire Director Comey, the     President’s admission that he did so because he did not like     the Russia investigation, and reports that Trump tried to waive     Director Comey off of the investigation altogether.   I     continue to stand with my colleagues on the House Judiciary and     Oversight committees in urging our chairmen to look into these     matters without delay"   ’ ’
