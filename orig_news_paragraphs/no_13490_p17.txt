Ted Cruz has done that his entire career.   Rubio has never led anything and now he’s adding dishonesty to his lack of leadership. What’s perhaps even more astonishing about this is that Rubio’s decision to abandon America’s national security infrastructure to hob nob with high dollar donors and jet set around the United States on the campaign trail hasn’t really produced much success at all for his lagging presidential campaign. Rubio came in a distant third place in Iowa’s caucuses, an embarrassing fifth place in New Hampshire’s primaries, and is expected to come in third place or lower in this Saturday’s South Carolina primaries here.
