A call to Vellanti also went unanswered. A CNN reporter saw Vellanti accosting a group of eight protesters who began shouting in the middle of Trump’s rally and exchanged words with one man before grabbing him by the neck while brandishing his closed fist. Vellanti then appeared to swing at the protester, but it’s unclear if the protester dodged the punch. Police officers, who were stationed throughout the arena of Trump’s rally, were not involved in the incident and Vellanti remained at the rally.
