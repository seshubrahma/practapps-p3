Some environmental policies  —   like "guidance" issued by the White House earlier this year, instructing agencies to consider the effects of climate change when conducting environmental reviews   —   do not have the force of law that agency regulations do, and can be abolished with a pen stroke. Undoing a regulation is more complicated. Some of the E. P. A. ’s new methane rules are completed, for example, but other rules, both at the E. P. A. and at the Interior Department, are not and can simply be abandoned.
