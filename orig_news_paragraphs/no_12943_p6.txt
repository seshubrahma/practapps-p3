Obama’s imposition of the new "gender identity" policy is likely to be hated by many parents, partly because it tries to exclude them from their children’s sexual development. In general, progressives argue that men and women, young boys and girls, should be free to adopt, create, and discard multiple varieties of temporary "gender identities" as they please, with or without the support of their parents and communities. That   society, they insist, would be better than the civic rules which Americans have gradually developed to maximize benefits from the two distinct sexes’ different average capabilities and preferences. Already, in multiple districts, parents are suing and protesting education boards to exclude the "gender identity" regime from their kids’ school lives.
