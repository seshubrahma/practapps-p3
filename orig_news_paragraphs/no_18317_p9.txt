To "get out and talk to more people   about how they’’re living, working and thinking about the future,"   he wrote in a Facebook post from January. ’ ’   Moore, who works in a   steel mill as an engineer,   described Zuckerberg as a "real down to earth, outgoing guy" with   "good manners" who asked to take his shoes off before he entered   the house.
