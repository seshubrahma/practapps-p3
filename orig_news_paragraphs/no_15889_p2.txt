Members of the Southern Baptist Convention, a coalition of churches that comprise the nation’s largest Protestant denomination, convene just once a year to discuss church business, make budget decisions, commission new missionaries and vote on "resolutions" that affirm their theological, social or political priorities. A Resolutions Committee chooses what topics will be formally voted upon before the meeting. This year’s list of approved resolutions, for example, included a call to defund Planned Parenthood, a rebuke of gambling and an affirmation that morality is important for political leaders.   Race relations are an extremely sensitive issue within the Southern Baptist Convention.
