Another London marcher,    student Rachel Denley Bowers, said science was important and that budget cuts affected research. Roger Morris, professor of molecular neurobiology at Kingâ€™s College London, said: "These marches are brilliant    a spontaneous, global response led by young scientists empowered by social media, keenly aware of the global challenges that need to be addressed if their world is to have a civilized, sustainable future. " Insular populist politics, which have temporarily triumphed in the US and UK, need to be balanced by the broader vision of youth.
