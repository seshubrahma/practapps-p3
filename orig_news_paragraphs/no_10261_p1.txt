Senator Reid is calling for Trump to rise to the responsibility of his office and help put an end to all the hate crimes that have been committed since Election Day, but so far, he has failed. It’s a shame Trump is choosing to hide behind his Twitter account and play ‘Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous’ with TMZ instead of healing our country," a spokesperson for Sen. Reid said in a statement emailed to Breitbart News on Thursday. Breitbart News specifically asked if Reid would call on Trump opponents to stop the violence against Trump supporters in a follow up question.
