Now, after the first 100 days under an opposition president and Congress, the party has entered the circular firing squad phase as members fight uselessly over things like the meaning of President Barack Obama’s being paid $400, 000 by Wall Street for a speech and new data showing that disaffected voters are convinced that President Donald Trump cares more about the poor and middle class than Democrats do. In one   finding in polling by Priorities USA, a liberal super PAC, twice as many of the Obama voters who voted for Trump said Democrats’ policies favor the wealthy compared to those who believed the same about Trump. The reality on the ground can’t be more different than what   voters perceive, and veering toward the "purity politics" advocated by the Sanders wing of the party will do little    if anything    to change that.   Their perceptions ignore the fact that the Democratic Party used up much of its political capital and sacrificed its control over Congress to achieve milestones for   and poor Americans.
