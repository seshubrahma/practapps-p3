They might regret that it took the extremism of Donald Trump to make me finally see it, but better late than never. Except that I donâ€™t see it that way at all. To me, Trump is an alien presence in the Republican Party, an opportunist who could just as easily have hijacked white   voters among the Democrats or as part of a   bid. Nonetheless, strangers on social media and friends in my daily life mistakenly assume that my opposition to Trump equates to some sort of new sympathy for liberalism in general or for Hillary Clinton in particular.
