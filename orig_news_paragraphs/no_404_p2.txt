The Ukrainian Army advanced in at least two places, according to news reports and official Ukrainian accounts, but it said it did so to rebuff rebel attacks. Each side blamed the other for the escalation. Referring to one   town, an adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, Yuri Kasyanov, told Radio Free Europe on Tuesday, "The defenders of Avdiivka preferred to advance the line" to a more defensible position. Ukraineâ€™s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement appealing to Western governments to intervene diplomatically.
