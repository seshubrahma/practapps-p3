On Sunday, just a day after Scavino’s call to take down Amash, Trump tweeted that those who think the GOP health care proposal is dead don’t know the "love and strength" of the Republican Party and said talks to repeal and replace Obamacare will continue. The tweets came as something of a public shift for Trump. After House Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the bill in March amid opposition from conservative and moderate corners of the Republican Party, the Wisconsin Republican said Obamacare would remain the law of the land for the foreseeable future, and Trump said he would move on, likely to tax reform, until Obamacare "explodes. "  Trump spent part of his Sunday playing a game of golf and talking health care with Sen. Rand Paul, according to a White House spokeswoman.
