If Trump was to admit a mistake and apologize for it, he’d shatter his own narrative of eternal invincibility. This crudeness, love it or loathe it, is the only way he’ll win. Meanwhile, the country is denied the kind of debate it deserves. I’m far more interested to hear how Trump is going to finance his latest proposal of spending more than $500 billion on infrastructure.
