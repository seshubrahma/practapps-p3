King Abdulaziz began the enduring partnership between our two countries. King Salman: your father would be so proud to see that you are continuing his legacy   â€”   and just as he opened the first chapter in our partnership, today we begin a new chapter that will bring lasting benefits to our citizens. Let me now also extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here today.
