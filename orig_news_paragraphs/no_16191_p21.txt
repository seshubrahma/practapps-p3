Another notable example: Trump’s deal with Gaddafi in 2009, two years before Gaddafi’s death.   Set to address the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time, Gaddafi was seeking a property to pitch a large tent. Turned away by New York City and New Jersey officials, Libya sought Trump’s Seven Springs estate in Bedford.   Trump recalled that deal, bragging about it in an interview with CBS’ "Face the Nation" this month.
