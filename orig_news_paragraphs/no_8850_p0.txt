After a Muslim woman faked a hate crime where she alleged   Donald Trump supporters attacked her on a subway as New Yorkers looked on, Newsweek is now saying the hoax "highlights pressures" on Muslim teen girls. [Yasmin Seweid, 18, has been charged by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for filing a fraudulent police report after she claimed Trump supporters called her a terrorist and attempted to pull her hijab off her head, as Breitbart Texas reported.   A source with the New York Daily News said Seweid stood by her story until NYPD continued to press her on the matter after finding no evidence that the attack occurred. Seweid admitted that she had fabricated the story, claiming she had family problems.
