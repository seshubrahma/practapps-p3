A senior administration official, who declined to say whether Trump had ordered the strike in Afghanistan said, in general, "we don’t approve every strike," adding that "this administration has moved further away" from dictating military strategy from the White House.   It’s a change both the President and Defense Secretary James Mattis wanted, the official said.   The bombing in Afghanistan comes a week after Trump authorized a US missile strike against a Syrian government air base     the first US strike against the Syrian government in the country’s   civil war.
