This seems to perfectly describe footage taken by reality competition shows, although its value today is questionable. Legally the biggest obstacle to unearthing any material in the possession of MGM or Burnett is the absence    so far    of any court case. As a general rule, there must be a criminal investigation or civil case pending to ask a court to pry open the records vault of a private company. Thatâ€™s especially relevant now that Trump himself is threatening litigation against The New York Times.
