In the five years after suffering a job loss, a Finnish family of four that is eligible for housing assistance receives average benefits equal to 73 percent of previous wages, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That is nearly triple the level in the United States. But the social safety net also appears to be impeding the reinvigoration of the economy by discouraging unemployed people from working part time.
