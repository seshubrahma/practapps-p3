About half of all millennials voted for president, according to the group at Tufts. That’s not much different from recent presidential elections, according to that group, and it’s also similar to the rate at which baby boomers voted when they were younger. Young people, it turns out, are underrepresented regardless of generation. I wish that would change, just as I wish more than 80% of all Americans would vote in elections, as they do in Denmark.
