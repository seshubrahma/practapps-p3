Of the 13 delegates allocated to Cruz and Trump today in the State Executive Committeeâ€™s vote, eight are clearly loyal to the Republican establishment and not supporters of the candidate to whom they are legally bound (Trump or Cruz) on the first two ballots. In any potential third ballot, all eight of these delegates are certain to vote for a candidate other than Trump or Cruz. These "Trojan Horse" delegates, while expected to honor their legal obligation when casting their votes during the first two ballots for the presidential nominee, are expected to side with the   and   establishment forces in the   procedural and rule votes.
