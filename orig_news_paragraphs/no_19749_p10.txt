I strongly condemn any outside interference in our elections, which we must work to prevent moving forward. We must also be clear that there is no evidence that there was any interference in the voting or balloting process. We cannot allow partisans to exploit this report in an attempt to delegitimize the  â€™s victory. Donald Trump won this election fair and square because he heard the voices of Americans who felt forgotten.
