Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and six siblings apparently arrived in Columbus, Ohio shortly after June 28, 2014. There are no press reports that his mother was employed. Artan himself was a full time student, first at Columbus State Community College, then at Ohio State University, from the fall of 2014 to his death on Monday. Press reports indicate that he worked a   job at a Home Depot store near his home in Columbus for about a year.
