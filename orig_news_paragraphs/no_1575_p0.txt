It was around 10 a. m. on a   summer morning, and James Altucher, perhaps the world’s least likely success guru, was packing his worldly possessions, about 15 items, into a small canvas   bag. " If I were to die, my kids get this bag," Mr. Altucher said sardonically as he packed away his laptop, iPad, three sets of chinos, three   and a Ziploc bag filled with $4, 000 worth of $2 bills ("People always remember you if you tip with $2 bills," he said) and departed a friend’s loft on East 20th Street. A few months ago, the boyish    let the lease expire on his Cold Spring, N. Y. apartment, and dumped or donated virtually everything he owned, more than 40 garbage bags of sheets, dishes, clothes, books, his college diploma, even childhood photo albums.
