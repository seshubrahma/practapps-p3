Pence credited Trump with signing legislation to "roll back reams of red tape" while also thanking Congress, Speaker Ryan and Sen. Johnson for sending that legislation to Trump’s desk. He added that Trump has called on every government agency to roll back two regulations for each new regulation they want to issue any new regulations on businesses and entrepreneurs. " He’s taken decisive action to end illegal immigration once and for all, to strengthen our borders and uphold the laws of the United States of America," Pence said of the President.
