Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office has confirmed that he will not be attending the funeral of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, a man Trudeau has called a "  " leader and "legendary revolutionary. " [The Prime Minister’s office issued a statement only stating that Trudeau would not personally be in attendance because "his schedule doesn’t permit it," without addressing the wave of global condemnation Trudeau’s statement praising Castro upon his death has triggered.   In his official statement released Friday, Trudeau said he felt "deep sorrow" at the passing of the Cuban tyrant, responsible for thousands of firing squad executions, the internment of tens of thousands of "undesirables" in labor camps, and a   exile population in the United States alone.
