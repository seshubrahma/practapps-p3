Flynn has emerged as a central figure    and Trumpâ€™s biggest liability    in the intensifying investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. His financial ties to Turkish government interests, which paid him $530, 000 in a lobbying deal that he failed to disclose during the campaign, are also under scrutiny by federal investigators.   One major concern for Obama administration officials was the subject of conversations between Flynn and Kislyak that took place shortly after President Barack Obama slapped new sanctions on Russia for meddling in the election. Sources tell CNN that Flynn told Kislyak that the Trump administration would look favorably on a decision by Russia to hold off on retaliating with its own sanctions.
