I can also envision how the superdelegate system could become untenable. If Sanders had edged Clinton by, say, two pledged delegates, itâ€™s conceivable that the superdelegates would have overturned that verdict by the voters. They could have cited things like popular vote totals or his reliance on caucus victories. In that event, you would have had an extraordinary mess (you think Sanders supporters are upset now? ).
