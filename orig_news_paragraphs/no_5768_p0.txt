The Obamacare repeal is "going to start happening in just a few days," Vice President Mike Pence promised a crowd gathered on Friday at Blaine’s Farm and Fleet Distribution Center in Janesville, Wisc. [The goal, he said, is to "eliminate all its mandates and taxes and intrusion into your personal lives and into the lives of your business," he said shortly after House Speaker Paul Ryan introduced Pence to the crowd.   " We both know the fundamental truth of our economy: when small business is strong, America is strong, and we’re gonna fight every day for small business America," said Pence.
