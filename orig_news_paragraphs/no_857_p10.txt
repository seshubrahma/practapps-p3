The bill effectively slashes subsidies that help many   people buy insurance, starting in 2020. A    earning $20, 000 in Lincoln, Neb. currently gets a subsidy of $18, 470 to help her buy insurance, with extra subsidies to help her pay deductibles and   according to calculations made by Kaiser. Under the new legislation, she would get a subsidy of $4, 000, and no help with cost sharing. The bill also does away with Obamacareâ€™s requirement that people have insurance or pay a fine.
