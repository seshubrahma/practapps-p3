Moscow (CNN) Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has dismissed claims that his country is interfering in the US presidential election as "ridiculous". In an interview with CNNâ€™s Christiane Amanpour in Moscow, Lavrov said it was "flattering" that American officials think Russia is meddling in the election, but the accusations were baseless. The US last week accused Russia of being behind a series of email hacks, including communications from the Democratic National Committee.
