Hearings are not yet scheduled but are expected in January. Democrats then will have 48 seats compared to 52 for Republicans, meaning they will need to convince at least three Republicans to abandon Price if they are to defeat him. This year, Price bought and sold 12 healthcare stocks, including big name biotech stocks like Biogen and Gilead Sciences as well as major pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and   Squibb. He also traded in Aetna, the large health insurer Athena Health, a health care services company and CVS.
