Washington (CNN) Senate Democrats are weighing whether to avoid an   war to block President Donald Trump’s upcoming Supreme Court pick, instead considering delaying that battle for a future nomination that could shift the ideological balance of the court, sources say. Democrats privately discussed their tactics during a   retreat in West Virginia last week. And a number of Democrats are trying to persuade liberal firebrands to essentially let Republicans confirm Trump’s pick after a vigorous confirmation process    since Trump is likely to name a conservative to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.
