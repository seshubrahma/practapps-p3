As a prequel to "Psycho," this series has always had an inevitable future looming over it. The core piece of that future arrived in shattering fashion in this May episode, which ended with the young Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore) lying down beside his mother, Norma (Vera Farmiga) after making sure the faulty furnace would fill her bedroom with gas. Norman has been deteriorating psychologically from the start of the series in 2013, but the pace has accelerated, and Norma’s marriage to Sheriff Alex Romero (Nestor Carbonell) left the disturbed boy feeling under siege. He survived the gas thanks to Alex’s dramatic rescue, but Norma died, as we knew she must eventually.
