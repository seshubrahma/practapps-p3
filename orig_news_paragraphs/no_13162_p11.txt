The answer is as simple as it is obvious: After eight years of Obamaâ€™s government by executive decree, not only in immigration but across a broad spectrum of government programs, our Constitution is in tatters. If we invite four more years of this lawlessness with a Supreme Court clearing the way for every new insult to American sovereignty and the rule of law, there will be no possibility of returning to the constitutional government we inherited from ten generations of patriots. We do not need a host of new immigration laws, and if fact, we not need a   wall on the southwest border. What we need most is the conscientious enforcement of existing immigration laws that have been subverted and castrated by Obama.
