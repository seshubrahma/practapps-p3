The key to this pragmatic position, and the reason it’s so effective, is the uncomfortable yet true realization that in order to actually get one’s agenda accomplished legislatively in America, one must actually win elections on a national scale. In order to do that, conservatives must abandon the "conservatism" that in effect "majors on the minors" by focusing on peripheral issues that, while they may be important morally, don’t personally affect the average American voter, and instead embrace issues that do. For their own survival, it’s time for conservatives to become populists. By making immigration his central campaign issue early on, Donald Trump did just that, speaking to something that hits home for many if not most Americans.
