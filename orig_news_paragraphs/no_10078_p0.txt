Wednesday on NBC’s Today, Republican presidential   fielded questions from NBC’s "Today"   Matt Lauer about the unfolding saga involving his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was charged on Tuesday with misdemeanor battery for an incident involving former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields at a Jupiter, FL, campaign event on March 6.   Trump continued to defend Lewandowski, as he had a night earlier at the CNN town hall and described it as "minor" compared to what was going on in the Middle East. " When you look at this, it was so minor," Trump said.
