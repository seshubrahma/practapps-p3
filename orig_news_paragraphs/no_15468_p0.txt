Washington (CNN) Rep. Jerrold Nadler said in an interview Friday that President Donald Trump’s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey and subsequent tweet that Comey "better hope" their conversations weren’t taped add up to a "strong case" that Trump tried to obstruct justice. The New York Democrat’s comments come after news reports that Trump requested Comey pledge his loyalty to the President at a dinner shortly after Trump took office. Nadler’s remarks also follow the President’s comment in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt on Thursday that he considered the FBI’s investigation of alleged collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials in his decision to fire the FBI director.
