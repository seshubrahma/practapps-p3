President Donald Trump’s assessment that political correctness was a contributing problem to the fight against Islamic terrorism, Mr. Farage pointed to the child sex abuse scandals in Rotherham and Rochdale, saying:  "We can talk about terrorism but equally please don’t forget what happened to all those young underaged girls in our big northern cities, molested, raped, on an industrial scale and yet we did nothing about it for fear of causing offence.
