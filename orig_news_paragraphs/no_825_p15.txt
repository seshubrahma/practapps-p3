They will be detained more often, or asked to wait in Mexico until a judge can rule. " There are all kinds of things in the system that werenâ€™t built to maximize compliance," said David A. Martin, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and a former immigration official in the Obama and Clinton administrations.
