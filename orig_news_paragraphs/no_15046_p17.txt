While Clinton’s closest associates are inclined to reject speculation of the former candidate’s interest in pursuing public office again, rumors have continued to swirl nonetheless. Local media have floated her name as a possible New York City mayoral candidate. Clinton aides say that she is still mulling over what she would like to do in the coming years, and has been reaching out to friends, donors and other associates to keep the lines of communication open. Asked if she would ever run for office again, Clinton said more than once that she is set on finding "interesting things" to do with her life    without outright rejecting the suggestion of another political campaign.
