Not long after Mr. Clinton won   in 1982, the Clintons sold the yellow house on Midland Street and moved back into the governor’s mansion, where they once again had free housing and the assistance of a small staff. Two years later, the state increased the governor’s term to four years, and the Clintons’ finances appeared more stable. Mrs. Clinton went on to join the board of Walmart, and she continued to work at the Rose Law Firm. By the time Mr. Clinton was running for president, they reported $297, 177 in total income on their 1992 tax returns, a sum that would put most Americans in the upper income tier but seemed meager compared with the wealth of his opponents, George Bush and Ross Perot.
