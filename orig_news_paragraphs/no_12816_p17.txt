As Scavino put it,  The success to our social media platforms comes directly from   and now   of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.   It is all Mr. Trump and his messaging. Whether Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram platforms, Mr. Trump is directly involved with our social media messaging.   He loves communicating with the American people, and he loves seeing what is going out.
