The Monday night event  —   with proceeds going to the Hillary Victory Fund joint fundraising committee   —   adds to Clinton’s comfortable cash lead over presumptive GOP nominee and her chief rival, Donald Trump. According to an FEC report filed Monday, Clinton’s campaign had $42 million    as of May 31, and the   Super PAC Priorities USA had another $52 million. Trump’s campaign had just $1. 3 million in the bank as of May 31, according to CNN.
