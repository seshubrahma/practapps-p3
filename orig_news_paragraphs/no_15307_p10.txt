George H. W. Bush lost one.   And, with Trump already at historic lows in terms of job approval at this point in a presidential term, it’s possible that if his unpopularity continues it could make Republicans’   races more difficult.

Still, the seats up in 2018 are tilted as heavily toward Republicans as any time in recent memory.
