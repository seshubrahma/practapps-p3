Jerusalem (CNN) President Donald Trump met with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas during the second leg of his first foreign trip as president, pressing forward with his bid to advance the peace process.

Trump sees Iranian threat as unifying force in quest for Middle East peace, "During my travels I have seen many hopeful signs that lead me to believe that we can truly achieve a more hopeful future for people of this religion and for people of all faiths and all beliefs and frankly all over the world," Trump said, delivering remarks Monday evening alongside Netanyahu.
