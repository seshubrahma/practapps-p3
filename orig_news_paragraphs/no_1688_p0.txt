GREENSBORO, N. C.  â€”    A rested Hillary Clinton returned to the campaign trail here on Thursday after three days of recovering at home from pneumonia, and vowed a different approach on the final stretch of the campaign, one more focused on her own positive vision for the country, rather than eviscerating her rival. " I want to close my campaign focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families," Mrs. Clinton said after her first rally of her renewed campaign.
