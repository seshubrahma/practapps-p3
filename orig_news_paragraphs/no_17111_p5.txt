" Trump’s campaign quickly condemned the parade, saying, "Mr. Trump and his team continue to disavow these groups and individuals and strongly condemn their message of hate," according to Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks. This isn’t the first show of support Trump has received from the group. Earlier this month, the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan expressed its support for Trump on the front page of its current issue, a move the Trump campaign also quickly denounced. Trump, however, often was reluctant to disavow support from white supremacists during the campaign.
