The Ryan plan, the American Health Care Act, will phase out tax credits for those making $75, 000 or those who file jointly $150, 000. These thresholds for tax credits are more generous than Obamaâ€™s Affordable Care Act, which phases out subsidies around an income of $48, 000. Avik Roy, of Forbes, argues that the tax credits availability might encourage employers to drop health coverage for their   employees. Conservatives balked at the February 10 leaked draft bill that would institute a tax on   health care plans above the 90th percentile.
