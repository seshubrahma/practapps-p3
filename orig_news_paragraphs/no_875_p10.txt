Other reports included the "liberation" of Palmyra by the Syrian Army with "the support of the Russian Air Force" an interview with former British ambassador to Syria and a United States critic, Peter Ford and a report about a London professor decrying the fall in British living standards. There are "clickbait" videos on RT’s website and stranger pieces, too, like one about a petition to ban the financier George Soros from America for supposedly trying to "destabilize" the country and "drown it" with immigrants for a "globalist goal. " Mr. Bogachikhin and Anna Belkina, RT’s head of communications in Moscow, insist it is absurd to lump together RT’s effort to provide "alternative views to the mainstream media" with the phenomena of fake news and social media propaganda.
