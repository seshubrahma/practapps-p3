Other Trump associates who have been drawn into the F. B. I. investigation include Roger J. Stone Jr. a longtime Republican operative who has acknowledged contacts with Guccifer 2. 0, the mysterious online figure that is believed to be a front for Russian intelligence officials, and Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the campaign who has done extensive business in Russia. Both have denied doing anything unlawful. The Senate investigation is proceeding on a separate track from the F. B. I. investigation while drawing on some of the same material, like routine electronic surveillance of the Russian ambassador and his embassy cohort. The committee chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, has told the White House he plans to interview all Trump aides who had contact with Russian officials, according to White House officials.
