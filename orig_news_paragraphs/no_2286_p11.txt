Mingo County, a picturesque district of twisting valleys, is steeped in the lore of coal, corruption and violence. A gun battle between mine company officials and unionized workers in 1920 brought the nickname "Bloody Mingo," fodder today for history tourists and TV serials. I checked into a hotel in the county seat, Williamson, where the manager offered a   of the areaâ€™s more recent dramas. In 2013, the county sheriff was murdered  as he ate lunch in his patrol car.
