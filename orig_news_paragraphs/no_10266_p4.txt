It was the greatest favor Powell ever did for me, utterly unintentionally, to be sure, and my   activities were only at the margins of the central decisions. I believe Boltonâ€™s liberal critics are falsely portraying Bolton as an architect of the Iraq War for two reasons. First, they want to obscure his successful diplomatic efforts to address cheating on WMD treaties by rogue states. Bolton did this by calling out major violators of treaties to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction like the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Biological Weapons Convention.
