The last state to vote on Saturday is Maine, which has the fewest number of delegates at stake, 23. It is a caucus format, but open to unaffiliated or new voters who can register with the Republican party on the day of the caucus. There is no polling in Maine. Other than Donald Trump’s swing through the state on Thursday, campaigns haven’t devoted any time recently to the state.
