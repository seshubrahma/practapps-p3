When pressed on General Dunfordâ€™s role, Mr. Spicer said, "The president gets plenty of information from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. " Current and former military officials said they suspected that the decision, in part, was prompted by the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who retired as a   general after he was dismissed during the Obama administration as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was the previous director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, who delivered the news to Mr. Flynn that he was being removed from his post.
