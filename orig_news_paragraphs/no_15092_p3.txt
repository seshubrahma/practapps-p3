The US blames Syrian President Bashar   for the carnage, but the Syrian military denies responsibility for the attack. US officials originally said 58 of the 59 missiles fired Friday had "severely degraded or destroyed" their original target, including 20 planes which they said were taken out in the strike. On Friday, Russiaâ€™s Defense Ministry said in a statement only 23 of the US missiles made it to the airbase, blowing up just six   planes. Military flights from the Shayrat airbase resumed over the weekend, according to both Syrian state media outlets and an opposition group.
