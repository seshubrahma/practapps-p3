Whatâ€™s your advice for readers for distinguishing good information from bad information? First, read The New York Times. But more broadly, I guess my advice would be to constantly crosscheck what you see and hear on the internet. If you read a   allegation in a Facebook post or a tweet, or on a   internet site, try to see whether that allegation is also being reported by The Washington Post or Fox News.
