Frank Gaffney, Center for Security Policy president, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss Gaffney’s warning that things can get worse in Syria. ["The Syria situation is one that is fraught with peril, as I see it, for the United States at this particular moment in time," Gaffney explained. " Because President Trump seems sorely tempted  —   and I think that tempting is not simply a function of the usual suspects, people who have been horrified by the humanitarian crisis there, the people there who think that it will be resolved, or at least diminished, by bringing Heaven knows how many refugees from Syria here and the like  —   but now from his own national security team that we must get involved, we must inject ourselves into the crisis in Syria.
