Ossoff sought to cast Handel, who had served as secretary of state in Georgia and run unsuccessfully for governor and Senate in recent years, as a tool of Trump.   Handel similarly sought to link Ossoff to Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. Although Ossoff was heavily funded by liberal donors outside the state, he never cast himself as a progressive warrior    instead putting himself in the mold of a centrist problem solver.   That was enough to get him 48% in the stateâ€™s "jungle primary" in May in which all of the candidates from both parties ran on a single ballot.
