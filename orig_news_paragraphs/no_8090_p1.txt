Trump’s surge in the Golden State now seems to have been confirmed. Polls as recently as early April showed Cruz closing the gap to about seven points, but three separate polls released this week  —   some of which were conducted in the aftermath of Trump’s massive victory in the New York primary   —   have shown Trump approaching 50 percent, and enjoying leads for Trump of 17 points or higher. Clinton’s win in her home state did not seem to have the same effect on voters in California.
