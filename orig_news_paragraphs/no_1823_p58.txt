These are meant to be commuter bikes, not   transportation. I had decided to do a meandering ride between Fort Greene and Red Hook, winding up through Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) before going through Brooklyn Bridge Park and all the way to the docks by Ikea (the ferry out back, which runs to Wall Street, is free on weekends). I got the ride route from the Spinlister site, incidentally, which has a useful (if irregularly updated) blog. I would not have been able to do the entire ride in 30 minutes at a leisurely pace, so I took my time and checked into a Citi Bike station every so often, then checked it out again, ensuring I wouldnâ€™t be charged extra.
