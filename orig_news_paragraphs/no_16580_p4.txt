To date, Trump’s only major pronouncement has been the need for a "civil rights agenda for our time," but he has failed to offer one, except a call to fight crime and expand charter schools. While seeking to temper his racially divisive image to   whites and suburban moms, he has reinforced the very stereotypes that blacks have worked for decades to overcome. Everyone is not impoverished, uneducated, jobless and getting shot.   Surely the Trump campaign didn’t believe that his outreach strategy    void of apologizing for his condescending tone or offering any prescriptive policy solutions    would increase his support among blacks.
