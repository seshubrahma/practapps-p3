It’s too hilarious to be written by real white supremacists. I’m having a great tour of the south, although I’m starting to wonder if country music is a Clinton plot to have me commit suicide. Sorry, that shit just doesn’t travel outside the US. I’m having huge turnouts and massive viewership of my talks on YouTube.
