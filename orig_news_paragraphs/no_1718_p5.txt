While some College Republican leaders profess an appreciation for the   voters that Mr. Trump has awakened, many in the preppy Vineyard Vines set are wondering if Mr. Trump is transforming the party they hope to inherit into one in which they are unwelcome. " They tend to be   traditional Republican conservatives, and so you know there is a little bit of a mismatch there," said Karl Rove, the architect of George W. Bush’s presidential campaigns. Mr. Rove’s career in politics started as a   national chairman of the College Republicans who won the position in 1973 over opponents supported by Roger J. Stone Jr. and Paul Manafort, both of whom went on to become advisers to Mr. Trump.
