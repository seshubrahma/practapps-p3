Update (11:30 PST): A   press conference revealed that water had stopped flowing over the emergency spillway. Authorities plan to keep flow through the main spillway at about 100, 000 cubic feet per second, with a goal of lowering the level of the lake by 50 feet, which will help the lake absorb additional runoff from anticipated storms later in the week. Law enforcement said that there was no looting or violence in Oroville or neighboring towns, and that the rumor of looting had been started thanks to a coincidental   within Oroville at the time that the crisis began. Authorities said they hoped for drier weather, as well as cooler weather (to keep snow from melting on the mountains).
