Obamatrade refers to the combination of Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA) —  the fast track package that greases the skids for congressional approval of specific trade deals, a piece of legislation Ryan helped Boehner ram through Congress —  along with the three separate trade deals currently in motion, the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( ) and the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). Everyone knows Ryan supports the TPP. In fact, even Ryan wrote that he did in a joint   in the Wall Street Journal with Cruz back in April 2015.
