There is no greater physical or economic threat to Americans today than our open border.   And there is no greater political threat than the control of Washington by special interests.   In view of these threats, the National Border Patrol Council endorses Donald J. Trump for President  â€”   and asks the American people to support Mr. Trump in his mission to finally secure the border of the United States of America, before it is too late. Sincerely, Brandon JuddPresidentNational Border Patrol Council, (Disclosure: Breitbart Texas sponsored the Green Line podcast for the NBPC in an effort to provide a platform for agents to inform the public about the realities on the border and what Border Patrol agents face.
