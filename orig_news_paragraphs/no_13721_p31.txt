When terrorists attacked San Bernadino, the D. C. GOP elites went out of their way to tell us how America has a duty to let in as many Muslim immigrants as wish to come here, no matter what they believe about America.

When Obama tried to ram through his Fast Track for TPP, the Washington Republican Party elites laughed at your pleas, mocks us as "Neanderthals" and shoved it through. Only Trump said hell no.
