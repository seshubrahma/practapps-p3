SB 54 was introduced by California State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (  Angeles) in December. In February, Breitbart News reported that de Léon said that "‘half his family’ was in the country illegally, using false documents, and eligible for deportation under President Trump’s new executive order against ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions. " According to the Daily News, McDonnell wrote to De León earlier this month: "SB 54 would not allow the safe transfer of custody rather it would force immigration enforcement agents into our communities in order to search out and find the person they seek. While doing this, they will most surely cast a wide net over our communities, apprehending and detaining those not originally the target of the enforcement actions.
