" "The wall design shall be physically imposing in height," CBP officials said in contracting documents. The agency said the goal is to have a   wall, but it will accept proposals as low as 18 feet. They also said the wall must be at least six feet underground to prevent anyone from tunneling underneath it and high enough that no one can climb the wall without a ladder, NPR reports. It should take at least an hour, and ideally more than four hours, to make a hole in the wall so agents can stop anyone attempting to break it down.
