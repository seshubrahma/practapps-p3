Trump has famously called climate change a "hoax," though his Cabinet has attempted to strike a more moderate tone in confirmation hearings.   The CDC started to notify participants just before Christmas that the meeting was "postponed," according to CDC spokeswoman Bernadette Burden.    "We are exploring options to reschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017, including the current continuing resolution, and potential overlap with an APHA conference on the same topic also being held later in 2017," Burden said in a statement.   The meeting postponement was first reported by EE News.
