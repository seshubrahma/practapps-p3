US National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster is overseeing the Afghanistan review at the White House and will be traveling to Afghanistan soon to make his own assessment. McMaster served in Afghanistan running an   task force in 2010, as a result of which he understands the players and politics of the country well. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February, Gen. John "Mick" Nicholson said that the present troop level of 8, 400 US soldiers was insufficient and noted, "We have a shortfall of a few thousand" advisers to train and assist the Afghan army.
