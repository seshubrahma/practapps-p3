Practicing physician Kelli Ward called on Arizonans to elect her to replace Sen. John McCain in the wake of Monday’s Supreme Court decision to overturn Texas’s abortion law, declaring that, unlike McCain, she will support a President Donald Trump in appointing conservative Justices. ["Today’s decision illustrates why it’s so crucial that a conservative replace John McCain in the U. S. Senate to support President Trump in appointing conservative Justices to the Supreme Court," said Ward in a campaign statement. " Senator McCain has a track record of supporting liberal nominees including Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer who authored today’s extremist ruling. "
