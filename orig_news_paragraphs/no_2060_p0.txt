After less than a month in exile, the white nationalist leader Richard B. Spencer is back on Twitter. The social network reinstated Mr. Spencerâ€™s personal account on Saturday, less than four weeks after suspending it and others he created for violating rules against making multiple accounts with overlapping uses. " Please select one account for restoration the others will remain suspended," the company told Mr. Spencer last week, according to an email that was obtained by BuzzFeed.
