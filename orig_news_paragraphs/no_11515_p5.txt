But if Clinton is not indicted, it would be based on a political decision, not a legal one. Then, whether or not she were to be elected, speculation, media investigations, leaks and Congressional hearings would never end, trying to answer what crimes were covered up by the Obama Justice Department in order to save her candidacy. She would be hard pressed to survive her presidency, not to mention what sort of example she would serve to the American people and to the rest of the world. It is astounding that no Democrat is willing to put country over politics and simply ask the question whether their party has a problem.
