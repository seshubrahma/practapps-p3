The Sahadi family, originally from Lebanon, opened their Atlantic Avenue shop in 1948. The selection of nuts, olives and cheeses is enough to wow even the most particular food snob. I bought a container of hummus, some spanakopita, grape leaves, freshly baked pita chips, and tangy flatbread covered in thyme and sumac, all for about $20. Walking into the park, we heard music and followed it to the festival grounds, a grassy area in the shadow of a temporary Martin Creed sculpture that reads "Understanding" in letters so red and intimidating that it seems more of an imperative than a suggestion.
