One friend of Mr. Obamaâ€™s, who requested anonymity to discuss private discussions with the president, said the election results seemed to have made him more willing to remain part of the political debate. " Everyone he talks to walks away with this impression," the friend said. In an interview with The New Yorker this week, Mr. Obama said that if Mrs. Clinton had won the election, he might have just turned over the keys and walked away on Inauguration Day.
