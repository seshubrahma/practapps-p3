Confusingly for members of MoveOn. org, which suddenly doesn’t seem all that interested in "moving on," the   group is circulating a petition to muscle "faithless electors" into turning against Trump, as well as a petition to abolish the Electoral College altogether. It’s beyond hilarious to read screeds against the evils of "direct democracy" coming from the party that was, just two years ago, telling us the midterm elections were meaningless because President Obama should be an absolute dictator certified by democratic vote, and maybe it was time to do away with midterm elections, or possibly even Congress. Obama himself announced that not only was direct democracy   as long as it empowered him, but he didn’t even need to see the ballots, because he can read the minds of people who don’t vote, and would defy the authority of Congress on their behalf.
