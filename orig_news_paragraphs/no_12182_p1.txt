Johnson only lightly and perfunctorily criticized Clinton, instead focusing most of his   attacks on Trump. He also revealed a personal gluten allergy and said that he himself would not patronize the services of prostitutes. These two marginal politicians are clearly enjoying the spotlight that the   media are finally giving them in their effort to stop Trump. (Something tells me the folks at CNN have not secretly been reading Reason magazine all these years.)
