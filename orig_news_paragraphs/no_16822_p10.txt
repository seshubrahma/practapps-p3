Clinton called for a   zone in Syria in October 2015, soon after Russia entered the country and started a bombing campaign to help President Bashar  .   " I personally would be advocating now for a   zone and humanitarian corridors to try to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air," Clinton said in an interview with Bostonâ€™s WHDH.   The White House has said a Syrian safe zone is off the table because of the enormous military commitment it would take to effectively enforce it and the ongoing responsibility of protecting its borders.
