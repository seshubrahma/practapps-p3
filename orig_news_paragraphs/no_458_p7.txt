On Thursday, heated arguments broke out at Sproul Plaza between students who said Mr. Yiannopoulos  —   a provocateur editor at Breitbart News who is known for his attacks on political correctness and offensive,   writing   —   was too inflammatory to be invited to campus and those who argued that he should have been allowed to speak. The university made it clear they believed the people who resorted to violence on Wednesday night  —   a group, clad in black clothing and carrying sticks   —   had come from outside the campus.
