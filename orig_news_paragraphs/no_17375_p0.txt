 (CNN) Russian cyberhacking activity has continued largely unabated since the November election, including against US political organizations, US officials briefed on the investigation told CNN on Thursday.   Among the attempted cyber breaches are phishing attempts targeting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign, one official says. The attempt to breach the Clinton campaign was unsuccessful, investigators tell CNN.   The attempts appear to trace back to some of the same Russian hackers behind the breaches of Democratic Party organizations in the past year, one official said.
