The Netherlands, Voters in the Netherlands head to the polls today in an election widely seen as an indicator of populist sentiment across Europe. Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte is facing a tight battle with   rival Geert Wilders, whose     tirades have landed him in court    but also won him widespread support in a country that is increasingly polarized by austerity and immigration issues. The Dutch have 28 different parties on the ballot. Concerned lawmakers say Wildersâ€™ charisma and controversy are pulling other parties to the right.
