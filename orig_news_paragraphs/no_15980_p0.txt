Washington (CNN) Donald Trump has directed nearly   of his campaign cash to companies that are part of his vast business empire, new federal records show. Trump, hurting for cash after he suddenly stopped   his campaign last month, has mixed his public campaign and his private ventures for nearly the entire 2016 race. He has promoted Trump products at campaign events, publicly litigated a federal civil suit heâ€™s facing over Trump University on talk shows, and, this week, will bring the political press to Scotland for a tour of a Trump golf course.
