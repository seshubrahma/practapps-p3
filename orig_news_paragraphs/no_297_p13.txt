Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the White House, said it had no comment. Christo, whose work usually involves monumental wrapping or draping, a kind of beautifying abstraction of architecture or landscape, is known not only for "The Gates," but also for highly visible projects like "Wrapped Reichstag," in Berlin, realized in 1995 after more than 20 years of planning and proposals. Last year, "The Floating Piers," a   walkway of fabric atop 220, 000 interlocking polyethylene cubes on Lake Iseo in the Lombardy region of Italy, drew 1. 2 million visitors. The Colorado project would have been the largest work Christo had ever attempted in America.
