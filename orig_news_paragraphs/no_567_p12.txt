Given multiple challenges, the idea of starting over appealed to the White House. Edward Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and an advocate of Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote on Twitter that it was "utterly crazy" to expect the justices to overturn Thursday’s ruling. As a result, Mr. Whelan wrote, it would be better to develop a "sensible" executive order and unveil it "with clear expectations" for carrying it out. The original executive order issued last month barred refugees from anywhere in the world from entering the United States for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely.
