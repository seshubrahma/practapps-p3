" They are letting people vote in your Virginia election that should not be allowed to vote," Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said. In fact, however, the governor is empowered by the stateâ€™s Constitution to grant   the right to vote, and earlier studies suggest that most of those whose rights were restored had committed nonviolent crimes. Almost all states deny felons the right to vote, but many automatically restore voting rights after a violator has completed a prison term, probation, parole or all three.
