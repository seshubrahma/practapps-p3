The Justice Department declined to comment on the contents of the report, but earlier in the day a spokeswoman confirmed it had delivered the document. " The Department of Justice has complied with the request from leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and Judiciary Committees seeking information related to surveillance during the 2016 election," Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Friday. The House Committee is set to hold a hearing Monday with National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and FBI Director James Comey.
