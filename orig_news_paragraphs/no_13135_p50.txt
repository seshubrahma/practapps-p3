" Donald Trump has met with and listened to our families’ stories of loss and grief and has pledged to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws in order to stop the preventable killings of Americans and permanently separating them from their loved ones," Maria Espinoza,   and National Director of The Remembrance Project, said. " We are grateful for Mr. Trump’s support and excited that he is honoring our work and the memories of stolen lives by speaking at this first ever National Conference.
