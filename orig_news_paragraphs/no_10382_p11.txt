The crowd around me looked on in disbelief as this guy kept trying to get out of their grip again and again!   I thanked the Agents for keeping all of us safe tonight and told him what I recognized him from the Florida Trump rally last week as  one of the guys who removed the idiots who were doing the gang signs, feeding each other, flipping the camera off and saying cuss words and more! Another announcement was made telling people they needed to leave the event.   I wanted to see what would continue to happen and I watched as more protesters said loud and angry things to the rally attendees.
