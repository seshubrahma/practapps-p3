Representative Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on CNN in September that the R. N. C. had been hacked by Russia, but then quickly withdrew the claim. Mr. McCaul, who was considered by Mr. Trump for secretary of Homeland Security, initially told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, "It’s important to note, Wolf, that they have not only hacked into the D. N. C. but also into the R. N. C. " He added that "the Russians have basically hacked into both parties at the national level, and that gives us all concern about what their motivations are. "
