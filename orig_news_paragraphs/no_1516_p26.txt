Kanye West’s wife, Kim Kardashian West, posted clips of a phone conversation that appeared to counter Taylor Swift’s insistence that she was blindsided by lyrics in one of Mr. West’s songs. In the clips, Ms. Swift thanks him for running the line "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex" by her, and he responds, "Relationships are more important than punch lines. "
