The leader of the Tea Party Patriots told Breitbart News she and her activists are backing Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court on Capitol Hill Monday, despite the lack of opposition from   operatives. ["We are here on Capitol Hill today and we will be here tomorrow when Judge Gorsuch testifies for 10 hours. in addition, our Tea Party Patriots are making phone calls and sending emails and letters to their senators from across the country," said Jenny Beth Martin, the author of the 2012 book Tea Party Patriots: The Second American Revolution.   Martin was joined by two dozen volunteers holding signs outside the Hart Senate Office Building, while Gorsuch spent the day listening to senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee make opening remarks before making his own   statement.
