The goal should never be a   solution, the goal is peace. And there are many ways of moving in that direction and there are several potential endpoints. And I think that itâ€™s useful to the Israelis and for us to remind everybody that the goal is peace. We should not let the means become more important than the end, and we should think about that goal, rather than saying there is no other possible arrangement ever than the   solution.
