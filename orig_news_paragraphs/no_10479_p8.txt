A party that is feminist, a party that is   a party that is opposed to the occupation of Palestine by the state of Israel, a party that will represent the true needs of the people, not only of this country but the people of the world. And I could also talk about a party that stands for food sovereignty, a party that recognizes that when capitalist corporations are involved in the production of food, that human beings need to nourish themselves, theyâ€™re involved for the purpose of generating as much profit as possible. And therefore they destroy the earth, they create untold pain for the animals that they raise in order to provide food for human beings. And so I want a radically different kind of political party.
