Clinton made his remarks during the beginning of a bus tour of Ohio campaigning for his wife Hillary Clinton at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. The rally, held at a park at Ohio University was only about a third of the way full, as Clinton took the stage. Lots of space left at this Ohio University rally as Bill Clinton takes the stage  &gt pic. twitter.
