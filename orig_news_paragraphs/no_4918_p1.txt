Republicans, who will retain a majority in both the House and Senate, are expected to vote to repeal the healthcare law in the very early stages of Trump’s presidency, although they have yet to outline a replacement plan. In light of Trump’s plans, various Democrat leaders, including Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi, have called for a "day of action". " Rallies will be held across the country to vigorously oppose the Republican plan to end Medicare as we know it and throw our health care system into chaos," a letter signed by a number of Democratic Party leaders states.
