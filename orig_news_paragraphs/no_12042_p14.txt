For all my friends who are supporters of the foreign policy of President Obama: Where was your outrage when he wouldn’t even impose a   zone to stop Arab children from being gassed from the air? Fake human rights activists are those who never hold President Obama accountable for allowing 500, 000 Arabs to be murdered in a   with next to no action. Comparing Bannon to Hitler is vile,   and nauseating makes a mockery of the Holocaust and enables all those who supported the Iran deal   —   together with Khameini’s threats of Jewish annihilation
