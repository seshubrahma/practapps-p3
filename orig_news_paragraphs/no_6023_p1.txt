and that is what I am looking for," said Sen. Joe Manchin (D. . V.) who said he had not spoken to Schumer about this issue.   The Washington Post and other media outlets reported that Sessions met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice during the 2016 election cycle, when the former Alabama senator was a senior adviser to candidate Donald Trump and his campaign. Manchin said as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, like Sessions at the time of his meetings, he met with Kislyak, but never by himself.
