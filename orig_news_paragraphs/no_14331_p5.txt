Last week, Long Island rapper King Myers released the track "Propaganda,"    an   anthem that calls for the impeachment of the new President and voices solidarity with refugees, immigrants and Muslims, a song which Myers billed as produced by West.   West’s G. O. O. D. music label denied that West produced that track or that the label has any official involvement with King Meyers. King Meyers disputed G. O. O. D. music’s assertion but declined to provide evidence that he was signed to the label.   Previously, a source with knowledge of West’s meeting with Trump told CNN that the rapper’s main concern is the state of his hometown, Chicago.
