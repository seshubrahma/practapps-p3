Martin Sheen, Debra Messing and more urge electors to vote against Trump. In the days following Trump’s victory, a   campaign attempted to persuade Electoral College members to disregard the will of their respective states’ voters and vote against Trump and, if not for Clinton, then for another Republican or a   candidate. A group called Unite for America enlisted   celebrities including Martin Sheen, Debra Messing, Richard Schiff and Bob Odenkirk to deliver that message to the country’s electors. The video includes a brief history of the Electoral College and an appeal for the electors to vote their conscience.
