Nordstrom, which mainly sold Ivanka Trump shoes, said demand for Ms. Trumpâ€™s products had not been strong. The company still has some merchandise from previous orders that it plans to sell in stores. For the time being, the relationship appears to have ended. Neiman Marcus said it "continuously" assesses productivity to determine where its products are sold.
