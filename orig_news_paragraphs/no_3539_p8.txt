Here is more of my previous summary: The report goes through a list of current missile defense programs, including   Midcourse Defense, Airborne Laser, Kinetic Energy Interceptors and a number of others, pushing for all programs to be cut. " It is unwise to fund more advanced systems for missile defense while current ones have yet to be proven effective against their targeted threats," complains the report. The militaryâ€™s vital Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation program is to be cut by $10 billion across the board.
