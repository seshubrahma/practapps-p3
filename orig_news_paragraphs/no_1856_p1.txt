On Thursday, State Representative Rodney W. Moore was one of a number of Democratic lawmakers who predicted that Republicans here in the capitol would have little reason to dump the law, commonly known as House Bill 2, or H. B. 2, even if Mr. Cooper were elected. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican seeking his second term, has refused to concede until thousands of   and provisional ballots are counted by elections boards in each of the stateâ€™s 100 counties. That process is set to conclude on Nov. 18. Mr. McCrory was widely criticized for having signed the law.
