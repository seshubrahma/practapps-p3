Pelosi, the House Minority leader, has called for Sessions to resign.   The exchanges are the latest in the    between the Trump administration and its critics over the continuing controversy surrounding reports that Trump’s associates made repeated contact with Russians known to US intelligence during the campaign. CNN reported Thursday that Sessions was a senator and a top Trump surrogate when he met the ambassador twice, once the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in July and again in September when he was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.   Facing pressure from Democrats and some Republicans in Congress to step aside from any investigation of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, Sessions announced Thursday that he would recuse himself.
