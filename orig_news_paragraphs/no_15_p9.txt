Mr. Trump had weighed in via a series of Twitter posts, suggesting that the House should be focused on domestic policy priorities such as health care and a tax overhaul. He called the Office of Congressional Ethics "unfair" but said focusing on it now was a case of misplaced priorities. He appended the hashtag "DTS," an apparent allusion to his promise to "drain the swamp" in Washington. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy had made clear on Monday that they, too, were opposed to the change.
