A White House spokeswoman confirmed to CNN on Tuesday night that Trump spoke to the New York Post and the quotes in the story are accurate and stand for themselves. The President acknowledged the widely reported infighting between Bannon and Trump’s    Jared Kushner, saying he told them to "straighten it out." "Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will," Trump told the newspaper. The first major signs of Bannon’s diminishing stature in the White House came last Wednesday, when he was removed from his permanent seat at the National Security Council.
