we have not in my time picked up someone who is covered by DACA," Kelly told reporters on Capitol Hill after meeting with Senate Democrats in late March.    Congressional reaction, Democrats in Congress immediately seized on the lawsuit, which claims that Montes was apprehended and sent to Mexico within three hours because he did not have his DACA paperwork on him. The lawsuit says that while in Mexico, Montes was assaulted and fearing his life, illegally crossed into the US again, where he was apprehended and detained before being removed once again to Mexico.   If Montes had active DACA status, he would be the first such recipient deported despite the protection.
