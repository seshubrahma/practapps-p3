Gorsuch, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, senators in both parties have been selectively arguing the facts on the jurist and overstating the Senate’s procedural history. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, promised on Sunday that Judge Gorsuch would be confirmed this week, even if it required changing longstanding Senate practice to require only a simple majority vote.
