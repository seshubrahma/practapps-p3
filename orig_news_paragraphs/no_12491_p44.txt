JUNE 18, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, An illegal alien from Britain living with an expired visa, made his way to the Trump rally in Las Vegas last weekend at the Treasure Island Casino, with intentions of assassinating the GOP candidate. Michael Sanford had spent the previous day at a shooting range, where he was given a lesson on how to fire. Feeling confident after firing twenty rounds from a 9mm pistol, Sanford approached an officer the next day asking if he could grab an autograph from Trump.
