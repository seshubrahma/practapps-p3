DEFIANCE, Ohio  —   James Waltimire, a police officer on unpaid medical leave, has been going to the hospital in this small city twice a week for physical therapy after leg surgery, all of it paid for by Medicaid. Mr. Waltimire, 54, was able to sign up for the government health insurance program last year because Ohio expanded it to cover more than 700, 000   adults under the Affordable Care Act. He voted for President Trump  —   in part because of Mr. Trump’s support for law enforcement   —   but is now worried about the Republican plan to effectively end the Medicaid expansion through legislation to repeal the health care law.
