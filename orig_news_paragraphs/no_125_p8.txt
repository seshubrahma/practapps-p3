Timothy Burke, the video director at Deadspin, who regularly monitors 20 to 30 online news feeds from his home in Tampa, Fla. was among the first to comment on Twitter about the sudden interruption. He said he had assumed "somebody just flipped a wrong switch somewhere. " Had Mr. Burke and others who were watching   online at the time not been interrupted, they would have heard Ms. Waters mention Russia and   Donald J. Trump several times before she ended her turn on the floor.
