Sunday on MSNBC’s "AM Joy," actor and director Rob Reiner called Donald Trump’s White House "a cancerous presidency that we cannot allow to spread. "  Reiner said, "What’s interesting here is that we really have a test, and we are being tested as to whether or not our democracy is going to survive. We have somebody who’s mentally unstable, who is a pathological liar. There’s no getting around that, who’s running our country. "
