From The Washington Post:  The operation of the senator from Texas thinks that it has come down to fighting over exactly 9, 131 voters who are trying to decide between Cruz and Trump: 3, 185 who are torn between him and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and a smaller group   —   2, 807, to be precise   —   who have not yet made their choice between him and Rubio. Cruz also must try to peel off supporters of other religious conservatives in the race, including former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.
