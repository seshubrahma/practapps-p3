Figures told the Senate that after the case went to the grand jury, and it "became increasingly apparent that we were going to break the case, Mr. Sessions attitude changed" and that he supported the prosecution. Sessions’s statements to the Senate in 1986 about his supervisory role in the case are more modest than what he and his supporters say today, and while his testimony at the time generally did not directly contradict Figures’s account, Sessions insisted that he did not urge Figures to drop the case. " He asked the FBI to go out and   witnesses, and I concurred in that, or I was aware of it, and they were reinterviewed," Sessions said.
