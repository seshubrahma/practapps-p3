Some American officials had expressed concern that the restrictions would have affected Iraqis who had worked with the American military as interpreters or in other roles and sought to come to the United States. The official said the executive order is expected to be signed on Monday. David Lapan, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, referred all questions about the new executive order to the White House. Mr. Trump’s previous order  —   which temporarily barred visitors from Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya and Yemen  —   set off chaos and confusion at airports around the world.
