A new poll by the Levada Center suggests more than half of Russians think relations with the US will improve under a Trump presidency.   Another Levada Center poll, published in the financial newspaper RBK, says the number of Russians who want better relations with the West is at its highest    71%    since March 2000, the start of the Putin presidency, when 76% expressed that opinion.   Thatâ€™s a big change from a year and a half ago a July 2015 poll found only 50% of Russians wanted closer ties. Moscow, at that point, was struggling against economic sanctions imposed by the US and Europe in response to its annexation of Crimea.
