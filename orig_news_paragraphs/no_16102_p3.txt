Sanders has been seeking policy concessions from Clinton on college tuition    which happened Wednesday, as Clinton rolled out a proposal to make tuition free at   public colleges and universities for those earning less than $125, 000 per year for a family of four. Also on Sanders’ wish list: A commitment on health care to allow those aged 55 and older to buy into Medicare, and concessions in the Democratic platform to oppose the   Partnership, a   trade deal negotiated by President Barack Obama’s administration, even in a   session of Congress before a new president is sworn in.    If the Orlando meeting goes smoothly, people familiar with the talks say, Sanders and Clinton appear to be on track to a joint appearance in New Hampshire on Tuesday.   Plans for that joint appearance could still fall apart, and patience is running thin among some    with Sanders insistent on policy concessions and Clinton aides feeling he’s lingered in the race too long after Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee.
