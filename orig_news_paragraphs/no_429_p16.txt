A spokesman for the organization in Iraq did not respond to a request for comment. There also was confusion on Thursday for Qusay Fawzi Ahmed, 38, a former military interpreter who moved to Tampa, Fla. in 2012, after receiving a special immigrant visa. On Saturday, Mr. Ahmed was awaiting a phone call from his fiancée, Marwa Nasr   who was flying to New York from Iraq with a valid visa in her passport. After years of waiting, she said, she received approval to join her fiancé.
