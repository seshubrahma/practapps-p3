Last month, four academics  —   Jeff Madrick from the Century Foundation, Jon Bakija of Williams College, Lane Kenworthy of the University of California, San Diego, and Peter Lindert of the University of California, Davis   —   published a manual of sorts. It is titled "How Big Should Our Government Be? " (University of California Press).
