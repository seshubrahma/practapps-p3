A man drove a stolen beer truck into a crowd in a popular shopping district in Stockholm, killing three and injuring 15 people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but officials in Sweden were calling it a terrorist attack. And in London, a    Romanian woman who plunged into the Thames during the attack on the Westminster Bridge died of her injuries. European news outlets reported that her boyfriend had been planning to propose on the day of the attack.
