House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said reports of gag orders to the EPA are "just appalling" and that the Trump administration seems "to be happy to be in a   zone. "  Speaking to reporters in the Capitol Wednesday, Pelosi also addressed reports of efforts to take down climate change material on the EPA website, calling such activity a "deterioration of intellectual sources to prevent information to flow."   Jeremy Symons, a former career employee at the EPA who worked through the transition between President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said this sort of information lock down is "unprecedented." "It didnâ€™t happen," Symons, who now works at the Environmental Defense Fund, said when asked whether anything like this happened during the   transition.
