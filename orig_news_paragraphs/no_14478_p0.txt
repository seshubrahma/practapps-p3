Washington (CNN) Congressional Republicans insist they are moving forward on their campaign pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare, but internal divisions over key components mean they will head home for a   recess with few details on how they will overhaul the nationâ€™s health care system. Republicans huddled in the basement of the Capitol for a   meeting Thursday to hear presentations from the two committee leaders leading the effort    Oregon Rep. Greg Walden and Texas Rep. Kevin Brady    who outlined plans to set up tax credits and restructuring how states will administer Medicaid programs that provide coverage for millions.   Members coming out of the meeting continued to stress they were unified on their goal and campaign promise to do away with the Affordable Care Act, but no draft language was was handed out.
