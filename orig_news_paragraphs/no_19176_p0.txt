’    Renowned statistician Nate Silver said on Sunday that a new poll   showing Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson with 24% support in his   home state of New Mexico made the chances of an Electoral College   deadlock "plausible. " ’ ’   Silver wrote  that Johnson had a 2% or 3%   chance of winning the Land of Enchantment. If that were to   happen, and Trump and Clinton were to split on key swing states,   neither of the candidates could reach the necessary 270 electoral   votes needed to secure the presidency.
