The National Popular Vote interstate compact would not take effect until enacted by states possessing a majority of the electoral votes â€”  that is, enough to elect a President (270 of 538). Under the compact, the winner would be the candidate who received the most popular votes from all 50 states (and DC) on Election Day. When the Electoral College meets in   the national popular vote winner would receive all of the electoral votes of the enacting states. I previously reported on the NPV scheme: The NPV campaign seeks to obtain the consent of the majority of the 538 votes in the Electoral College to award electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote instead of the winner of the popular vote in each state.
