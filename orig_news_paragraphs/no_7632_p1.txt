Parker’s   on the film, Jean Celestin, was found guilty of sexually assaulting the same    female, who claimed to be unconscious, after a night of drinking. Celestin appealed the verdict and was granted a new trial in 2005, but the case never made it back to court after the victim decided not to testify again. According to sources, studio executives at Searchlight are assessing the fallout from a fresh round of stories about the incident on prominent news sites and    sites. The studio held a meeting on Monday morning with Parker’s team, and they are considering not granting new interviews with Parker from now until the movie debuts at the Toronto Film Festival in September.
