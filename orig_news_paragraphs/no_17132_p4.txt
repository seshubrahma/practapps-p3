Cuomo also vowed to set up a legal defense fund for immigrants who fear prosecution under a Trump administration. He said the fund would be the first of its kind.   The plan, he said, would be to set up a   partnership "to provide immigrants who canâ€™t afford their own defense the legal assistance they need . .. because in New York, we believe in justice for all," Cuomo said.
