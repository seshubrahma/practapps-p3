" I think itâ€™s very strange, and probably inappropriate, to have a political adviser, someone whose job is to talk politics to the President, sitting in the Situation Room and weighing in on the most consequential national security," said Sullivan in his first interview since the election. The former Obama administration official allowed that a president should get to decide who advises him, but that going to Bannon for national security advice constituted "bad judgment." "It reflects a wrong priority to place weight on what a political adviser says rather than on your military and intelligence professionals," Sullivan said.
