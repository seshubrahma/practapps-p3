Obama said the sanctions would impact "The GRU and the FSB, two Russian intelligence services four individual officers of the GRU and three companies that provided material support to the GRUâ€™s cyber operations. " " These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U. S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior," President Obama said in a statement.
