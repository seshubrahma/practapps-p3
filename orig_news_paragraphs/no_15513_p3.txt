Comey claimed in the memo that Trump said "I hope you can let this go," referring to the Flynn probe, according to CNN sources who described the document. Multiple White House officials refuted the claim on Tuesday, including one who said a "conversation of that nature" did not happen. " While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn," a White House official said in a statement.
