Talk radio host and Fox News Channel anchor Sean Hannity declared a New York Times piece about his position on immigration reform and the Gang of Eight was "a   lie" and added that he was "getting pissed off at [GOP presidential candidate Florida Senator] Marco Rubio too" over his performance during the debate and on the trail during his radio show on Monday.   Hannity began by talking about the NYT article. He stated that other talk radio hosts, such as Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, and Laura Ingraham wouldnâ€™t change their principled opinions on any issue. He further said that in 20 years at FNC he had never been told what position to take on a single issue, including immigration.
