Do we really want judges making national security decisions? I think the Constitution and the statutes do give presidents broad powers over immigration. We liked that during President Obamaâ€™s term. I believe the ban is vulnerable on religious discrimination grounds, but it seems to me that people outside the U. S. do not have any Constitutional rights (unless they have visas or green cards which do give them some rights).
