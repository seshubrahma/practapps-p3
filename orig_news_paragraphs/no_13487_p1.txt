Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, appeared with three alleged sexual assault victims of former President Bill Clinton in the hours before he debates Clinton’s wife, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, here at Washington University.    The women —   Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick —  have each leveled various charges against Bill Clinton. They also each have charged that Hillary Clinton was an "enabler" of Bill Clinton’s behavior in exclusive interviews with Breitbart News’ Aaron Klein published on Sunday.
