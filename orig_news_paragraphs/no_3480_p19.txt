percent said they want no additional refugees above the 1, 500, and 29 percent declined to answer the poll, indicating quiet opposition to greater inflows. An August 2016 poll of 2, 061 adults showed that:  three in ten Americans overall (36%) support taking in refugees from Syria. A majority of Democrats (56%) support admitting Syrian refugees in contrast only minorities of Republicans (18%) and Independents (32%) agree. These skeptical attitudes, however, are balanced with Americans’ decent emotional welcome for most individual immigrants, and with their gratitude for the nation’s generous history of immigration and support for constitutional rights.
