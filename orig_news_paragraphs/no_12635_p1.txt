It’s another reason to lay blame for this chaotic primary season squarely at the feet of the Republican Party hierarchy, which was blindsided by a populist surge it should have seen coming long ago, and should have absorbed instead of rejecting it. Alas, the Party bosses and GOP donor class were too busy smashing the Tea Party movement to learn anything from it. The many complaints that Trump is erratic on his core issues, or is too easily distracted from them, only highlight how thoroughly the rest of the Party has neglected those issues.    It was absurdly easy for Trump to breeze into the Republican Primary, pick up the immigration issue, and become the instant   while the Establishment’s   evangelist Jeb Bush spent millions and went nowhere.
