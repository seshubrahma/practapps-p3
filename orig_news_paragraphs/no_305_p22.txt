As is standard with every transition, the outgoing administration, in coordination with the incoming one, requested all politically appointed officers submit letters of resignation," Mark Toner, the department’s acting spokesman, said in a statement, adding: "Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the foreign service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service. " The most senior official to leave is Patrick F. Kennedy, the department’s longtime undersecretary for management, who oversees finances, security, facilities and consular services. But his departure had been expected, in part because of his vigorous defense of   of State Hillary’s Clinton’s handling of the attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
