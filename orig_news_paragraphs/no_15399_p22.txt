ads claim Quist wants a national gun registry, something Quist denies. Quist said he would like to limit fully automatic rifles but strongly supports the 2nd Amendment, rolling out his own ad showing him shooting the negative GOP ad with his familyâ€™s rifle.   The Washington Free Beacon posted a report that Quist performed at a nudist colony.   Quist confirmed to CNN that he did    but that he performed completely clothed.
