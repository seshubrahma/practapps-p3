Also on Wednesday, 4th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Theodore Chuang, another Harvard Law School graduate Obama appointee and former bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, issued a similar ruling. Though Chuang did not strike down President Trumpâ€™s statutory and Constitutional authority to limit the number of refugees on Wednesday, he did schedule a March 29 hearing  on plaintiffs motion to enjoin the "specific provision of the First Executive Order [Section 5 d of Executive Order 13679]" in which the president set the annual refugee limit for FY 2017 at 50, 000. " The Court will resolve that Motion, which the parties have agreed should be construed to apply to the successor provision of the Second Executive Order [13780]  in accordance with the previously established schedule," Chuang wrote in his decision.
