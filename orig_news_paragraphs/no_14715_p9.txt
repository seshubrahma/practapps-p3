Multiple former senior US officials have dismissed Trump’s allegations, however, calling them "nonsense" and "false. " Obama, through a spokesman, also rejected the claim that he ordered Trump’s phones tapped. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, a career intelligence official who had oversight of the US intelligence community in that role, said Sunday that Trump was not wiretapped by intelligence agencies nor did the FBI obtain a court order through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor Trump’s phones.
