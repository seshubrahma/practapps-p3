Mr. Peña Nieto’s finance minister has said that under no circumstances would Mexico pay for a border wall. Andrew Selee, the executive vice president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a Mexico expert, said Mexico’s motivation to invite Mr. Trump might simply have been pragmatic. " I think the Mexican government wants channels with whoever is going to be president of the U. S. next, and Trump is a legitimate candidate," Mr. Selee said.
