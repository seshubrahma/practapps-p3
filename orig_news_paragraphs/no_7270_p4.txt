My friend Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal wrote in December, months before the first primary votes had been cast: "Let us now pledge to elect Hillary Clinton as the 45th president of the United States. " Stephens meant that somewhat facetiously, but has since reiterated that "the only hope for a conservative restoration is a blowout Hillary Clinton victory. "
