The widest differences are generational, with Sanders the overwhelming choice of voters under age 30 and Clinton preferred by a    margin among Democratic primary voters age 65 or older. There are also big differences between registered Democrats, who favor Clinton by nine points, and   intending to vote in the Democratic presidential primary, who are now backing Sanders two to one. The challenge for Sanders is that independent voters must request a special ballot to vote for Sanders. Many may forget to do so.
