Stem cell research, Price has been outspoken against research that involves embryonic stem cells. In 2005, Price spoke with Georgiaâ€™s Athens   newspaper about the "ethical dilemma" of stem cell research. Embryonic stem cells, which have the potential to treat myriad medical conditions, are controversial because they derive from early embryos. The cells are of interest for research because they have the potential to develop into many different cell types, and so scientists believe they can be used to generate cells and tissues that could be used for   therapies.
