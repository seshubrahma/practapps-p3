Actress Debra Messing unloaded on fellow actress Susan Sarandon this week after Sarandon said in an interview that she wouldn’t necessarily vote for Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton if her chief rival Bernie Sanders does not win the nomination.   In an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes on Monday, Sarandon said that she is going to "see what happens" if Sanders falls to Clinton in the primary, indicating she may not vote for Clinton in the general election. " You know, some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately," Sarandon told Hayes.
