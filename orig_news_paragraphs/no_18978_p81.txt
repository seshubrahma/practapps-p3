Round up all   these incredibly, really smart and sophisticated investors who   have made billions of dollars and get them talking about a   relatively complex social issue and they sound like idiots! ’ "    They give money to Harvard or Stanford because all their friends   pat them on the back, they get their name on a prestigious   building, and they get associated with all of the incredible   brand value of those institutions, but they haven’t thought,   clearly, about the social justice implications of what they’re   doing. And they get uncomfortable when someone says, well wait a   minute, you have not thought as seriously about your philanthropy   as you have about your investment decisions
