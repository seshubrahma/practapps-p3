As one Michigan legislator noted, "This lemon of a recount may turn into lemonade from the standpoint of helping us firm up the integrity of the voting process. " The general speculation about "election integrity," without any actual evidence to support it, is thus emboldening Michigan Republicans to enact a law that will have negative effects on the right to vote. If reliable evidence does come out showing the Russians hacked our voting machines in addition to seeking to influence the campaign, then we should certainly take appropriate corrective action.
