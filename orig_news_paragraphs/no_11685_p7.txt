The scandal raised serious questions about Luntzâ€™s impartiality in conducting his Fox News   focus groups, especially in light of a ridiculously   focus group that he conducted right before the Iowa caucus. National Journal picked up the story in a feature entitled "Luntz Plays Favorites With Marco Rubio. " Luntz admitted to his conflict of interest with Rubio in an interview in which he also dished out profane insults to this reporter. At a Fox News debate in Detroit, Luntz spotted this reporter near the stairwell of the press room and became visibly flustered, angrily muttering about "Trump" and instructing his journalist friends to walk with him, away from my earshot.
