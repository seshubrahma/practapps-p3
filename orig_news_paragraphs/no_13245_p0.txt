House Democrats fear that they are losing white,   voters due to the partyâ€™s shift toward urban and suburban voters. [Although Democrats gained six seats in the House, they lost all 12 Republican districts they targeted with white,   educated voters mostly by   margins and almost suffered surprise losses in their own districts with the most   whites, Politico reports.   Many of those white,   districts have been redrawn after 2010 to make it tougher for Democrats to win in those areas and have only gotten worse since then. Rep. Tim Ryan ( ) one of the few remaining Democrats from those areas, launched a challenge against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, citing the need to change things up if the Democrats want to take the majority.
