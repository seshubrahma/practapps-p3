Last week, the "landing team" of Trump designees told several of the department’s most senior diplomats  —   career officials, some with decades of service  —   to clear out of their offices. Almost all had submitted their resignations, the protocol when administrations changed, but had volunteered to stay on for a month or two until successors were appointed, to ensure that State Department facilities were safe, American citizens were evacuated from perilous places and passports were issued. The Trump team made it clear it had no interest in transitions. (Mr. Tillerson also never met    with his predecessor, John Kerry, before the inauguration.)
