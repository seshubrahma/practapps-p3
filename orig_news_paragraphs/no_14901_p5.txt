The vote count has been tight. According to CNNâ€™s ongoing whip count, as of Wednesday night, 24 House Republicans have   said they will vote against the bill, while four more have indicated they are likely to oppose it. With so much on the line, Trump, White House officials and Republican leaders have been lobbying their colleagues all week. On Wednesday, Trump even personally called individual members of the Freedom Caucus just as a possible deal was emerging.
