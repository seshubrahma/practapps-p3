In his first live "Late Show" broadcast since the start of the Republican National Convention, Stephen Colbert promised the return of an old friend from his   days, but instead, viewers got to see two familiar faces: first, Jon Stewart, the longtime host of "The Daily Show," and then "Stephen Colbert," the unctuous conservative commentator that Mr. Colbert portrayed for nearly a decade on his Comedy Central program, "The Colbert Report. " The guest appearances from Mr. Stewart and that other Mr. Colbert appear to have paid off for "The Late Show. " According to preliminary ratings information on Tuesday, "The Late Show" was the No. 1 broadcast   show in overall viewership on Monday night, the first time the program has surpassed all its competitors (including Jimmy Fallonâ€™s "Tonight" show on NBC and "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on ABC) since Feb. 15.
