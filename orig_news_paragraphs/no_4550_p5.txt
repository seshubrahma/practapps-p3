Echoing Gen. Townsend, the CENTCOM chief told House lawmakers, "There is a fair chance that our operations may have contributed to civilian casualties [in Mosul]. But I would highlight to each of you that this investigation continues, and there is still much to learn from this. " Gen. Votel noted that the U. S. had assigned a general officer to dig up the facts of the incident and help the American military address the situation, adding: While we consider and establish accountability over our actions in this incident, I think is also important to clearly recognize that the enemy does use human shields, has little regard for human life and does attempt to use civilian casualty allegations as a tool to hinder our operations.
