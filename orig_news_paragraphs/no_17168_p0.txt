Shanghai (CNN) On Monday, Donald Trump indicated he would follow through on campaign trail promises to scrap the   Partnership, announcing plans to pull out of the controversial trade deal in his first 100 days in office.   Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that without the US, the deal "is meaningless."   While trade is likely to dominate Trumpâ€™s immediate relations with Asia,   strategic US interests are most challenged by a rising China that is increasingly staking out its interests in the South China Sea and Africa by setting up military bases and reclaiming islands.
