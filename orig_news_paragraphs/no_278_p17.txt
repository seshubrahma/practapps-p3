To put it again in TV terms, Mr. Trump won by   rather than broadcasting. He identified a key demographic in the right markets and successfully targeted it. His margin of victory in the decisive states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin was just over 77, 000 votes combined, around the average audience of the   NBC Universo channel. This is a perfectly valid strategy, in politics and in TV.
