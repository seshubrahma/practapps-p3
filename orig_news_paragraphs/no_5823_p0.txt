Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s "America’s News HQ," Sen. Orrin Hatch ( ) the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, reacted to delay tactics from Senate Democrats to slow the confirmation of President Donald Trump’s cabinet appointees, which included boycotting committee votes to force Republicans to suspend the rules in order to proceed to a floor vote.   Hatch noted the action was unprecedented and referred to the Democrats as "juvenile idiots. " " My gosh, first time in my history and the history of the Finance Committee that Democrats even refuse to show up for hearings and for markup," Hatch said.
