On Friday, asked about Trump’s upcoming inauguration, Hua said: We would like to join hands with the new US administration to uphold the principles of     mutual respect and   cooperation, deepen communication and dialogue, build up mutual trust, respect and accommodate each other’s core interests and major concerns, properly deal with sensitive issues and disputes in constructive ways, expand bilateral cooperation on bilateral, regional and global issues across the board, and propel further development of   ties at a new staring point. Trump has repeatedly stated that he does not think that the "One China" policy, which demands other nations ignore Taiwan’s sovereignty, should remain in effect unquestioned. He has also engaged in    communications with Taiwanese President Tsai   breaking   precedent and infuriating China. While the Foreign Ministry has kept its tone civil, however, Chinese state media has not.
