Anne penned the short poem in a notebook belonging to her friend Jacqueline van Maarsenâ€™s older sister, Christiane. The work is dated March 1942, just a few months before Anne, her older sister, her parents and another family went into hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam. Only her father survived the Holocaust. Only a few of her writings aside from the diary she kept while in hiding have emerged.
