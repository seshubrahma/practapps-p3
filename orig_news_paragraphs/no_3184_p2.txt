Last month, a   blogger made the same false claim, which was thoroughly debunked by Breitbart News (where Gorka was once an editor) and others. The Forward now claims Gorka once pledged loyalty to the Historical Vitézi Rend, a racist rival to the Vitézi Rend, which is a postwar anticommunist organization. (The word "historical" was added to allude to the original Vitézi Rend, which was   by Hungary’s   government and later banned.) Gorka denies it all.
