It should be kept in mind that the survey reports welfare use for all Middle Eastern refugees who arrived in the last five years, not just new arrivals. Many refugees get RMA and RCA, but then transition to Medicaid and other cash programs like TANF or SSI after the   eligibility window for RMA and RCA runs out. So, for example, use of TANF is likely lower for the first eight months than the 36. 7 percent reported above. To be sure, some refugees access cash welfare or Medicaid in the first eight months.
