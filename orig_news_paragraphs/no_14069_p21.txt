That’s what we’ve all lost in this election, the ability to truly listen to one another and work together to find common ground. Feeling listened to and understood is critical to changing someone’s opinion. I wrote many months ago that a large number of people who voted for Trump weren’t voting for him, they were voting against Washington, the media and the elitism that had been a chaff for so many years.   We all need to do a better job listening and working together.
