A congressional source familiar with the committee’s probe tells CNN that the House intelligence committee issued a total of seven subpoenas today. Four of the subpoenas were issued on the Russia probe and three others were issued seeking information on "unmasking," the identification of US citizens picked up during surveillance of foreign nationals.   Trump tweeted Thursday morning that "the big story is the ’unmasking and surveillance’ of people that took place during the Obama administration," a point he’s made previously as the investigation into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia has accelerated. A source close to Flynn said Tuesday that the former national security adviser would comply with a series of Senate subpoenas issued for documents from Flynn and his businesses.
