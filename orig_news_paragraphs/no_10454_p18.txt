Caddell said he is confused by Reuters’ motivation. Writing to explain the change in Reuters poll calculations, Maurice Tamman, the leader of the news service ’s New York   data mining and investigatory reporting team said respondents in the "Year of Neither" were using the Neither option to avoid revealing a decision they had actually made. When events, such as a party’s national convention, compel the Neither respondents to step forward with their actual choice it creates swings in the poll results that Tamman said suggest shifts in opinion that were actually a result of respondents hiding in Neither.
