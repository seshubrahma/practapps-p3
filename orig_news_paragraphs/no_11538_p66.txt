When Cruz refers to the Gang of Eightâ€™s amnesty plan as the "  amnesty plan," the crowd boos. Cruz points out that the donor class that supports Rubio hates it and that is why they booed. The crowd cheers Rubio when he says Cruz is now a passionate opponent of amnesty when he supported an increase in green cards, etc. Rubio says Cruz is not a "purist" on amnesty.
