The resolution, proposed by Britain and France months ago and endorsed by the United States last week, would have imposed sanctions on a handful of Syrian military officials and entities for having dropped   barrel bombs on   areas on at least three occasions in 2014 and 2015, according to a United Nations panel. Russia’s envoy, Vladimir Safronkov, defended the veto, calling the resolution "politically biased" and asserting that Russia’s concerns about the draft language had not been addressed. " This is railroading the draft by the Western troika," he said.
