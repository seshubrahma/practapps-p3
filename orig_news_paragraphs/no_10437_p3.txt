Last month, Abbott Labs informed 180 of its   workers that they would be laid off. The company has signed a contract with Indian outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd. that will take over the employeesâ€™ jobs. According to reports, the workers, before their exit from the company on April 22, are required to train their   foreign replacements to do their jobs. Abbott also uses the   visa program to outsource jobs to foreign workers.
