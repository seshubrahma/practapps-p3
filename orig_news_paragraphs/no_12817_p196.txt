—   Alice Stewart (@alicetweet) February 1, 2016,   Barack Obama gamed the caucuses brilliantly in 2008. His supporters cut a deal with Bill Richardson’s supporters —  and the Clintons still not have forgiven the former New Mexico Governor and U. N. Ambassador for those shenanigans. Obama supporters also kept some candidates viable at certain caucus locations (ensuring they had 15% support in the room) if they thought their supporters would go to Hillary Clinton.
