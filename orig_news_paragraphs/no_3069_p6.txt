Sen. Lindsey Graham  —   an early critic of Trump’s Russia policy   —   said as much on Sunday, when he speculated that an intercepted message from the Russian ambassador to his bosses back home, claiming that Jared Kushner wanted to set up a "back channel," could well have been a   exposed on purpose to be intercepted by the U. S. Regardless, Trump is almost certainly right that the Russians are "laughing" at us. The entire political and media establishment is utterly consumed by an obsession with Russian influence for which there is no actual evidence.
