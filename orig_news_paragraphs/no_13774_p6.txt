If those three were to step out of the race Ward stands a better chance to succeed in the August 30 Republican primary election. Ward has gained considerably on McCain from a PPP poll one year ago in which the then far lesser known Ward lost to McCain   compared to the    tie between the two in the recent poll. The Schlafly endorsement lends a greatly influential endorsement to Ward in her pursuit to retire the   senator McCain, known better to Democratic Party presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton as her favorite republican. Schlafly recently endorsed presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.
