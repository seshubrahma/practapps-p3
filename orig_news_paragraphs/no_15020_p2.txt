" Lemon’s social message was in response to an earlier tweet from the rival cable news host, one in which O’Reilly claimed Monday’s edition of "CNN Tonight" failed to cover a recent story surrounding Susan Rice and alleged improper handling of national intelligence. The O’Reilly post pushed audiences to a short snippet of a Lemon segment from the previous evening, a clip featuring the anchor’s pledge to not "aid and abet" those trying to misinform the American people through claims that Donald Trump or his team had been surveilled, or spied upon. Though the video was paired with a description suggesting Lemon had "declared his show a   zone," content from the program suggests otherwise.
