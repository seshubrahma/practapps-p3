(Read the review.) ‘THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD’ By Colson Whitehead (Doubleday). In this haunting novel, Mr. Whitehead turns the Underground Railroad from a metaphor into an actual train that ferries fugitives north. In doing so, he’s written a potent, hallucinatory novel that leaves us with a devastating understanding of the terrible human costs of slavery.
