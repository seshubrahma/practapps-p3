The   Republicans gave him his first win in New Hampshire, and later, they put him over the top. This could just be the result of a simple analytical error: conflating opposition to ideologically consistent conservatives with an affinity for   candidates. Or perhaps they would have voted against Mr. Trump if someone other than Mr. Cruz had been the principal opponent to Mr. Trump. Either way, I thought the party’s establishment could count on these voters, and instead they were among Mr. Trump’s strongest backers in the end.
