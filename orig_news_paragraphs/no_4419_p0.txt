Thursday on Fox News Channel’s "Hannity," conservative commentator Ann Coulter, author of "In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome! " took aim at what she described as "beta males" behind what could be "Rodney King riots" staged to protest a speech she has pledged to give next week at the University of California in Berkeley, CA.   After having her speech canceled by   officials due to safety concerns and then only to have those same officials propose an alternate date for her speech, Coulter dismissed the claim security as a reason for any cancellation.
