Clinton won white college educated women 51% to Trump’s 45% according to those same polls. Clinton led among independent women but only by a   margin. It was a stunning conclusion to a race where the first female nominee of a major party was matched with a candidate who has made the most sexist, misogynistic comments of any nominee to run for president in recent memory. Women typically make up 52 to 53% of the electorate in presidential years, but Clinton’s allies and advisers realized early on that the   nature of her candidacy was not generating much excitement among voters    certainly not in the same way that electing the first   president had galvanized Democratic voters around Barack Obama in 2008.
