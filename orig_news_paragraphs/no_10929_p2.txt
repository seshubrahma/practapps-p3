The wild card here is Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president whom Ryan has used his position as Speaker of the House to undermine whenever he can. A majority of those surveyed, 52 percent, view Trump as favorable while just 32 percent view Trump as unfavorable and 16 percent have no opinion. The poll isn’t good news for Nehlen who —  despite scarce polling in the district that has usually been bad for him and good for Ryan —  has put Ryan on his heels politically throughout the course of the campaign. Nehlen’s campaign has forced Speaker Ryan to change his position on the Trans Pacific Partnership and publicly claim that he supports border security even though he opposes building Trump’s wall on the border.
