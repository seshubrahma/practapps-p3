According to the New Hampshire exit polls, a full 66% of Republican voters back a "ban on Muslims from entering the U. S. " This obviously is good news for Donald Trump, who proposed a temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the country until our government is in a better position to avoid another Sacramento terror attack. The female jihadist who committed that terror attack was here on a fianc√©e visa.   By all accounts, Trump made this proposal based only on his instincts, not any kind of focus group polling.
