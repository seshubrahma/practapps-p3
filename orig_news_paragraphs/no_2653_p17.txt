Mr. Rosengren, a longtime proponent of the Fedâ€™s stimulus campaign, has become increasingly concerned that the Fed, by waiting too long to raise rates, will need to move more sharply, a pattern that often ends in a recession. The last time three Fed officials dissented from a policy decision was nearly two years ago. Two reserve bank presidents wanted Ms. Yellen to move more quickly to tighten policy, while one dissented in favor of moving more slowly. Notwithstanding the debate about when to take the next step, Fed officials are increasingly agreed that they will not be raising rates for very long.
