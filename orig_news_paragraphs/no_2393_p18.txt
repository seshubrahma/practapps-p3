Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt. Best of all, it did not matter if the actual market value of the stock was considerably less than the $40 million in canceled debt.
