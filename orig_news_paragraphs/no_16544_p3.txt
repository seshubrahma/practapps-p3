That’s deceptive.   Lincoln’s Republican party    and its opposition Democratic party    were the polar opposites of today’s parties that carry those same names. If Trump really wanted to embrace the Party of Lincoln, he would have to support the Reconstruction policies that won freed blacks’ support in the 19th century. He would have to be for federal intervention to ensure equal protection, for expanding voting rights, and for public education.
