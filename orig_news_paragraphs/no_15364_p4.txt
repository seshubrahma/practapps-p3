Military hospitals are considered the same as a military base, so security and patient privacy concerns require that any donation of any outside items by   groups be reviewed and distributed with chaplains overseeing religious matters. And no outside group can enter a hospital or a patients room without permission, according to defense officials. But that doesn’t mean service members there can’t receive religious items. Indeed, service members have the option of declaring their faith in their personnel records so chaplains of that religion can ensure they get whatever religious items or services they wish.
