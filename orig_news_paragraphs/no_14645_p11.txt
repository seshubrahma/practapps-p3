In the emotional high point of the speech, Trump turned to the first ladyâ€™s box and acknowledged Carryn Owens, the widow of a US Navy Special operator, William "Ryan" Owens, who was killed in an   raid in Yemen in the first major military engagement of the new administration. Van Jones: The moment Trump became President, "Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero    battling against terrorism and securing our nation," Trump said as the House floor erupted in a prolonged standing ovation. Owens, with tears streaming down her face, looked to the Heavens and joined in the applause.
