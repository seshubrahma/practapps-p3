Moore released his TrumpLand film last month with almost no advance warning, to middling reviews. The film is based on a   play about the election that the progressive activist performed over the course of two nights at a small theater in a heavily Republican corner of Ohio. Shortly after the film premiered, a clip in which Moore discusses Donald Trumpâ€™s appeal to   Americans went viral online, helped in part by Trump himself, leading some to believe the the filmmaker was backing the Republican candidate for the presidency. Moore has repeatedly predicted that Trump will win the election.
