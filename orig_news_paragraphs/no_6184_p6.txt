A fresh poll from Seton Hall surveyed 841 adults across the U. S. Each respondent was asked to identify seven separate factors as a reason for the NFL rating drop, allowing them to answer "yes" or "no" for each of them.

But, Cote says don’t worry about that, because the "closer to patriotic" Kaepernick says he’s done with kneeling during the National Anthem.
