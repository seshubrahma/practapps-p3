Some Democrats will be quick to note that Tom Price, the congressman whose departure to join the administration created the   vacancy, won   last year by more than 20 points. Others, however, will suggest, given the national spotlight, that comparing Ossoff’s performance to Clinton’s strong showing would make for a more accurate assessment. Democrats are also sure to argue that, win or lose, requiring the GOP to dedicate gobs of money to defending a district that House Speaker Newt Gingrich once called home should be cause for hope. Others    along with every Republican who feels like chatting (or tweeting)    will note the Democrats’ own massive investment, and either rage or chuckle at what that spending got in return.
