Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told CNN Sessions "should further clarify his testimony. " Rep. Darrell Issa,   said "we need a   view of what the Russians actually did so that all Americans can have faith in our institutions." "Jeff Sessions is a former colleague and a friend, but I think it would be best for him  for the country to recuse himself from the DOJ Russia probe," said Sen. Rob Portman,   in a statement.
