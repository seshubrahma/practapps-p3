Formed in 2013, the   party Alternative for Germany (AfD) was initially galvanized into action by what it saw as Merkel’s bungled handling of the eurozone crisis    specifically the multiple Greek bailouts.

AfD contributed to defeats for Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union in Berlin and her home state of   during regional elections this year. Among the top issues for voters: rising rents, increasing gentrification and refugees.
