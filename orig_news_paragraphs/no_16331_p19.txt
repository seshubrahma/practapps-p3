Obama additionally offered a survey of diverse military operations around the world, including the fight to support the Afghan government in its civil war with the Taliban and a growing ISIS presence. He also mentioned the latest expansion of   operations in Libya as government forces there try to take back the city of Sirte from the radical Islamic group. No ransom, Obama also forcibly denied that his administration had effectively paid a ransom to Iran after delivering $400 million of a $1. 7 billion payment to settle a   dispute over an arms deal on the same day that four US prisoners were freed in January.
