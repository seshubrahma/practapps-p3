Investigators also found screen shots from an epilepsy website with a list of commonly reported epilepsy seizure triggers and a story from a Dallas news site about Eichenwaldâ€™s efforts to subpoena Twitter to track down the user who sent him the image, according to the affidavit.   Since the first incident, "More than 40 ppl sent strobes once they found out they could trigger seizures," Eichenwald tweeted. " Stop sending them," he wrote.
