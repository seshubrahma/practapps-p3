Known as ’Woody’ CNN was attempting to reach a representative for the Kaine family and was not immediately successful.   Miryam Lipper, a spokeswoman for the senator, gave a statement to the Pioneer Press in St. Paul. " Today’s announcement of misdemeanor charges against Sen. Kaine’s son contains no suggestion that he engaged in disruptive behavior while at the rally, but are instead focused on his actions as he was arrested after he left," Lipper said.
