Brussels (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday will attend his first NATO summit alongside the 27 other members of the military alliance and join in the opening ceremony of the group’s new headquarters in Brussels. The day’s events are highly anticipated after his election last November shook members of the NATO military alliance, since as a candidate he repeatedly decried the military alliance. Calling it "obsolete," Trump said its members weren’t paying their fair share and cast doubt on US commitment to defending NATO allies should they come under attack     one of the alliance’s central tenets.
