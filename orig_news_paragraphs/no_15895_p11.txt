Shortly after the incident, the pair addressed a packed House chamber, calling for unity and condemning the attack. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed Pelosi and Ryan’s calls for unity. " We want everybody to know that we’ve always had a robust discussion of the issues in this country throughout our history," McConnell told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday in a joint interview with Schumer.
