Washington (CNN) CNN political commentator Scottie Nell Hughes on Saturday criticized Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine for speaking in Spanish, saying it contrasted with this week’s Republican convention in which "I didn’t have to get a translator. " Hughes, who supports Donald Trump, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on "CNN Newsroom" that Kaine’s appearance with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Miami    in which her VP pick frequently spoke in Spanish    highlighted the differences between the Republican and Democratic parties.
