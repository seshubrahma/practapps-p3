The political battle in 2016 is between those who believe America is great and can be much greater once again, and those that believe America is a force for evil that must be apologised for, torn apart and rebuilt. Between the whiny, unsatisfiable and dishonest establishment feminism of Hillary Clinton and the bold optimism and resolve of Donald Trump. Daddy Trumpâ€™s embracing of the American spirit is what has attracted so many independents and moderate Democrats to his cause. He is making it okay for Americans to say "we are the best" in public without being made to feel bigoted or worse.
