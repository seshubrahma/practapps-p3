A person is a natural born citizen for purposes of Article II if he was a citizen the moment he was born. Cruz was born to an American mother, and therefore both under the laws of this nation’s founding, and also the laws in effect when he was born in 1970, he is a natural born citizen of the United States. There may be other arguments, both legal and political. But it is important to note that an originalist argument —  as opposed to originalist arguments narrowly construed by critics of originalism —  does indeed provide a very strong case for Cruz’s eligibility under the Natural Born Clause.
