If we do not get some   from the Russians on reducing the violence and easing the humanitarian crisis, then it’s difficult to see how we get to the next phase," the president said after a meeting with the British prime minister, Theresa May, in Hangzhou. Whatever progress Mr. Kerry has made, officials said, could easily be unraveled by external events, whether a new offensive by Turkey or the Nusra Front  —   which until recently had publicly aligned itself with Al Qaeda   —   or intensified bombing raids by the government of President Bashar  . And it is clearer than ever that if Mr. Kerry’s latest attempt at diplomacy falls short, there is no Plan B. Mr. Obama, officials said, has become increasingly skeptical about one of the major fallback options advanced by officials in the administration: expanding military aid to rebels vetted by the United States to put more pressure on Mr. Assad to compromise.
