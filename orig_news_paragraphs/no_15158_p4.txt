Republicans know they will need Democratic votes in both chambers to keep the government operating. House conservatives who may be dissatisfied with the emerging deal    like those that make up the   and influential House Freedom Caucus    are unlikely to support a final agreement. That means Speaker Paul Ryan,   will need to lean on Democrats in his chamber to muscle a bill to passage.    In the Senate, the 52 Republicans will need to rely on at least eight Democrats to support the measure to give it the 60 votes it will need to advance.
