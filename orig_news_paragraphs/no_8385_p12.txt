I am a woman and I have been accused of being a feminist from one time or another, and I think suggesting that we support her just because she is a woman is an anathema to the whole point of having equality. It is no longer making her equal, it is making her some shinny new object that we should just vote for because she has a different chromosome then everybody else, and that exactly what we should not be doing. That is not a conversation we should be having.
