After taping an interview on "The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon " Thursday afternoon, Trump flew out of New York, while pool reporters were left behind in Manhattan traffic, leaving on their press plane from New Jersey. Upset, some of the traveling press tried to "boycott" the rally by refusing to cover it, but network management told them that wasnâ€™t an option. Some took to Twitter to rail against the GOP nominee for leaving them behind.
