After all, we’ve somehow just elected a president who has spent most of his life in the public eye, demonstrating how little he values women ’s humanity, and who all but corroborated   allegations against him by bragging that, as a rich and famous man, he could "grab [women] by the pussy," with zero consequences. Amid the instant flood of accounts of hate speech, swastika grafitti, and assaults on Muslim and black citizens, reports are coming in from women around the country who have been sexually harassed and groped by men who tell them with glee and menace that they live in Trump’s America now. Did I say it’s a good time for this show?
