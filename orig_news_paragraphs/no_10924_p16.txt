Trump said that "six months ago, the two of us were building hotels around the world and having a really great time" and his dad, unlike many of the candidates who are running for president, "doesn’t need this job, but he wants to help America" because the country "has provided him so many opportunities. " Eric Trump pointed out that other candidates "need this job" because "if they don’t win this race, for all intents and purposes, they don’t have a job" since they are "career politicians" while his dad is someone who, because he comes from outside of the political system and is beholden to nobody, will cut "through the nonsense and get things done. "
