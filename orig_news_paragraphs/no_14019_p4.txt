Dove read her poem, "Lady Freedom Among Us," at the bicentennial of the laying of the cornerstone of the Capitol in 1993. Poets have been, for some inauguration watchers, a part of the spectacle of the occasion since Robert Frost, the first poet to appear at the ceremony, read for John F. Kennedy’s   in 1961. And yet, according to inaugural historian Jim Bendat, it hasn’t been a consistent feature of the day. Only Democrats    Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama    have had a poet read from the steps of the Capitol.
