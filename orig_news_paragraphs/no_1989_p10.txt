Ignoring American efforts to destroy the Islamic State, Mr. Putin said the problem of international terrorism "is being solved by our servicemen in Syria," where Russian warplanes have helped President Bashar   regain control of large sections of Aleppo, once Syria’s biggest city, from rebels, some of whom are supported by the United States. A new foreign policy doctrine signed by Mr. Putin on Thursday underscored the problems with Russia’s relations with the West and set a high bar for any swift easing of tensions. The doctrine, a summary of how Moscow sees the world and what it wants, stressed the gravity of "the serious crisis between Russia and the West" and blamed this on "geopolitical expansion" by NATO and the European Union.
