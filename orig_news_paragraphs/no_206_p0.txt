  celebrities may be staying away from Donald J. Trump’s inauguration on Friday, but a large number of religious leaders will take part in the ceremony, reading Scripture and offering prayers for his administration. Six religious leaders  —   including a rabbi, a cardinal, and a diverse group of Protestant preachers   —   will participate, more than for any previous president, said Jim Bendat, an author and historian of inaugural ceremonies. Each will have 60 to 90 seconds to offer a reading or lead a prayer.
