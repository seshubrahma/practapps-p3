South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley stated that while Republican presidential candidate Florida Senator Marco Rubio isn’t "for amnesty " she is "against his Gang of Eight bill" on Wednesday’s "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren" on the Fox News Channel.   Haley said that during her response to the State of the Union, "I was talking about a lot of people, certainly Mr. Trump was one of them, but you know, what we learned last year in Charleston was, we went through a lot of challenges, but the way we got through the Walter Scott issue, the way we got through the Mother Emanuel issue, the way we got through the 1, 000 year flood was by listening to each other, by making sure that we heard what everyone needed, and then getting there. And so I just worry when we get irresponsible with the way that we talk, our goal is to make everyone feel welcome.
