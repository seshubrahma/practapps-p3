US satellites have watched a test site for several weeks and seen fresh signs of digging and activity at tunnel entrances. The commercial website 38 North recently posted satellite imagery showing continuing activity at the   nuclear test site indicating the area was ready for an underground test as soon as one is ordered by Kim.
