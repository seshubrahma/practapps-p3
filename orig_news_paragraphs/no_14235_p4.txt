Democrats ready for Gorsuch battle on Capitol Hill, The court has been operating with eight justices since the sudden death last February of Justice Antonin Scalia. If confirmed, Gorsuch would continue the ideological balance that existed before Scalia’s death, with four conservatives, four liberals and Justice Anthony Kennedy as a swing vote between the blocs.   Trump selected Gorsuch    who sits on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals    from a list of 20 potential justices compiled during the presidential campaign in a direct appeal to conservative and evangelical voters skeptical about his commitment to their values.   Gorsuch’s opinions on religious liberty, where he sided with the challengers to the   Obamacare contraceptive mandate, and on the separation of powers, where he said too much deference was given by the courts to administrative agencies, are key to his appeal to Republicans.
