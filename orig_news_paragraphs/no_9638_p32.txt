As The New York Times noted on Sunday, Uber drivers have taken a more than 60 percent pay cut in the last two years: Two years ago, drivers for Uber and Lyft could hope to make as much as $25 an hour, according to interviews with more than a dozen Los   drivers. Today, with a glut of Uber and Lyft cars on the road, those drivers say that their average fares have dropped from $2. 40 per mile in December 2013 to $0. 90 per mile for most trips after Uberâ€™s most recent rate reduction this month.
