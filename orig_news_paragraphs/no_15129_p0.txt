Washington (CNN) The surprisingly close results of Tuesdayâ€™s special election for a House seat in   Kansas should serve as "a warning sign" to the GOP, Sen. Ted Cruz said Wednesday. The contest showed the massive shift in the electorate since voters elected Donald Trump President in November. He had carried the Kansas district by 27 percentage points but on Tuesday, Republican Ron Estes only bested Democrat Jim Thompson for the seat previously represented by new CIA Director Mike Pompeo by 7 points.
