Whatâ€™s inside the Republican health care bill? The final bill that Republicans will vote for Friday would repeal 10 Essential Health Benefits, a term used to describe a provision of Obamacare    or the Affordable Care Act    that required certain health insurance plans to cover 10 services, including maternity, prescription drugs, substance abuse and mental health.   The legislation would scrap the individual mandate and allow insurers to charge higher premiums to those whose coverage has lapsed. It would provide refundable tax credits, based mainly on age, for individuals to purchase health insurance.
