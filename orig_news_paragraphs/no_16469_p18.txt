That is why we support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry. The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic," the official GOP platform now reads. Trump, who earned the endorsement of the union representing about 16, 500 border patrol agents, the Border Patrol Council, has also vowed to boost funding and resources to enforcement activities at the southern border.   Trump has also vowed his wall will include "a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall" to allow immigrants to come into the US legally.
