Law enforcement officials in Santa Monica, Calif. confirmed the arrest on Sunday of a heavily armed man who said he was in the area for West Hollywood’s gay pride parade. The authorities, however, said they did not know of any connection between the California arrest and the Orlando shooting. The F. B. I. investigated Mr. Mateen in 2013 when he made comments to   suggesting he had terrorist ties, and again the next year, for possible connections to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American who became a suicide bomber in Syria, said Ronald Hopper, an assistant agent in charge of the bureau’s Tampa Division. But each time, the F. B. I. found no solid evidence that Mr. Mateen had any real connection to terrorism or had broken any laws.
