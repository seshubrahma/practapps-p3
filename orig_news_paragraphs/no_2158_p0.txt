HIGH POINT, N. C.  —   Parrish Clodfelter, a    retiree who lives on a central North Carolina farm, professes opinions about transgender people that might get him fired if he worked for a multinational corporation, though for many here, they constitute simple country wisdom. " A man wants to change to a woman, he’s got a mental problem," Mr. Clodfelter said on Wednesday over lunch at Spiro’s Family Restaurant, where posters by the door advertised classes on carrying concealed weapons and a "Hillbilly Sunday" Pentecostal church service. But Mr. Clodfelter has a different kind of problem.
