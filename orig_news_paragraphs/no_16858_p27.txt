Forcing Trump off the ticket, Republican sources say one option under consideration is ending the Joint Fundraising Agreement between the RNC and the Trump campaign so the RNC could focus its fundraising exclusively on critical down ballot races and encourage donors who were opposed to Trump to continue to support the party. But the chance that the GOP could force Trump off its presidential ticket just a month before Election Day appears to be a long shot, not least because the election is already underway in some states in absentee and early voting. In theory, there is a mechanism to replace Trump on the ticket should he rescind his pledge to stay in the race and drop out. The party rules allow RNC members to pick a new nominee in a    vote.
