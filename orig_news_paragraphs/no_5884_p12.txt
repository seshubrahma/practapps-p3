So just like other times in American history where there have been problems in our country, when citizens rights have been infringed, Tennesseans are stepping up to the solution. My name is Scottie Nell Hughes, a proud graduate of the University of Tennessee at Martin and a Skyhawk. And it is an honor to stand here today next to Representative Martin Daniel and Senator Joey Hensley and their sponsorship of this Tennessee student free expression act, or as Iâ€™m liking to call it, the MILO bill.
