My name is John Fredericks and I host one of the top syndicated conservative radio talk shows in Virginia. [As one of the only radio personalities in America to project Dave Bratâ€™s historic upset victory that rocked the nation last year, I also predicted Donald Trump would be the 2016 Republican Presidential nominee back in May, before he even officially announced his candidacy.   I rarely make public endorsements of political candidates.
