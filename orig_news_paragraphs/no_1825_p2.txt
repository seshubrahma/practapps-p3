In a city where high black turnout could seal her grip on the presidency, Mrs. Clinton framed the campaign in the context of historic struggles for equality   —   from the origins of the women’s rights movement in Seneca Falls, N. Y. to the march for black civil rights in Selma, Ala. "Everything you care about, everything I care about and have worked for, is at stake," Mrs. Clinton said, without mentioning Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton has delivered a broad message of national unity in the campaign’s closing days, offering herself to voters as an avatar of tolerance and reconciliation, in contrast to Mr. Trump.
