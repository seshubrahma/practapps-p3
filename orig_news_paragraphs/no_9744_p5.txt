(RNC) chairman Reince Priebus, who’s been disagreeable with Trump many times throughout the campaign, and House Speaker Paul Ryan —  who’s been trying to undermine Trump’s ascent since it began despite endorsing him —  both condemned Trump’s remarks on the tape as well. Ryan also canceled Trump’s scheduled appearance at a campaign stop in Wisconsin on Saturday. Interestingly, it seems as though this tape’s release —  and the rush by a bevy of   Republicans to denounce him over the   locker   banter —  comes as Trump stays strong in the polls and prepares for the next debate on Sunday night in St. Louis, Missouri.
