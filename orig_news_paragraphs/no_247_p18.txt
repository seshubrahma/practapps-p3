___ 7. President Trump now oversees  the intelligence agencies that are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions for possible links between his associates and Russian officials. Among those being scrutinized are Paul Manafort, above, Mr. Trumpâ€™s former campaign chairman Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative. It is not clear whether the communications have anything to do with Mr. Trump, but he has the authority to redirect or stop at least some of the efforts.
