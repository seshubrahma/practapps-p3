Many speak of the need for ‘generosity’ in welcoming huge numbers of economic migrants," Valditara noted, "but few speak of the generosity needed toward our children and future generations as we hand on to them a society that scarcely resembles the one we received in heritage," a comment that elicited enthusiastic applause from the audience that filled the hall.
