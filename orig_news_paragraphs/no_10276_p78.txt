It is an open and shut case. There is no way anyone can argue that Hillary will not make 4 or more supreme court choices if elected, turning the Supreme Court into a leftist playground for generations. America as you know it will be gone, replaced by just another declining western nation, no better, stronger or freer than Germany or France. So beyond all of Trumpâ€™s policies, which you may or may not favor, and beyond his personality, which you may find obnoxious, consider the court.
