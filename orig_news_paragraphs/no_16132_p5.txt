In a change in plans, Trump later decided to spend the night in Indianapolis "because it was logistically easier" to go straight from there to California, a campaign aide confirmed to CNN. Earlier in the day, Pence lavished praise on the presumptive GOP nominee, comparing Trump to Ronald Reagan and using the phrase "make America great again" Tuesday afternoon when he spoke with reporters after an event in Indianapolis.   " I think he is someone who has connected with everyday Americans like no one since Ronald Reagan," Pence said.
