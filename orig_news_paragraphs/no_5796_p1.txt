The blame lies with Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, Florio argues, because he is a Republican with ties to the Jeb Bush for president campaign and he is the brother of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, without considering that management might be considering their fan base or that Kaepernick just isn’t that good.   Florio doesn’t seem to remember the Isaiah Crowell ordeal.   The Cleveland Browns running back posted an Instagram pic last year of a cop getting murdered by a terrorist and appeared to "advocate the knifing of police officers," which caused the Cleveland Police Union president to actually threaten to pull security from Browns games. Crowell eventually apologized.
