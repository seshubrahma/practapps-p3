In their Oval Office meeting, White House officials said, Mr. Obama told Mr. Sanders that he could play a valuable role in   the party by supporting Democrats in races across the country this year, and use the influence he has amassed in his campaign to press his agenda forward in the Senate. Mr. Sanders, speaking to reporters as he left the West Wing with his wife, Jane, said that "we will continue doing everything that we can to oppose the drift which currently exists toward an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires exercise enormous power over our political, economic and media life.
