If it seemed like there were a lot of painful deaths this year in entertainment, it’s because there were.   Natalie Cole technically died on December 31, 2015, but the announcement of her death on New Years Day kicked off a year of hard farewells.   Pat Harrington, Jr. followed. David Bowie passed days later.
