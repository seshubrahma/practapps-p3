The average Trump primary voter makes 72, 000 a year, no more likely to be hurt by immigration or trade, or to be out work. Donald Trump doesn’t really have solutions and his supporters don’t really have problems. The only thing poor about them is their judgment. They’re hysterics, and they think President Tupac spent eight years turning the American Dream into nightmare on black street, and Hillary’s going to finish the job.
