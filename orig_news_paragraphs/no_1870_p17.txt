" During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and   Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward," the statement said. No mention of whether Mr. Trump’s repeated campaign threats against Chinese trade practices came up, nor his statement that climate change was a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese, nor his   promises on economic relations moving forward.
