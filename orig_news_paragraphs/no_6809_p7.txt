Whenever the president finds that the entry of aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, the president may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or   or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. On Saturday, Breitbart Jerusalem reported that lawyers from groups financed by Soros, a champion of open border policies, were signatories to a lawsuit filed Saturday to block the order. In response to the lawsuit, U. S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued an emergency order that temporarily blocks U. S. authorities from deporting those from the nations listed in Trumpâ€™s executive order. Over the last decade, Soros has reportedly provided some $76 million for immigrant issues.
