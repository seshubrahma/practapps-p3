On Day One of the new Congress, Republican senators used a budget maneuver to start the repeal process, although a final repeal bill is not likely to land on President Donald Trumpâ€™s desk for some weeks, even possibly months. And within hours of being sworn in as president, Trump issued an executive order that could eventually have   impact on Obamacare. Among other things, it directs the secretary of health and human services and agencies to interpret regulations as loosely as allowed under the law to minimize the burden on individuals, insurers, health care providers and others.   Collins called the executive order "very confusing" and difficult to interpret.
