Turning to a destabilized world, Trump said Americans were far less safe than when Obama took office and made Clinton his secretary of state.    He claimed America had been thrust through "one international humiliation after another," recalling images of U. S. sailors captured by Iran. ISIS is marching across the Middle East, Libya is in ruins, Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons, and Iraq is a mess, he said. He warned of the "barbarians of ISIS," conflated "brutal Islamic terrorism" in France with attacks in San Bernardino, Texas, Boston and Orlando.
