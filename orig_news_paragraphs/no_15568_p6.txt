In what is largely seen as a gift to his   base, Trump expanded the Gag Rule, and this week his State Department broadened the order, which strips US funds from any organization abroad that so much as mentions abortion as an option for women    even groups that donâ€™t provide abortions at all but simply tell women their legal rights.   Under previous Republican presidents, the Gag Rule applied only to family planning funds (about $600 million under George W. Bush). Now it applies to $8. 8 billion in US global health funding, including programs for HIV and malaria.
