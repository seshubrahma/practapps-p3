At the very least, I figured I could pitch Clinton directly on doing an actual interview without any mediation from her army of agonizers. Clinton and I spoke for about 45 minutes in a conference room of the Omni Mount Washington resort in Bretton Woods, N. H. She is, as advertised, "funny and thoughtful in    and   settings" (even the Clinton clichés are clichés at this point). Donors pay top dollar for the opportunity to experience this "funny and thoughtful Hillary in    and   settings. "
