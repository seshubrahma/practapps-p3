Mayor Rahm Emmanuel and several other Chicagoans kicked off the event at the DuSable Museum of African American History. Emmanuel became emotional when he spoke of his grandfather, who journeyed to the United States when he was 13 years old.   " He came because this country represented something that Moldova would never stand for," Emmanuel said.
