The executive order signed in 2014, which protects employees from   workplace discrimination while working for federal contractors, will remain intact at the direction of President Donald J. Trump. "   The executive order signed by Obama in July 2014 prevents federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. " Donald Trump campaigned promising to be a ‘real friend’ to the LGBT community, and now President Trump is delivering on that commitment," Log Cabin Republicans president Gregory Angelo told CNN.
