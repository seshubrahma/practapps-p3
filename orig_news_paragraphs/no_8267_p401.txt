The error was due to a calibration issue in Lebanon County’s voting machines, where five machines out of the 270 machines available in the county malfunctioned, Penn Live reported.   Voters saw the errors after they reviewed their ballots before officially filing them. When questioned about the issue, no one reported their votes were incorrectly cast, according to Lebanon County Election Director Michael Anderson. Anderson said the issue was fixed and there was no indication that anyone’s votes were incorrectly registered in the system.
