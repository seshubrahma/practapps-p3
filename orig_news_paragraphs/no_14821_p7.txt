The "Underground" cast    which includes Amirah Vann, Alano Miller, Aldis Hodge, Misha Green and Joe Pokaski    teamed up with the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Cut 50 and the American Civil Liberties Union last week, releasing a series of public service announcements to speak out against mass incarceration. " For more than 30 years, we’ve waged a racially discriminatory war on drugs that’s devastated poor black and brown communities," the actress says in the PSA, calling on Americans to contact their lawmakers to advocate for criminal justice reform. Activism, described by   as "citizen vs. soldier," is a prominent theme in "Underground" Season 2, which implores audiences to determine whether they will choose to stand on the battlefield or remain silent.
