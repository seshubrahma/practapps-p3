Gabbard says the frumpy and grumpy Sanders became the voice of millions because of his "deep love of others" and "our Mother Earth. " She calls the Sanders campaign a "movement of love" to care about people whose lives have been ruined by the criminal justice system and people whose lives have been ruined by disastrous trade deals. After quoting Gandhi, she says the movement can’t be defeated because "it’s fueled by love" and nominates Sanders for president.
