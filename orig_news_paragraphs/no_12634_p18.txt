As Breitbart News has previously reported, the central pillars of Ryanism are very similar to the pillars of Clinton’s agenda. The   agenda on crime, trade, and immigration also aligns with the views of the Koch brotherss. Ryan will face Wisconsin voters at the polls on August 9th. Should Ryan win his   and Trump lose, it is likely that  —   as Tim Kaine has predicted  —   amnesty will be enacted within the first 100 days, the TPP will be implemented, and criminal sentencing laws will be reduced, potentially resulting in an increase in the amount of violent crime and recidivism in U. S. communities.
