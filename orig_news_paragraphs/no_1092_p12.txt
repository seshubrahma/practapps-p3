When I caught up with Mr. Hayes last week he was in the process of staffing up. He had poached The Wall Street Journal’s books editor, Robert Messenger, to be an executive editor alongside Mr. Barnes. He had hired Rachael Larimore, a former managing editor of the   Slate (though her politics lean to the right) and recruited a former deputy business editor of The Charlotte Observer, Tony Mecia. He said he was on the verge of hiring five additional journalists, having gotten the   from The Weekly Standard’s billionaire owner, Philip Anschutz, to grow his team by a third.
