The NAS spends much of its report trying to define away the immigration tax, partly by offering a variety of ways to estimate the transfer of wealth from ordinary Americans.   But the report acknowledges that the   surplus exists only because Americansâ€™ wages are reduced. This $493 billion immigration tax is redistributed away from   and   Americans who compete against immigrants, and is sent towards the new immigrants, and toward wealthier people who employ immigrants as domestic help or as   employees at companies. Much of the immigration tax goes to shareholders and stock market, because corporate revenues are increased by sales to the new immigrants, while corporate payrolls are reduced by cheaper immigrants.
