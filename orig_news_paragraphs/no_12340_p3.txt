The algorithm is also reported to have been held on a separate, private computer server, with only a select few people able to access it. Like the MogIA AI system, which successfully predicted Donald Trumpâ€™s victory, Ada constantly took in and made its decisions based on public data, allegedly running "400, 000 simulations a day of what the race against Trump might look like. " Though Ada told the campaign that Pennsylvania would be one of the most important states to focus on, it never expected losses in Michigan or Wisconsin, the latter of which Clinton never even visited during the campaign. Last week, Breitbart Tech reported that the AI system MogIA successfully predicted its fourth election, after also successfully predicting both the Democratic and Republican primaries, and the three prior presidential elections.
