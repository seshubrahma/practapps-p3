Farage talked about his   fight against British membership in the European Union and the abuse he had suffered because of it and joked, "if you’ve endured abuse, if you’ve been called "deplorable" you’ve only had a few months of being abused, I’ve had 20 years of it! " Speaking highly of America, Farage told the story of both Brexit and spoke specifically of former President Barack Obama’s visit in support of the remain campaign saying, "I will, to my dying day, be grateful that President Obama came to my country, intervened in the referendum and told the United Kingdom’s people, told America’s greatest friend and ally in the world and told us that if we voted to get our independence we would go to the back of the line. " " And the British people were so disgusted by Obama treating us like this that it put us up two percent in the polls!
