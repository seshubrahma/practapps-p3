Washington (CNN) Secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson’s difficult path to confirmation will begin early next month in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s hearing room, where one Republican’s "serious concerns" about the ExxonMobil chief executive’s close ties to Russia could sink his nomination before it even gets to the Senate floor. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a former Republican presidential candidate who fiercely battled   Donald Trump for the GOP nomination, will sit on the dais across from Tillerson. He will grill him about his company’s vast business interests in Russia, his opposition to US economic sanctions against Russia and his apparently friendly relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who many lawmakers believe is a deceitful and dangerous dictator.
