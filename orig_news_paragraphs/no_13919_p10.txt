Republicans have a   margin on the Foreign Relations Committee, meaning that if all Democrats on the panel and just one Republican vote against Tillersonâ€™s nomination, it will stall in committee. At least one Republican on the committee, Sen. Marco Rubio, is undecided. However, if the nomination does not make it out of committee, it is still possible for Senate GOP leaders to bring it to a vote before the full Senate, although such a step would be unusual.
