We will call them out when we see something wrong. If we see where we can work together, of course, weâ€™re going to try and do that," Haley told an Al Jazeera journalist this week, once again condemning Russia, this time for supporting Syrian dictator Bashar   and opposing resolutions condemning his use of chemical weapons against civilians. Haley has also been excellent as a vocal ally of Israel, the only functioning democracy in the Middle East. Among her first acts as UN Ambassador were a visit to the family of an Israel soldier killed by the terrorist group Hamas and a rebuke of the Security Council generally for its "obsession" with Israel.
