According to a source familiar with the conversations, the calls were made to people whom Trump has historically listened to for political advice. The source did not know if there was any meeting set or any follow up to these calls. And in a call with CNN, the Trump campaign denied that there was such an effort underway. One adviser who spoke to Trump Wednesday morning told CNN that Trump appeared surprised by the public reaction to his comments about Khan, and how big of an ordeal it had become.
