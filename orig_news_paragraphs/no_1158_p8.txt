A second referendum would probably put the independence camp in a better position than three years ago, when young people voted heavily to leave, and a British exit from the European Union seemed highly unlikely. But while Scots voted to remain in the European Union last June by 62 percent to 38 percent, that has not translated easily into support for independence, with about a third of those favoring independence also voting for a British exit. " Right now thereâ€™s too much uncertainty, not just about Scotland but about Brexit," said Ian Ramage, who returned to Edinburgh a decade ago after many years living abroad.
