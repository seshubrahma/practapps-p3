Rev. Barber entered the position with a promise to increase the relevance of the   old institution to contemporary life and criticized former NC NAACP leaders for having a   scenes approach to civil action, preferring to negotiate with legislators rather than taking the civil rights agenda to the streets. His commitment to organizing and policy advocacy is unique for the institution and he states that while the NC NAACP will continue to work with lawmakers "  …    the difference is that when we go into the legislature, we don’t check with them to negotiate what’s most politically acceptable. We go in and stand on our principles. "
