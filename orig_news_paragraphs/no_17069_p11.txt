The Wisconsin Republican said he agrees with Trump’s comment to CBS’ "60 Minutes" that Obamacare’s laws against barring those with   conditions from receiving coverage and allowing those up to age 26 to remain on their parents ’ insurance can stay in place even as the GOP pushes to repeal Obamacare. Ryan said the GOP plans to push refundable tax credits that would allow   Americans to essentially use those tax credits as vouchers to buy insurance, rather than receiving   Medicaid.
