A fiction can never be accused of being a lie. The problem is that, more and more, people seem to want to be lied to. This is the flip side of "reality hunger," since a lie, like a fake memoir, is a fiction that does not admit its fictionality. That is why the lie is so seductive: It allows the liar and his audience to cooperate in changing the nature of reality itself, in a way that can appear almost magical.
