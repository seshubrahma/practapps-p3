In Alabamaâ€™s 2nd Congressional District, Rep. Martha Roby fended off a challenge from Tea Party heroine Becky Gerritson and one other challenger. Roby won 67 percent of the vote, far above the threshold needed to avoid a runoff. Gerritson, who founded the Wetumpka Tea Party, received national attention when she testified before Congress after her organization was targeted by the IRS. She racked up   endorsements from Phyllis Schafely, Herman Cain, Allen West, Citizens United, Madison Project, and Tea Party Patriots Citizen Fund.
