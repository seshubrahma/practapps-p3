The president’s stump speech has evolved over the last several weeks, with Mr. Obama testifying to Mrs. Clinton’s qualifications, but also lashing out at Mr. Trump in increasingly blunt terms. As Mrs. Obama was in her assault on Mr. Trump in New Hampshire on Thursday, the president has become unleashed in his criticism of the Republican nominee. In a speech Thursday night to Democrats in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Obama assailed what he called "the swamp of crazy" that Republicans have allowed to fester in recent years. He said Mr. Trump was merely the outgrowth of a political worldview that Republicans have increasingly embraced in Washington and around the country.
