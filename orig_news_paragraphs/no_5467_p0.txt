Professor John Banzhaf, public interest law professor at George Washington University Law School, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday to discuss the constitutionality of President Trumpâ€™s immigration order. [Despite the media hysteria surrounding it, Banzhaf said, "This order is largely constitutional and probably will stand. "  Citing his own analysis, Banzhaf added that even if Trump said that "no Muslims could come into the United States, that would be constitutional. "
