The Russians were as surprised as everyone else at Mr. Trump’s victory, intelligence officials said. Had Mrs. Clinton won, they believe, emails stolen from the Democratic committee and from senior members of her campaign could have been used to undercut her legitimacy. The intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia tried to help Mr. Trump was first reported by The Washington Post. In briefings to the White House and Congress, intelligence officials, including those from the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency, have identified individual Russian officials they believe were responsible.
