One Bush donor pledged to donate a whopping $2 million to Hillary’s Latino outreach program to help her get elected in November. Still another Bush has also been reticent to support the party’s nominee. Texas Land Commissioner and Texas GOP Victory Chair George P. Bush, Jeb’s son, initially said he would never vote for Donald Trump. But only a few months later it appears he softened his stance by saying it is important to stop Hillary so Republicans should "swallow a bitter pill" and vote Trump.
