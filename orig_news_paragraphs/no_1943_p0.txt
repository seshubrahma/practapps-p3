Following up on a campaign promise that appealed directly to his Rust Belt base,   Donald J. Trump said Thursday that he had reached out to the Carrier air conditioner company in Indiana to ask it not to move more than 2, 000 factory jobs from Indiana to Mexico. In a post on Twitter Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said: "I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A. C. Company to stay in the U. S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS   Will know soon!" During both the primary and general election campaigns, Mr. Trump frequently cited the February decision by Carrier and its corporate parent, United Technologies, to close two Indiana factories and move production to Mexico as an example of how Nafta and other   agreements had failed American workers.
