Another reader notes: In 2009, Republicans only controlled 14 state legislatures. [Now they control 33, a legislative dominance not seen since the Civil War.] Certainly the 2010 redistricting and gerrymandering had an effect, but the state of the local Dem party is not too far out of whack from what should be expected after eight years of a Democratic president. Iâ€™ll say that Republicans are traditionally very good at nationalizing local races.
