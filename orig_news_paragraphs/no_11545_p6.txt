Trump, Cruz, Kasich, Bush, and Rubio —  and a few stubborn stragglers all winning some delegates, it will be tough for Trump to gather enough delegates before the national convention to lock up the nomination. The most logical target for one of Trump’s famous deals is Kasich, who unless he trips, should have a nice bundle of delegates to bargain. Kasich, like Trump, is not an   conservative —  at least as measured by those who impose a litmus test, such as National Review. Rather both are malleable personalities interested in workable solutions —  for example, instead of denying poor folks health care for partisan reasons, the governor implemented the Medicaid provisions of the Affordable Care Act expansion in Ohio.
