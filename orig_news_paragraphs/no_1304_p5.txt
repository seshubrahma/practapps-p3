officials in Ukraine say $12. 7 million in "off the books" cash payments were earmarked for him in a handwritten ledger kept by the political party of the deposed strongman Viktor F. Yanukovych. Last month, a Ukrainian lawmaker released documents that appeared to corroborate one of the ledger entries, and on Wednesday The Associated Press reported confirmation of another payment. The two payments in 2007 and 2009, totaling $1. 2 million, were routed through shell companies in Belize to a bank account in Virginia belonging to Mr. Manafortâ€™s consulting firm.
