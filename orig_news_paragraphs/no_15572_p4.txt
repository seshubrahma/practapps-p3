Speaking to a joint session of Congress after September 11, George W. Bush said that terrorists hate our freedoms: "our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other."   At the time, I thought (and still do think) that his rhetoric was harmful.   But, today, I nonetheless think itâ€™s a fair description of the Turkish president and his goon squad.   Here in America those freedoms are increasingly under attack.
