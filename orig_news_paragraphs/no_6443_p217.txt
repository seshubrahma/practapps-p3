Our Democrat friend who’s supporting Ossoff tells us that the the person who did the best outreach to seniors likely will win. UPDATE 8:12 P. M. Here’s the spin to expect from the left if Handel wins, from a Democrat who’s supporting Ossoff tonight who spoke to Breitbart News on condition of anonymity from the Ossoff party via phone: Democrats believe now they can be competitive in red states and district if they fight, Ossoff won more votes than Democrats historically do in this district, and Ossoff to win the seat needed to avoid the runoff to begin with. Not a good sign for them right now, but again it’s still early.
