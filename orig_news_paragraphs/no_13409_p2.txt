Users of Reddit have alleged the site to be involved in an increasing amount of censorship recently, with moderators of the Donald Trump "  " subreddit even being asked by admins to stop reporting on the censorship itself. Redditâ€™s news subreddit has faced most of the recent criticism, after censoring stories related to the Orlando terrorist attack in June. Users found themselves banned and their posts deleted after sharing stories that connected the perpetrator, Omar Mateen, with Islam or ISIS, and a post offering blood donation advice even found itself swiftly removed from the platform.
