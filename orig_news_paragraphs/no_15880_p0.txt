 (CNN) Kamala Harris has served as freshman senator for only six months, but sheâ€™s not wasting time sitting in the shadows.   For the second time in a week, the Democratic senator made headlines after her Republican counterparts interrupted her during Senate Intelligence Committee hearings.   Last week, Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain of Arizona cut her off as she questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.
