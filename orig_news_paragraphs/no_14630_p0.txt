 (CNN) The man accused of shooting two technology workers from India and another man at a bar in Kansas last week had his first court appearance on Monday in a   case that is being investigated as a possible hate crime. Adam Purinton, 51, faces one charge of   murder and two charges of attempted   murder in last Wednesdayâ€™s shooting in Olathe that killed one person and injured two others. The incident has raised worries among Indians and other communities about possible violence against foreign workers in the United States.
