Border enforcement will become what it should be: Keeping out real criminals,   terrorists and others sneaking across the border for the wrong reasons. Stop sending drones out to keep a mother from crossing over with her kids to join their father, and focus on stopping the actual bad guys    or finding them if they slip by. That’s what will make us safer.    We really are a nation of immigrants, and we’ve become the greatest nation on earth without big walls and nativism.
