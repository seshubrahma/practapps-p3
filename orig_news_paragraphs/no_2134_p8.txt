The Electoral Reform Society, a lobbying group, criticized the government’s plan as a "sledgehammer to crack a nut," arguing that voting fraud was not widespread in Britain and that "the government should think very carefully before introducing barriers to voting," said its chief executive, Katie Ghose. " Raising barriers to democratic participation could just put people off voting   —   and evidence from the U. S. shows that it’s generally those already most excluded from the political process that are worst affected by strict ID laws," she said.
