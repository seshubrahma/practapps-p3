and I ask you to consider the following hypothetical.   Suppose I, a white person, was living and working in South Africa.   Suddenly an extremist group of whites, intent on restoring the country to white rule, begins using suicide bombers to bring down airplanes, and threatens to continue the practice until whites are again in power. I, as a white person, would certainly hope that secondary screening would be concentrated on white passengers, including me.
