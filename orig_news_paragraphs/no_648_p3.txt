But the case won’t go away. Last week, The Irish Examiner and the public broadcaster RTE’s "Prime Time" program reported that Ireland’s child protection agency had created a file on Sergeant McCabe containing a false accusation of child sexual abuse   —   a mistake that the agency has attributed to what it called a clerical error. The news organizations also reported that this wasn’t the first time Sergeant McCabe had been wrongly accused of such a crime an earlier complaint against him had been made, in 2006, and dismissed.
