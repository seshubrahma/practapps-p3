"To the strong, traditional, macho,       male, red meat is a strong, traditional, macho,       food," the authors of one study   wrote. The connotation spans borders: In Ethiopia, eating raw   meat is a "male thing" manly men do together, and most languages   with gendered pronouns put meat in the masculine camp. Someone   who engages in    consumption of meat is signaling that   he doesnâ€™t care about his health or the planet, and not caring   about harming things is one of the most important elements of   traditional masculinity. Men are less likely to do things   perceived as   like eat vegetarian, lest they be   confused for women.
