Clinton is ahead 44% to 42% within the poll’s margin of error. It’s a similarly tightened race in Virginia, where ads had similarly stopped, as Clinton leads by 6 points, 45% to 39%. In Georgia, Trump is now up by 7 points, 47% to 40% putting some distance between himself and Clinton in what is typically a reliably Republican state. And in Iowa, which has leaned in Trump’s direction for the entire general election, he is also up by 7 points, 44% to 37%.
