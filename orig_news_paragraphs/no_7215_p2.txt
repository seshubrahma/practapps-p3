According various excerpts from "Mexico: Narco Violence and a Failed State?" by the late author and prestigious university professor George Grayson, the PRI had ruled over Mexico like a monarchy for more than 70 years turning a blind eye to smuggling activities unless they got out of line. The centralized power of the PRI came down like a hammer on any criminal group that drew attention to themselves or stepped out of line.   That way of doing business came to an end when Fox took office in 2000 since the PAN did not have the centralized power needed to quash any unruly drug trafficker.   During his term in office Fox focused more on establishing a democracy and in economic growth than in the security conditions.
