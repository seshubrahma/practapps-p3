Catholic Charities of Dallas has not explicitly confirmed that it had a contractual obligation with the federal government’s refugee resettlement program to resettle and monitor the progress of Abdul Razak Ali Artan, his mother, and six siblings. " We gave them aid and comfort and some shelter as part of the government resettlement program," Catholic Charities of Dallas CEO Dave Woodyard told NBC5 on Tuesday of his organization’s dealings with Artan and his family. That same day, Catholic Charities of Dallas released a statement that made no mention of the refugee resettlement program: Catholic Charities of Dallas has been contacted by law enforcement in connection with the investigation into yesterday’s events at Ohio State University.
