During NPR’s Morning Edition, reporter Tom Gjelten fawningly and at great length profiled an initiative called "Celebrate Mercy.

" Mogahed claimed Mohammed’s time in Medina showed him to be an exemplar of peace and tolerance and, if only Muslims model their lives on his, they will eschew radicalization.
