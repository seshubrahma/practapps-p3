" If we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with a broad brush and imply that we are at war with an entire religion, then we are doing the terroristsâ€™ work for them," Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama is scheduled to travel to Orlando on Thursday to visit with the surviving victims and the families of those killed in the rampage on Sunday morning. He was to have traveled to Wisconsin on Wednesday for his first campaign appearance with Mrs. Clinton since endorsing her last week, but the event was canceled in light of the shooting.
