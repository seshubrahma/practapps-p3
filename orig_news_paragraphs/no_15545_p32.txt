Asked about the upcoming meeting, Francis said he’s keeping an open mind.   " I will say what I think, he will say what he thinks, but I never, ever, wanted to make a judgment without hearing the person," the Pope said at a recent press conference aboard the papal plane.   Francis also said he will not seek to change Trump’s mind on policy disagreements.
