Tillerson’s decision not to speak publicly about the report, and the State Department’s decision not to hold an    press conference, was criticized Friday by human rights groups. Rob Berschinski of Human Rights First and a former deputy assistant secretary for human rights said in a statement that Tillerson’s decision "is yet another troubling indication that the Trump administration intends to abandon US leadership on human rights and universal values." "Such a decision sends an unmistakable signal to human rights defenders that the United States may no longer have their back, a message that won’t be lost on abusive governments," he added. According to former State Department Spokesman P. J. Crowley, the more subdued rollout is likely the result of a combination of factors, including the fact that Tillerson is still adapting to his new position.
