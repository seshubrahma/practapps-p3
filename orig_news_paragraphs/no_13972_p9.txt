Zimmer Biomet is included in a   account and that the stock was purchased without his knowledge, a Price aide said after the story published. But CNN asked Priceâ€™s office before the story published if there was a broker involved in the transaction,  and a representative for the congressman declined to say.   A Price aide claimed the congressman learned about the stock purchase on April 4, 2016    a few weeks after the source said the financial adviser made the transaction. Price continued to hold about $2, 000 worth of shares in the company, the source said, despite having introduced the bill that would have helped the firm just days earlier.
