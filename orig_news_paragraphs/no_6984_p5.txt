Cotton said he spoke to the president about the general outlines of the bill during the campaign and that morning. While he would not say that Trump endorsed the bill, he was clear that it is in line with the presidentâ€™s priorities, and he and Perdue have an ongoing partnership with the White House staff. The Army Ranger veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq said his bill with Perdue takes the number of legal immigrants from  million to 500, 000 per year without addressing the   immigration programs. Cotton said this bill makes it a simple matter of supply and demand.
