The   officer was shot   as he approached the passenger window of a vehicle carrying two men from Ohio who are allegedly wanted for murder.    Following an autopsy in Albuquerque, a procession lined up to carry the officerâ€™s body south along Interstate 25, through his community of Hatch and on to Las Cruces where he will be laid to rest. As the procession headed southward, people lined the streets to pay their respects to Officer Chavez. In addition to police motorcycles and vehicles escorting the body, firetrucks in communities along the route erected   ladder bridges as a sign of respect and mourning.
