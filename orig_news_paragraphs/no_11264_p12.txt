Then the time limit on the president does not start until he files implementing legislation, which is not directly part of the treaty but implements the treaty. So he could hold that off, we would assume, and would file it in August or September to have it ripen after the election and before the lame duck Congress departs. So nothing can move until the president submits the implementing legislation and he has the power therefore to decide when the vote would occur. It can occur within a   window.
