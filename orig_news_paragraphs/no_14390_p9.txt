Trump is not the first president to want to improve relations with Russia, but he is the first to suggest doing it by adjusting American policy to suit Russian interests. And he is the first to offer effusive praise of an autocratic ruler (whose critics frequently turn up dead) by smearing his own country. Why is Trump so committed to a radical recasting of Americaâ€™s Russia policy? His knowledge of Russia and bilateral ties is hardly sophisticated.
