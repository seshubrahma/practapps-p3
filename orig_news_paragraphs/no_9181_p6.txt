The decision today to cancel the planned March 21 Fox News debate in Utah following Trump’s decision not to attend, and Kasich’s subsequent decision not to attend as well, adds a significant element of uncertainty to the outcome in Utah. Cruz won an upset victory over Trump in nearby Idaho, with help from the state’s 19 percent Mormon population and Trump’s failure to visit the state. It is currently unclear how much, if any, time Trump will spend in Utah prior to the March 22 caucus, but the Trump campaign tells Breitbart News an announcement of his scheduled events for the next week will be made Wednesday afternoon and posted to the campaign’s website. If that schedule shows several trips to Utah as well as Arizona over the next week, it will be a clear signal Trump intends to contest both states.
