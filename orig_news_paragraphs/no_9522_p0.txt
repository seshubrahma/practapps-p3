Jackson, Mississippi  —    UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage addressed a 10, 000+ strong crowd at the Coliseum in Jackson, Mississippi, telling them to "put on their walking boots" and urging them to form their own "People’s Army" to defeat the U. S. political establishment. [Mr. Farage  —   who led his party (UKIP) to victory in the 2014 European Parliamentary elections, to a whopping 4m votes in the 2015 UK general election, and mostly importantly, to Britain voting to leave the European Union in 2016   —   has used the "People’s Army" moniker to describe his party’s supporters for years.
