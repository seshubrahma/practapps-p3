John Andrade’s restaurants, including Meridian Pint, Smoke and Barrel, Brookland Pint and Rosario, will be open, but "bring your own food" with the kitchens closed, Andrade said in a statement on Facebook.   " As a Latino business owner, I stand in solidarity with all of my immigrant staff," he said. Black Restaurant Group, Shouk and Taylor Gourmet all told CNN they would see how   they are on Thursday, but said they support their worker’s decisions to protest if they so choose.
