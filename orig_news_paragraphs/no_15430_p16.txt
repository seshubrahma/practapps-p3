I think it’s absolutely worth trying to get to the bottom of how Yates came to know what she knew about Flynn and Russia and how that information got to The Washington Post. But, again, is that more important than finding out the depth of Russia’s meddling in our presidential election and the extent of their contacts with Flynn and others within Trump’s orbit? I think not.
