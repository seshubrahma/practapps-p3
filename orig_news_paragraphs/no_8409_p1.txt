It was also revealed this week that Eric Schmidt wanted to be the "head outside advisor" to the Clinton campaign, with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta adding that he was "ready to fund, advise, and recruit talent" for the Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has also claimed that Google is "directly engaged" in the Clinton campaign. The collusion between Schmidt and the Democratic Party is just further evidence of the shocking level of   bias in Silicon Valley. Other examples include Facebook   Dustin Moskovitz pledging over $35 million to Hillary Clinton in order to defeat Donald Trump, whilst Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were both touted as possible vice presidential picks by Hillary Clinton.
