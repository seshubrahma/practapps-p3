Saying the war on terror "is simply not working," Corbyn urged national unity but also said the government must ensure "that our foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country. "  Corbyn, who has a long record of voting against UK military intervention overseas, said a Labour government would "change what we do abroad" if elected, while acknowledging that no government can prevent every attack and that terrorism has many causes.   " Many experts, including professionals in our intelligence and security services have pointed to the connections between wars we have been involved in or supported and and fought in other countries, such as Libya, and terrorism here at home," he said.
