Indeed the reader might ask himself or herself: Is it wise to trust our "betters" when they tell us that the   renewables —  solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy —  can be expanded rapidly enough to protect the   of the average American? In fact, according to the National Academy of Sciences, in 2015 those four renewables made up less than eight percent of total U. S. energy consumption.   So realistically, what are the chances that they could be expanded sufficiently to take the place of the energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear, hydropower) that are now out of fashion in high circles? Or, is it wiser for the ordinary Joe and Jane to conclude that the Al Gore class simply doesn’t care what happens to them?
