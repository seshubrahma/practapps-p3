Washington (CNN) House Democrats left a meeting with the Homeland Security secretary Friday with complaints both about the administration’s policies and the secretary’s tone    calling him "dismissive" and saying they still have more questions than answers about President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Secretary John Kelly held the meeting with House Democrats after weeks of requests from the full caucus and from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus directed toward DHS’ immigration agencies. The lawmakers had asked for the briefing to discuss Trump’s strict enforcement of US immigration laws.
