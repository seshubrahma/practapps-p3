His Eminence Timothy Cardinal Dolan, archbishop of New York, was a guest on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM, where he offered a preview of his speech for the upcoming March for Life in Washington, D. C.["The   march in Washington, which usually occurs on January 22   —   which is the somber anniversary of Roe v. Wade in 1973   —   this year, as you know Alex, it got pushed back because of all the celebrations of the inaugural," he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.
