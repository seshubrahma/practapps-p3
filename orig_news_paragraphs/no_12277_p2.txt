Fuck you bitch, A photo posted by pete davidson (@petedavidson) on Nov 20, 2016 at 10:51am PST,  Earlier Sunday, Trump said he had watched parts of Saturday Night Live‘s most recent episode and found it "totally   biased" and not funny at all. The most recent episode of the   NBC sketch comedy show saw Alec Baldwin return to play Trump in a skit in which he is seen fumbling his way through his presidential duties. Trump previously criticized the program in October, shortly after Baldwin made his first appearance as Trump opposite cast member Kate McKinnon’s impersonation of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
