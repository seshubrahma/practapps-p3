HIAS was an acronym that previously stood for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and it originally worked to resettle Jewish emigrants from Russia.   It dropped the full title and only goes by the acronym now.   Mark Hetfield, HIAS president and CEO, told the Washington Jewish Week in December 2014 the word "Hebrew" was exclusionary and outdated, comparing it with the use of the word "colored" to refer to African Americans. Soros, meanwhile, has reportedly provided some $76 million for immigrant issues over the last decade alone.
