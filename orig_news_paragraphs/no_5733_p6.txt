The clear pattern which emerges from the risk analysis is that, as one country institutes strong border controls, neighbouring countries which remain lax see a corresponding increase in illegal migration. For example, the report describes how "African illegal stayers who primarily entered the EU through the Central Mediterranean route significantly decreased in Austria" after the   country "upgraded the controls of its national border with Italy". The statistics show illegal stayers growing in Switzerland, which is outside the EU but inside the bloc’s borderless Schengen zone, "at the same time". Despite clear statistical evidence of the effectiveness of walls in tackling illegal migration, Europe’s leading politicians remain wedded to open borders.
