Mr. Trump has said the United States must "greatly strengthen and expand" its nuclear capability, "Let it be an arms race," he said. But Mr. Perry, asked by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, whether he believed expanded testing of nuclear weapons was a "dangerous idea," replied, "I think anyone would be of the opinion that if we never have to test another nuclear weapon that would be a good thing for the world. " He added, "I think nonproliferation is a good thing. "
