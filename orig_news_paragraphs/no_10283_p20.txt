John Boehner touted Cruz’s support for Obamatrade on the Speaker’s website in a talking points memo entitled, "Conservative Support for TPA Grows" on June 9th. These talking points were echoed by other Republican lawmakers such as Kenny Marchant, who highlighted Cruz’s support for fast track on his website as well on June 11th. South Carolina lawmakers Tim Scott and Trey Gowdy similarly seemed to use Sen. Cruz’s name for political cover when trying to dismiss the concerns of voters who believed that granting Obama the fast track executive power he desperately wanted would further empower his Presidency: "Trade Promotion Authority is not about empowering any president," Scott and Gowdy sought to assure voters.
