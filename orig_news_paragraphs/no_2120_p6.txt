Mr. Putin did not engineer the shift   but he has been adept at making his own luck, deploying Orthodox priests,   news media outlets like RT, spies and computer hackers to ride and help create the wave of populist anger now battering the foundations of the   European order. Mr. Gyorkos, one of the foot soldiers in that assault, is now in jail but, according to his lawyer, has not yet been formally charged. A few days before he was accused of opening fire on police officers, a court in the southern Norwegian town of Tonsberg ordered the detention of Jan Petrovsky, a longtime local resident of Russian nationality who, according to a confidential   report by Norwayâ€™s security service, belonged to "a network of people characterized by abnormal interest in weapons" and a "shared enmity towards Norwegian democracy and other democracies.
