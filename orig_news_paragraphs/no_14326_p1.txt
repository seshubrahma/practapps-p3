When the Cubs overcame a   deficit to take the World Series in Game 7, Americans took a breather from politics to cheer the momentous victory, grateful that sometimes a   battle on a seemingly level playing field just felt good.    The political hype leading into the awesome spectacle of a young Falcons team looking to take down a veritable dynasty    and in Tom Brady, the greatest quarterback the game has ever seen    indicated Super Bowl LI would not be a break from anything. The night before the game, Saturday Night Live’s Michael Che said on the show that he hoped to "watch the blackest city in America beat the most racist city I’ve ever been to."   Jack Hamilton wrote "a guide for morally compromised New England fans" for Slate, explaining how longtime Pats fans such as himself who have cheered for the team when it wasn’t worth their breath now had no idea what to do with the criticism that swirls around Tom Brady’s "MAGA" hat (he’s a friend of sorts of President Donald Trump) and the scandals of "Spygate" and "Deflategate." Others pledged dollar amounts to favorite charities for each touchdown the Patriots scored.
