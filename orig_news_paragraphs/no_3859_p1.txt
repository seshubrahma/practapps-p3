The Russian statement on Trump’s call did not mention if Obama’s sanctions were discussed. President Trump also spoke to Japanese leader Shinzo Abe about the U. S. pulling out of the   Partnership, a   trade deal that Abe supported. The president reportedly told Abe that he was more interested in bilateral trade deals that were easier to manage and alter as the situation demands, the Washington Times said. The pair arranged a meeting in Washington for next month.
