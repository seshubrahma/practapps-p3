The officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the intelligence and to avoid angering Mr.   and Mr. Ellis. Officials say Mr.   has been reviewing the reports from his   office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the National Security Council is based. The officials’ description of the intelligence is in line with Mr. Nunes’s characterization of the material, which he said was not related to the Russia investigations when he first disclosed its existence. According to Mr. Nunes, who served on the Trump transition team, he met his source on the grounds of the White House.
