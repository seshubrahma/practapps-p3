Democratic strategists involved in House and Senate races said they envisioned Mr. Trump’s collapse precipitating a broad shift in the political landscape, with tossup races moving firmly into their hands, and campaigns that were once long shots suddenly becoming competitive. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee planned to do rapid polling early this week to measure the impact of Mr. Trump on the House battlefield. Democrats said they had no intention of allowing Republicans to wash out the stain of associating with Mr. Trump: "Voters will see this for the craven act of   that it is, and it won’t save them," said Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the committee. Barring an unforeseeable, if not miraculous, political recovery for Mr. Trump, the Republican exodus from his camp is expected to pick up pace in the coming days as lawmakers digest his debate performance and receive new polling on how voters are processing his apparent demise.
