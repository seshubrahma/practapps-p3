JAKE TAPPER: So, Donald Trump  …     to play devil’s advocate, Donald Trump says that it is supporters of Senator Sanders and supporters of yours who came to Chicago and shut down his rally with violence. Obviously when we all looked at those horrific pictures from that night it was not easy to discern that one side was wrong and the other side was right or what was going on, there a lot of people fighting. Do you think that there are Democrats who also need to be cautioned violence is not the way to go here?
