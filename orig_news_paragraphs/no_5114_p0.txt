Michigan’s capital city rescinded its decision to declare itself a "sanctuary city" after the city council held a vote Wednesday evening regarding Lansing’s sanctuary status. [Lansing City Council voted   to reverse a decision made April 3 in a   vote that deemed the city a "sanctuary city" in writing, the Detroit Free Press reported.   A letter the city council received from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging the council to remove all references to "sanctuary city" from its resolution is behind the change in course, the Associated Press reported. The term "sanctuary city" has sparked much debate as some cities decide to fight President Trump’s decision to crack down on cities that refuse to have their law enforcement agencies cooperate with U. S. immigration authorities.
