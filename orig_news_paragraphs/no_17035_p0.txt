Washington (CNN) House Democrats are still picking up the pieces after Hillary Clintonâ€™s stunning upset on Tuesday, but are likely to keep Nancy Pelosi in place to continue charting the strategy as their top leader. Pelosi informed her colleagues in a letter on Friday that the election for leadership posts, originally expected to take place after Thanksgiving, was now scheduled for next Thursday. No member has emerged to challenge the California Democrat for the top spot, but shifting the vote up weeks earlier makes it difficult for anyone to mount a campaign to defeat her.
