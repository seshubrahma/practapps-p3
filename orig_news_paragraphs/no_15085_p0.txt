Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) President Donald Trump is well outpacing his predecessor on the green, making his 16th visit to one of his eponymous golf courses since taking office as he marks the end of another weekend at his Florida getaway. Trump was spotted Sunday driving a golf cart and making a putt at his Trump International Golf Course    the only sign of his activities at the facility since his handlers have declined to detail what heâ€™s doing inside the private establishment. President Barack Obama, also an avid golfer, waited months before playing a round when he first entered office.
