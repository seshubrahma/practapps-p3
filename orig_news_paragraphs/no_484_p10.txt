I feel completely ruined," said Ahmed Hassan, a Somali refugee heading for Rhode Island. In the past few weeks, Mr. Hassan was bused out of the camp sent to a transit center in Nairobi, Kenyaâ€™s capital, several hundred miles away given travel documents told he was about to fly to America told he was not about to fly to America bused back to the camp and then told he might actually fly to America after all. He boarded a bus in Nairobi to return to the camp just hours before the federal judge lifted the travel ban. Mr. Hassan had sold his home and feared that he could be targeted as an American sympathizer by the Islamist and   militants known to move in and out of the camps.
