July 24, 2016,  ORIGINAL STORY BELOW: The Democratic Party is officially in disarray as the chairperson of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) has announced her forthcoming resignation on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Convention, which starts on Monday, comes after the wrap of the Republican National Convention, which saw the nomination of billionaire businessman Donald J. Trump for president, along with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as the Vice Presidential candidate. The resignation announcement couldn’t have come at a worse time for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee who will likely win her party’s 2016 nomination for president —  alongside running mate Sen.
