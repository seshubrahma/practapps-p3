I was a huge Romney supporter because he was the best on immigration we had had until the dawn of Trump   —   as each Republican dropped out, Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, they would endorse anyone but Romney. They went out throwing bombs over their shoulders at Romney on the way out. So there’s always bitterness toward the guy who just beat you.
