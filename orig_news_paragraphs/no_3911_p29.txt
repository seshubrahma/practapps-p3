probably kicking and screaming —   fade into history. I just don’t see this as a dynasty like the Bush dynasty, for example, where you’ve got a sort of    generation that can potentially run for national office. The Clintons just simply don’t have that, and I think we’re going to see them fade into history, essentially.
