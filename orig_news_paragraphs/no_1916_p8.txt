But the effort was moving too slowly for the Pentagon leadership, and Mr. Carter went to Fort Meade several weeks ago to give Admiral Rogers and his team "a kick in the pants," one official said. Top national security officials had also come to see Admiral Rogers as lacking leadership at a moment of wrenching change for the N. S. A. He took command after the disclosures of widespread surveillance by Edward J. Snowden, the former N. S. A. contractor, and the efforts he directed to seal up the agency proved insufficient, they said. That perception was underlined by the disclosure in October that the F. B. I. had secretly arrested a former N. S. A. contractor, Harold T. Martin III, and was investigating whether he had stolen and disclosed highly classified computer code developed by the agency to hack into the networks of foreign governments.
