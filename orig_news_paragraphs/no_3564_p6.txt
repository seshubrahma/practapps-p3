Following President Trump’s signing of an executive order limiting refugee flows from   nations, Trudeau posted on Twitter that Canada would take in those rejected by the United States. Trudeau’s confrontational Tweet did not match Canada’s record of rejecting hundreds of foreign nationals in 2016 for a variety of national security reasons. Trudeau’s approach also does not seem to match what Canadians are seeking from him as prime minister.
