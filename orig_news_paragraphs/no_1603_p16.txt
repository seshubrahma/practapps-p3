At the funeral prayers, Mr. de Blasio said: "In Islam, the loss of a person is regarded not just as a loss for their family, but for the entire community. Thatâ€™s something we as New Yorkers understand, again across all faiths, across all neighborhoods, when a loss is felt so deeply, when it affects us all. " Several speakers implored the police to increase security efforts in the neighborhood, placing security cameras and patrols outside the mosques.
