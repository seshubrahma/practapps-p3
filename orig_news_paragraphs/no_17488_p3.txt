He and his friend Charles Erickson, both then 17, were drinking illegally at a college bar in Columbia, Missouri. About five blocks away, Columbia Tribune Sports Editor Kent Heitholt turned off his computer after a long night and left the newsroom shortly after 2 a. m. according to court documents. In the newspaper’s parking lot, someone struck Heitholt from behind and strangled him with his own belt.   Police interviewed a janitor, Jerry Trump, who said he couldn’t identify the people involved in the slaying.
