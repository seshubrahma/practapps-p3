Pattersonâ€™s announcement has the potential to launch a number of lawsuits against the federal government by county and city governments who have not been consulted by the federal government and Office of Refugee Resettlement prior to the resettlement of refugees within their jurisdiction, as the Refugee Act of 1980 requires. Two states, Alabama and Texas, have filed federal lawsuits to end refugee resettlement in their jurisdictions, but both states lost in district court. County and city governments present a vastly different legal issue because the federal government has almost universally failed to even go through the motions of "consultation" with them, as it has done with most states. As Breitbart News reported previously, "city leaders in Flint, Michigan have not been informed" by the federal government of plans to resettle 100 Syrian and Iraqi refugees there in FY 2017.
