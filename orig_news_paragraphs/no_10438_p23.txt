Granted, early signs of what Trump might do have not been promising. But anything is more promising than the absolute certainty that Hillary would follow in a    drive to control the court, including striking down the Second Amendment, supporting her unilateral efforts beyond those of President Obama to open the borders and impose climate change regulations, count illegal immigrants when drawing districts, impose restrictions on your political speech, enshrine abortion and gay marriage for another generation, and protect government employee unions’ ability to take money straight out of their members’ paychecks and spend it on candidates you  —    and sometimes they  —   loathe. In short, a Hillary Clinton presidency would mean the end of the Constitution has you understand it.
