 (CNN) Democratic senators sharply criticized President Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI director James Comey on Tuesday, with some calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian meddling into the 2016 US election and any connection to Trump’s aides. " Mr. President, with all due respect, you are making a big mistake," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters he told Trump when the President called him earlier.
