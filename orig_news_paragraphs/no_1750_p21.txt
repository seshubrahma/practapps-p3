Indeed, at a   event outside Chicago last month, Mr. Trump noted in a biting aside that Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, a Republican who opposes Mr. Trump, was on track to be defeated, according to Mr. Bergman, who attended the event. If Mr. Trump fails to recover, Republicans still question whether Mrs. Clinton is capable of piling up enough of a victory margin to pull congressional Democrats into office along with her. Mike Shields, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a "super PAC" that supports Republican House candidates, said Democrats were unlikely to win races on Mr. Trump’s weakness alone.
