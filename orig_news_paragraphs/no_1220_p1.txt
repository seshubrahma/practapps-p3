They formed a group called La Meute, or Wolfpack, created a Facebook page and invited   people to join. Within a month, they had 15, 000 followers.

Now, Mr. Beaudry and his colleagues say they are shaping those followers into   members who will give the group financial muscle and, they hope, political clout.
