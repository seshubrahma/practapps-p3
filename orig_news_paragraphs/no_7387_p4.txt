If Trump does as well as Stone expects, he said Tuesday could be the "tipping point against a brokered convention. "   He went on to describe the process by which an embittered Republican establishment could use a convention fight to steal the nomination away from Trump, assuming his only serious remaining competitor, Senator Ted Cruz, is able to take enough delegates during the primary to force a convention fight.

He described this idea as "the first step of the Big Steal," and possibly the trigger for a revolt of Republican voters against their own party establishment.
