These reports show the serious consequences of the presidentâ€™s executive order, which allows all undocumented immigrants to be categorized as criminals and requires increased enforcement in communities, rather than prioritizing dangerous criminals," California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said in a statement without supporting her claims. The statement was also reported by Fox 8 News. Democrat leaders like Feinstein and Castro do not appear to have made similar protestations following this same ICE operation in March 2015. During the operation carried out under the Obama Administration, more than 2, 000 criminal aliens were rounded up for deportation in the   Operation Cross Check.
