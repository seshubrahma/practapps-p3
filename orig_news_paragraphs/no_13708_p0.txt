Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will try to separate themselves from their competitors on Super Tuesday as both frontrunners are in line to rack up the lionâ€™s share of the delegates and build what may be insurmountable leads.   Republicans will battle for 595 delegates while Democrats have 865 delegates at stake tonight. Trump, who has won three straight nominating contests, has a   lead in the latest national   poll. And according to the RealClearPolitics average of the polls, he has commanding leads in nearly every Super Tuesday state.
