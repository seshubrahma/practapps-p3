" The White House blocked US reporters from photographing the meeting, opting to allow only White House and Russian photographers to capture images of Trumpâ€™s interactions with Lavrov. The White House official insisted it is standard practice to keep more of a lid on presidential meetings with   foreign officials, as opposed to visits from heads of state, which typically come with greater press coverage. The official also pushed back on critics who have questioned whether Trump should have met in the Oval Office with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, whose interactions with Trump campaign officials have come under scrutiny by federal and congressional investigators.
