MELBOURNE, Fla.  —    President Trump will interview four candidates on Sunday to replace his dismissed national security adviser, three of them military veterans, but one of America’s most prominent retired generals, whose name had been floated, is not in the running. A White House spokesman said on Saturday that Mr. Trump would speak with Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, a prominent military strategist Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr. the superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point and Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general already serving as acting national security adviser.
