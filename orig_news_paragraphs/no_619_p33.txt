The suit was eventually settled, but it set off investigations and misdeeds by Charles Kushner that eventually led to a   prison sentence for tax evasion,   and making illegal campaign donations. A few years later, Charles Kushner and Mr. Netanyahu still seemed close: When the Israeli media obtained Mr. Netanyahu’s partly handwritten list of wealthy Americans most likely to fund his party’s primary elections, Mr. Kushner was near the top. Last June in Washington, Yousef   the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, received an unexpected request from his friend Thomas Barrack Jr. a   businessman and Trump  : Would he meet with Jared Kushner? " What struck me in our first meeting is that he asked a lot of questions and listened," Mr. Otaiba said.
