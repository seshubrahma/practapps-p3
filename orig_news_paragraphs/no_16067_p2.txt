On Monday afternoon, the Trump campaign finally issued a statement on the matter    one that amounted more to a response to the Clinton campaign statement than an explanation of his tweet. Trump rejected the Clinton campaign’s accusations that his tweet was   by slamming "false attacks" and insisting the star represented a sheriff’s badge. " These false attacks by Hillary Clinton trying to link the Star of David with a basic star, often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior, showing an inscription that says ’Crooked Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever’ with   is ridiculous," Trump said in a statement.
