Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, likes doing bits. His presidential run last year was full of them   â€”   from a recurring set of impressions from "The Princess Bride" to an elaborate   of a scene from "Hoosiers" before the Indiana primary. (His plans were felled by an   reference to a "basketball ring" instead of a rim.)
