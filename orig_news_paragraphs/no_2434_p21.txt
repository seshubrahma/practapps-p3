While residents of Narva are mostly ethnic Russians or at least Russian speaking, nobody here wants to see a repeat of the events in eastern Ukraine, where   residents, backed by Moscow, seized power and broke away from the rest of Ukraine. Students in Mr. Mazur’s class laughed uproariously when asked whether they would ever want to live in a place like Ivangorod, the decrepit Russian town on the other side of the Narva River. " I am Russian, but I don’t feel safe in Russia," said Jevgeni Timostsuk, an events manager who frequently travels across the border.
