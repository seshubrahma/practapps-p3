The question is whether the increasingly threatening economic storm surrounding O’Reilly can be weathered. If he has made himself a permanent target of formal protest by women, and men who agree with them, it may take a whirligig of spinning in the   zone to put that down. Several veteran Fox News staff members told me this week that replacing him now should not rattle the institution as it would have in the past, because the audience for the network is so committed and loyal they merely segue to whomever is the next designated voice of the channel’s conservative narrative. Tucker Carlson moved in to replace Megyn Kelly, the   hope for a younger, perhaps less   future for FNC.
