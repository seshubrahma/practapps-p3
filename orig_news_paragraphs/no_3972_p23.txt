High immigration also reduces employers’ need to recruit disengaged Americans, to build new facilities in   areas, or to buy   machinery or to demand that local schools rebuild high school vocational training departments for the millions of youth who don’t gain much from   colleges. The resulting poverty and civic conflicts increase   support for Democrats, ensuring that more states  —   especially   California  —   are dominated by the Democratic Party’s   policies. Under Obama, the annual inflow of legal immigrants was roughly twice the inflow of illegals. Roughly 550, 000 illegals arrived in 2016, but fewer are expected in 2017, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.
