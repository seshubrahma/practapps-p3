Last summer an appeals court ruled against the law. One part of the case is before a district court, the other is currently pending before the Supreme Court.   The Texas law requires voters to present certain   photo IDs when voting in person which includes a Texas driverâ€™s license, a Texas election identification certificate, a US passport and a military identification card. Critics point out that while the state accepts a license to carry a handgun as a permissible form of ID, it does not permit federal or state government ID or student ID.
