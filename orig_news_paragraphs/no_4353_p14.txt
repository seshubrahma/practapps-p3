The Times, in its April 22 report, cited unnamed "frustrated" prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them.    Comey reportedly allowed Lynch to persuade him into publicly minimizing the FBI’s criminal investigation into Clinton’s email server. According to the same extensive April 22 report in the New York Times, Lynch, an Obama appointee, convinced Comey to use the word "matter" instead of "investigation" when the FBI director publicly addressed the criminal investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. This despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal investigation.
