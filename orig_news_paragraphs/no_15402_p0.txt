Washington  (CNN) Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins announced Monday that he plans to challenge Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia, a seat that Republicans consider within their reach in next year’s midterm elections. Jenkins, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, criticized Manchin in a nearly   announcement video, painting the incumbent senator as a Washington insider and knocking him for supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016. A former governor with deep ties to the state, Manchin has wide name recognition in West Virginia but faces   as a Democrat in a state that voted for President Donald Trump by 42 points over Clinton last November.
