Sanders says he disagrees with the analysis of his tax plan that the questioner cited. Sanders says he believes that the wealthiest people in the country and the largest corporations will start having to pay their "fair share" of taxes. Sanders claims the analysis of his tax plan did not take into account his "Medicare for all" program that will reduce the premiums Americans will pay. [Really not a good answer from Sanders for   Americans.]
