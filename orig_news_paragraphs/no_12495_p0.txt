On this week’s episode of The Milo Yiannopoulos Show, Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos was joined by Jeff Lord, a former member of the Ronald Reagan administration who served as a White House associate political director between 1987 and 1988. Lord has been called "Donald Trump’s favorite pundit" by Vox and recently engaged in a debate with Van Jones on CNN over Trump’s disavowment of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke. [  On the podcast, Lord shared his favorite memories of Ronald Reagan, recalling Reagan’s   long commercial entitled "A Time For Choosing," that was made in support of Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential bid against Lyndon Johnson. Although the speech didn’t motivate voters to elect Goldwater, it invigorated Reagan’s political career and allowed him to be elected Governor of California in 1967.
