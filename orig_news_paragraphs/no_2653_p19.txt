Fed officials are increasingly reconciled to the reality of a downturn in global interest rates that has dampened the force of the Fed’s stimulus campaign even as the Fed stands still.

The Fed remains in a better position to raise rates than other major central banks, which are struggling to drive up inflation in the face of even lower interest rates and weaker growth.
