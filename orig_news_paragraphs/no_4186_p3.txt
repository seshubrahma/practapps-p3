Speaker Ryan is showing he stands with American workers by refusing big business calls for more cheap labor. Keeping the   worker exemption out of the government funding bill puts businesses on notice that Congress will no longer turn a blind eye to the harm mass immigration causes American workers. In December,  Ryan decided to not include the "returning worker" exemption in the 2017 federal budget, after he supported it in the 2016 budget. The exemption in the 2016 budget allowed companies to exempt visas for new   workers from the annual cap of 66, 000 visas if those workers had been an   worker in the previous three years.
