North Korea, A North Korean UN official warned of nuclear war breaking out if tensions don’t ease between his country and the US. Now, we’re used to war rhetoric of all kinds from the North Koreans, but the Trump administration’s recent moves    saying it was ending the policy of "strategic patience" and sending an aircraft   strike group to the Korean peninsula     has caused the North to up the ante in its tough talk. Meanwhile, Trump seems to be dangling a carrot of better trade terms in front of China in an effort to coax the Chinese to exert more influence on North Korea.
