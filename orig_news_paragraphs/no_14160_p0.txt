Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump took executive action Friday on curbing access visas and limiting refugees coming to the US. Titled "Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States," the action institutes what the President has called "extreme vetting" of immigrants.   According to drafts of the executive action obtained by CNN, it suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated "only for nationals of countries for whom" members of Trumpâ€™s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted.
