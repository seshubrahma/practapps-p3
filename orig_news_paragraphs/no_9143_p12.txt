Republican Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, but even Obama is admitting now that black turnout in the state is way down. Obama is making two trips to North Carolina for Clinton in the final week of the campaign, and the Clinton campaign has strategically made the state its Waterloo as it’s bringing out the heaviest firepower it has there. North Carolina has 15 electoral votes, and if Trump can lock those in, along with Florida’s 29 electoral votes —  as well as the states he already seems to have in Nevada, Ohio, and Iowa —   he will be, along with the red states, at around 265 electoral votes, just shy of the 270 mark.
