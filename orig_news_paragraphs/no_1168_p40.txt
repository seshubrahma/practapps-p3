Mr. O’Reilly is not a defendant, but in the suit Ms. Tantaros said that in early 2016 Mr. O’Reilly had asked "her to come to stay with him on Long Island where it would be ‘very private,’" and told her "on more than one occasion that he could ‘see [her] as a wild girl,’" according to court documents. In an affidavit filed under oath, Ms. Tantaros’s psychologist, Michele Berdy, who treated her from 2013 to 2016, said she recalled "a number of occasions when Andrea complained to me about recurring unwanted advances from Bill O’Reilly. " Fox News said it investigated Ms. Tantaros’s claims and found them baseless.
