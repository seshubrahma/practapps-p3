Yes, most congressional Republicans accepted intelligence and law enforcement officials’ conclusions that Russia meddled in the presidential campaign and orchestrated the hack of Democratic groups. And in light of the latest findings, both Republicans and Democrats have issued calls for a deeper probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The calls began with a letter signed by the incoming Senate Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, Armed Services Committee chairman Sen. John McCain, Sen. Lindsey Graham and the Armed Services Committee’s ranking member Sen. Jack Reed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued his own call for a congressional investigation of the Russian hacking in a press conference Monday, in a notable break with Trump.
