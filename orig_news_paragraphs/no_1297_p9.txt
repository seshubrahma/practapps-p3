Depending on the voucher program, the rights being waived can include the right to a free education the right to the same level of   services that a child would be eligible for in a public school the right to a   or   teacher and the right to a hearing to dispute disciplinary action against a child. Itâ€™s not just Florida. Private school choice programs in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee and Wisconsin also require parents to waive all or most IDEA rights. In several other states, the law is silent on the disability rights of voucher students.
