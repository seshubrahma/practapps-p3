The White House laid out the plan this way: While much of the country has recovered from the recent recession, large areas of rural America have not fared as well.   Nationally, 85 percent of persistently impoverished counties are in rural areas, and one in four rural children is growing up in poverty.   The employment numbers continue to lag, and without connectivity and improved infrastructure widely available, the population in rural America is at its lowest point since 2010. The Task Force is working to improve quality of life for people living in rural areas, develop a reliable workforce, spur innovation and technology development, and roll back regulations to allow communities to grow and thrive.
