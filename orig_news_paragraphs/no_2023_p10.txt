During his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Rouhani, apparently trying to fend off the attacks, emphasized that ultimately it was the nationâ€™s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who had led the negotiations and signed off on the deal. " We took no step in the issue of the nuclear agreement without consulting the supreme leader," he said. Ayatollah Khamenei has often criticized the deal publicly, but analysts agree that without his specific consent, a compromise with the United States and other global powers would never have been reached.
