In the meantime, if we take another look at that 1828 map, we can see that the electoral wins for Jacksonâ€™s opponent that year, Adams, were almost entirely confined to New England, the hub of Yankee Protestantism. And of course, we know that in 2016, Hillary Clinton, too, won New England overwhelmingly. So again, we see a continuity: From Adams to Clinton, New England is typically on the other side of the Jacksonian Coalition. We can dub these   the Yankee Coalition.
