There also might be a claim of a "conflict of interest" because of Muellerâ€™s personal relationship through the years with Comey and possibly with many of the other potential subjects of his investigation. So far none of these claims appear to rise to the level of what lawyers and the court system would label a true conflict of interest. Lots of people have worked together and know each other in the higher echelons of government and that fact alone is not really a legitimate conflict of interest.   A true claim of a Comey "conflict of interest" would require proof  that Mueller and Comey had a longstanding personal friendship that would clearly impede the impartiality of the special counsel.
