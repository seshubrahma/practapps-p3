On some bipartisan goals, the president will have to seize the chance to pick up some Democratic votes as well. To succeed in his use of executive power, the president will need to be more deft in drafting orders that will not be challenged in court.

To avoid being trapped in endless investigations, Mr. Trump will have to tone down his war of words with intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
