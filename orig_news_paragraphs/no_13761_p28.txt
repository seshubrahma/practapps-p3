If youâ€™re an ideological conservative, would you prefer a chief executive who goes Medieval on his political opponents to achieve 75 percent of what you believe, or an unaccomplished   who agrees with you 100 percent of the time, but lacks the   to implement any of it? Like many conservatives, my personal ideology overlapped with Cruz more than Trump.   But it did concern me that Cruz completely lacked any executive experience and was almost entirely lacking business experience.   For Cruz, capitalism was a philosophy, not a   application.
