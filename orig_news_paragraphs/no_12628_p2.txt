Dorsey and McKesson have been close friends for years now, with Twitter even directly donating to McKesson’s failed Baltimore mayoral campaign. More recently, the pair shared the stage at Recode’s annual tech conference, conducting a joint QA on Twitter.   Black Lives Matter supporters have violated multiple Twitter terms of service rules with absolute impunity,  from celebrating the deaths of police officers and calling for more to die to open support of the Baton Rouge cop killers, these tweets and many more have been allowed across the platform with no repercussion. Many of the tweets are still up, and the users have not received any punishment.
