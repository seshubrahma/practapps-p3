[That’s why I must respectfully disagree with Andy Schlafly, son of the late and great Phyllis Schlafly, whose vocal opposition to almost all of the candidates on President Trump’s list has caused confusion and consternation among   activists. Schlafly claims there is only one candidate among the 21 on the President’s list worthy of his endorsement.   Even candidates like 11th Circuit Judge William Pryor, who has decried Roe v. Wade as the "worst abomination in the history of constitutional law" and as having "led to the slaughter of millions of innocent unborn children," do not satisfy Schlafly’s qualifications. Pryor has won my approval, and has strong backing from Federalist Society, Alliance Defending Freedom and others whose opinion I highly value.
