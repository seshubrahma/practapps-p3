His concerns were not without basis    North Korea’s test missiles have regularly fallen near Japan. As recently as March 6, North Korea launched four intermediate missiles into waters off Japan, three of which landed in its Exclusive Economic Zone, and less than 200 nautical miles away from the Japanese city of Oga.   Shortly after, the city held the nation’s first ever evacuation drill to prepare for future North Korean missile launches. Meanwhile, in his visit to Tokyo on Tuesday, US Vice President Mike Pence reassured Abe that the US is "100 percent" with Japan on North Korea.
