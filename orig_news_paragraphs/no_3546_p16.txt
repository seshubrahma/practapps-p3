Moon is already known as a skeptic of THAAD deployment, with his campaign describing the decision of his impeached predecessor Park   to install the system "strongly regrettable" and "very inappropriate" because she did not properly consult with parliament. Moon has called for an immediate halt to the deployment of the THAAD system, which has increased tensions between South Korea and China. Chinese boycotts over THAAD have cost South Korea enough money to raise concerns about the future of South Korea’s economic recovery. China objects to the deployment because it believes THAAD’s powerful radars will be employed to spy on Chinese activity.
