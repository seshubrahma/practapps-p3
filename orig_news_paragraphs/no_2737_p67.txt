This comic drama, which turned up on Seeso in May, is almost indescribably off kilter and anchored by a terrific performance by Olivia Coleman. The matriarch of the titular Flowers family, she teaches music and balances on the edge of sanity. Her husband writes childrenâ€™s books that a drunk Dr. Seuss might have produced. Their    twins, Donald and Amy, still live at home, and both have romantic designs on the female neighbor next door.
