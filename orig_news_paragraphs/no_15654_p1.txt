The Justice Department earlier this month appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to handle the investigation into all matters related to Russian involvement in the election, including potential collusion with Trump’s associates and potential attempts to influence the investigation. Kushner has also drawn increased scrutiny in recent months, as reports have showed that he met with a representative of a Russian bank under US sanctions prior to Trump’s inauguration and failed to disclose the meeting.   The Senate intelligence committee signaled in March that it was reviewing information about Kushner’s Russian contacts and his role arranging meetings. At the time, Kushner offered to meet with the committee voluntarily.
