The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reports that America has not seen sustained growth rates of 4% (a rate optimistic Trumpians target) since the early 1960s, when our population was younger and growing.    Even if growth were to spike up quickly to these   levels, interest rates, still historically low, would certainly rise. This would doubly hurt the federal government, because it would have more debt to finance, due to the tax cuts, and at higher interest rates.     As is, the federal government spends more on interest payments on its debt than on education, energy and the environment, international affairs, and science    combined.
