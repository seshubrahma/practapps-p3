Mr. Trump pledged that on his first day in office he would give notice that the United States intends to withdraw from the   Partnership, a trade agreement the Obama administration negotiated with other Pacific Rim nations that is awaiting ratification.

If not, they may pursue regional trade deals that exclude the United States.
