Indeed, as Don Rosenberg —   whose    son, Andrew, was repeatedly run over by an illegal alien as he sought to flee the scene of the crime —   has explained, many illegal immigrants have been caught for previous crimes prior to their murdering American citizens. In a 2014 letter to President Obama, Rosenberg wrote: Roberto Galo had been caught driving without a license shortly before he killed my son but his car was impounded for 18 hours (state law requires 30 days) and then the charges were dropped  …      Glenn Vierra was killed by Jorge   who had been caught driving without a license four times before killing Vierra. He was never considered a threat to public safety even after he killed Vierra as he was only charged with a misdemeanor.
