First Solar struggled with improving Chinese technology as well as dropping prices. It laid off workers in Perrysburg partly because it decided not to produce its Series 5 generation of panels, which represented a limited improvement over its existing Series 4 panels. First Solar, to better compete with Chinese producers, will wait for its     Series 6 panels to be ready for production in 2018. In the end, First Solar, which is based in Tempe, Ariz. laid off 1, 600 people worldwide.
