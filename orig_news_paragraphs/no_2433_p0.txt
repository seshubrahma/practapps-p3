LONDON   —    The government of Britain could need six more months to settle on a plan for negotiating the country’s exit from the European Union and an extra 30, 000 civil servants to deal with the complexities of the task, according to a memo of uncertain parentage leaked to The Times of London on Tuesday. The office of Prime Minister Theresa May poured cold water on the memo, denying reports that it was prepared for the government.
