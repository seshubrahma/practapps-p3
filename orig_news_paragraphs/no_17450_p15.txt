The occupation myth relies on the fact that the UN has continually condemned the Israeli ’occupation,’ and people mistakenly believe that the UN’s resolutions are internationally binding. The truth is that according to Article 10 of the UN ’s own Charter, General Assembly Resolutions are generally not binding, and do not create international law. UN Security Council Resolutions are theoretically binding in limited circumstances, when the Council is using its UN Charter Chapter VII powers, which deal with threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, or acts of aggression, but the Security Council has never made such a declaration regarding Israel.
