The polls generally both overstated Trump’s support and underestimated Cruz’s support. Polls by Emerson and ARG were the most incorrect, showing a   race, within the margin of error, between Cruz and Trump. For those keeping score at home, those polls were off by more than 15 points. The   poll was the closest to nailing the actual levels of support for Trump and Cruz, although they missed the final margin by four points.
