City fire department uses about 175 goats.   They helped patrol 27 acres of vegetation with their teeth, leaving little behind for a potential fire to chew on, taking a bite out of danger. So, maybe they don’t actually breathe fire, but as long as they keep their chins up and the undergrowth under grown, residents probably won’t mind being goaded into reaching safety goats by employing these goat to weapons in the bahhhttle against blazes.
