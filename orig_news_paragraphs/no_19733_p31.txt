Federalism is a political orientation, not a body of   policy prescriptions. The negotiation of power between national and state governments —  and, relatedly, between state and local governments —  is complicated and partisan. Larger bodies of government, led by Democrats and Republicans alike, often threaten smaller bodies with litigation or funding cuts if they don’t follow certain policies. During the Reagan years, the federal government famously used this method to get states to comply with its policy on the legal drinking age.
