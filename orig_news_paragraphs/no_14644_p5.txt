Trump focused on the need to build a wall along the   border, and for much of his campaign, called for deporting all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US. The closest he came to calling for a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants was in his calls to allow the "good ones" who had been deported to reenter the US through an expedited, legal process. Democrats on the Hill may be open to working with the administration on a compromise, sources said    but healthy skepticism remained about Trump’s true intentions on Tuesday and lawmakers signaled they’d want to see more from the President, and less aggressive immigration enforcement actions, before they believed him.     Tackling immigration reform would be another massive legislative endeavor, piling on top of Trump’s already ambitious goals of repealing and replacing Obamacare and passing a tax reform package. It would perhaps be the ultimate test of Trump’s   credentials, which he touted daily on the campaign trail.
