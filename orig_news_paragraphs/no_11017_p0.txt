In a final warning to the American people ahead of Tuesday’s election, the nation’s frontline immigration officers are calling upon voters to reject Hillary Clinton and her "radical" open borders vision that will "unleash" violence in American communities and "cause countless preventable deaths. " [Although the nation’s border emergency goes virtually unreported by "  media," Clinton’s immigration policies would greatly exacerbate the crisis, the officers warn in a statement written by the president of the National ICE Council, which represents the nation’s roughly 5, 000 frontline ICE officers, agents, and personnel.   " Hillary’s pledge for ‘open borders’ will mean disaster for our country, and turn the present border emergency into a cataclysm," writes ICE Council President Chris Crane.
