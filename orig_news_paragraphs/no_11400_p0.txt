The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence sent a March 9 email alert urging opposition to Donald Trump for his   stance on "concealed carry" and because of his support for allowing teachers to defend themselves and their students on school campuses. [Trump will "arm school teachers allow hidden, loaded guns on college campuses and give every person the green light to carry a concealed weapon anytime, anywhere, no questions asked," the email claims.   Trump’s real goal is not safety, but to "sell more guns," claims the campaign. To make this point, they leave out the fact that the   and bloodiest attacks in recent memory took place in areas where   zones predominate  —   Paris and California.
