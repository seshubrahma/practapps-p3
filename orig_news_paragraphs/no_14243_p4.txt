A US official told CNN that an al Qaeda leader was also killed in the battle.   Officials from multiple countries tell CNN that special forces from the UAE took part in the raid on the al Qaeda compound, which the military said was geared towards collecting as much intelligence on the terror group as possible in order to facilitate future raids and strikes against the organization. Al Qaeda’s Yemeni affiliate is thought to be among the terror group’s most capable franchises, having helped direct the 2015 attack on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper offices in Paris.    UAE troops successfully drove al Qaeda from the Yemeni port city of Mukalla, an act that officials said has made striking the terror group easier as it is now based in more rural areas free of civilians.
