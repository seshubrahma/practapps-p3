Voters are finally allowed to ask: Do we want to live in a country where barbaric practices  —   such as beheadings, animal sacrifice, and female genital mutilation   —   take place? Do we want our children to learn "the value of diversity" instead of math, reading, science, writing, and American history? The media can no longer cover up these stories so easily, and political correctness lost much of its power over the immigration debate.
