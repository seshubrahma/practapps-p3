I’ve reviewed that tape a number of times. Notwithstanding what Rudy Guiliani just said, it’s very clear what Donald Trump was implying, namely that gun people could wreak violence against Hillary Clinton. And against the history of assassinations in the United States of presidents and against the more recent history of indiscriminate gun violence and tragedy on a grand scale, it’s unthinkable that any candidate for president would make such a statement. And it only reinforces again what so many of us have been saying, that Donald Trump is possessed of an unbalanced mind.
