The carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But it said it would invest in a different Michigan plant to expand production of   vehicles, including its   pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new   sport utility vehicle. " We are encouraged by the   policies that   Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue," said the companyâ€™s chief executive, Mark Fields.
