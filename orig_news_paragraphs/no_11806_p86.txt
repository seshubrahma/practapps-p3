" UPDATE 7:05 P. M. ET, Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, says that todayâ€™s events show how much of an "uphill climb" that the Democrats have in unifying their party behind Hillary Clinton. He noted that divisions inside the Democratic Party are deep, something that the media have mostly ignored throughout the election. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon, meanwhile, on MSNBC is being shouted down live by Sanders supporters in the background as he praises Wasserman Schultz.
