The group has been under congressional investigation for the past year following the release of videos that alleged Planned Parenthood harvests the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and sells them for a profit. The abortion chain spent about $30 million trying to elect Democrats and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 races. Trump has vowed to appoint   Supreme Court justices and has said Planned Parenthood should not receive federal funding if it continues to provide abortions. State legislatures have passed laws to eliminate   abortions and improve safety standards for women in abortion clinics who choose to undergo the procedure.
