In his 1848 address to the Democratic Association of Brussels, Marx declared that he was "in favor of free trade" because of its destructive capabilities for hastening social revolution: The free trade system is destructive. It breaks up old nationalities and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution.
