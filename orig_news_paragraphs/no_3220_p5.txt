The appointments have come with the usual media backlash that the Trump Administration has grown accustomed to. CNN, for instance, has written that Feere and Kirchnerâ€™s appointments have "alarmed" the open borders lobby. The network propped up opposition to the appointments through the   Southern Poverty Law Center, with Director Heidi Beirich claiming that that the Center for Immigration Studies and FAIR publish "racist" and "xenophobic" reports. Krikorian, though, said the open borders lobby is only outraged because they know how effective both nominees could be.
