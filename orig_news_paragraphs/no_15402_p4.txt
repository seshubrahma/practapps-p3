Since Trump was elected, Manchin has sought to work with the president on a number of issues, even bucking his own party at times to support many of Trump’s picks for his Cabinet and the Supreme Court.   Jenkins also sought to align himself with Trump in the new video by including footage of him standing behind Trump at the White House when the President signed a law to repeal an   rule on the coal industry. (Manchin, along with West Virginia lawmakers, was at the same photo opportunity, but was not included in Jenkins’ video.) Manchin is seeking a second full term.
