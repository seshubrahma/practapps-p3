By the end of the case, Mr. Trump’s top lawyer, Jay Goldberg, apologized for seeking to oust Justice Lowe from the proceedings, promising to never level such accusations against him again. But when the litigation was going on, Mr. Goldberg forcefully challenged Justice Lowe’s "fitness to serve in a judicial capacity," accused him of "unwarranted bias toward Trump" and said that, "at every turn, Justice Lowe has shown that he is unable to comply with his duties," according to a 2009 complaint Mr. Goldberg submitted to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct. Mr. Goldberg, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Trump, claimed that Justice Lowe had betrayed a bias against Mr. Trump on two occasions. The first, he said, was when Justice Lowe declared, in his chambers and in the presence of a lawyer for Mr. Trump, that he would not allow Mr. Trump’s presence in the courtroom to intimidate him.
