While this blanket statement cannot possibly be completely true or completely false, it expresses an assessment of what it takes to get ahead in America. One’s basic belief or disbelief in the fundamental importance of hard work as being a key to economic success does not make a person a racist. According to Merriam Webster’s definition, in fact, it is racist to believe that race is the "primary determinant" of people’s capacities. Therefore, making race more important than hard work for personal advancement would be an indicator of racism, and not the other way around.
