On Wednesday, The Associated Press reported new details of Mr. Manafortâ€™s activities in Ukraine, including a proposal he is said to have drafted in 2005 to do similar work for   interests in other former Soviet republics. The plan was presented to a Russian oligarch with whom Mr. Manafort had a business relationship, Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia who agreed to pay Mr. Manafort $10 million for the work. It is unclear how far the plan got or whether money changed hands. Mr. Manafort issued a statement denying he did any work for the Russian government.
