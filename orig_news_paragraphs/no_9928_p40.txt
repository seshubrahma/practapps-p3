My daughter and I got to meet him at his big rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania, recently. Though, the meetings have been few, Trump has always been amazing. But, if you don’t want to believe me, I can recommend some people you can talk to. Trump’s children, his employees such as Lynne Patton and Katrina Pierson, and his supporters including Sarah Palin and Ben Carson all know Mr. Trump very well.
