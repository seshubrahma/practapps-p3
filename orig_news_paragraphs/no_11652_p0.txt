Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 horse race. Indiana is effectively a closeout contest for Donald Trump, who can effectively all but end the GOP nominating contest by winning the lion’s share of the Hoosier State’s 57 delegates with a resounding victory.

A Sanders win in Indiana will not change anything for Democrats since Sanders and Clinton will probably split the state’s delegates, but a Clinton victory may put more pressure on Sanders to exit the race.
