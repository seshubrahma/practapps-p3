For this election, the government has tightened security further, after reports that   hackers were trying to gain access to government computers late last year. In what the Dutch are calling the "  principle," each vote will be counted and verified by two people at the polling station. Tallies will then be recorded by hand and initially sent by text message to the municipality. The ballots and tally sheets will then be physically delivered to municipal voting centers so that the counts can be   and verified.
