We might think of those words in considering how little attention   in our history books is given to our presidents’ very limited   roles in standing up to atrocities overseas. ’ ’    And yet now, as Obama’s presidency winds down, and a ceasefire   begins to take effect Syria that Washington played no role in   negotiating, it’s becoming clear that the loss of life and   the humanitarian crisis represent just the first of many   consequences that historians will have to assess as they ask how   the United States, under Obama’s leadership, chose to deal, or   not to deal, with the Syrian Civil War. And if historians tend to   give presidents a pass on failing to arrest slaughter, they are   not so generous in evaluating the loss of American influence   around the world.
