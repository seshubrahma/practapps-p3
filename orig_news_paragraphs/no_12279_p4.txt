Companies, universities and government agencies currently employ a population of more than 1 million foreign   "guest workers," who are usually hired without any chance for Americans to apply for the U. S. jobs. These foreign professionals are not immigrants, but are temporary workers slated to return home to Europe, India, China or elsewhere after six or seven years. The population includes roughly 650, 000     professionals, plus several hundred thousand additional foreign college graduates holding     or NAFTA visas, plus at least 120, 000 foreign graduates in the expanded OPT program. These foreign graduates are eager to take U. S. jobs, even at very low salaries, partly because the U. S. government supplements their salaries with the chance to win the very valuable reward of U. S. citizenship for themselves, their children, siblings and parents.
