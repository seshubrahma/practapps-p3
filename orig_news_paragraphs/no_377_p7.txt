We are of course concerned that this issue may affect scientists and students traveling to Boston," said Tiffany Lohwater, an official with the association. She said the organization was considering alternative measures, including free   of sessions, for those who could not attend. Jennifer Golbeck, a professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, said her department had a number of Iranian students and researchers. Using social media, Dr. Golbeck in recent days has organized a database of people willing to shelter scientists and others who were in transit to the United States and were halted by the order.
