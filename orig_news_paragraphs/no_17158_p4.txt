In a lengthy article Wednesday, the North Korean   news agency KCNA accused Washington of going "so far as to breach the basic principles of international laws and ditch its dignity of a superpower by pleading with other countries to join their pressure racket against (North Korea) through downgrading or severing ties with it. "  Japan is the 33rd country with which South Korea has signed a military deal. Under the agreement, which takes place immediately, all confidential and secret information can be shared between the countriesâ€™ intelligence agencies. The deal does not cover top secret information.
