The Department of Justice —  led by Attorney General Loretta Lynch —  has come under fire, as has the FBI, in recent months as questions have arisen over whether the criminal investigation into Clinton’s illicit home brew email server was conducted properly. After Lynch’s secret meeting on the tarmac at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International Airport with Hillary Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, and now the revelations that the FBI reportedly considered a "quid pro quo" with the Clintons over the emails, the decision not to indict Hillary Clinton for her reckless conduct has outraged the public. The revelation that a vast majority of DOJ officials donating cash to presidential candidates gave to Clinton over Trump is not likely to help their case. This revelation was part of a bigger story from the Hill, in which Swan details how government workers have given about $2 million to presidential candidates this cycle —  and nearly all of it, $1. 9 million, has gone to Hillary Clinton.
