Without getting too far into the weeds on process, it is impossible for Obama to renegotiate any of the TPP and then   it to Congress in time for approval before he leaves office. Procedurally speaking, the TPP is dead and buried —  and can’t be brought back to life until the next administration. That means that the voters of the country will get a referendum vote when it comes to this trade agenda: A vote for Donald Trump for president would mean a complete evisceration of the TPP and an entirely new approach to trade policy. A vote for Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, would be a vote to repackage and rename the TPP, and ram it through to congressional passage, all the exact same approach we have seen for the last several decades since the rise of the Bushes in the GOP and the Clintons in the Democratic Party.
