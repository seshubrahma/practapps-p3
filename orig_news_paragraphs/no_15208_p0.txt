 (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday he was not disrespecting Hawaii or a judge in the state when he said he was "amazed" that the official was able to block President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban halting immigration from several majority Muslim countries. " I wasn’t criticizing the judge or the island," he told CNN’s Kate Bolduan on "At This Hour."
