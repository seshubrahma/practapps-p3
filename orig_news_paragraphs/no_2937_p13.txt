Half of Americans surveyed in an   Street Journal poll last week approved of how the   was preparing for the job, a figure far lower than when it was asked of Mr. Clinton in 1992 (77 percent) and Mr. Obama in 2008 (73 percent). Democrats, after a period of shell shock from their loss, say they will offer a   resistance. Mr. Trump’s cabinet selections so far, and his refusal to acknowledge Russian efforts to affect the election, have only solidified Democrats’ resolve. But resolve will also confront a reality: Republicans control both chambers of Congress and are in sync with Mr. Trump on many issues.
