Kislyak reportedly told   in Moscow that Kushner suggested the proposal in a meeting at Trump Tower    which former national security adviser Michael Flynn also attended    in December. Kushner "suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications," the Post reported. The idea was to have Flynn "speak directly with a senior military official in Moscow to discuss Syria and other security issues," The New York Times reported, citing three people with knowledge of the discussion. Reached Friday, an administration official said there would be no comment on the latest Kushner report.
