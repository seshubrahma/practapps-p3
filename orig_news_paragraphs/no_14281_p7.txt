Under the proposed law, a school disciplinary hearing can only take place if a criminal investigation has been launched, a key departure from how things currently work. The proposal also prevents interim disciplinary measures from taking effect until a criminal investigation has been launched, another contrast to how administrative hearings currently operate. The bill is the latest to address the critique that schools should "be in the business of educating, not investigating sexual assaults," as HB 51’s Republican sponsor, Rep. Earl Ehrhart, put it.   It’s a position that clashes with state and federal law as well as best practices for a   approach to helping sexual assault survivors.
