Rubio, on the other hand, can’t because he is presenting himself as Mr. "   Correct " so attacks like that make him seem more like a phony and goes against the core of his brand. Rubio and his allies may be cheering his debate performance and "cute soundbites," but they may not realize he is coming across as "that guy" who desperately hurls insult after insult at the guy who is dating the girl he has always wanted. It’s funny that Rubio’s allies in the permanent   class seem way more like "that guy" than the guy who gets the girl, and that is why they are myopically   each other over Rubio’s performance.
