Resolved, That after the oath shall have been administered to the President, he, attended by the Vice President and members of the Senate and House of Representatives, shall proceed to St. Paulâ€™s Chapel, to hear divine service. This chapel is now known as "the little church that stood". It still stands as the oldest Church in NYC across the street from the World Trade Center. It is here that Washington spent four hours in prayer and made a covenant with God.
