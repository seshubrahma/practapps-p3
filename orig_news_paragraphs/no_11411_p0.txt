Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore showed up at Trump Tower in New York City on Saturday seeking a    meeting with   Donald Trump. ["I’m going to join the people who’ve formed a protest of this racist, sociopath on his way to the White House," Moore said in a Facebook live video that has received more than a million views.   Moore, a   activist who predicted Trump’s victory, attempted to enter Trump Tower at around 1:00 p. m. wearing a San Francisco 49ers cap. After Moore attempted to walk inside the building, security told him he would need to go to the back of the line and be searched before he could enter.
