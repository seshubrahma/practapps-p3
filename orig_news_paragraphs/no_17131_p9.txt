Juppe, 71, is the current mayor of Bordeaux who also served as prime minister from 1995 to 1997 under President Jacques Chirac. He’s considered a moderate who promises to promote a "happy national identity" if he comes to power.   Juppe has also promised economic reform, effective border control within and outside Europe, an end to the   work week, and more investment in security and the fight against terrorism. Because of the unpopularity of President Francois Hollande’s socialist party, the Republican nominee will likely face Le Pen in the final round of the presidential race in May.
