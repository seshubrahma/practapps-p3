Lord and Yiannopoulos drew parallels between Reagan and Donald Trump with regards to their rejection of party establishment values. Yiannopoulos called for Trump to begin to act more like a statesman as we move towards November and asked Lord to suggest ways in which Trump could ensure his victory against Clinton. Lord claimed that it would be in Trumpâ€™s best interest to continue giving speeches like the one he gave at AIPAC, where he discussed the Iran Deal, the United Nations, and Israel. Lord also claimed that Trump is likely to publish a list of individuals he is likely to pick as Supreme Court nominees if he were to be elected president.
