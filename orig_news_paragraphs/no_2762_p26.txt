But this isn’t a regionalism issue. The "solid red" and "solid blue" states where Mr. Trump failed to make gains include a clear majority of the country’s Electoral College votes, population and actual votes. The regional anomaly was the Midwest, and it just so happens that in a    system Mr. Trump’s strength in the Midwestern battleground states yielded a lot of Electoral College votes. There’s a real demographic reason for it: Most of the traditional battleground states are much whiter, less educated and particularly less Hispanic than the rest of the country.
