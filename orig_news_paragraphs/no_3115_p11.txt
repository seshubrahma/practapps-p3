It would have worked just fine without the disputed anecdote, but then it would have lacked the "White House political operators bullying Cabinet officials" angle.   (Especially this particular White House political operative, Bannon, having assumed totemic stature among adversarial media, and adversarial media having returned from an   hiatus on the morning of November 9th, 2016.) The Post’s failure to consult the people actually involved in the alleged showdown between Bannon and Kelly is cast in an especially poor light by the speed of the administration’s response to their post. How can reporters and editors justify not even trying to solicit a comment from the White House on an explosive story from anonymous sources?
