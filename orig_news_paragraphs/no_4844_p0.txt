On Friday afternoon, Egyptian warplanes attacked militant camps in eastern Libya to retaliate for the slaughter of 28 Coptic Christians by masked gunmen. ["The officials said the warplanes on Friday targeted the headquarters of the Shura Council in the city of Darna, where local militias are known to be linked to   not the Islamic State group," ABC News reports.   No formal claim of responsibility for the bus attack has been made yet, but it is widely suspected to be the bloody handiwork of the Islamic Stateâ€™s Egyptian franchise. The BBC cites Egyptian media reports that six strikes hit the town of Derna in Libya.
