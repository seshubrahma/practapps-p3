Secretary Mattis also noted that "there’s very little doubt" that Russia has "either interfered or they have attempted to interfere in a number of elections" in the United States and other democracies. During his confirmation hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee in January, retired Gen. Mattis described Russia as one of the "principal threats" facing the United States. Nevertheless, he indicated that he supports U. S. engagement with the Kremlin. Mattis told lawmakers: When we identify other areas where we cannot cooperate, we must confront Russia’s behavior and defend ourselves if Russia chooses to act contrary to our interests.
