But what on earth has he done to merit one? If the GOP gives Ryan the presidential nomination at the national convention, I could never vote for him. Despite the fact that by a nearly    margin, Republican voters believe   "free trade" deals lower wages rather than raise them, Paul Ryan was President Obama’s "partner" in pushing to give Obama executive authority to fast track his   Partnership (TPP) agreement. As Breitbart News has previously reported, in his role as House Speaker, Paul Ryan funded entirely, and even expanded, President Obama’s immigration agenda.
