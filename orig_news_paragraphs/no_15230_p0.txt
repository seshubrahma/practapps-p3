 (CNN) To fund a wall, or not to fund a wall? That is the question President Donald Trump and White House officials can’t seem to answer clearly. After Trump told a group of conservative reporters Monday evening that he wasn’t fixated on getting funding for his border wall in the current budget negotiations, White House officials insisted Tuesday that Trump was not backing down on securing funding for the border wall in the FY 2017 budget that must get through Congress on Friday to avoid a government shutdown.
