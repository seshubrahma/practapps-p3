This thing costs many billions, and weâ€™re working on a   plan of prioritization so it would be spread out over years in order to gradually build it, but to complete it to defend the State of Israel," Netanyahu added. Israel began construction of the security barrier in 2002 at the height of the Second Palestinian Intifada, or terrorist war of shootings and suicide bombings targeting Israeli civilians.   That intifada was launched after PLO leader Yasser Arafat rejected an Israeli offer of a Palestinian state during U. S.  negotiations in the summer of 2000. Upon the completion of a significant continuous section of the security fence in 2003, Israel already saw a marked decrease in the number of suicide bombers able to penetrate Israeli cities.
