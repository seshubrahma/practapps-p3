To the issue, Donald Trump defends his use of eminent domain for development purposes by misconstruing his proposed use. While happily admitting that he used the "takings" power to fight with a woman in Atlantic City who refused to give him her property so that he could expand a hotel, he then intentionally dodges the core objection, by arguing, "without it we wouldnâ€™t have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines. " Shockingly, Trump seems to argue that because eminent domain exists, the people must ignore and sanction its misuse.
