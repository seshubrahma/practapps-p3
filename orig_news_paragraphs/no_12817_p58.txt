" Rubio thanks Iowans because he has taken the first step to winning the GOP nomination and promises that when he is the nominee, "we are going to unify this party and we are going to unify the conservative movement" and "grow the conservative movement" by taking our message to people who are "struggling paycheck to paycheck" and bring them to our side. He also thanks "  and mighty God" and his family. He said he wants to congratulate Cruz for earning his victory and thanks Huckabee as well.
