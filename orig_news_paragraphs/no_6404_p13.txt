It was February 2 that Nordstrom’s announced it would stop carrying Trump’s line due to sales numbers according to NBC News. The news came despite the internal email from just over two months earlier that assured they would continue carrying it. One day after the announcement, though the company has spoken of remaining apolitical, an internal company email indicated otherwise. The February 3 email referenced President Trump’s executive order restricting travel from seven countries.
