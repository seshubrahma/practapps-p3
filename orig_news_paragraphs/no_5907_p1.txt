Progressive Hubris, Sally Kohn probably knew her tweet wasnâ€™t true when she sent it. Given the fear and hysteria whipped up by Kohn and her ilk, anyone could have predicted the anger, tears, and rioting from progressives that followed the election of Donald Trump. I suspect Kohn sent out this tweet because she was confident, as so many in the media bubble were, that he was never going to be elected President. How could such a thing happen?
