Refugee groups relieved, Refugee resettlement agencies across the US welcomed Robart’s ruling. " President Trump’s ban against refugees and Muslims was not only   but Judge Robart found it to be unconstitutional," Mark Hetfield, president and CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, told CNN on Saturday. " Thanks to Judge Robart’s order protecting the Constitution, thousands of refugees who were bound for the US can finally find protection    and a warm welcome    here."
