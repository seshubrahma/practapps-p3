The reality remains that Trump wants to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement and could impose a hefty tax on Canada’s softwood lumber. His recent executive order banning immigration from specified majority Muslim nations is unpopular in Canada (which has accepted some 40, 000 Syrian refugees) but has made national security the signature of his young presidency. This is where things become sticky for Trudeau: He must balance Canada’s interests (trade, investment, jobs) against its values (diversity, open immigration, collective security). Canada is a progressive, moderate society that has adopted universal health care, embraced gay marriage and abortion, and ended capital punishment.
