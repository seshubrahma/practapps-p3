When Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain came for what appeared to be a largely successful visit, Mr. Trumpâ€™s first by the leader of a close ally, she spoke of maintaining sanctions on Russia until it met its commitments on Ukraine. Mr. Trump stayed silent. After he spoke the next day to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the official readout provided by the White House made no mention of Ukraine, or of the   operation to influence the American election that led President Barack Obama, in his last days in office, to issue new sanctions. Perception is different from reality.
