Mr. Helland worries about his dam every day. Last year, a family of six drove their pleasure boat down the spillway and four people died. Recently a contractor hit the dam and broke another wicket (cost: $20, 000) adding a   hole to many   holes and a   hole. Each hole makes it harder for the dam to hold back water.
