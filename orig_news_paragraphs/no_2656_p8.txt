Goldman’s links to the Clintons date to the 1990s, when Robert E. Rubin, the company’s   partner, left to join President Bill Clinton’s economic policy team. Economically and politically, it was a vastly different era. Mr. Clinton had embraced deficit reduction and balanced budgets, an approach later called "Rubinomics" after Mr. Rubin, who became Treasury secretary in 1995. While Wall Street leaned right over all, executives at Goldman gave most of their political contributions to Democrats.
