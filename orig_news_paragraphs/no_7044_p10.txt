The leader of the North Vietnamese Army, General Nguyen Giap, prided himself in conducting a war against America not involving major confrontations of massive armies but, rather, numerous limited smaller unit engagements the Chinese call "lingchi" or "death of a thousand cuts" to bleed America dry and into withdrawing. This would also be Iran’s modus operandi against U. S. ground forces. Interestingly, it has been aided in supplying its proxies today with war material by Obama’s administration which, as part of its nuclear deal with the mullahs, gave them billions of dollars in cash to continue their violent regional activities. There is another factor distinguishing the Vietnam war from the turmoil in Syria if U. S. ground forces were to be involved.
