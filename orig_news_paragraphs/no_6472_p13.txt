" In Saturday’s   press conference, NBC’s Claudio Lavanga pressed the Pope further, repeating his question of how he would face a head of state with ideas in opposition to his (it should be mentioned that no journalist thought to ask the Pope this question regarding his meetings with Vladimir Putin, Raúl Castro, Evo Morales or Barack Obama). Once again, the Pope deftly parried the attack, counseling   rather than throwing up a wall. There are always doors that aren’t closed," Francis said.
