The president’s budget outline, unveiled this week, has something for almost every Republican to hate, from the lack of   entitlement reform to large proposed cuts at the State Department. " Speaking for myself," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, "I think the diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important, and you get results a lot cheaper, frequently, than you do on the defense side. So, speaking for myself, I’m not in favor" of huge reductions at the State Department.
