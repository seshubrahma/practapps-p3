My thesis at the Isaac and Jesse Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town dealt with the troubled status of Jews in an increasingly   and antisemitic,   South Africa. I believe myself to be a qualified judge of what is, and is not, antisemitic.   It defies logic that a man who was a close friend, confidant, and adviser to the late Andrew Breitbart  —   a proud Jew   —   could have any negative feelings towards Jews.
