I would give everyone a good deal of latitude here: culture is always produced by appropriation, as when we blend cuisines from other countries or enhance our styles of clothing with dashes of color or elegance from another country. I loved it when Paul Simon took on African rhythms in "Graceland. " T. S. Eliot could not have written "The Waste Land"    the most important poem of literary modernism    without feeling free to "steal" lines from Hindu rituals, from dozens of other cultures.
