Obama made the visit to the state after Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) requested that he travel to the region to tour the damage of the flooding. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has nonetheless refused to schedule a visit to the state, saying that she does not want to "disrupt" the   efforts. Clinton traveled, instead, to Martha’s Vineyard to celebrate her husband, former President Bill Clinton’s birthday while the Obama’s were still vacationing at the swanky vacation spot. Trump called Obama’s visit to the state "too little, too late," in a Twitter post, saying that he should have visited the region immediately following the devastation, as he did.
