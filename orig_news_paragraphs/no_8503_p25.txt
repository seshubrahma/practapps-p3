—   real deliverables for people —  and not theories. On May 12, Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland, outlined the failure of the status quo, using cutting words: Politicians at all levels —  obsessed with political correctness, victimhood and identity politics —  have dumped billions into failing public schools and universities, financed an increasing array of entitlements instead of adequate public investments in RD and the infrastructure needed to support a   economy, sowed divisions and suspicion among ethnic groups, between men and women, and the successful and those deserving a genuine hand up. Continuing in this vein, Morici added: High schools churn out students unprepared for college or vocational programs, and many university graduates lack the critical thinking and technical skills needed to prosper in a   workplace.
