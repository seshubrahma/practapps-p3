Hamill didn’t mention any of the  ’s appointments by name, but Trump has filled several Cabinet and administrative positions since his victory over Hillary Clinton earlier this month. On Friday, Trump selected Donald McGahn as White House general counsel and KT McFarland as deputy national security adviser. The   previously selected Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser, Reince Priebus as chief of staff, Steve Bannon as chief strategist, Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for Attorney General and Rep. Mike Pompeo as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Star Wars star is certainly not a fan of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, whom Trump is reportedly considering for Secretary of State.
