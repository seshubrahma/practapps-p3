Hillary Clinton is no monster like Trump, but she is the calcification of a   version of what is wrong with politics today: the intransigence and pandering, the corruption and secrecy, the influence of big money, and a    the     approach to an entitled sense of rulership. The Democratic Party has a chance to see what its Bernie contingent is pointing out to party leadership. Were the G. O. P. candidate any better than a buffoon, it would be easier for the mainstream Left to see what is wrong with Hillary. It has nothing whatsoever to do with her gender.
