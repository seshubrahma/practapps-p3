In 1967, Pillsbury Co. purchased Burger King for $18 million as the company grew immensely in 13 years, operating out of 274 restaurants. The Pillsbury Co. was acquired by Grand Metropolitan PLC in 1988 for $5. 79 billion and remained a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan PLC until it was sold to a group, including Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs, and Texas Pacific Group in 2002. Eight years later, after going public in 2006, Burger King was purchased by 3G Capital of Brazil for $3. 3 billion in 2008, again becoming a private entity.
