Agents attempted to stop the driver who initially complied and pulled his vehicle over. After coming to a stop, the driver began to drive away, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U. S. Customs and Border Protection officials.   After driving about 200 feet, the Mexican national juvenile opened the door and rolled out of the moving SUV. He attempted to flee on foot and the Isuzu Trooper rolled further down the roadway.
