Last month, the senior Democrats on 16 Senate committees demanded that no Trump nominee should receive a confirmation hearing until he or she has cleared an FBI background check, submitted a signed ethics agreement, and answered   questions from committee members. Because of a rules change engineered by Democrats in 2013, the 52 Senate Republicans can confirm Trumpâ€™s nominees without Democratic votes, and a few committee chairmen have already set tentative hearing dates for the second and third week of January without receiving the completed paperwork for the nominees. " There is no indication that the schedule for hearings is going to be ticked back as a result of this slower pace," a senior Senate Democratic aide said.
