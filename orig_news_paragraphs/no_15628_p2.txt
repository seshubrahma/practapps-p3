Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s controversial former campaign manager, has been seen in the White House to discuss possibly becoming the administration’s top adviser on crisis management as part of a broader effort to prepare for a   crisis related to the special counsel’s investigation, sources said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, facing swirling questions about political pressure from Democrats, tapped former FBI head Mueller to lead the special counsel into Russia’s 2016 activities last week. The move was decried by the President and aides have tried to undercut the probe since Mueller was named. But the possibility of Lewandowski coming into the White House signals that the administration is getting serious about its defense.
