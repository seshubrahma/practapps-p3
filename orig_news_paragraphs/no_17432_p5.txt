Democrats oppose Price because he is a leading GOP architect of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the health care law they champion. If he is confirmed at HHS, he will have a major role in determining how the law will be scrapped and what will replace it.   Democrats believe Priceâ€™s stock trades provide them an opening to convince the public, and perhaps a handful of Republicans, to oppose his confirmation. Hearings are not yet scheduled but are expected in January.
