Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been under scrutiny in the F. B. I. investigation because of his ties to   politicians in Ukraine. In August, he was forced to step down as the chairman of Mr. Trump’s campaign amid reports that his name emerged in a secret ledger in Ukraine listing    payments for consulting work he did for a   government there. He has denied any wrongdoing and has said he never worked for the Russian government. Other Trump associates who have been drawn into the F. B. I. investigation include Roger J. Stone Jr. a longtime Republican operative who has acknowledged contacts with Guccifer 2. 0, the mysterious online figure that is believed to be a front for Russian intelligence officials, and Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the campaign who has done extensive business in Russia.
