US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is in Moscow meeting with his Russian counterpart, has taken a softer line, saying he "hoped" the Syrian people would choose to oust Assad from power.   President Trump said that the images of the attack’s aftermath moved him to act, launching the Tomahawk strike on the airbase from where the US believes the planes took off to carry out the attack. US Defense Secretary James Mattis said the airstrike had destroyed 20% of the Syrian government’s operational aircraft.   The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that those strikes were not as effective as the US claims.
