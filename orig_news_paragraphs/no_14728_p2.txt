The order also removes Iraq as one of the countries covered by the order. The courts, which invalidated the original ban, did so, in effect, because they found the order amounted to religious discrimination against Muslims. This new order, unlike the first, makes no mention of the religions of any applicants to come to the United States. Still, opponents of the order will insist the new rules are merely pretexts    that the new order once again fulfills President Trumpâ€™s campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States.
