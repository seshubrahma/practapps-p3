Kelly  —   who left Fox News earlier this year to lead two news programs at NBC   —   shared a preview clip of her interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday. In the clip, Kelly asks Jones how he feels about being called "the most paranoid man in the world," while the radio host and InfoWars founder says he believes   was an "inside job" and that he was unfairly maligned for his views on the Sandy Hook attack. Next Sunday, I sit down with conservative radio host @RealAlexJones to discuss controversies and conspiracies #SundayNight June 18 on NBC pic.
