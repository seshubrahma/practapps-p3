Well, I can imagine that Mr. Trump would like to have people move on and forget what was said during the primary process and what’s been said over the years, but we actually take the measure of an individual over their entire career and during the primary as well. On that basis, get a sense of the person’s character, integrity, values with regards to race, religion, gender, and Mr. Trump has made that clear through the campaign to this point. I am absolutely convinced that Reince Priebus is right when he says Mr. Trump will be able to read from the text and present a different image going forward, but that is not something which is consistent with who he is as demonstrated by his past.
