The Republican caucus in the House of Representatives has 22 women, 11 people of color and no representatives who identify as LGBT. That means that women make up 8. 9% of the   caucus, and people of color make up 4. 4% of the Republican representatives. We rate Pelosiâ€™s claim as mostly true because the Democratic caucus falls short of representing women, but is   of people of color and those who identify as LGBT.
