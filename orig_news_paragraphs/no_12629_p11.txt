A group of key figures from the Green Blob —  academics, professional activists, lawyers, scientists, PR agency heads —  have gathered to discuss the heist of the century. Their plan is to terrorise big business with a form of environmentalist blackmail, which they will use, in the manner of a   protection racket to bully their target companies (with the help of tame lawyers and complicitous government officials) into handing over millions, if not billions, of dollars. This Danegeld will end up being paid to environmental campaign groups of the kind they work for themselves, thus funding yet more vexatious,   actions against still more blameless companies. And the cleverest thing of all is, this heist isn’t even illegal.
