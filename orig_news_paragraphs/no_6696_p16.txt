Donâ€™t let logic stand in the way of a   progressive snowflake, though. Citing claims from Rep. John Lewis ( ) that Trump is not a "legitimate" incoming president, the Huffington Post contributor Mohajer describes mythical Americans watching in "abject horror" as the transition to an "increasingly belligerent" Donald Trump presidency carries on. Mohajer writes: The unrelenting onslaught and sheer breadth of scandal and conflict has left an American electorate fatigued and uncertain as to the best path of resistance following a protracted election season that may be the most volatile in history. As Americans, we are culturally predisposed to seek rapid closure rather than answers, oftentimes more comfortable expressing outrage at a perceived injustice than we are willing to remedy it.
