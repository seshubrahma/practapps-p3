__ Overheard Chant: "Yes we can" as people walked past the White House. As the sun set downtown, protesters made their way to the White House and assembled in small groups in a park just across from the buildingâ€™s entrance. There in an area surrounded by temporary gates, people walked single file through one open entrance and one by one laid protest signs across gates set up for inauguration several hundred feet away from the White House.
