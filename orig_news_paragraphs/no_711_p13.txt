As a former foreign minister, Jorge Castañeda, told me, one option might be to get out of the way and let Central Americans cross Mexico unimpeded to the United States. Here’s what is at stake. Last year, Mexico returned 143, 057 Central American migrants to their countries of origin. It sent home more than 59, 000 Guatemalan migrants moving north across its territory, and repatriated nearly 48, 000 Hondurans and 31, 000 Salvadorans, according to the International Organization for Migration.
