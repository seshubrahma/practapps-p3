" Recruiting is a tough issue right now in skilled and semiskilled industries," said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City. He mentioned a particular need for workers in accounting, information technology, call centers, warehousing and office and professional services. Mr. Funk said employers often complained about being unable to find employees with a strong work ethic who met the minimum requirements.
