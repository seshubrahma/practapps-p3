Outside of the war of written words, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks was notoriously arrested during a   at Senator Sessionsâ€™ Mobile, Alabama office on Wednesday, according to a recent Breitbart News report. The message was clear: "We are asking the senator to withdraw his name for consideration as attorney general or for the   Donald Trump, to withdraw the nomination," Brooks said, according to CNN. After posting bail, Brooks joined a Friday morning conference call with top leadership from the   The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, La Raza, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Al Sharpton from the National Action Network to retell his experience. Recent IRS Form 990s revealed that the combined salaries for the speakers on the call exceed $1. 5 million dollars.
