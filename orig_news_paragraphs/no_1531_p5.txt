Ahead of Mr. Trump’s acceptance of the nomination, which might be considered a success for the type of boisterous politics espoused by Fox News, the network’s powerful chairman, Roger Ailes, announced he would step down. Mr. Ailes was accused of sexual harassment by Gretchen Carlson, a former anchor, but has denied the allegations. People briefed on an internal inquiry said that at least six other women told lawyers that he had behaved inappropriately. Rupert Murdoch, 85, is going to assume control of the network.
