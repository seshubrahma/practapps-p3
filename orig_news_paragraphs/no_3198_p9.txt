As Breitbart Jerusalem reported, Odeh, who together with other strike organizers are calling to "decolonize Palestine" and protest the "white supremacists in the current government," is a convicted terrorist accused of bombing attacks in the late 1960s that killed two Israeli university students and injured nine more. In 1980, Odeh was freed from an Israeli jail as part of a prisoner exchange deal, and a decade later emigrated to the U. S. She recently made headlines again after being charged with immigration fraud for lying about her terrorist background when applying for U. S. citizenship.
