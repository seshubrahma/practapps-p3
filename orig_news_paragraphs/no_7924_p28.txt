Just in the past year, 989 refugees have arrived in the rural state, most of them landing in either Boise or Twin Falls. Nearly half have come from some of the world’s nastiest jihadist hot zones, including 95 from Iraq, 94 from Somalia, 47 from Sudan, 39 from Afghanistan, 31 from Iran, 28 from Syria and 11 from Pakistan, according to the federal refugee database. In recent months, the mass importation of refugees has become a topic of controversy in Idaho —   as American communities have struggled with some unique assimilation challenges posed by   migration from the Third World. In June, Iraqi and Sudanese refugees allegedly sexually assaulted a five   American girl in Twin Falls, Idaho.
