Monday on his nationally syndicated talk show, Glenn Beck accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of creating a conservative version of Black Lives Matter.   Beck said, "He’s making a new group of Black Lives Matter. He’s making a new group of people that so distrust and hate the system that they will buy anything. It was a rigged election, the media ought to go to jail, and it’s these Republicans, and not look at whose leading that.
