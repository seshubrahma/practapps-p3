For all these reasons, I enthusiastically endorse Donald Trump for President. " "I am pleased to have the support of Representative Duncan (TN) who is one of the most fiscally conservative Members of the House. If more Members voted like Rep. Duncan, we wouldnâ€™t be wasting trillions of the taxpayer dollars in foreign countries," Trump stated in the press release.
