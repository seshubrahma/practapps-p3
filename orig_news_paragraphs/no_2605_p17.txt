• Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump’s sons, offered a passionate, energetic speech on behalf of his father, describing him as the candidate who is running to make the lives of ordinary Americans better. The elder Trump sat in the audience for his son’s remarks, clapping occasionally but appearing to express displeasure as the large screen behind Eric Trump appeared to malfunction. Eric Trump said his father ran for president because he could "no longer bear witness" to America’s decline.
