the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall here in Sarasota â€”  is hallowed ground for President Trump. Just weeks before Trump announced his presidential campaign, the Sarasota GOP awarded him its annual Statesman of the Year award in May 2015 in front of a   crowd in the same hall. That award was bestowed upon Trump by   GOP powerbroker Joe Gruters, now a Florida statehouse representative. Gruters was vice chairman of the Florida GOP, and joined the Trump campaign early as a senior official.
