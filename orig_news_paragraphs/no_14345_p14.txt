Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell, representing his state and Minnesota    which are challenging the Trump executive order along with advocacy groups    was pressed by Canby to explain how the executive order demonstrates a direct intent to discriminate against Muslims when only a relatively small percentage of Muslims hail from the seven banned countries. " You donâ€™t have to prove it harms every Muslim     you just need to show the action was motivated in part by animus," Purcell argued.
