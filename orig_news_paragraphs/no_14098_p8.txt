During his confirmation hearing, Tillerson had faced a grilling about his close ties to Russia and whether his business experience could translate into diplomatic skills. His answers about human rights riled both Democrats and Republicans like Rubio, who told the lifelong businessman at his confirmation hearing that US foreign policy needed a "moral clarity" he wasn’t hearing.   After Rubio met for 90 minutes with Tillerson last week and got answers to more than 100 written questions he’d asked the nominee to answer, the Florida senator said that "despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson’s nomination in committee and in the full Senate."   Rubio was one of just three Senate Republicans who had been withholding backing for Tillerson over broad concerns about his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
