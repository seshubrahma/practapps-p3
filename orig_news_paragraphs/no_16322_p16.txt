Meanwhile, the former congressman has tried to style himself as someone focused on the issues that bring the country together, even as Trump has criticized certain parts of the United States. Trump, for instance, said Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, "looks like a war zone" this week, laying the blame at the feet of President Barack Obama and Clinton.   " What unites us in these United States," Pence said Tuesday in Tucson, "is so much more powerful than what could ever divide us our belief in freedom, our belief in individual responsibility, our belief in the boundless capacity of every individual to live out their dreams, and our belief since before this nation was founded that we are one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
