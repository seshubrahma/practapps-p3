Only about one out of every four households receiving food stamps in 2014 was black, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. One area where blacks lag severely is homeownership. Rates of homeownership for blacks have dipped over the past four years to 41. 7 percent in the second quarter of this year, the lowest rate among any racial group, according to the Census Bureau. The unemployment rate for blacks is nearly double the national average.
