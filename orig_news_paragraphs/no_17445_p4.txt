" The city will continue, with all of the tools at its disposal, to develop our capital according to the cityâ€™s master plan and in accordance with planning and construction laws, for the benefit of all residents    Jews and Arabs alike," Rachel Greenspan said. The plans include 216 units in Ramot and 174 units in Ramat Shlomo, two neighborhoods in E. Jerusalem. The plans, scheduled for a Jerusalem Zoning Committee meeting on Wednesday, were on the agenda before the UN Security Council vote, according to Ir Amim, a   NGO that tracks construction in East Jerusalem.
