Not only do the FBI’s interview notes underscore Hillary Clinton’s terrible judgment, incompetence, and dishonesty, they raise serious questions about whether emails regarding the terrorist attack in Benghazi were intentionally destroyed while under congressional subpoena," stated Trump’s deputy campaign manager David Bossie. He continued: According to the FBI’s notes, ‘an intense round of deleting’ began weeks after lawmakers subpoenaed Clinton’s emails following the New York Times report exposing her secret server. Given this timeline and the fact the FBI recovered deleted emails that would have been subject to the subpoena, the FBI should make all of the relevant information surrounding the wiping of Clinton’s server public, including witness accounts from employees of Platte River Networks, which carried out the deletions.
