Fields is best known for claiming that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski violently attacked her at an event before the Florida primary in March. Fields resigned from her job at Breitbart News before it became apparent that her account of events did not match up with video footage of the incident. She later filed a criminal complaint against Lewandowski, but a Palm Beach County prosecutor declined to pursue an indictment against Trumpâ€™s campaign manager. Fields will now cover the Trump campaign for a website that used to place Trump coverage in its "Entertainment" section rather than its "Politics" vertical.
