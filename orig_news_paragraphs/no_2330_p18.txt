The Clinton campaign plans to employ Mr. Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, as much as possible in the coming weeks, making particular use of the couple in Florida, Ohio and North Carolina  —   in areas of those states that Mr. Obama won handily in 2008 and 2012. After campaign aides insisted in June that Mr. Obama would not be pigeonholed to reach   voters, whose support appeared steady for Mrs. Clinton, the campaign has appeared to acknowledge his help is needed, sending him to cities like Philadelphia and Charlotte, which are home to many black voters. " There’s some thought that without him on the ticket, the same enthusiasm might not be there for Hillary Clinton," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York.
