Local blogger Brian Burgess has been on his case for some time. Jones has succeeded in being labeled a philanthropist, in part because he annually gives a few million dollars of his    fortune to   charity organizations. These activists are all too happy to use a small portion of his contribution to give him shiny awards at celebrity studded galas, and his public relations operation is excellent about making sure everyone knows he’s   with actual liberal icons like Jimmy Buffett. But it is exactly this sort of   or at least,   that seems to be the driving force behind at least a couple of Jones’ nonprofit initiatives.
