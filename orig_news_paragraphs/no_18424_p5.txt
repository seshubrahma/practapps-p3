" ’’ ’   "My interpretation is that a member of Congress would still have   to reveal the appropriate foreign government contacts   notwithstanding it was on official business," Zaid said in CNN’’s   report. ’ "    Federal officials are not required to include meetings on the   security form if it was for a foreign conference that they   attended in their official capacity; however, Sessions’ meetings   may not meet that standard for exclusion because the meetings in   question do not appear to be related to foreign conferences, CNN   reported.
