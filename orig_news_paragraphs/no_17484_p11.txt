We slept in wooden bungalows and crossed frozen rivers and lakes on skis, visiting picturesque villages where   babushkas greeted us with warm smiles. I still remember the muffled sound of falling snow and the blinding white scenery.   The school was divided in two parts: the elementary and middle schools were in one block while the high school was within the US embassy on the other side of Moscow. For important school events and   parties, we would all go to the US embassy where the cool big kids were.
