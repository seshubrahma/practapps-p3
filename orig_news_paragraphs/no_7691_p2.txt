Trump’s   movement is obviously well within the polls’ margin of error, but Rubio’s rising support is cleary a phenomenon. Trump’s decline in support has been evident since the middle of January, when he peaked in the CNN poll at 34 percent. Since that poll, Trump has lost 5 points, Rubio has gained 8, and Cruz has dropped one point. In the days following the Iowa caucus, Trump has trained his fire on Cruz, who has also been criticized by Republicans like Karl Rove and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad.
