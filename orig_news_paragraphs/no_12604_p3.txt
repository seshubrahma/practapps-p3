The film looks shoddy. From the poor     visual effects, to the bizarre and frankly out of place jokes, Ghostbusters looks like a bad movie. Couple this with the fact that the original is one of the most beloved classics of all time, and you end up with a lot of angry people. Making a shoddy film is one thing, but attempting to remake a beloved classic with an incredibly inferior looking film is not going to make fans happy.
