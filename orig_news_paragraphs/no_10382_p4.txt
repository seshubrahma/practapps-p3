People were laughing and happy to be at the event and were eager to get inside. When I walked in, I was surprised that I was able to go to the from area near Trumpâ€™s podium was on stage. I was about 12 people from the front of the stage initially when I got in there.   During the next few hours, a group of younger people dressed in black outfits and acting very determined, kept being very pushy to get farther up to the stage area.
