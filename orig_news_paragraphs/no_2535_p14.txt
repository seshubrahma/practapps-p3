Mr. Lewandowski, who was fired from the campaign early last summer, waged the most visible fight for a role at the White House. In the end, though, he will remain outside the gates, announcing on Twitter on Wednesday that he has set up a Washington public relations and consulting business a block from the White House. " I will always be President Trumpâ€™s biggest supporter," Mr. Lewandowski wrote in a news release announcing the new business, Avenue Strategies.
