  Thursday at the Christian Monitor Science breakfast in Washington, D. C. Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) explained the one area where he could find some agreement with   Donald Trump, which is in the area of how to handle corporate America.   Sanders criticized corporations exporting jobs overseas to lower costs to the detriment of the middle class and the working class in the United States and said if Trump indeed has the "guts" to take on those corporations, he would have an ally with Sanders. " [T]hey think they can save some money in Indiana by moving to Mexico and hiring people there for $3 a hour," Sanders said.
