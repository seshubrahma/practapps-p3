Why would any feminist think it is a moral advance for women to imitate male abandonment of the vulnerable through abortion?   Influential women such as   Slaughter thankfully have begun to highlight a more authentic feminist logic: if society better valued caregiving, then perhaps men would do more of it, and weâ€™d see greater collaboration in the home, more equity in the workplace, and more   policies. But as   law professor Robin West has noticed, the constitutionalizing of abortion rights in Roe stands in dramatic tension with a political agenda that better values caregiving.    Were it not for the wedding of modern feminism with the sexual revolution, many more men, I think, would more readily value the culturally essential work of caregiving.
