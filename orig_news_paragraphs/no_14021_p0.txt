 (CNN) Drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, a legend in Mexico through his dramatic prison escapes and years of staying just ahead of the law, arrived late Thursday in New York after his extradition to the United States. Guzman will appear Friday in a federal courtroom in Brooklyn, where he will stand trial at a later date.
