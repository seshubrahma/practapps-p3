Washington (CNN) Corporations and wealthy Americans poured nearly $107 million into the festivities surrounding Donald Trumpâ€™s ascension to the presidency, doubling the previous inaugural fundraising record set eight years ago. Organizers announced the total on Tuesday, two days before the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee must disclose its donors to the Federal Election Commission. The money paid for 20 events during the extravaganza, but produced excess cash that will be donated in the future to a charity, organizers said.
