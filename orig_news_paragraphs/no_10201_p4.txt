It certainly doesn’t mean the pope is never wrong, and on prudential issues like immigration policy, taxation and so on I’d argue that this pope, who isn’t nearly as clever as his more stern but also less emotionally incontinent predecessors, screws up rather a lot. Now, if you think I’m being outrageously presumptuous and skidding toward excommunication   …      well, you might be right.
