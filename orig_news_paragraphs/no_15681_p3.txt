Kushner was a private citizen at the time, not a US government official although he was acting on behalf of the incoming US government and in an official capacity having an interim security clearance. The details were shared with CNN as an explanation to The Washington Post reporting, which it said was based on intercepts of conversations between Russiaâ€™s ambassador and Moscow. Kislyak, according to The Post, told   in Moscow that Kushner suggested the proposal in a December meeting at Trump Tower    which former national security adviser Michael Flynn also attended. Kushner "suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications," the Post reported, in an apparent attempt to try to shield discussions during the transition from monitoring.
