Over the past month, the mainstream GOP has adopted fringe   conspiracy theories that Clinton has a "secret illness. "  The media, eager to report "both sides," has now begun to report on whether Clinton coughs. When I pushed back against the coughing meme on Twitter, my account was flooded with conspiracy theorists telling me her coughing is a sign of Parkinsonâ€™s, epilepsy, strokes, cancer and dozens of other conditions. Now Gohmert, speaking before Christians, draws laughs by saying that Clinton has special needs or that maybe she was hit in the head by one of the hammers used to destroy BlackBerries.
