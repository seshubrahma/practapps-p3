Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday that indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called "extreme vetting" of immigrants. Titled "Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States," the executive order would start to make good on Trumpâ€™s promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. The text of the order    in a break from drafts that had been circulating earlier this week    drops a longtime Trump campaign pledge to establish safe zones in Syria to give Syrian nationals displaced by the ongoing civil war in the country a place to relocate.
