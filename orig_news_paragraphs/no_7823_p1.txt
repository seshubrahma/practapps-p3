Donald Trump is a racist. Donald Trump in fact is making fascist appeals. Thatâ€™s why many   Republicans are not supporting Donald Trump for president. Look, being president of the United States is the toughest job in the world and I can tell you, as someone who has worked with Secretary Clinton and competed against her that she is a tough person who is ready to do this job.
