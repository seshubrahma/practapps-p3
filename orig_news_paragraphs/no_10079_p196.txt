Bombshell report: Mateen was enrolled in online courses from a convicted criminal and Islamic extremist known as Abu Taubah.   The gunman who murdered at least 50 people in a Florida nightclub early Sunday morning was a follower of a controversial gang    robber who was released from prison last year despite warnings from prosecutors that he would recruit people to carry out violent acts, sources told FoxNews. com. Omar Mateen, whose bloody siege inside a packed Orlando gay nightclub ended when SWAT teams stormed the building and killed him, was a radical Muslim who followed Marcus Dwayne Robertson, a law enforcement source said.
