The article attempts to further justify its claims by going back more than 40 years, something not referenced in the original article. A leaked report from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) disclosed that nearly half of those crossing the U. S. borders go undetected, according to an AP article reported by Breitbart Texas in October. The report revealed that only 54 percent of those crossing the border illegally during FY 2015 were captured. The agency had previously publicly claimed an 81 percent success rate the AP reported, though they knew internally that this was not true.
