" I have to be very careful about expressing any views," Judge Gorsuch said. Senator Leahy also asked Judge Gorsuch to say whether he would continue on the Supreme Court to recuse himself from cases involving the Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz, with whom he has various ties. Among those ties: Mr. Anschutz was Judge Gorsuchâ€™s former client and in 2006, he successfully lobbied the Bush White House to appoint Mr. Gorsuch to the appeals court.
