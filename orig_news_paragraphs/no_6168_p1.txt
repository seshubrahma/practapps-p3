Republicans and telecom industry groups argue that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) not the FCC, traditionally protected consumer privacy.   The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the FCC under the Obama administration. The regulation required internet services providers (ISPs) to protect consumer data more stringently than content providers such as Google and Facebook. The FCC required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using location data, financial information, health, information, and web history for advertising.
