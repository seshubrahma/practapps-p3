Mr. Kudlow, while certainly versed in economics, is not an economist. He has an undergraduate degree in history. The council chairman has traditionally been pulled from the highest echelons of academia to advise the president, not to lobby or persuade. Moreover, Mr. Kudlow is an ardent free trader and was openly critical of Mr. Trumpâ€™s position on trade during the campaign, even as he enthusiastically backed the candidate.
