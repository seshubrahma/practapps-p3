Mr. Obama imposed the   rules in May 2013 as part of an effort to recalibrate counterterrorism operations after he had overseen a steep increase in military and C. I. A. drone strikes in places like Yemen and tribal Pakistan. Critics, including inside the government, worried that the strikes were causing too many civilian casualties, driving terrorist recruitment and undermining support among local partners in the regions. In response, the Obama administration developed the rules, known as the Presidential Policy Guidance. Under those rules, cabinet officials generally must agree in   deliberations that a proposed target away from a traditional war zone poses a threat to Americans.
