The answer is that Mr. Black and other private equity executives make their money in ways that set them apart from most other industries. Mr. Black’s share of the Hostess profits, from the partial sale and the $900 million in cash they pulled out of the company, will be reflected in a series of distributions he collects from Apollo’s publicly traded stock. The size of the distribution depends on the size of the profits from deals like Hostess. Last year, Mr. Black’s distributions totaled $181 million.
