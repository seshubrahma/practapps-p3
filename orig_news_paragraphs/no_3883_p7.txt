(Bork was a former U. S. solicitor general, Yale law professor, one of the greatest legal scholars in all of American history, and a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit.) Democrats took control of the Senate in the 1986 midterm elections, and it had become an article of faith in that party to protect sacred cows leftists were getting from a liberal Supreme Court that they could not get through the ballot box, like abortion on demand, racial preferences, and militant secularism. In 1985, Attorney General Ed Meese declared that the official constitutional philosophy of the Reagan administration was originalism: In our democratic republic, the only legitimate way for unelected, politically unaccountable judges to interpret the law (and especially the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land) was according to the original meaning of its provisions, leaving it to the American people alone to decide whether the Constitution or lesser laws need to be changed or amended. Reagan and Meese made good on that philosophy when Reagan elevated Scalia to the Supreme Court.
