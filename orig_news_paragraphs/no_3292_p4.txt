During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump was a prominent critic of the deal, promising to "cancel" it, and this week he refused to sign a statement endorsing the agreement. Although Trump could not instantly pull America out, he could initiate the process for the country’s exit. Since taking office, Trump has revoked a range of environmental legislation —  including Barack Obama’s climate orders —  with a plan to focus on energy independence and revitalize the coal industry. In his first White House budget, Trump also proposed a 31 percent cut to the EPA’s overall budget.
