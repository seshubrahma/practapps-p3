The patrons who organize these consultation? The conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch and their   pals who are continuing to spend millions to help promote   ideas in Latino communities across the country. Through the Koch network’s LIBRE Initiative, volunteers and advisers are helping immigrants study for drivers’ license exams so they have some form of government ID, others prepare for citizenship tests and still others earn a G. E. D. And it doesn’t matter if they are here legally or not.
