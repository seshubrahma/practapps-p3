I am grateful to live at a time when a man    the most powerful man in the world, no less    can model what it means to let life affect him to the point where tears come. Would you want to be married to a man who has never been moved to tears by his love and appreciation of another human being? But I am not kidding myself. We have a long way to go in transforming masculinity.
