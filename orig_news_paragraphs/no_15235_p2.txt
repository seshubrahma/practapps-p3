More amazing to me is that only 52% of   Democrats said their party was in touch with peoplesâ€™ concerns, while 44% said it was out of touch. (Also of concern for Democrats: Fewer than 1 in 5 independents    18%     said the Democratic Party was in touch with the average person.) Those numbers    particularly among Democrats    are striking.
