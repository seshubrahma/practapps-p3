Mr. Rosen, who was   of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012 and Senator Marco Rubio’s 2016 bid, said Mr. Friedman had developed a strong rapport with Mr. Trump that would allow him to be effective as his envoy. " They’ve worked together closely for a very long time, and he knows what Donald is thinking, and what Donald wants to accomplish," Mr. Rosen said. Many of Mr. Friedman’s views are far to the right of the stated positions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has endorsed the principle of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
