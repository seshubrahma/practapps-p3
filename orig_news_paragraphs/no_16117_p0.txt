 (CNN) Mexico’s president said Sunday that there is "no way" his country would ever pay for a wall between it and the United States.   In a   interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Enrique Peña Nieto shot down Donald Trump’s campaign promise that he’s going to build a wall and Mexico will foot the bill.   Peña Nieto stressed that economic and social prosperity on both sides of the border relies on a firm relationship between Mexico and the United States.
