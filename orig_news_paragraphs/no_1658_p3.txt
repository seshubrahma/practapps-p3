A band of trained volunteers focused on elections farther down the ballot could help raise their standing for 2018 and beyond. The network hopes that these activists will learn how to make a compelling, personal pitch to win over new converts to the cause, and that if volunteers are grounded in a strong philosophical understanding of   principles, they will be better prepared not only to explain their beliefs but also to ward off candidates, like Mr. Trump, who do not espouse their vision. " We want a cultural shift of people being able to know what they want and how to talk to the people in their communities, so that in the future, when there are political leaders that want to demagogue   issues, they do hit resistance," said Levi Russell, the director of public affairs for Americans for Prosperity.
