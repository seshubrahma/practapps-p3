Trump: Comments about judge ’misconstrued’ Trump was condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike after he repeatedly referred to   Curiel as a "hater" and a "Mexican," while criticizing the judge’s rulings in the case.

" Trump later defended himself in a written statement, saying he did not believe "one’s heritage (made) them incapable of being impartial."
