According to his financial snapshot, Flynn received $827, 055 in salary and bonus from his firm, Flynn Intel Group, alone. CNN has reported that Flynn gave the speech in Moscow, paid for by the Russian television network RT, but the existence of the other two speaking engagements paid for by Russian companies was disclosed last month by House Democrats. In his recent filing, the retired lieutenant general listed the speaking engagement for "RT TV" when asked in the form to disclose "compensation exceeding $5, 000 in a year," but did not specify the amount. CNN previously reported that Flynn, according to a top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, was paid more than $33, 000 of a $45, 000 speaking fee by RT for the speech in December 2015, with most of the remainder of the money going to Leading Authorities, the speakers bureau.
