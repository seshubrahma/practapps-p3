Indonesia is the largest Muslim country on earth, but is considered "moderate" a designation that is essentially mythical. They’ve declared there is no room for gays in the country, which is no surprise as we’ve discussed earlier, but discrimination doesn’t end there. Chinese christians in Indonesia have a long history of persecution, which often involves beheadings.   They’ve gotten used to beheadings in Indonesia, and I find that horrifying.
