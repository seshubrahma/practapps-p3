At the start of the campaign in April, the Prime Minister set down a narrative that the June 8 election was a choice between her "strong and stable" leadership that would deliver a successful Brexit, and Corbyn’s   brand of Labour. But as the votes are counted, it is remarkable how Corbyn has managed to change the narrative and turn the election into a competitive fight. This shift has been achieved, say commentators, in part because Corbyn does not behave like an ordinary politician. While other party leaders adapt their policies to the changing times, his views    including opposition to Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent, and in favor of higher taxes on the rich to pay for healthcare and schools    have not changed in more than 30 years.
