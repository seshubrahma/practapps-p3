" 7:03: Santorum is asked whether Monday night will be his last stand. He blasts Fox News and the media for not promoting the undercard and accuses them of "segregating" and trying to take Iowa out of the process. Santorum says if the same rules were in place four years ago, he would have been in the undercard debate. Santorum blasts a certain "entertainer" (but Santorum will go to Trumpâ€™s event after the debate) and the networks for not spending enough time on issues he says are important to voters.
