Trump stood 68, 236 votes ahead of Clinton, with 99% of the vote in Wednesday evening. The total support for Johnson and Stein was 191, 565    almost three times Trump’s margin of victory. CNN projected a Trump victory here. If half of Johnson’s supporters and all of Stein’s supporters had voted Clinton, it would have flipped the state.
