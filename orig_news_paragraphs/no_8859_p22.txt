Jobs are hard to come by as the local factory is moving to Mexico, Canada, or China —  or Vietnam or India or somewhere else —  while the politicians in Washington want to take away Americans’   Social Security and Medicare benefits. Veterans who served our country, and put their lives on the line, can’t see a doctor for half a year, while healthcare premiums for those now forced to buy insurance plans they already can’t afford are skyrocketing, all while Democrats want to take away Americans’ guns and make them pay higher taxes —  while regulating their businesses into submission making it easier to get a welfare check than to start a company.
