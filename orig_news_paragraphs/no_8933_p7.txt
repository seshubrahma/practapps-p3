Mexico has taken a leading role in Labor Rights Week, ensuring that workers in Mexico and throughout the world know about their rights in the workplace and where to access help and support. I thank our Mexican counterparts for their collaborative partnership in our shared mission to empower workers and combat discrimination. The Obama administration has already set up similar programs with the countries of Ecuador and El Salvador to help their citizens finds jobs in the U. S. and to battle "discrimination. "
