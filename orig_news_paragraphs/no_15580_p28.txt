The Washington Post, citing "current and former US officials," reported that Trump disclosed highly classified information    apparently as he bragged about the breadth of intelligence at his fingertips    to the Russian ambassador and foreign minister during their meeting the previous week. He did not, CNN reported, directly reveal the source of the information, but intelligence officials expressed concern that Russia would be able to take what they heard and use it to suss out information on its origins.   The White House quickly denied the story. Dina Powell, Trump’s deputy national security adviser for strategy, was at the meeting.
