The British Parliament on Monday debated whether or not to ban Donald Trump from the country for the crime of saying that in light of jihad terrorist attacks, there should be a temporary moratorium on Muslim immigration into the U. S.[I did not expect for one moment that the Brits would ban the U. S. presidential candidate who may very well be the next President of the United States. A nation whose national   (or whatâ€™s left of it) is rooted deeply in its place in history would be infamous for having banned the leader of its closest ally, the one that saved her from the Nazi onslaught.   On the other hand, maybe they will ban Trump. After all, the British government banned me from entering the country for standing up against jihad terror.
