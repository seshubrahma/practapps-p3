Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter Friday to the acting director of the Secret Service, saying his committee is now investigating the incident. He said his committee has learned of these additional allegations that werenâ€™t in the original affidavit, including triggered alarms that were ignored and that the suspect "may have moved around on the White House grounds undetected for a considerable amount of time. " Chaffetz wrote that the suspect also "may have attempted entry into the building."
