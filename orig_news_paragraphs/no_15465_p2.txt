Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told senators Thursday, "I strongly believe that the Russian investigation is adequately resourced. " One source said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein isn’t inclined to make a change unless the FBI investigation appears to be imperiled, and at this point, FBI officials are confident that the investigation is moving ahead, despite Comey’s abrupt firing. The investigation is overseen by Dana Boente, the US attorney in Alexandria, Va. who now also serves as the head of national security prosecutions at Justice Department headquarters.
