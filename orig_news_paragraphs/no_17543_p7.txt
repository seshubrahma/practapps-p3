No criminal charges were filed in the case, as neither Huth nor her parents brought the allegations to the attention of police until 2014    long after the California criminal statute of limitations for the crime expired. Because of this problem, the district attorney declined to prosecute when Huth made an attempt to charge Cosby in 2014. Had Huth or her parents made a timely report to police, the charges that Cosby probably would have faced in 1974 would have been for misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor. In California in 1974, the maximum sentence for this offense was one year in jail, and prosecutors would have had until one year after her 18th birthday to file charges before the statute of limitations applied.
