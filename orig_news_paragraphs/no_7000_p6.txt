Miller Lewis wrote back to Breitbart News’s request for comment. Breitbart News sent him a link to Thompson’s Tweet and gave Sanders all day to respond. Breitbart News followed up with Miller Lewis at 1:35 p. m. 3:59 p. m. 5:49 p. m. and 5:52 p. m. asking whether Sanders will condemn the alleged   actions by Thompson. He has not responded to any of those inquiries.
