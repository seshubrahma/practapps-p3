The Washington Post used "removed" in its Bannon story headline, but explained early on that not having a "permanent seat" on the council in no way diminishes Bannon’s role in the Trump White House   —   after reporting that critics have long said Bannon has no national security experience and that some   national security personnel were left out of the NSC. According to the Post: The White House strongly disputed that characterization, saying that Trump chose to change the structure of the committee from the one in place during the Obama administration to reduce the number of meetings in which senior intelligence officials were required to participate if they did not pertain to their areas of expertise. Instead, one of the officials said, Bannon was put on the council early in the administration to guide and keep watch over   security adviser Michael Flynn, who was tasked with reshaping the operation.
