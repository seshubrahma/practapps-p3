We’re talking about kids, and anybody who’s been in school, been in high school, who’s been a parent, I think should realize that kids who are sometimes in the minority  —   kids who have a different sexual orientation or are transgender   —   are subject to a lot of bullying, potentially they are vulnerable. I think that it is part of our obligation as a society to make sure that everybody is treated fairly, and our kids are all loved, and that they’re protected and that their dignity is affirmed. Obama has declared that his   rules are an issue of "discrimination" for judges to decide, not a democratic issue for voters and politicians to decide.
