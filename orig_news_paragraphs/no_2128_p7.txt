That raises fears of more terrorist attacks in cities outside the Middle East. For instance, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for last week’s truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin even though the links between the group and the main suspect, Anis Amri, a    Tunisian, are not completely clear. After Mr. Amri’s death, the Islamic State released a video of him pledging allegiance to the group. President Obama has vowed to deal the Islamic State crippling blows in Mosul and Raqqa before he leaves office.
