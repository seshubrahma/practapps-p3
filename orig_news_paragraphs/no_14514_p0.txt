Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump widened his search for a new national security adviser this weekend amid concerns in Washington that the forced resignation of Michael Flynn leaves the White House unprepared to face any sudden foreign policy crisis. Flynnâ€™s short tenure ended when he was asked to resign after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his   calls with the Russian ambassador. Trump interviewed several candidates to replace Flynn on Sunday, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.
