Sanders keeps calling Wolf Blitzer "Jake" and seems very prickly, agitated. He slams Clinton for voting to go war in Iraq and then punts when asked whether that reflects badly on her judgment. Sanders has not come off well in the last weeks of the primary cycle. He seems like a candidate (because he gave Clinton a pass on her email scandal) who ran having no intention to win or a candidate who just wants to milk the limelight that he never had for as long as possible.
