Detainees have described the procedures used at Guantánamo as particularly painful, with some likening them to torture. Musa’ab   a Yemeni captured in Pakistan and suspected in a terrorism plot, the evidence for which the United States eventually largely disavowed, joined a large group of hunger strikers in 2013 protesting conditions at the prison. He had arrived at Guantánamo in 2002, barely out of his teens, after being held at a C. I. A. prison. He had violent nightmares and other psychiatric problems after harsh treatment there, his medical records show.
