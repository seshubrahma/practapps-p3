The arrest was caught on tape by his    daughter Fatima Avelica, who recorded video on her smart phone.   On the video, obtained by local Los Angeles affiliate KABC Channel 7, Fatima can be heard sobbing as she collects footage of her father ’s arrest through the windshield of the family vehicle.    "I’m here to ask that the (LAUSD makes) schools sanctuaries so that nobody else can pass through what I passed through and not be scared to go to school," Avelica reportedly said at a press conference earlier on Tuesday.
