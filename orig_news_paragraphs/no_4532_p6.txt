VA officials previously told Rosebrock that a federal regulation allowed hanging the American Flag and   flags on the "Great Lawn Gate" fence, and Rosebrock, Hayes and others hung as many as 30   America flags at the fence at the same time without incident. Rosebrock faces up to six monthsâ€™ imprisonment if found guilty on any of the three charges. Six months!
