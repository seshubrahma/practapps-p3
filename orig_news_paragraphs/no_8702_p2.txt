Additionally, according to data from the State Department, in 2013 the U. S. voluntarily admitted approximately 123, 000 temporary migrants from Muslim countries as foreign students and foreign workers. On top of those autopilot admissions, which will be funded throughout all of 2016, the House is also funding the President’s plan to add another 10, 000 refugees from the Muslim country of Syria. As a result, Ryan’s   omnibus will bring in nearly 300, 000 Muslim migrants in the next 12 months alone, including roughly 170, 000 who will be permanently resettled within the country. Ryan, who leads the   migration wing of the Republican Party, recently suggested that he would sue a future President Trump if he were to use his executive authority to temporarily pause Muslim migration into the United States.
