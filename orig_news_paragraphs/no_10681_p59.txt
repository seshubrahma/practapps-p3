Sanders says he was on the committee that wrote Obamacare and "right now, what we have to deal with is that 29 million people still do not have health insurance" while Americans are paying the highest for prescription drugs and spending the most on health care. Clinton says Obamacare is "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, the Democratic Party, and our country. " Sanders says that nobody is "tearing" Obamacare apart and points out that Clinton did not mention that so many Americans are underinsured with huge copayments, etc.
