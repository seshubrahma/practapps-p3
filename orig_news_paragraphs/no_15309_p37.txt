I slept in benches and ate from garbage with other children that didn’t have a home.   It was something that I couldn’t forget. In the age of 20, I opened my home to serve dinner to children, teenagers, and people that didn’t have any place to eat.   Before I know it, I set the place for all these children to sleep in my own home.
