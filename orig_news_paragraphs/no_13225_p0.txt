Republican presidential frontrunner Donald J. Trump said during the GOP Debate in South Carolina on Saturday night that in the wake of the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the Senate should "delay, delay, delay" and prevent President Barack Obama from appointing someone to fill the vacancy. [While he said he had no doubt that Obama would try to appoint a Supreme Court Justice —  creating a new liberal majority on the court —   Trump said that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should stop him. He added that Scalia’s death was a blow to the conservative movement and to the country as a whole.
