Fox’s Charlie Gasparino writes that Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign has turned into "  civil war" between donors urging him to drop out now and campaign staff telling him to fight through the Florida primary. [From Fox Business:   Rubio campaign officials deny that the Florida senator is contemplating an early exit from the campaign and say he will continue on through the GOP convention in July. But major donors who have advised Rubio say based on their conversations, Rubio’s ultimate intentions are less certain, and while he may not drop out before Florida, they believe based on these conversations, he will drop out of the race if he loses there.
