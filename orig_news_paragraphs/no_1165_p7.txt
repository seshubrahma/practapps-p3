HOME Investment Partnerships is one of dozens of programs and independent agencies aimed at the poor  —   including the Appalachian Regional Commission, AmeriCorps, the Legal Services Corporation and the Interagency Council on Homelessness   —   that Mr. Trump has proposed cutting. The budget for the fiscal year beginning in October would cut $6. 2 billion   —   about 13 percent  —   from HUD, eliminating the Community Development Block Grant program, which funds local initiatives like Meals on Wheels and   efforts and the   Homeownership Opportunity and Choice Neighborhoods programs, which aim to replace distressed public housing with   development.
