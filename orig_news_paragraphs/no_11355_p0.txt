Students at Forest Grove High School in Oregon protested Thursday over a banner hung briefly in the school hallway this week that read "build a wall," per a report by Oregon Live.   Chief of staff for the Forest Grove School District Connie Potter said the sign, which was put up on Wednesday, was up briefly, but prompted a rather quick response by the reportedly about half Latino student body. Potter said the sign was put up after the schoolâ€™s Unity Week. According to her, students had put up "  signs," and then a "build the wall" sign was hung over one of the posters.
