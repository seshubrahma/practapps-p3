Nehlen’s campaign has received national attention despite significant disadvantages —  which come in addition to the natural disadvantage Wisconsin challengers face in light of Wisconsin’s general reluctance  to primary or oust Congressional incumbents. For instance, while Nehlen has received endorsements of conservatives like Phyllis Schlafly and Ann Coulter, unlike Dave Brat, Nehlen received virtually no attention from Washington talk radio hosts like Mark Levin —   who has instead spent much of his time focused on articulating his opposition to tariffs. Moreover, throughout his campaign, Nehlen has been repeatedly attacked by local Wisconsin talk radio pundits, such as #NeverTrump radio host Charlie Sykes. Nehlen has also faced sabotage by the state party leaders, and opposition from local tea party leaders who have encircled themselves around the powerful House Speaker.
