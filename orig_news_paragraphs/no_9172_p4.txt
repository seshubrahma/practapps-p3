Barack Obama’s   contribution to the Remain campaign has actually made 24 per cent of people more likely to vote Leave, compared to just 16 per cent persuaded by him to be more likely to stay. With almost six in ten respondents saying they haven’t been affected by the President’s comments at all, his contribution to the debate is nearly as irrelevant as Jeremy Corbyn’s. Understandably, given the fact he is not a   incumbent in the White House, Donald Trump’s contribution has had even less effect than President Obama’s. Nevertheless, it did at least have the intended effect, with 19 per cent more likely to Leave, compared to 10 for Remain.
