The decision came as Senate Republicans told the White House he was losing support, a senior GOP source said, adding there were four firm Republican no votes and possibly up to 12.   Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, was one of those Republicans who planned to vote against Puzder, saying he was worried about revelations involving Puzder paying employees in cash and the nominee’s comments about some of the American workforce. In a statement Wednesday afternoon, Scott said he shared those concerns with Senate leadership and Tennessee’s Lamar Alexander, chairman of the HELP Committee.
