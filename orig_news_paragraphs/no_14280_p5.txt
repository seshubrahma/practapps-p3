Shortly after taking office, Trump spoke with Netanyahu in a conversation that both sides described as warm. Israel since then has announced new plans to establish a settlement in the West Bank, replacing the illegal Amona construction that was demolished this week.   The new settlement would be the first in almost 20 years in the West Bank, and the creation of thousands of homes in the area is seen as an attempt by Netanyahu to appease his   base in the wake of the evacuation of the  Amona outpost. President Barack Obama was sharply critical of settlement activity, a stance that caused friction between himself and Netanyahu.
