Some residents think it should try to attract artists. Mr. Shorraw, who has a   job as an assistant band director at the townâ€™s high school, wants to create a music center in a downtown building that once housed a grocery store. A local businesswoman recently pitched to the City Council the idea of using part of the old factory site as a medical marijuana farm. Mr. Mavrakis, the mayor, has little patience for these dreams.
