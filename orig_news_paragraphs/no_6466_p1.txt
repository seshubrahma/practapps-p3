" Anybody who gives money to him is pissing down a rathole," said John Morgan, a big Clinton donor who is pondering a run for governor in the state of Florida, of Brock’s fundraising efforts. Brock explained that his donor network is more political than Democracy Alliance, saying that Democracy Alliance has been less of a political organization focused on winning elections and more of an organization focusing on liberal donors’ pet projects. After Hillary Clinton’s loss, Brock took heat from Sanders supporters who say he did not do enough to help Clinton against Trump and Clinton supporters who say his work for conservatives in the ’90s makes him unreliable to help the liberal cause.
