The Republicans who lead the congressional committees overseeing intelligence, the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security take the opposite view. They say that Russia was behind the election meddling, but that the scope and intent of the operation need deep investigation, hearings and public reports. One question they may want to explore is why the intelligence agencies believe that the Republican networks were compromised while the F. B. I. which leads domestic cyberinvestigations, has apparently told Republicans that it has not seen evidence of that breach. Senior officials say the intelligence agenciesâ€™ conclusions are not being widely shared, even with law enforcement.
