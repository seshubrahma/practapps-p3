Former Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri has blasted President Trump for being "preoccupied" with allegations of ties between Russia and the Trump campaign and called him "obsessed" with proving he is a legitimate president. Palmieri leveled these criticisms despite her role in the Clinton team’s constant efforts to delegitimize the president by making claims about alleged Russian interference in the election. [Palmieri, who served as the communications director for the Clinton campaign, told the New York Times in a weekend article that Trump’s tweeting after his firing of FBI Director James Comey shows he is "more preoccupied" with the Russia controversy than once thought.   "What we’ve really learned is either he’s worried about Russia because he’s got a significant vulnerability or he’s worried about Russia because it undermines his electoral win," Palmieri said.
