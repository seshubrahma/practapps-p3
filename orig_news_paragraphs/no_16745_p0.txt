New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week    hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: Preparing for her first    confrontation with Donald Trump.   While she is set to make a quick trip to Florida on Wednesday, after dipping into Pennsylvania on Monday, Clinton will devote the lionâ€™s share of her time huddling with her debate team, gaming out how she will confront Trump next Monday night at Hofstra University.   The lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate.
