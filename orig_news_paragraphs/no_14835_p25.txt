Andre Krouwel, political scientist at the Free University Amsterdam, and owner of election website Kieskompas, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoganâ€™s ongoing war of words with the Dutch government appeared to have boosted support for Rutte. Tensions between the Netherlands and Turkey have been high since the Dutch government refused to allow Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to visit Rotterdam for a political rally last weekend Erdogan retaliated by blaming the Netherlands for the Srebrenica massacre in 995. Voter turnout in the Netherlands is traditionally high.
