Legitimacy derived from procedural justice is the aim of community policing, which must be the foundation of policing today. The community policing concept was created in the last quarter of the last century, a period during which it competed with policing policies based on military models.   In the worst cases, these models cast police and community in the role of belligerents fighting an outright and   war. In our new century, the time has come to replace the war scenario with community policing as a   approach that supports   partnerships and pragmatic   in which police and citizens work together to address public safety challenges ranging from social disorder, to street crime, to fear of crime.
