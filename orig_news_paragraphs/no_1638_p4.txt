Mr. Beruff, who spent $8 million of his money on his bid, is an avid supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubioâ€™s Democratic opponent, Mr. Murphy, bested Representative Alan Grayson, a liberal provocateur who was favored by many progressives but faced ethics inquiries in the House and accusations that he had abused his former wife. " I commit to you that I will serve my full term," Mr. Murphy told supporters Tuesday night, suggesting that Mr. Rubio would run for president again instead.
