Mr. Friedman’s late father, Morris, commemorated on a plaque as a "founding member of Beit El," was one of the first American Jews to meet Mr. Katz when he started going to the United States more than quarter of a century ago and could barely speak English, according to Mr. Silberstein. Another was Eugen Gluck, Beit El ’s main American benefactor, whose name graces the settlement’s clinic. When Mr. Friedman’s nomination was announced, Mr. Katz praised him on his Facebook page as a pioneering philanthropist and settlement builder.
