Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said the GOP frontrunner will own the entire GOP primary debate hosted by Fox News on Thursday night, even without being there. He added that he was "stunned" watching Fox News last night and that the network is acting as if it was "jilted at the altar. "   " Donald Trump knows that by not showing up, he’s owning the entire event," Limbaugh said of the GOP frontrunner refusing to participate in the Fox News debate because Megyn Kelly is a moderator  —   someone who Trump doesn’t think was fair to him in a past debate.
