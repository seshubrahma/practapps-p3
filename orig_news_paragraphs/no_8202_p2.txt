From KPIX: Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center. Around the corner and away from police protection on San Carlos Street, a mob mentality took over. A young man wearing a "Build The Wall"   was assaulted by several young men. Fearing for the manâ€™s safety, KPIX reporter Len Ramirez yelled at him to get away.
