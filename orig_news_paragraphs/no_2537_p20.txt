Perhaps most strikingly, Mr. Trump won 19 percent of white voters without a degree who approved of Mr. Obama’s performance, including 8 percent of those who "strongly" approved of Mr. Obama’s performance and 10 percent of white   voters who wanted to continue Mr. Obama’s policies. Mr. Trump won 20 percent of   liberal white   voters, according to the exit polls, and 38 percent of those who wanted policies that were more liberal than Mr. Obama’s. It strongly suggests that Mr. Trump won over large numbers of white,   voters who supported Mr. Obama four years earlier. The notion that Mr. Trump could win over so many people who voted for Mr. Obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional   spectrum.
