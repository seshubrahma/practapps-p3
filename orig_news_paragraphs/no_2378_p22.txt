Democrats say that despite Mrs. Clinton’s solid performance in the first two debates, she will still attend her usual "debate camp" and grueling preparation sessions with aides in Westchester, N. Y. and Las Vegas. After the final debate, Mrs. Clinton is expected to make her closing argument with a more robust schedule of rallies, and may even make stops in   states like Georgia and Arizona where the margin has tightened.. " You take nothing for granted," said Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton’s chief strategist and pollster.
