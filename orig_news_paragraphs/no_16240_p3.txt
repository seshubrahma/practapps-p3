Friends who download the app can compete to see who completes the most challenges.   The team that built the app pointed to games like Candy Crush, Farmville, Duolingo and Swarm as inspiration for the design. These games entice users to keep playing by endless promises for points, badges and awards, and they connect users with friends to make them feel competitive. And thatâ€™s what keeps people coming back.
