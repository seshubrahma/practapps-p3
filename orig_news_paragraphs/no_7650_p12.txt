In addition to their   war for amnesties and open boarders, Democrats are responsible for the more than 350 "Sanctuary Cities" that openly defy federal law and provide safe havens for those same illegal immigrants, criminals, and terrorists. Open borders, Sanctuary Cities, importing unvetted Muslim refugees from the Middle East are but the tip of the iceberg in assessing the threat that the Democratic Party and its candidate (whoever it is) pose to Americaâ€™s national security. For   years since the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Democratic Party has been the party of appeasement and retreat in the holy war that fanatical Muslims have declared on us. The first bombing of the World Trade Center misfired but still killed six people and wounded 1, 000 others.
