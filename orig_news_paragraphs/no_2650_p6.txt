That choice, Mr. Obama implied, was as sharply drawn in the race between Mr. Trump and the president’s preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, as it was in the grinding sectarian war in Syria, the predations of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the   of China. Mr. Obama spoke of a "crude populism" driving politics in the United States and Europe that fed on "uncertainty and unease and strife" around the world. Mr. Obama’s words underscored the distance he has traveled from the hopeful leader who first addressed the General Assembly on Sept. 23, 2009. On that day, he pledged to forswear the unilateralism of his predecessor, George W. Bush, heralded a new era for the United States’ relationship with the Muslim world and promised to revive peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
