Ryan is rushing a bill —  the American Health Care Act, or Obamacare 2. 0, or Obamacare Lite, or Ryancare as it has become known —  through the House of Representatives right now. But Cotton, a U. S. Senator, tells Breitbart News in this exclusive phone interview on Thursday afternoon that Ryan should back off. Cotton told Breitbart News that this plan by Ryan does not follow through on President Trump’s and other Republicans’ plans to repeal Obamacare, then replace it with a healthcare system that works better for all Americans. Cotton told Breitbart News: We need to get healthcare reform right.
