, how can we trust anything the Trump administration states about national security issues?   When Trump officials tell us that they know who committed a terrorist attack or that they have eliminated terrorists, how can we believe them? All Americans    especially Trump supporters    must demand that Trump and his administration always tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. No more fabrications, exaggerations or outright lies by Trump or his officials should be tolerated by any American regardless of political affiliation.
