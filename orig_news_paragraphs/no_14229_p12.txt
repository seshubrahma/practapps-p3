Mattis will meet with the foreign minister, the defense minister and the prime minister for discussions that will cover Japanese concerns about China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea and East China Sea, freedom of navigation and North Korea. Pyongyang appears to have restarted a plutonium reactor just as Mattis heads to the region. Mattis’ trip also comes in advance of a Feb. 10 summit meeting in Washington between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Tsukada said Japan will look to Mattis, who spent part of his early career as a Marine in the country, to help smooth ongoing historical friction between Japan and South Korea that Tokyo worries could affect cooperation on the region’s daunting security challenges.
