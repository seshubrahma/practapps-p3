"We call on all people of good conscience to join in disrupting the ceremonies. If Trump is to be inaugurated at all, let it happen behind closed doors, showing the true face of the security state Trump will preside over. It must be made clear to the whole world that the vast majority of people in the United States do not support his presidency or consent to his rule," the group states on the website. Some of the #DisruptJ20â€™s planned "events" for the inauguration day include an   and   Bloc, Quockblockade Parade Queer Resistance, Climate Convergence, as well as an Occupy Inauguration.
