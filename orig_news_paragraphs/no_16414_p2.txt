We know, at the moment, these are tough states for Donald Trump and there isnâ€™t as much of a need for us to air ads there," said Justin Barasky, a Priorities USA spokesman, who added that the group has no plans to expand their battleground map before Labor Day. Polls show Clinton with healthy leads in Colorado, Virginia and Pennsylvania. A recent NBC   Street   poll found Clinton up 13 points in Virginia    46% to 33% up 14 points in Colorado    46% to 32% and up 11 points in Pennsylvania    48% to 37%. Priorities decided earlier this month to go dark in certain markets in Virginia and Colorado, but said at the time that they would go back on the air on August 16.
