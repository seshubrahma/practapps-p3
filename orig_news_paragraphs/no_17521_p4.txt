That chain of blunders is almost inevitable, given the fundamentally different and conflicting goals of federal and local agencies. The Supreme Court made clear in a 2012 case, Arizona v. United States, that the federal government has sole authority to enforce border and immigration laws. According to the high court, local law enforcement agencies canâ€™t start investigating and arresting people on suspicion that they may in the U. S. illegally.   That fits neatly with   sanctuary city policies: local authorities in these   places focus on routine   matters    burglaries, muggings, traffic violations and the like    without taking the additional step of tracing the immigration status of the vast tide of suspects, victims and witnesses they come across.
