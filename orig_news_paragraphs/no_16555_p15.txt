" Typically, the tone of our meetings are candid, blunt, businesslike    and this one was no different," was how Obama described it to reporters. He referred to "gaps of trust" over Syria, warned that the US has "more capacity" both "offensively and defensively" when it comes to cyber espionage and stressed that the US has no intention of easing sanctions against Russia over its action in Ukraine. The tough talks were a reminder that the "reset" of Russia relations that Obama pioneered at the start of his administration is now but a memory, while Putin has also taken advantage of chaos in the Middle East to reinstate Russian influence with Syria and Iran.
