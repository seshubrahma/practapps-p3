Justice Antonin Scalia died in February,   depriving his conservative allies of a reliable vote and leaving   eight justices to decide nearly five dozen cases. ’ "   President Barack Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland for   the ninth seat, but Senate Republicans have refused to hold a   hearing or vote on Garland’s nomination, arguing that the next   president should have the right to name Scalia’s replacement.    Even if the Senate were to confirm Garland after the election,   the court probably would hear three months of cases without him,   Ginsburg said.
