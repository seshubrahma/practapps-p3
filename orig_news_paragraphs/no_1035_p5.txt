Mr. Khan did not describe terrorism as "part of living in a big city," as if bombings and shootings were an inescapable fact of life. He said that terrorism preparedness, including providing sufficient support to the police, was "part and parcel of living in a great global city. " " That means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice," Mr. Khan said in a video interview published by The Evening Standard, another British paper.
