Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( ) opens the Loretta Lynch hearing and mentions that the timing of FBI Director James Comey’s recommendation to exonerate Clinton is "troubling" as was Lynch’s meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac while Clinton and the Clinton Foundation were under investigation. Goodlatte says Comey’s comments were akin to a "public indictment" of Clinton and leads one to ask if someone who is not in Clinton’s position would have fared as well with the FBI as she did. He emphasizes that Clinton lied when she said that there were no emails on her private email server that were "marked classified. "
