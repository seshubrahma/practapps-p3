When I voted for Trump, I was as much voting against the fantasy of open borders as I was voting for his policies, which were never very clear, anyways. Hillary Clinton could have laid out a plan about how to limit illegal immigration, and what to do about the 11 million people who are here illegally. But she didnâ€™t, because on the left, you cannot publicly have a policy that limits immigration. I mean, can you think of any Democrats who have a public position that limits immigration?
