Every day seems to bring news of mass shootings, more hate displaced onto minorities and extreme voices from the Republican party    by turns bigoted and silent when it is strategic for their campaigns. We shouldn’t forget that it was Ben Carson who said that he would never let a Muslim into his cabinet and that a Muslim could never be president, Marco Rubio, who said he would be open to shutting down mosques if they inspire radicalization, and Ted Cruz, who said only those refugees fleeing ISIS who could prove they are Christian should be taken into our country.   They were scarcely called out then, and their words aren’t that different from what’s being said today.   It is statement like these that give rise and justification to those here and abroad who have burned down and vandalized mosques all over this country, who pushed a woman wearing headscarf onto train tracks, shot cab drivers, and even may have provided validation for three young men in New York who allegedly attacked a   Muslim girl.
