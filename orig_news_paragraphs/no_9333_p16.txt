The timing of this poll means that some interviews were conducted even before the South Carolina primary. The poll, also, of course, was conducted before Ben Carson left the Presidential race. Carson received 11 percent in the Idaho poll, enough for 4th place. If one combines Carson’s vote with undecideds, this unaligned group actually leads the field, pulling 31 percent, just ahead of Trump’s 30 percent.
