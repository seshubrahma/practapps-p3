"But the changes are minor rather than a   repudiation of the   effort to set standards for what students should know in   arts and mathematics. "  The prominent change in the standards is the addition of cursive writing lessons through fifth grade, an element that Common Core does not provide. In addition, Arizonaâ€™s standards will now require younger students to study the concepts of time and money, and to spell frequently used words. " These new standards represent the final step in the repeal and replacement of the common core in Arizona, and they reflect the thoughts and recommendations of thousands of Arizona citizens," said state schools superintendent Diane Douglas in a press release.
