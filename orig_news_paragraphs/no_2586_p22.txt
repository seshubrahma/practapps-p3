Frank Cruickshanks, 52, who is a caddy at Mr. Trump’s property, including for Mr. Trump’s son Eric, said he appreciated the work Mr. Trump had put into overhauling the golf course. " Having caddied for the last three weeks, mostly for Americans, I have yet to meet one who’s voting for Hillary Clinton," Mr. Cruickshanks said. Asked if those American tourists were voting, then, for Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruickshanks paused.
