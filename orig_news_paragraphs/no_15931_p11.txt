On Monday, the President expressed dismay at the news of Warmbier’s death, calling North Korea a "brutal regime" and telling tech CEOs gathered at the White House that a lot of bad things happened to the student while he was held there. In a written statement, Trump said, "Melania and I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier on his untimely passing. There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Otto’s family and friends, and all who loved him."
