(Not in the mood? Head on over to Facebook and watch our cool little video about making a ricotta tart. See if you don’t want to make that baby tonight or later this week.) If I were cooking, I’d be pleased this evening to serve Pierre Franey’s great old recipe for chicken breasts with lemon alongside some plain rice and a platter of green beans with shallots.
