If you were an alien and had just beamed down to Doral, Fla. the gold letters on a Spanish   building amid 800 acres of golf courses would leave no doubt as to who owns the resort: TRUMP. You might, however, find yourself wondering if this Trump fellow is a reality television star, a titan of industry or a vintner. Trump chardonnay and Trump sauvignon blanc (about $25 each) line the shelves of the Marketplace Cafe at Trump National Doral Miami.
