The debilitating impact this is having inside the older, more established institutions of the American Jewish community is profound. As the     Jewish left grows in size and scope, the older establishment institutions are either marginalized or simply taken over altogether. By far the largest and most important of all communal Jewish organizations, the United Jewish Appeal, recently elected to lead its New York affiliate Aliza Doctoroff, an open supporter of the notorious New Israel Fund, which is a major sponsor of the   BDS (Boycott, Divest and Sanctions) movement that seeks the destruction of the Jewish state through demonization, delegitimization and economic strangulation. That the ADL and other Jewish groups should accuse Donald Trump of   for suggesting we try and prevent more antisemites from coming to this country must have George Orwell spinning in his grave at record speed.
