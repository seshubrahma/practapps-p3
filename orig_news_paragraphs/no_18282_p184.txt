Extremely receptive. I   even talked about the crisis with the pharmaceutical industry and   how the government has to have some leverage on these prices. You   know, I was there for a long time, and it was a very pleasant   meeting. Where it ended up was not where I wanted it to, and   thatâ€™s why I kind of stood against this healthcare bill.
