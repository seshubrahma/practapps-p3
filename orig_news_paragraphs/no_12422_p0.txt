Monday  on CNBC’s "Squawk Box," the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET) Bob Johnson said after a Sunday meeting at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with   Donald Trump that   should give the incoming president "a shot and give him the benefit of the doubt. "  Discussing how the meeting was set up, Johnson said, "You know how these things happen, a friend calls a friend and they say, you know, Bob,   Trump would like to meet with you to talk about how he can better reach out to the   community, and I said, that’s a positive sign, so I accepted the invitation. We had a great chat. The most important thing that came out of the meeting, he and I agreed, and if you recall in the election, he asked what do   have to lose, and I said   Trump, the real question is what do they have to gain by your presidency?
