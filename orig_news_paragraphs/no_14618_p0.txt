Washington Informal talks scheduled for next week between a North Korean delegation and a team of former US officials were canceled Friday after the Trump administration withdrew its initial approval of the North Koreans’ visas, two people who had planned to participate said. The   talks were to be held in New York between the US experts and a   team of North Koreans led by Choe   the director of the American affairs bureau of the country’s foreign ministry. Donald Zagoria, the head of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, an advocacy group that was organizing the talks, emailed participants Friday morning to say next week’s meeting would proceed as scheduled after receiving assurances that the visas would be granted, the two participants said.     But hours later, Zagoria sent a   email to the group saying the visas were not approved and the talks were off.
