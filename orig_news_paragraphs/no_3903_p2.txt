According to Trump, apparently citing the   climate model, the most climate activists could hope to gain from Americaâ€™s dearly bought reductions in carbon dioxide emissions is  0. 2 degrees Celsius less warming over the rest of the century. This did not stop the political left from accusing the President of "telling the Earth to drop dead," by pulling out of the   climate accord. Trump cast doubt on the lofty goals supposedly motivating the accord, pointing out how it allows to China, India, and even Europe to continue to ramp up coal production while placing incredible burdens on our own domestic industry.
