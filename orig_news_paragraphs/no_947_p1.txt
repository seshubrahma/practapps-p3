The comments appeared intended to set an upbeat tone for a first meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that is provisionally scheduled for next month at Mr. Trump’s    resort in Florida. In an annual news conference that lasted more than two hours, Mr. Li stressed his optimism about relations with the United States. " This relationship is crucial for not just China and the United States, but also for regional and global peace, security and stability, and we have to protect its progress," Mr. Li told hundreds of reporters at the end of the annual meeting of China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress.
