At an earlier rally in San Jose, criminals leapt on top of cars, chased down Trump supporters like prey, stalked and mobbed other supporters, stole Trump signs and hats from supporters and destroyed them. Many of them were masked and waving Mexican flags, and burned American flags. Screaming and violent demonstrators shut down a Chicago rally and launched similar attacks against supporters and police, also while waving Mexican flags. Countless death threats have been levied at Trump as the media celebrates them, even giving a sympathetic interview a wannabe killer who rushed Trump.
