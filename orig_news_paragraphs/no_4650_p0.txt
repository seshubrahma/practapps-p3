While Chuck Schumer complains that "America cannot afford a Twitter presidency," Rupert Neate writing at The Guardian examines how   Donald Trump’s use of Twitter has shaped the actions of major manufacturers before he has even taken office:[After his election win, Trump credited Twitter and other social media platforms with helping him beat Hillary Clinton despite her much higher advertising spending. " The fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc, I think it helped me win all of these races where they’re spending much more money than I spent," he told CBS’s 60 Minutes programme. Trump has said he will rest his Twitter fingers when he is sworn in as the 45th president on 20 January.
