Airlines were expected to remove travel alerts from their websites and get messages out to customers to alert them about the change. It is possible there will be more court activity and an appeal before anyone could act on getting a visa, and itâ€™s unclear how long it would take to obtain one. US airlines use an automated system connected to the Customs and Border Protection database to scan passports and visas to get an instant determination if the passenger can board or not. Unless the government reinstates visas and the airlines get a "board" status, the airlines still would not allow such passengers to board.
