 (CNN) Vice President Joe Biden confirmed Thursday that he and President Barack Obama were briefed last week by intelligence officials on unsubstantiated claims that Russia may have compromising information on   Donald Trump.   CNN first reported that the nationâ€™s top intelligence chiefs provided both the President and   a   written synopsis of the claims, which came from a   report compiled by a former British intelligence operative based on Russian sources. Intelligence agencies appended a   summary of the unverified allegations to documents prepared for the briefing on Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.
