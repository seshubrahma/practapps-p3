In her 1964 landmark book, Schlalfy explained that the Kingmakers want "to nominate candidates who would sidestep or suppress the key issues" by compromising with Democrats on the issues that matter to Republican voters. In so doing, the Kingmakers create a sort of monopoly consensus on particular issues —  and, as a result, voters are denied their ability to choose a candidate who represents their interests, since each party’s nominee represents merely an echo of the other side. For instance, the Kingmakers’   this election, Marco Rubio, shares President Obama’s same goals on mass immigration and trade —   with both men trying to make it easier to import cheaper foreign goods and labor. Schlafly explained that echoing the Democrats’ policy platform on the critical issues of the day makes a Republican candidate weaker —  not stronger.
