The poll found that 36 percent of white evangelicals said they strongly supported Mr. Trump, while in June 2012, just 26 percent said they strongly supported Mr. Romney. Mr. Romney faced resistance from some evangelicals because of his Mormon faith. Mr. Trump is a member of the Presbyterian Church U. S. A. a liberal mainline Protestant denomination, has demonstrated little fluency in the Bible or Christianity, and has said that he has never asked God for forgiveness. But the poll showed that voters in general, including evangelicals, were dissatisfied with their options this year.
