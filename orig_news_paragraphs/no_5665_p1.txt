Maria Espinoza,   and National Director of the Remembrance Project, was thrilled by the change in direction she heard at the press conference, telling Breitbart News: These joint press conference in indicative of the dedication and commitment America will enjoy with America’s new era   —   the Trump Era!   We had the high honor of having separate and private meetings with U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly.
