In a statement, Seth Jaffe, an agency spokesman, said that officials there were "excited" by Mr. Trump’s announcements on conflicts of interest and that the messages were not based on any information about the  ’s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. Asked later about the disclosure of the advice that the Office of Government Ethics had given to Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Mr. Jaffe said he could not provide additional comment. But the agency has left the posts on its official government account. Officials for Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment about the disclosures from the agency.
