The governments of Italy, France, and Germany Thursday flatly rejected U. S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s offer to renegotiate the Paris climate accord. ["We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies," the leaders of the three countries said in a joint statement.   Earlier Wednesday, Trump had announced that the U. S. would withdraw from the Paris agreement and immediately begin negotiations to   on terms that are "fair to the United States. "
