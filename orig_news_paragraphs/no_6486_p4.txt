So far this year, nearly 2 million more people didn’t keep their coverage through Obamacare’s individual insurance marketplace   —   in large part because of doubling premiums, dwindling choices, and less access to the care that’s right for them. As the Senate moves forward with our effort to repeal and replace this failing law, the House is continuing to take action this week with legislation that will protect and expand access to affordable, quality health care options for our veterans, workers, and families.
