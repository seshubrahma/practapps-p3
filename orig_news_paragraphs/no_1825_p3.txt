Mrs. Clinton has delivered a broad message of national unity in the campaignâ€™s closing days, offering herself to voters as an avatar of tolerance and reconciliation, in contrast to Mr. Trump. She campaigned on Sunday in New Hampshire with Khizr Khan, the father of an Army captain slain in Iraq, whose speech in July castigating Mr. Trump as biased against Muslims and immigrants electrified the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Khan branded Mr. Trump as a figure of exclusion and division, asking of him, rhetorically: "Would anyone who is not like you have a place in your America? " Mr. Trump, for his part, warned voters that they would never again see a candidate like him within reach of the presidency.
