But Senator Richard Blumenthal ( ) —  a staunch Clinton supporter —  urged the gun control groups not to switch to their loyalties too quick. Blumenthal said: I have deep admiration for Michael Bloomberg’s eloquent advocacy on this issue, but I think Hillary Clinton has demonstrated over many years her equal passion and fervor. My hope is that no candidate owns this issue and that they are all on the right side with the same passion and commitment, and that it becomes a defining issue between the Democrat and Republican candidates, not among the candidates on our side. Yet gun control groups are already choosing between candidates on the Democrat side.
