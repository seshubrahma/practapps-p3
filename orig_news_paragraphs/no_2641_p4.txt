That case was a professional breakout for Mr. Harder, who had previously been known for handling   —   and usually, settling  —   more routine rights’ enforcement cases for celebrities. After the trial, Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur, revealed that he had secretly financed Mr. Bollea’s lawsuit and other legal cases against Gawker. Mr. Harder is also representing Melania Trump, the wife of the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, in a libel lawsuit filed last week against the publisher of The Daily Mail.
