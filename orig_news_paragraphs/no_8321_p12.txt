Supporters see them as crucial to South Korea’s industrial success, while detractors say they benefit from political favoritism. One of the major charges against Park’s friend Choi   is that she directed large donations from the chaebols to favored foundations, in exchange for promises of favorable treatment by the government.

He will complete his term as Secretary General soon, but has not yet confirmed an interest in the presidency.
