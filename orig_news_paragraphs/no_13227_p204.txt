Trump has called into all of the major cable television networks. Trump says there is "great love" for his message at the stadiums. Trump says he thinks he did the right thing tonight after meeting with law enforcement after they told him that people could get hurt. Trump blasts CNN, like he did Fox News, for playing the same clips over and over again after the protesters have dispersed.
