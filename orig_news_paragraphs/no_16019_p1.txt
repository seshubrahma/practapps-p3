A Wall Street   News poll, meanwhile, pegs Clinton’s lead at 5 points, 46% to 41%.   Trump is emerging from a difficult phase in his campaign, including the firing of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, anemic fundraising and widespread blowback from his party over his labeling of an   federal judge as "Mexican" and therefore biased in his Trump University legal proceedings.   The   Clinton advantage would suggest those controversies have badly damaged Trump    but the   lead would indicate he’d survived the last month largely unscathed.    Another example of the widely differing results: When   choices like Libertarian Gary Johnson are factored in, the Washington   News poll showed Clinton still ahead by 10 points, while her lead shrank to 1 point in the Wall Street   News survey.
