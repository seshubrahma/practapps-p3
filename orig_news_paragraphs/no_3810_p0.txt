With sexual assault cases up more than 60 per cent in just one year, and ‘unaccompanied minors’ mugging pensioners to pay for hard drugs, police in Uppsala admit crime in the city has reached new levels. ["These are challenges like we’ve never seen before" said Uppsala police commissioner Daniel Larsson, quoted in a press release on the force ’s website which states the city has "a brand new street scene [  …    ] today compared to just a few years ago. "   Between summer 2015 and summer 2016 the city also saw a 60 per cent rise in muggings, and police reported that officers feel they are facing a "harsher climate and reduced respect for their profession" while out on patrol.
