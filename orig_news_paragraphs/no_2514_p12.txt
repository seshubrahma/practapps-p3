Another paper, published this year in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, looked at the same question through a different lens. That study examined   outcomes, like how long students stayed in school and how much they earned as adults, for students in districts with and without   funding changes. Here, too, researchers saw gains with more money spent. That study was conducted by C. Kirabo Jackson of Northwestern, Rucker C. Johnson from the University of California at Berkeley and Claudia Persico, then a graduate student at Northwestern and now an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin.
