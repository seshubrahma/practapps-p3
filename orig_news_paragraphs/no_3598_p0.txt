Arizonaâ€™s state board of education (SBE) has voted to "rebrand" Common Core, i. e. replace the existing Common Core standards with the same standards that contain only some minor changes. ["The Arizona Board of Education has voted to approve new education standards to replace the Common Core State Standards," Education Week reports,   "But the changes are minor rather than a   repudiation of the   effort to set standards for what students should know in   arts and mathematics. "  The prominent change in the standards is the addition of cursive writing lessons through fifth grade, an element that Common Core does not provide.
