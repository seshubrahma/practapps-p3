After boasting that the USS Carl Vinson strike group was being dispatched to the Korean Peninsula in a "show of force," the US was forced to walk back the claims after it emerged that the ships in question were actually on their way to participate in military exercises in the Indian Ocean, some 3, 500 miles in the opposite direction. Instead, the strike group will arrive off the Korean Peninsula by the end of April, multiple US defense officials told CNN. The Pentagon announced on April 18 that it will conduct two major tests of its ability to shoot down missiles launched out of North Korea in May. On April 19, the UN Security Council tried to address North Koreaâ€™s latest missile launch with a proposed statement that would have condemned the test, but Russia used its veto to torpedo the motion.
