Placed on the defensive again today about the emails. And by the way, you heard it here first if it happens. I would not be surprised to see the Clintons announce at some stage that the global initiative, the big Clinton affair, in September, that this September will be the last time that they hold that. They haven’t announced it yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see them do it, because they’re taking so much heat from that and the emails.
