The company said it plans to create a total of 7, 000 new jobs over the next two or three years, including the 450 jobs on axle production, the 1, 500 new jobs announced with the investment, and more than 5, 000 jobs related to engineering, GM financial, and advanced technology, Reuters reported. GM also said it plans to bring back information technology jobs that were previously outsourced to foreign countries in a move that will create 5, 000 new IT jobs in the U. S. over the next few years. " All of the decisions behind todayâ€™s announcement are good business decisions and they have been in the works for some time," said GM spokesman Pat Morrissey.
