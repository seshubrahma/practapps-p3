■ Some forecast models suggested late Thursday that the storm had moved slightly eastward, raising hopes that Florida would be spared a direct strike. ■ The eye of the hurricane was about 125 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Fla. as of 11 p. m. on Thursday, moving northwest at 13 m. p. h. as it churned away from the Bahamas. The eye was projected to pass near Cape Canaveral at about 8 a. m. Friday, and to pass close to Jacksonville about 12 hours later.
