The overall results are a departure from a spate of recent public polls    including a   survey released last week that put Trump up, 45% to 43%    that show the race tightening in recent weeks.   President Barack Obama ’s approval rating is at 58% the Washington   News poll poll finds, his highest since July 2009. That’s one of several differences between the   poll and the   survey, which pegged Obama’s approval rating at 51%.
