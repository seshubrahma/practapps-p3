The move by six senators is the latest warning from Capitol Hill to the new administration over   relations. On Wednesday, a group led by Sens. Lindsey Graham,   Carolina, and Ben Cardin,   plan to introduce legislation that would impose strict new congressional oversight and veto power over the Trump administration if it decided to lift sanctions on Russia.   The Russia Review Act would require the White House to submit a report detailing why it was seeking to lift sanctions, setting into motion a   review period where Congress could vote to disapprove of easing the penalties on the country, according to a summary of the measure provided to CNN. Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is cosponsoring the   measure, along with Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican John McCain of Arizona.
