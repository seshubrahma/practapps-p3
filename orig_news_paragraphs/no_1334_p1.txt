Among the names under discussion by Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Clinton and campaign advisers: Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, former governors from the key state of Virginia Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who represents both a more liberal wing of the party and a swing state former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, a prominent   Democrat and Thomas E. Perez, President Obama’s labor secretary and a Hispanic civil rights lawyer.

One obvious possibility is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is hugely popular among progressive Democrats, though she has not been helpful to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, declining to endorse the former secretary of state.
