Green, along with Lyft   and president John Zimmer,   published an  on Tuesday outlining how exactly this might work, but   basically, the   propose that by building out more      thus reducing traffic. ’ ’    "These smart lanes will have dynamic pricing to control for   congestion, so they will be able to guarantee that that road can   flow at 45 miles per hour or 50 miles per hour minimum. You then   create a free option, so you say any person with three or more   people in their car gets in this lane for free," Green said.
