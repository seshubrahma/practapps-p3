Washington (CNN) Next week is shaping up to inflict the most dramatic damage on television yet to Donald Trump’s campaign, with forces behind Hillary Clinton planning to outspend him by $13 million, a wider gap than any week so far. Clinton’s campaign has reserved about $7. 5 million in advertising time the week of July 4, according to advertising records reviewed Tuesday by   Media, a company that tracks political advertising. Clinton’s super PAC, Priorities USA, plans to spend $5. 5 million, with both groups devoting most of their cash to Florida and Ohio.
