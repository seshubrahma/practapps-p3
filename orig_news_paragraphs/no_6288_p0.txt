The budget bill Republicans will use to begin Obamacare’s repeal would also eliminate Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding, according to House Speaker Paul Ryan. ["Planned Parenthood legislation would be in our reconciliation bill," Ryan said Thursday, according to The Hill.   Republicans plan to use reconciliation as a procedural tool that permits legislation pertaining to fiscal policy to pass with a simple majority and without filibuster by Democrats in the Senate. The GOP had previously passed legislation last year that repealed portions of Obamacare and defunded Planned Parenthood through the reconciliation process, but President Barack Obama vetoed it.
