By 2013, at the start of his second term, he declined to support Mr. Boehner’s   as speaker, abstaining from the vote in protest. At the same time, unlike some members of the caucus, Mr. Mulvaney, 49, has also supported Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner’s successor as speaker, and has served as a quiet back channel between Mr. Ryan and conservative members. Impish and sometimes   Mr. Mulvaney seemed to chafe at serving in the shadow of Mr. Gowdy and Mr. Scott, who are best friends and shining stars in their party and home state. Mr. Mulvaney has now found a political home where he can stand out.
