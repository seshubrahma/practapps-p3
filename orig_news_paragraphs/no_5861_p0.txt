The music video for electronic    Moby’s latest song depicts President Donald Trump as a Nazi robot who is eventually blown up by a band of rebellious citizens. [The   video for Moby’s song "In This Cold Place" sees an evil capitalist Trump, who transforms into a flying swastika money symbol, in a battle to take over a slowly decaying world. Visuals in the trippy video include a border wall, President Richard Nixon with a   nose that grows and wraps around the world, and several popular cartoon characters, including   the Care Bears, Mickey Mouse, and Mario.
