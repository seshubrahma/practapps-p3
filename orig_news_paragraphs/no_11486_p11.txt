In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles   —   or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into the country  …    . Finally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends material support to terrorism.
