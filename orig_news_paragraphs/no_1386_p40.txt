Roger Eatwell, a professor at the University of Bath, in England, calls it "illiberal democracy," a form of government that keeps the trappings of democracy without the reality. " Elections are seen as important to legitimizing regimes," he said, but instead of imposing   rule, as in the past, todayâ€™s authoritarians "use a variety of devices to control   manipulate the media, intimidate opponents" and so on. Either way, it has found pockets of support on both sides of the Atlantic.
