President Trump tweeted this week that he hopes that the Senate can soon pass a health care overhaul bill. The president also believes that the Senate should switch to a 51 person majority to pass legislation. Switching to a 51 person majority might avoid the complications that arise from using budgetary reconciliation to pass health care and tax reform. Hopefully Republican Senators, good people all, can quickly get together and pass a new (repeal  replace) HEALTHCARE bill.
