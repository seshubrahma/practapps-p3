As far as the Comey thing goes, I think he gave him plenty of chances. I think what became the last straw was when he (Comey) made that statement about the classified emails showing up on (Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s and her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s) laptop. You can’t have rules for the elitist ruling class and not have those rules apply to everybody else. I think in my opinion that was part of (Trump’s) decision.
