The administration has already asked Congress to appropriate more than $60 million to help speed hiring, including money to encourage agents to move to less desirable regions along the border and expand recruiting efforts. Some of the money will help extend Customs and Border Protectionâ€™s outreach efforts at high schools and colleges and amplify its social media presence in order "to reach the millennial generation," the memo says. Though the number of people apprehended at the border has fallen sharply in recent months and some detention beds are now empty, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has found 27 private and government facilities with 21, 000 more potential beds for detention, according to the document. But it notes that the agency does not have the money to pay for them.
