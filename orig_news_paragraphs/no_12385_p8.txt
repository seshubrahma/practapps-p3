Trump also said he would get Washington, D. C. out of education, and said he favored local control of education and the dismantling of the U. S. Department of Education. Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, said in a statement prior to the announcement of DeVosâ€™ nomination:   Trump rightly slammed Governor Jeb Bush for his support of Common Core on the campaign trail. Betsy DeVos would be a very   pick, and the idea that Trump would appoint a Common Core apologist as Secretary of Education seems unlikely.    Donald J. Trump will nominate Betsy DeVos, a brilliant and passionate education advocate, as Education Secretary.
