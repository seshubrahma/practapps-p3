Washington (CNN) The Senate Intelligence Committee is asking more than a dozen agencies, organizations and individuals to preserve communications related to the panelâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.   The panel, led by chairman Richard Burr,   Carolina, and top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia, sent letters asking for those materials to be kept, a Senate aide said Sunday. The letters were sent Friday, the same day committee members discussed Russia in a private meeting with FBI Director James Comey.
