While Wintour remains opposed to the Trump administration, saying "Dissent is not enough," she also praised longtime fashion colleague Ivanka Trump, who has been invited by Wintour to attend the annual Costume Institute’s Met Gala, known as the ‘Oscars’ of the fashion industry. " Ivanka has had a long history with the magazine, and I have respect for Ivanka and everything that she has achieved," Wintour told BOF. Wintour also left the door open to putting First Lady Melania Trump on the cover of American Vogue.
