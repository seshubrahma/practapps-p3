Younger people on the Left side of the American political spectrum are generally given a negative view of the Fifties, especially with respect to racism and stodgy, judgmental "Ozzie and Harriet" culture, while the late Sixties are seen as a mystical transformative experience. Young people on the Right are more likely to hear about the virtues of those earlier times, or to be concerned about modern trends in divorce, illegitimacy, and   career anxiety. Both the good and bad things happened, of course, but a holistic view of a   â€™s worth of culture will depend on emphasis.
