As Breitbart News reported recently, members of the Black Bloc appeared to engage in a similar test late Monday night as they led law enforcement on a wild   around downtown Cleveland. Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby, who is familiar with leftist protest tactics, said: The entire appeared to be a stress test and a test of the   protesters numbers. They put a call out to gather and people trickled in. The protesters wanted to see if they could make it to the main entrance to the convention and how the police would react.
