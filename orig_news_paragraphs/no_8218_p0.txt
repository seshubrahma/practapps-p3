Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says she feels sympathy for Donald Trump supporters who are taken in by the New Yorker, but warned voters that she thinks his message is offensive. ["I am sympathetic to a lot of the people attracted by Trump’s message, who are feeling really left out and left behind," she said during a YouTube Creators summit in Los Angeles, California on Tuesday.   She asserted that many Trump supporters had lost their faith   —   in the government, in politics, and in the economic system and were losing hope in the future of their country.
