The problem is, in addition to Trump’s checkered past, he has done little to woo black voters since declaring his candidacy    and he has had plenty of opportunities, beginning with the primary in South Carolina, where blacks account for nearly 30% of the population.   If Trump was serious about education reform, he could have visited crumbling, underfunded and predominantly black schools along Interstate 95 known as the "Corridor of Shame" and unveiled his plan for America’s public schools.   If he was committed to helping minority businesses, he could have toured manufacturing plants in Greenville and explained his plan for expanding their access to capital and corporate supply chains.   If he was sincere about healing divisions, he could have worshiped at Mother Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, where a man who police said wanted to start a race war admitted killing nine churchgoers, including the pastor    my friend and state senator Clementa Pinckney    and talked about racial reconciliation.
