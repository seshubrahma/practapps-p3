The extent of the contamination came as a shock to residents of the complex, even though it is just north of a huge former U. S. S. Lead smelting plant and on top of a smaller former smelting operation, in an area that was designated a Superfund site in 2009. Now, in a situation that many fearful residents are comparing to the water crisis in Flint, Mich. they are asking why neither the state nor the Environmental Protection Agency told them just how toxic their soil was much sooner, and a timeline is emerging that suggests a painfully slow government process of confronting the problem. The mayorâ€™s sudden decision to raze the complex, which is run by the East Chicago Housing Authority, and close an adjacent elementary school turns on its head a plan the E. P. A. has had since 2012 to remove the contaminated soil without displacing residents. People in this heavily industrialized city just south of Chicago are also asking why their governor, Mike Pence, the Republican   nominee, visited flood victims in Baton Rouge, La. this month while campaigning with Donald J. Trump, but has not found time to come to East Chicago.
