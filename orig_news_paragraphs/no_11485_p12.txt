—   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016, Chicago’s murder rate has soared over the last year and is on track to end with more deaths than the city has seen in decades, and perhaps ever. Thus far this year the Windy City has seen an incredible 2, 811 shooting incidents from which 432 citizens have been shot and killed. Trump has been making a special appeal to African American voters over the past few weeks and this latest outrage in Chicago  —   one of the most dangerous cities in America   —   is exactly the sort of thing he has been warning about.
