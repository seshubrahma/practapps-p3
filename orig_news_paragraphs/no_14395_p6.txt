Each one likely has a section labeled "events," "meet (insert member’s name here)" or something related that indicates when and where the member of Congress has scheduled events. Most every member of Congress has a newsletter as well you can sign up for to get updates on their actions. If you don’t want to clog your email inbox, you can also call and ask their offices, generally during business hours. Members of Congress have offices on Capitol Hill and in the area they hail from, so you should have plenty to choose from.
