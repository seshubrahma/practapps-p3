Along with Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel is also headquartered immediately south of the Texas border. The Mexican state of Tamaulipas is largely controlled by the two paramilitary groups. All of the news outlets in the region have a "link" who works for the cartel and tells journalists what they can and canâ€™t write about. Journalists and editors who ignore the control of the local cartel faction are brutally murdered.
