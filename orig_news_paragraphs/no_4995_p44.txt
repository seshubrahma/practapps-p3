: Attacker was    Salman Abedi, CBS reports the suicide bomber who killed 22 on Monday evening was    Salman Abedi, who they report was "known to British authorities" prior to the attack. If this is so, Abedi would be the man the Islamic State claimed as a "soldier of the Khaliph" on Tuesday. Abedi is distinct from another 23 year old man arrested as a suspect in Manchester Tuesday morning. The NBS network has published a similar claim, but stated the killerâ€™s name was spelt slightly differently as Salmon Ramadan Abedi.
