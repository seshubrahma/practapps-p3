As polls closed in the Buckeye State on Tuesday evening, it was still too close to call in Kasich’s Ohio but exit polls show the governor has an edge —  and while Cruz won Texas a couple weeks ago on March 1, and has won a handful of other states with it throughout the core heartland of the country —   no candidate save for Trump has been able to build such a diverse selection of state victories and such a broad coalition of voters inside the GOP, and among independents and crossover Democrats. Cruz’s factional nature, and Kasich’s inability to mount a serious national campaign outside his home state, are sure to propel Trump higher and higher as the only Republican who can unify the party and defeat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election moving forward. Sure,   forces within the party are still trying anything and everything they can to desperately aim to slow the   momentum of Trump’s ascension down, but they’re running out of options as the battle heads into a dog fight for delegates between Cruz and Kasich and Trump in the next stages of battle.
