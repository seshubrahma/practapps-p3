Under pressure to name some national security advisers, campaign staffers produced a list of names for Trump to refer to, according to a US official close to the campaign. Trump mentioned Page, in part because he had a Ph. D. listed next to his name, the official said. Trump had never met Page. Sam Clovis,   of the campaign, helped gather the names that the candidate used.
