The same is true, Mr. Greenwald said, of another set of N. S. A. intercepts released by WikiLeaks that showed that the United States bugged conversations of United Nations officials and European allies, including private   talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the United Nations secretary general, Ban  . On Wednesday, Mr. Assange said he had his own separate sources for N. S. A. material. That raises the question of whether another,   N. S. A.   is leaking documents to WikiLeaks, or whether the files were obtained from the outside via a sophisticated cyberespionage operation, possibly sponsored by a state actor. That question was underscored by Mr. Assangeâ€™s statement a few weeks ago that he would release the codes that the United States uses to hack others.
