John R. Allen, the retired   Marine Corps general who commanded American forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere, delivered a thundering endorsement of Mrs. Clinton because, he said, "the stakes are enormous" not to. Flanked by fellow veterans, Mr. Allen said that Mrs. Clinton would use all the "instruments of American power" to defeat ISIS, strengthen NATO, and honor its treaties. " Without any hesitation or reservation," Hillary Clinton will be "exactly, exactly the kind of    America needs," Mr. Allen said.
