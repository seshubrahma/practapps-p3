We have made very clear our concerns about Russiaâ€™s violation, the risks it poses to European and Asian security, and our strong interest in returning Russia to compliance with the treaty," Toner added. Just last week, a US Navy warship in the Black Sea had three encounters with Russian aircraft Friday that were deemed to be unsafe and unprofessional because of how close the Russian planes flew to the US, according to a senior defense official.    The USS Porter, a   destroyer, was operating in the Black Sea when it was approached three times by Russian aircraft, including one   and two  . The Navy calculated the Russian planes may be have flown as close as 1, 000 yards laterally from the ship and 1, 000 feet over the water, but did not cross the deck of the Porter.
