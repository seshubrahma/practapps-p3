A    who makes $15, 000 a year and buys a policy on the individual market would probably spend $8, 400 on premiums a year: more than 56% of their income.   These are "increases the American people cannot afford," LeaMond said. And although the new legislation would not include a return to the   days when companies could refuse to sell a policy if a person had a   condition, an insurance company could charge that person 30% more if they have a   gap in coverage.
