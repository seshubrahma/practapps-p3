Everybody considered Senator John Tower of Texas a movement conservative even though he supported legal abortion. Over time, though, as conservatives grew more opposed to abortion and liberals more supportive of it, it became an issue that voters used to sort candidates by ideology  …     voters who knew that a candidate opposed it could also be reasonably sure that he would oppose gun control and tax increases   —   or, at least , that he was more likely to oppose it than someone who favored legal abortion.
