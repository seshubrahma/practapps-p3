In 2017, the campaign starting gun went off in dueling rallies inside the US Capitol, during an extraordinary morning of drama and theater emblematic of the coming Trump era. The Vice   arriving in one corner of the Capitol, and almost simultaneously, split screen, the outgoing president arriving in another.
