GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski joined Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM with guest host Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle and called for Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich to unite behind Trump. ["After Tuesday night, Ted Cruz, like John Kasich, is now mathematically eliminated from securing enough delegates to be the Republican nominee, and what we want is everyone to support Donald Trump," Lewandowski told Boyle. He added he wants Cruz and Kasich to "come in, join the campaign, unite around the frontrunner and lets make sure we all have our eye on the prize, which is to ensure we do n’t have four more years of a Democrat in the White House.
