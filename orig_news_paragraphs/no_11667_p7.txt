I’ve stopped speaking with some people I know, and blocked many others on social media, because they support a man who is diametrically opposed to nearly everything in which I believe.   On the other hand, although I’m a gay man with liberal views on social issues such as marriage equality, I’m staunchly conservative on other subjects, ranging from economics to foreign policy. So I’ve gotten grief from all sides. In my opinion, there is a rational way to express political disagreement with someone, and there is the mindless, kneejerk, politically      bullying way to do so.
