But over longer spans, coastlines have been much more dynamic. During ice ages, caused by wobbles in the Earthâ€™s orbit, sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land. But during periods slightly warmer than today, the sea may have risen 70 or more feet above the current level. Dr. Dutton and other leading scientists are focused on the last   high point, which occurred between the last two ice ages, about 125, 000 years ago.
