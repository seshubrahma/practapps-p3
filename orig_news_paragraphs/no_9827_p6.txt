The race between Clinton and Trump does appear to have tightened considerably with just 50 days to go until Election Day on November 8. Reuters reported Friday that the candidates were running virtually even in a tally of projected electoral college votes, while a number of recent national polls also have the candidates tied, or even have Trump ahead. A Los Angeles Times daily tracking poll released Monday found Trump with a 6.   lead over Clinton nationally, with a   47. 8 percent support compared to Clintonâ€™s 41. 1 percent.
