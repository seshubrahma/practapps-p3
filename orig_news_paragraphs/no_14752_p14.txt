Democrats have promised at least 100 amendments, most of which have no chance of passage. For instance, one defeated measure would have blocked health care reform coming into force unless it ensured coverage for every taxpayer and all their dependents.

It also proposes restructuring Medicaid and defunding Planned Parenthood.
