Trump and his nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, represent the   face of American politics on racial justice.   By normalizing the demonization of predominantly black neighborhoods across the nation as unworthy of federal protection and resources, Trump signals to both ordinary citizens and political institutions the value that should be placed on the black folk who live there.   Sessions, meanwhile, has adopted less combative rhetoric but has called the Voting Rights Act "intrusive," prosecuted civil rights activists for voter fraud and expressed support for voter ID laws. 2017 promises to offer a racial landscape at the federal level that echoes aspects of King’s era more than our recent past, where President Obama’s rise gave way to grand expectations that the nation had finally turned the corner on race.
