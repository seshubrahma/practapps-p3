"Recently, the US military has dispatched multiple ships and aircraft to conduct operations in waters and airspace facing China, infringing upon our sovereignty and endangering the lives of front line personnel from both sides," the ministry said in a statement. " The Chinese military will resolutely fulfill its duties to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and security," the ministry said. Wednesday’s encounter comes on the heels of last week’s incident in which two Chinese   fighter jets intercepted a US Air Force radiation detection plane over the East China Sea, according to the US Pacific Air Forces.
