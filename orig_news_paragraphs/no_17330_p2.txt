A veto ’in the public interest’ Current state law, which Kasich signed in 2011, forbids abortions of what the statute calls viable fetuses, or fetuses that can survive outside the womb. Abortions beginning at 20 weeks’ gestation require a doctor’s finding that the fetus is not viable. Exceptions are made in cases where the woman’s health is at serious risk. The new regulations, which take effect in 90 days, eliminate the viability test and simply ban abortions after 20 weeks.
