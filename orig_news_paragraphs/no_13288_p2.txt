Mike Pence did a great job. I think he’s almost universally conceded to have been the winner, and in large part, it’s because on national security he showed the kind of calm, responsible, but strong position that I think reflects the mainstream views in the Republican Party," Bolton offered, adding: That should give comfort, I think, to people who are still undecided at the top of the ticket, that Mike Pence is a very steady voice, and he spoke very sensibly and knowledgeably   —   as opposed to Tim Kaine, who, honestly, looked not just on national security, but on many fronts, like he was repeating memorized talking points, not reflecting his own thinking on some of these subjects. Bolton agreed with Marlow’s contention that Tim Kaine’s claim that Hillary Clinton had somehow shut down Iran’s nuclear program was one of the most outrageous "whoppers" of the night: I think it shows that where his brain ought to be on national security, there’s a big vacuum.
