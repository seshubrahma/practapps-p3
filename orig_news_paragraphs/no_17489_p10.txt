Attendees were split on what to do with illegal immigrants currently in the country, with 37% saying they should be deported 27% saying they should be encouraged to return home and apply for citizenship legally and 18% saying they should be allowed to stay in the U. S. and apply for citizenship. More than   of attendees supported Congress using its "spending power" to try to defund President Barack Obama’s executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrants, despite the fact that the measure cannot be defunded. And a plurality, 41% support marijuana legalization, a poll result that drew loud cheers from the young crowd left in the final hour of the final day of the conference. RELATED: CPAC 2015
