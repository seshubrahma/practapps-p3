e. the notion that illegal entry is not in and of itself a deportable offense —   wipes away the protections U. S. immigration laws are supposed to afford Americans citizens. That’s because, in addition to protecting against crime, U. S. immigration law is supposed to protect against the loss of your job to an illegal immigrant, protect against the sapping of your child’s school resources, protect against the draining of your hospital’s resources, protect your tax dollars, and protect your political system and voting franchise (giving citizenship to illegal aliens and their U. S.  children allows them to cancel out the votes of   American citizens). Under Rubio’s vision, millions of people could presumably illegally take jobs, petition for government services, fill U. S. schools, receive affirmative action, alter the country culturally, socially and politically, and be involved in substantial criminal activity so long as they don’t get don’t get caught, tried and convicted for a   related felony. This principle is a central pillar of the open borders philosophy, which desires the free, uninhibited movement of labor across international boundaries.
