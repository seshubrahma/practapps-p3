That is the spirit in which Breitbart News has always operated with Steve as executive chairman. We have Jewish, Catholic, evangelical, Muslim, black, white, Asian, Hispanic, and gay writers (did I miss anyone? ). Steve is a tireless, disciplined manager who demands excellence   â€”   and who seeks talent regardless of distinctions of race, gender, religion, sexuality, or any other kind.
