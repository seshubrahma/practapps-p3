Then there is the effigy of Pope Paul V (the pontiff in 1605) alongside banners reading "no popery" and flaming crosses. Lewes also commemorates the killing of 17 Protestant martyrs who met their horrific deaths in the town well before the Gunpowder Plot. They were victims of the   Marian Persecutions of the 16th century, which took place when Queen Mary (or "Bloody Mary") sought to stamp out Protestantism. There is also an act of remembrance for those who died in the major wars of the 20th century.
