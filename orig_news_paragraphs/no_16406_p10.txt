It is statement like these that give rise and justification to those here and abroad who have burned down and vandalized mosques all over this country, who pushed a woman wearing headscarf onto train tracks, shot cab drivers, and even may have provided validation for three young men in New York who allegedly attacked a   Muslim girl. As they punched her, beat her, tried to rip the scarf off her head, they allegedly called her ISIS.    I’d like to believe that Saturday’s horrendous attack is not a hate crime, and that in any case, it will be the last attack of a Muslim we will see. But it is hard to be optimistic as the elections in November draw nearer.
