Shelton was a virgin when she was raped. Taylor, whose original charge of   rape carried a possible life sentence in prison, served less than a year in county jail for unlawful fondling of a minor after pleading down. Shelton survived, but the attack left her in a coma, unable to bear children, and affected the rest of her life. She became addicted to drugs for a period of time and avoided men after the attack.
