Although Schilling pitched for the Philadelphia Phillies and won a World Series with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001, the righthander is bonded with the Boston fans after being a key part of the Red Sox World Series wins in 2004 and 2007. Schilling and his family live in Medfield, a New England postcard town an hour outside of the city. For Carr, booking Schilling was a coup for the first week of his new simulcast on Newsmax TV. The member of the Radio Hall of Fame told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview the simulcast was the next logical step for his syndicated show, now heard on 24 stations.
