With her eye on the rightâ€™s Paula Jones legal crusade of the 1990s, Gloria Allred, the civil rights lawyer representing women who have accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault, is trying to lure the   into a legal battle before he takes office. Ms. Allred challenged Mr. Trump on Friday to retract his threat to sue his accusers for defaming him and suggested that she might bring a case against him if he refused. She also said that she was prepared to countersue if Mr. Trump made good on the threat. "   Trump now has the opportunity to act presidential," Ms. Allred said at a news conference with Summer Zervos, the former contestant on "The Apprentice" who said last month that Mr. Trump tried to seduce her and grabbed her breasts in 2007.
