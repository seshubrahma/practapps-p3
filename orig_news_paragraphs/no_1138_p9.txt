The loosening of the rules in Somalia comes against the backdrop of a broader, continuing Trump administration policy review about whether to scrap the 2013 rules altogether. The decision was described by officials familiar with the new directive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military planning. Luke Hartig, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said greater action could be helpful in dealing with a threat, pointing to the Obama administrationâ€™s decision last year to temporarily declare the region around Surt, Libya, an   zone. That decision similarly permitted airstrikes that helped Libyan forces root out Islamic State militants.
