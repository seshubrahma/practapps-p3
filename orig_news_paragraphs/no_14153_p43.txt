Shortly after his inauguration, Obama signed executive actions aimed at closing the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and shuttering secret detention facilities    promises he had assured voters of while on the campaign trail.

Unlike executive orders, presidential memos do not have to be released publicly so it is hard to document the exact number issued during a presidentâ€™s term.
