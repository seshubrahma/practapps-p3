Former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta believes that Donald Trump has doomed the entire planet. ["Make no mistake, the Trump administration’s rampage against the environment presents an existential threat to the entire planet," Podesta wrote in the Washington Post on Wednesday.   The former failed campaign manager, a passionate warrior for global warming, appeared distraught after Trump signed an executive order to ratchet back the   environmental regulations that choked businesses and job growth. Podesta appears unwilling to let go of the fact that Clinton lost the election, again citing the popular vote in 2016 as a reason to fight Trump’s agenda.
