The two leaders say they want existing oversight committees    spearheaded by the intelligence panels in each chamber    to examine the issue and possibly propose reforms through legislation or by other means.   Flake, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, seems to be breaking with McCain, a fellow Arizona Republican.    "Sen. Flake believes that the Senateâ€™s standing committees are capable of handling the investigation," said Flake spokesman Jason Samuels. Collins, the moderate Maine Republican, added: "If we were to create a cyber select committee, it would be months before the committee could even begin its investigation," pointing to the need to hire staff who need to undergo extensive background checks to get security clearances.
