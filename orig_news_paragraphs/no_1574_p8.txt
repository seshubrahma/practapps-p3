" We had so much pressure to bring Syrians, that we hadn’t done enough for that crisis," said Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, migration and refugees, who said she had initially questioned whether the target of accepting 10, 000 Syrians  —   part of an overall goal of resettling 85, 000 refugees in the United States this year   —   was feasible. The task involves a rigorous set of security screenings and other checks, and an increased effort by the nonprofit groups involved to find new homes for those who are accepted in the United States.
