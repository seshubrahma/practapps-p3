The solidarity with Damascus is likely to cause problems for Russia in the long run, analysts said, although Mr. Putin probably cannot be persuaded to loosen his embrace any time soon. The Russian government often takes its time to react to major world events, but the Kremlin issued a prompt statement early Friday castigating the United States for the missile strike on Al Shayrat airfield in retaliation for Syria’s chemical weapons attack. The Russian Ministry of Defense vowed to strengthen Syria’s air defense systems, sent a frigate on a port call and froze an agreement with the United States to coordinate activity in Syrian air space. " Putin made a choice  —   to underline that Assad is his ally," said Aleksandr Morozov, an independent political analyst.
