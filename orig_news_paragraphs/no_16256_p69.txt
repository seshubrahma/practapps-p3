Trump has referenced going to ground zero after the attacks in other interviews as well. Trumpâ€™s role in lobbying Congress or fighting for first responders after   is unclear, but during the Republican National Convention last week, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump often helped "when police officers were hot, when firefighters were hurt, when people were in trouble, he came forward and he helped, and he asked not to be mentioned. " Philip Kirschner, a   first responder, told Breitbart News in May that he believes Trump was behind the flight that transported him from Florida to the Cleveland Clinic when his health was declining in 2011.
