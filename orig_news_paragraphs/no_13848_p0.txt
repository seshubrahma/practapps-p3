 (CNN) Sen. Tim Kaine on Thursday criticized   Donald Trump, alleging he is acting like Russian President Vladimir Putin’s "defense lawyer" and calling Trump’s conduct "suspicious."   "Why does   Trump again and again and again take it upon himself to be Vladimir Putin’s defense lawyer rather than listening to and respecting the intelligence professionals of the United States," Kaine told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on "New Day"  in his first national interview since the 2016 presidential election.    The former Democratic vice presidential nominee, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee which is hold a hearing on hacking Thursday, said that even if Trump believes Russia can be America’s ally in the fight against ISIS, he doesn’t have to "trash" American intelligence professionals in the process.
