When a politician says something stupid, reporters are traditionally expected to mask their glee with a veneer of shock and disappointment. It was in this mode, more or less, that the NBC News political director, Chuck Todd, and his colleague Carrie Dann began the Aug. 3 edition of First Read, the network’s daily political tip sheet, warning that Donald Trump’s campaign had gone "from ‘unraveling’ to ‘break glass’ mode. " They began with a heroic attempt to catalog all the previously      things Trump said and did in the preceding 24 hours, a long list that included the candidate’s displaying to a rally audience the Purple Heart medal he had been given by a retired U. S. Army lieutenant colonel who was wounded in Iraq.
