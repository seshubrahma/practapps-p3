Congressman, weâ€™re looking at live pictures right now from WJLA of the scene, the aftermath there. You can see yellow police tape and people beginning to crowd around, trying to figure out what happened.    You have, Congressman, remarkable recall of all the details and what happened and you have a good description of the gunman, who we believe is in custody.
