On Thursday, 70 donors are to meet at Trump Tower in New York, followed by lunch at the Four Seasons hotel. Mr. Trump is expected to attend both the meeting and the lunch, and to proceed to a   event in Richmond, Va. on Friday. It is unclear which version of Mr. Trump is likely to show up. After delivering a conventionally   victory speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump returned to Twitter the next morning to attack the hosts of MSNBCâ€™s "Morning Joe" for covering him unfavorably.
