A mismatch of skills or location, the lack of support like child care and employer discrimination are some of the reasons that high school graduates,   factory workers, members of minorities, baby boomers and others have failed to find or regain a comfortable footing in the labor force. However strong (or weak) last monthâ€™s figures are ultimately viewed, they are a legacy of the Obama administration, since they are based on surveys before Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. Some employers may have made staffing decisions in anticipation of a Republican administration, but this report does not reflect any specific policy changes. (The way the government estimates the jobless rate does not change from one administration to the next.)
