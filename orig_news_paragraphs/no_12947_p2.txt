The criminals had 64, 197 convictions among them, representing a whopping 8, 234 violent crimes. The nearly 20, 000 criminals were released in virtually every state and territory of America, ICE statistics show.

ICE has also tried to claim it is cracking down on illegals skipping court dates, but in fact the agency has simply changed its policy and cut down on issuing court appearances in the first place to make it seem as if fewer of those appearances are being ignored.
