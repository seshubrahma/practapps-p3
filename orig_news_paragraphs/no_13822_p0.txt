Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama delivered a mandate to Democrats on Wednesday: "Donâ€™t rescue" Republicans on Obamacare. Less than three weeks out from leaving the White House, Obama visited Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill with a mission to save his signature healthcare reform law as Republicans are moving quickly to unroll the Affordable Care Act. In the   meeting, the President urged fellow Democrats to not "rescue" Republicans by helping them pass replacement measures, according to sources in the room.
