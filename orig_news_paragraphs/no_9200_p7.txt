The individuals who are selected to be delegates are only bound on their first vote at the convention. If no candidate can secure the 1, 237 delegates necessary to win the nomination on the first vote, all of the Nevada delegates, like delegates in most states, would be free to support whomever they like. Hypothetically, Kasich supporters could fill all of Trumpâ€™s delegate slots. They would be required to support Trump on the first ballot, but could throw their support behind Kasich on subsequent ballots.
