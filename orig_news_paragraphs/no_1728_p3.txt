If I were cooking, I’d be pleased this evening to serve Pierre Franey’s great old recipe for chicken breasts with lemon alongside some plain rice and a platter of green beans with shallots. It makes for a relatively fast meal, and it should leave you time to clean up ahead of the first   debate of this election season. (Alternatively, you can roast up some loaded nachos and eat them while watching, drinking beer and taking a shot of whiskey every time Mrs. Clinton says "breaking down barriers" and each time Mr. Trump mentions "the wall. ")
