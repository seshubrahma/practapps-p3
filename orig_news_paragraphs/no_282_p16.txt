Lt. Eddie W. Elmore of the Florida Highway Patrol said that Mr. Baumer’s death was still under investigation. The police report said only that the driver, a    woman from Florida who had a child in the car, had "failed to maintain her lane" and entered the shoulder, striking Mr. Baumer. Mr. Baumer’s father, Jim, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that the family was planning to set a date for a "celebration of his life" in Providence, where his son had "touched so many people," from fellow students at Brown University, from which he graduated in 2011, to people at the farmers’ market.
