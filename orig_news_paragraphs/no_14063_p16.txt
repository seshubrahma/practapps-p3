The rise and fall in drone strikes in Pakistan closely mirrors the rise and fall of American troop numbers in Afghanistan.   Pakistan’s military operation to secure its northern tribal areas along the   border in 2015 resulted in an influx of militants into Afghanistan as they fled Pakistan, further reducing the number of targets. The United States has killed more than 50 al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in Pakistan since the beginning of the CIA drone campaign. In 2011, before he was killed in a US Navy SEAL raid, bin Laden was considering moving al Qaeda’s key figures out of Pakistan to avoid the strikes.
