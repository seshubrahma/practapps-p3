Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said Tuesday evening that he wanted the Senate panel to hear from Comey as part of its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 elections and questions about potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.   " I still want him to come and testify, even as former FBI director," Warner said in an interview on CNNâ€™s "Erin Burnett OutFront. "
