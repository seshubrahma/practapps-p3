Prop 187 was a popular ballot initiative, which would have prevented illegal aliens from accessing public benefits paid for by U. S. taxpayers. Shortly after the initiative was passed overwhelmingly by California voters, a federal judge blocked it. As The Weekly Standard’s Fred Barnes noted, Ryan was so adamantly opposed to the   effort to crack down on immigration, that he penned a   rebuttal to the National Review, which supported California’s Proposition 187. More recently, in 2013 Ryan worked with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray to eliminate federal budget caps while slashing veterans’ pensions.
