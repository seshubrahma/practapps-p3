Were it not for the disproportionately higher rate of   cases of TB in the state, Utah’s TB rate would be even lower. The breakdown of   cases by the top six counties of origin over these five years in Utah includes Mexico (29. 5 percent) with 39 cases out of 132, India (9. 1 percent) with 12 cases out of 132, Peru (7. 6 percent) with 10 cases out of 132, Phillipines (6. 8 percent) with nine cases out of 132, Burma (4. 5 percent) with six cases out of 132, and Somalia (4. 5 percent) with six cases out of 132: During this   period between 2011 and 2015, a total of 5, 163 refugees were resettled in Utah, primarily from high TB burden countries such as Somalia (1, 188 refugees) Burma (963) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (350) according to the State Department’s interactive website.
