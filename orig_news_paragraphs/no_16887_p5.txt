Most states    37 for this year â€™s balloting    now also offer some form of   early voting, where any voter can go to a polling place before Election Day and cast a ballot for any reason.   The group of states where a majority of ballots are cast early already included the battlegrounds of Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and Colorado, as well as the population centers of Texas and California. More than four in 10 votes were cast early or absentee in Iowa in 2012, along with a third of votes in Ohio and a quarter in Michigan.
