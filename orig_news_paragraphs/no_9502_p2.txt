Peña Nieto made his remarks during a press conference at the North America Leaders’ Summit in Canada on Wednesday with President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Peña Nieto appeared worried by the growing strain of populist sentiment, which he sees as a threat to economic ties in North America. " We have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have a populistic slogan, that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build," Peña Nieto said.
