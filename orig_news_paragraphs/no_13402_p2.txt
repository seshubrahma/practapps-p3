Seehofer has previously threatened to withdraw support from Ms. Merkel and refuse to form a coalition with her party after the federal elections next year should they not come to an agreement on migrant caps. The Bavarian minister president asserted that Merkel lacked the political will to cap the number of migrants entering the country   —   a move already enacted by neighbouring Austria. The comments by the CDU leader and chancellor reopen the rift between the two sister parties who have been diverging since the start of the migrant crisis with Seehofer’s party turning more to the right.
