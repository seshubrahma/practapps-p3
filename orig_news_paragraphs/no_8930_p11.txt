The same day as Clinton’s cancelled Tuesday fundraiser, Trump held two North Carolina rallies. One at High Point University drew at least 2, 000, a fire official told local Fox8 News reporter Jasmine Spencer around an hour before Trump spoke. The event  —   held in the university’s 1, 750 capacity Millis Center   —   was sold out ahead of time.
