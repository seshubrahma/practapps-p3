a Communist strangely ranks as a graver sin than killing tens of millions of people. The Wisconsin senator got that one right, but even after Franklin Roosevelt brought Alger Hiss to Yalta and Harry Truman promoted Harry Dexter White to head the International Monetary Fund the media caricature painted the   as the ones unable to differentiate between Reds and liberals. This same   of the Democratic Party employs the low evidentiary standards and gutter tactics today that they accused their enemies of embracing back then. None dare call it McCarthyism.
