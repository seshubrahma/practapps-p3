I covered political party conventions, presidential debates and inaugurations, and even the controversial Florida recount of 2000. I have voted for Republican candidates and Democrats. In America, my sole identity was American. More recently, as I campaigned for the   ticket, connecting with voters throughout the country, I met Muslim immigrants, Hispanic and black Americans    upstanding citizens, some with family members in the military    who said they feel scared.
