So that gets down to the reason for this rally. The reason that we’re here at FAMU, you have a superb reputation of any university of student activism and of getting people to understand the critical importance of voting. So we’re starting actually a national movement with HBCU’s and other universities as colleges are coming back into session, to talk to students about registering and voting and we want FAMU to lead the way.
