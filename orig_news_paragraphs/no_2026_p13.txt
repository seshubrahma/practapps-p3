But Mr. Van der Bellen’s victory was at least partly explained by a concerted effort to woo rural voters after narrowly winning the first round of voting in May on the strength of urban votes. He visited dozens of rural settings, posed repeatedly in front of the Austrian flag and won 200 more communities than he did in the first round as his victory margin soared to almost 300, 000 votes. Romania has seen a similar situation, as the populist Social Democrats have lost ground in the countryside after the   National Liberals began to compete more vigorously there   —   indicating that there is a way to loosen the populist grip over rural areas through attentive politicking.
