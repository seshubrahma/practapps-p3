TOKYO   —   President Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the   Partnership trade deal should have been good news for Hitoshi Kondo, a Japanese rice farmer. The sweeping   agreement, negotiated by the Obama administration and formally rejected by Mr. Trump on Monday, would have opened swaths of Japan’s highly protected agricultural sector, and was bitterly opposed by farmers. Now, without American involvement, the deal looks as good as dead.
