The Secret Service is investigating a burlesque dancer from Kentucky after she posted a Tweet that said she hoped someone would be "kind enough" to assassinate President Donald Trump. ["If someone was cruel enough to assassinate MLK, maybe someone will be kind enough to assassinate Trump," Heather Lowrey, 26, of Louisville wrote on Twitter.   The Secret Service confirmed it interviewed Lowrey and is still investigating the incident, the New York Daily News reported. Lowrey posted the Tweet Jan. 17, three days before Trumpâ€™s inauguration.
