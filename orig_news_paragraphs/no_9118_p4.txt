And yesterday, in complete contradiction of this commitment, including an explicit commitment by President Obama himself in 2011, the Obama administration carried out a shameful   ploy at the UN. I would like to tell you that the resolution that was adopted, not only doesnâ€™t bring peace closer, it drives it further away. It hurts justice it hurts the truth. Think about this absurdity, half a million human beings are being slaughtered in Syria.
