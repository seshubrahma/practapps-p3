He  was friends with one of the suspects, Jordan Hill, and was voluntarily spending time with him, starting on New Year’s Eve, she said. The attacks started in the back of a stolen van after Hill apparently became angry because the victim’s mother called and asked about her son ’s location, Antonetti said.   Hill took the teen to a   apartment in Chicago, where he was bound and gagged, beaten over several days by the two male and two female suspects and forced to drink toilet water, with some of the attacks broadcast on Facebook Live, she said.
