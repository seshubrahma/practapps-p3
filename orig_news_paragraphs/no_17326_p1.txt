Investigators also found digital footprints of individuals tied to the Russian government who had been on intelligence agencies’ radar before, as was acknowledged when the intelligence agency put out a public statement in October. All of these findings provide a greater understanding of what the intelligence community relied on to assess Russia’s intentions. Even before the election, the US intelligence community was "close" to assessing that Russia’s intention was to aid Trump, rather than simply to disrupt the election process, the former senior law enforcement official said.
