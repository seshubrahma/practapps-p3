Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Mark Levin made the case that President Donald Trump’s reaction to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision not to proceed with the House GOP’s legislative effort to repeal and replace Obamacare was a positive.   Levin called it "actually outstanding" and likened that leadership style to former President Dwight Eisenhower. " I thought the president’s comments today were actually outstanding," Levin said.
