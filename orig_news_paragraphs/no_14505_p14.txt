At the same time, the memo declares: "The Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement," which could imply that those protected by DACA could still be subject to removal proceedings. The memos also expand whatâ€™s known as the "287( g)" program, which allows the federal government to empower state and local law enforcement agencies to perform the functions of immigration officers. The language in the memo authorizes the CBP and ICE "to accept state services" on enforcement, but makes no mention of the National Guard, as an early draft reported by The Associated Press on Friday had done.   The memo gives broad leeway to immigration officers to make immediate decisions about whom to arrest and says officers should begin actions against individuals they meet in the course of their official duties.
