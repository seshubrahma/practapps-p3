Christopher said that the example of the Prophet Mohammad’s love for all people and Islam’s focus on service and charity prompted him to become a Muslim. And his desire to live out his faith in practice led him to become the deputy director of government affairs at the Dar   Mosque in Falls Church, Virginia, in 2015. In that role, he applies Islam’s teachings on justice and equality to work with interfaith partners on gun violence prevention, affordable housing, environmental justice and other policies.   Dar   Mosque has been labeled the "  mosque" by critics because two of the 19 hijackers had stopped by the mosque to attend Friday services just before executing the terror plot in New York.
