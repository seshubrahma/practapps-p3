But even this strategy, healthcare experts say, wouldnâ€™t prevent insurance companies from fleeing the individual marketplace or spiking premiums    a reality that has some Republicans on edge about moving too quickly on repeal.

In a press conference after the meeting, Pence told reporters that the party intends to draw from a "broad range" of ideas as it starts crafting a replacement plan.
