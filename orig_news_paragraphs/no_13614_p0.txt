From the Associated Press:  Hillary Clinton won the Democratic presidential primary in Puerto Rico Sunday after jumping out to an early lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders. A win that pushed the   even closer to securing the number of delegates needed to win her partyâ€™s White House nomination. After a blowout victory Saturday in the U. S. Virgin Islands, Clinton is just 60 delegates short of the 2, 383 needed to win the nomination, according to an Associated Press count. There were 60 pledged delegates at stake in Puerto Rico, and Clinton would need a commanding performance to get them all.
