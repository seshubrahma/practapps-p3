The situation at the two airports in Queens is somewhat different because they are not as easy to reach and they have tended to attract fewer homeless people. The news media, including The New York Post, described several dozen homeless people staying in La Guardia in December. But in January, the Port Authority, which runs the airports, started limiting the main terminal to passengers with tickets between midnight and 4 a. m. and now far fewer people remain. One is Christine, a woman in her 60s who said she had been waiting at the airport for several months to save enough money to buy a plane ticket so she could move to Florida.
