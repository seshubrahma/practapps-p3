Donald Trump stands against all of these things. He stands for Planned Parenthood and trade restrictions and targeting of political enemies and an   foreign policy and government domination of religion and nastiness toward women and tacit appeals to racism and unbounded personal power. I stand with the Constitution of the United States, and its embedded protection of my   rights through governmental checks and balances. Donald Trump does not.
