During a speech at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden argued that in 2016, the Democratic Party "did not talk what it always stood for, and that is how to maintain a burgeoning middle class. "   Biden stated that he thinks the choice between protecting American jobs and engaging with the world is "exaggerated. " He added, "Look, in a sense, we wouldn’t be having this conversation about American jobs, in the way it’s just been phrased, legitimately, by the president, were it not for 171, 000 votes, 171, 000 votes in four states, that put us in this position. "
