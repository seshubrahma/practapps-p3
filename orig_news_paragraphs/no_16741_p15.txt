So, what does all this history tell us about Trump and Clinton Monday night? There is good news for both sides    but lots of cautions, too.   The good news for Trump is that challengers can upset a vulnerable   through a strong first debate, change the dynamics of the campaign and go on to victory in November    think Kennedy in 1960 and Reagan in 1980.     Hillary Clintonâ€™s team is right to be concerned about whether Trump will have a lower bar to clear than she will.
