But the Middle East and Europe are.    The president is scheduled to leave today to visit Saudi Arabia, Israel, Vatican City, Belgium and Italy in that order.   The trip will last eight days and though heâ€™s facing controversies back home, President Trump will be working with other leaders in the days ahead to advance his foreign policy goals. Speeches, visits to holy sites and meals with other heads of states are all in the schedule.
