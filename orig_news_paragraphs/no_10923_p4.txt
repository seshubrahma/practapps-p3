The next president may face the meltdown of Obamacare, as Aetna announced on Tuesday that it’s pulling back coverage in 15 states and will only remain in four states due to a $200 million dollar loss. The Obama administration argues that Aetna’s move isn’t a sign of trouble for Obamacare, according to The Hill. " Aetna’s decision to alter its Marketplace participation does not change the fundamental fact that the Health Insurance Marketplace will continue to bring quality coverage to millions of Americans next year and every year after that," stated Kevin Counihan, CEO of ObamaCare marketplace.
