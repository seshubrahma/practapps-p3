Yes, that’s most definitely good news, because the economy desperately needs effective stimulus.   We might pause to observe: Yes, it’s true that American tax rates are a good deal lower than they were before JFK and RR worked their respective economic miracles, but in past decades, the whole world —  most spectacularly, China —  has lowered its tax rates and opened up to investment, and so we must stay competitive. We can observe that this opening up has been good news for world freedom, and yet at the same time, it has been a mixed blessing to   and   Americans.   Nobody misses the   fears of the Cold War, but in the last few decades, the expansion of China, in particular, has coincided with the contraction of manufacturing and economic activity in the America heartland.
