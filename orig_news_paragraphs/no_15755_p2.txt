You can’t find the words "executive privilege" anywhere in the Constitution. It’s not written down in any federal statute, and it’s not part of the rules of evidence.   Executive privilege is a doctrine that has developed over time to allow a president to communicate freely with his Cabinet members and staff about national security issues and other sensitive matters without being concerned those discussions would be disclosed to Congress, the courts or the public. Presidents have often invoked executive privilege, and they have mostly failed when challenged in court.
