The property is owned by the business and media conglomerate Dogan Holding, founded by Turkish billionaire Aydin Dogan. Dogan’s company and its news outlets have repeatedly clashed with Turkey’s government, which the watchdog organization Freedom House has accused of "intense harassment" of journalists. In 2009, Turkey’s government slapped Dogan Holding with a $2. 5 billion fine for unpaid taxes, which was reduced to about $700 million following an appeal by the company.   Earlier this year, Aydin Dogan was personally indicted by a Turkish prosecutor for allegedly participating in a   scheme.
