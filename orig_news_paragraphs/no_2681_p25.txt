An F. B. I. director has never made such a disclosure to Congress so close to a presidential election.   How did Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Justice Department feel about Mr. Comeyâ€™s letter? Senior Justice Department officials tried to discourage Mr. Comey from sending the letter, saying that it would violate department guidelines that advise against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections. They urged Mr. Comey not to do anything before Election Day, and they said he should tell Congress when agents had read the emails, understood whether they were relevant and could put them in context.
