" If America eases up on Russia, Britain will be under heavy pressure to pick the United States, not to side with Merkel," said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a   think tank, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Mrs. May is increasingly focused on maintaining the alliance with the United States, the worldâ€™s largest economy and military power. Whereas leaders such as Ms. Merkel have responded sharply to criticism from Mr. Trump, Mrs. May has been more forgiving.
