It was the first test from North Korea since a launch on March 22. That test was considered a failure, with the projectile exploding within seconds of launching, according to American and South Korean defense authorities. But by launching a missile on Wednesday, North Korea apparently sought to pull attention to its growing missile and nuclear weapons threats a day before the United   summit meeting. To Mr. Trump, the test is a new reminder that North Koreaâ€™s leader, Kim   is determined to develop a   missile that can one day carry a nuclear warhead across the Pacific.
