For example, when asked by Reutersâ€™ pollster if the U. S. should "open our borders to refugees of foreign conflicts," the percentage of respondents strongly supporting an apparently unlimited number of refugees jumped up to 19 percent, almost double the 10 percent in the prior "limit the number of refugees" question.   That question and answer suggests that Americans do not recognize the "open borders" term as a     for mass migration by 100 million people from Africa, Arabia and Asia. The new poll was conducted by Ipsos polling, from Jan. 30 to Jan. 31, on behalf Thomson Reuters. It included roughly 1, 201 adults, with 453 declared Democrats, 478 declared Republicans, and 149 declared independents.
