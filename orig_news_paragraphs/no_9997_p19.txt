But it is exactly this sort of   or at least,   that seems to be the driving force behind at least a couple of Jones’ nonprofit initiatives. Last year, for example, just four days after being confronted with angry protesters upset about income inequality outside his gated home in Greenwich, Connecticut, Jones announced a new nonprofit entity called Just Capital, with the mission to provide the public with information about how "just" companies are. BullSugar (one of the main sources for the Weather Channel’s hit job) has denied being bankrolled by Paul Tudor Jones II. And given its 501( c)(4) status it’s free to deny till the end of time.
