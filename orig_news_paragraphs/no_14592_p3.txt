Writer Dustin Lance Black (an Oscar winner for the movie "Milk") has based the     project in part on a memoir by activist Cleve Jones, who is introduced in 2006, where Guy Pearce plays him. The narrative then flashes back to the early 1970s, presenting a   Jones (Austin McKenzie) in the early days of brutal police raids and the bravery required to push back against those forces, as activists assembled and found their voices in San Francisco.   Jones is just one of several leading figures whose experiences are chronicled, casting a pair of actors in each of those key roles. It is, admittedly, a pretty   cast, with other principals portrayed by   Parker, Rachel Griffiths and Michael K. Williams.
