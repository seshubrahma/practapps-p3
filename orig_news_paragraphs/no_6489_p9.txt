This latter statement basically calls Attorney General a liar by suggesting he is hiding something. This attack by innuendo is unforgivable for a Republican congressman because it straight out of the Democrats’   playbook aimed at promoting the Big Lie that the Russians, not the American people, elected Trump. Such    is part of the   "Deep State" strategy to undermine the legitimacy of the 2016 election results. It is quite a stretch in both fact and logic to suggest that any conversation with any Russian official, including the Russian Ambassador, during calendar year 2016 must have been part of a conspiracy to control the outcome of the election —   a conspiracy for which no evidence whatsoever exists!
