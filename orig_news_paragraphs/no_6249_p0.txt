A   group is claiming that approximately 600, 000 illegal immigrants may be eligible for a pathway to legal status, allowing them to remain in the U. S.[In a new report by Catholic Legal Immigration Network (CLINIC) an organization that advocates for more legal immigration and defends illegal immigration, the group alleges that 15 percent of the 4 million illegal immigrants living in just seven southern U. S. states may be eligible for amnesty.   The amnesty for the 600, 000 illegal immigrants, CLINIC says, is based on claims from the individuals that they came to the U. S. after facing persecution abroad or because they have family already living in the country. A research who worked on the report for CLINIC told Reuters that President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration should not be deporting illegal immigrants to begin with.
