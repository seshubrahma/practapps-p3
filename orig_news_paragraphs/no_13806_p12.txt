The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.   And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress. Currently the ethics panel operates as an independent,   entity that has the power to investigate misconduct against lawmakers, officers and staff of the United States House of Representatives. Originally created by Congress under Nancy Pelosiâ€™s speakership in the wake of multiple lobbying scandals, it continued to act as an independent body under   Speaker John Boehner.
