" Images in the video put on display the brazenness of the offenders who assaulted the victim and then broadcast it for the entire world to see," Mr. Johnson said. The victim, whom the police did not name, was hospitalized for undisclosed injuries, but had been released by Wednesday evening and was speaking with investigators. The police said he was "traumatized" and initially had trouble communicating with detectives.
