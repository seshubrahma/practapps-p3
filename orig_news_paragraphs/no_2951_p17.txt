Mr. Trump has also used the foundation’s money in questionable ways, including a donation to a political action committee aligned with the attorney general of Florida while she was considering whether to bring legal action against his Trump University. That led to a $2, 500 penalty by the Internal Revenue Service for improperly using the foundation for political purposes. The Trump campaign has called the $25, 000 donation a clerical error. The Post also reported this week that two donations totaling $258, 000 had been made from the foundation to settle legal disputes involving Mr. Trump’s businesses.
