Courts have long held that records about the intention of laws can be used to invalidate statutes that otherwise appear to be neutral.   The classic example is literacy tests as a condition of voting. In Guinn v. US, the Supreme Court held an Oklahoma law passed in 1910 that required literacy to vote, unless it could shown an individualâ€™s grandfather was allowed to vote, was unconstitutional because the intent was to exclude   the vast majority of whose grandfathers would have been unable to vote.   In another case, Edwards v. Aguillard, the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that a Louisiana law requiring creationism to be taught in schools alongside evolution was unconstitutionally designed to promote religion despite the law claiming an objective of academic freedom.
