Five parties, including Meredith Corporation and an investor group led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. and the media executive Ynon Kreiz, have expressed interest in buying the company in its entirety, the people said. Early last month, Time Inc. filed an amended    severance plan with the Securities and Exchange Commission that protects bonuses for executives deemed most likely to be affected by a sale. Time Inc. rebuffed a takeover bid of at least $18 a share from Mr. Bronfman and Mr. Kreiz last year, and it could ultimately decide not to sell. The company is also considering bringing on an outside investor.
