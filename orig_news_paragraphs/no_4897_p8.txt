Harry Truman, who took office after Rooseveltâ€™s death in April 1945, spent his first four months in office presiding over the last days of World War   a time to work with Congress on new legislation. Dwight D. Eisenhower initially focused on his campaign promise to end the war in Korea, and, despite having a   Congress, expended little effort on legislative matters. John Kennedy likewise focused on foreign policy, and had little real success on the domestic side. Nor were Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George [H. W.] Bush, or Bill Clinton spectacularly successful in their first few months in office.
