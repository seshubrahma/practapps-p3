What’s more, changes starting in 2013 in the way the census asks people about their incomes can distort comparisons with previous years. After adjusting the data for these changes, according to Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute, the income of American households in the middle of the distribution last year was still 4. 6 percent below its level in 2007 and 5. 4 percent below where it was in 1999. Of course, the Census Bureau’s numbers on income and poverty don’t add up to a perfect representation of families’ means.
