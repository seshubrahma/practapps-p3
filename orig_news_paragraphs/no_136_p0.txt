BALTIMORE   â€”    Nearly two years after the death of a black man in police custody led to violent riots here, the Justice Department and city leaders announced on Thursday a   agreement to impose greater oversight and training on a police force found to have routinely harassed minorities. Negotiators have been rushing for weeks to complete the deal before the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald J. Trump and the expected confirmation of his attorney general pick, Senator Jeff Sessions.
