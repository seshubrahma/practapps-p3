US troops have been fighting for nearly 16 years in Afghanistan, where the government and its coalition allies are battling a resilient Taliban as well as other terror groups, including ISIS. In February, Gen. John Nicholson, commander of Resolute Support and US forces in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that leadership assesses "the current security situation in Afghanistan as a stalemate. " He cited the governmentâ€™s stability, Afghan military casualties, the influence of Pakistan, Russia and Iran, "the convergence" of various terror groups, the narcotics trade and corruption.
