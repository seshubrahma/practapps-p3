On May 14, Clinton used a tweet to warn that Trump plans to abolish zones where   teachers and school faculty are currently mandated to remain unarmed, therefore defenseless. Clinton wrote: "FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office. " During his speech to the NRA Leadership Forum, Trump pointed to various examples of innocents being shot to death in   zones. He specifically mentioned unarmed   gunned down in San Bernardino and unarmed military personnel gunned down in Chattanooga.
