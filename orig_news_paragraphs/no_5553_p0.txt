The leader of the   opposition in Albania told Breitbart News Friday that democracy in his country is in great danger, as the   prime minister Edi Rama has allowed corruption and crime to flourish there. ["Albania is in a unique and difficult situation, in a political crisis, the results of a full onslaught of organized crime on all state structures, on the rule of law, and democracy," said Lulzim Basha, the leader of the Democratic Party of Albania.   Basha is the former mayor of Tirana, the countryâ€™s capital and largest city, and the leader of the Democratic Party of Albania. If the party wins the June 18 parliamentary elections, Basha said he becomes the new prime minister.
