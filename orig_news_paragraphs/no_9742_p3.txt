The Senate does have to confirm the cabinet secretary posts. So far, Trump has officially appointed two   decorated retired warriors to be a part of his administration: retired Marine Gen. James "Mad Dog" Mattis as his secretary of defense and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as White House national security adviser. Meanwhile, he is considering bringing in three others: border security hawk retired Marine Gen. John Kelly for secretary of homeland security, former Army Gen. David Petraeus for secretary of state, and Navy Adm. Michael Rogers for director of national intelligence (DNI).
