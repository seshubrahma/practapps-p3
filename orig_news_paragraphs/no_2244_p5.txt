After praising the   Partnership as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton has recently said as a candidate, "I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I’ve set" on protecting American workers, the environment and other issues. About 60 percent of voters said trade with other countries caused job losses in the United States, according to the latest New York   News poll. Mr. Trump has a slight edge over Mrs. Clinton on the question of who voters consider better poised to tackle the trade issue. Putting Mr. Kaine on the ticket "could be disastrous for our efforts to defeat Donald Trump in the fall" because of his support of the   Partnership, said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a liberal political action committee.
