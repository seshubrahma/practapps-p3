The uncertainty over Kasich’s presence at his own party’s convention in his home state is extremely unusual and illustrates the awkward position he finds himself in.   Kasich’s campaign has recently started using their email list to highlight the governor’s continued high levels of favorability among the general election electorate and his efforts to help fellow Republicans.
