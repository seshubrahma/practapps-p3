Assange has also claimed he has further information relating to Hillary Clinton that he plans to release closer to the November election.   Assange alluded to what information the "October surprise" as it is now being called may contain saying, "I don’t want to give the game away, but it’s a variety of documents from different types of institutions that are associated with the election campaign, some quite unexpected angles, some quite interesting, some even entertaining. " Assange isn’t focusing entirely on Clinton however, urging anyone with information on Trump to come forward, "If anyone has any information that is from inside the Trump campaign, which is authentic, it’s not like some claimed witness statement but actually internal documentation, we’d be very happy to receive and publish it," he said on NPR’s "Morning Edition" in August.
