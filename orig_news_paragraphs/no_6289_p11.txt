I spoke with a   staff member from the Senate Judiciary Committee (who must remain anonymous if he wants to keep his job) who told me that Republicansâ€™ only remedy is to force Democrats to debate until they wear themselves out. Schedule Senate floor debates to go all day and night, on weekends and holidays until Democrats cry uncle. " Is McConnell likely to do that?
