Trump treats terrorism in the Middle East as a business opportunity to create jobs at home and enrich defense industry tycoons.    While addressing the world’s   dictators about terrorism, Trump failed to mention how state violence and repression feeds ISIS and al Qaeda’s propaganda campaigns. Instead, he proclaims the Arab leaders to be defenders of the people’s freedom. As he advised his allies to allow "young Muslim boys and girls (to) be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent of hatred," he disingenuously pretended that the Arab Spring never occurred.
