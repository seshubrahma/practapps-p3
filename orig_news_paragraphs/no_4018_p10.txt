The spending bill will extend the Opportunities Scholarship Program for three years, the vice president explained. " Since its creation in 2004, the Opportunities Scholarship program has given parents and families hope by giving them a pathway to take their children out of schools that too often are failing to meet the needs of children here in our nationâ€™s capital, give them a chance that other families have to put their children into a private school," he added. Pence observed that over the past 13 years, some 20, 000 students have applied for the program, with 7, 500 students having been accepted.
