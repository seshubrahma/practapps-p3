They are my statistics. Iâ€™ll tell you what it is, I also run the jails. We average about 9, 000 people in the jails every day and every month they take statistics of those in our jails charged with all different crimes, here in this country illegally, 8, 600 have been turned over to ICE for deportation and over 3000 keep coming back to the same jails that I run.
