The assault took place on a stairway leading down to the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall that lies between the subway station closest to the museum and one of the museum’s entrances. The attack was so close to the Louvre that it lit up social media networks. Within a couple hours of the assault, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the man was a "radical Islamic terrorist," although the French authorities said it was too early to establish whether he had ties to any terrorist groups. Mr. Molins, who is known for sticking to the facts, refrained from saying anything about the man’s motivations, but said that his passport had two visas to Turkey, in 2015 and 2016, and that he also had a visa for Saudi Arabia.
