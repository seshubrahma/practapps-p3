Newspapers in Taiwan reported last month that a Trump Organization representative had visited the country, expressing interest in perhaps developing a hotel project adjacent to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, which is undergoing a major expansion. The mayor of Taoyuan, Cheng   was quoted as confirming that visit. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, Amanda Miller, said that the company had "no plans for expansion into Taiwan," and that there had been no "authorized visits" to the country to push a Trump development project. But Ms. Miller did not dispute that   Donoghue, a sales manager overseeing Asia for Trump Hotels, had visited Taiwan in October, a trip that Ms. Donoghue recorded on her Facebook page.
