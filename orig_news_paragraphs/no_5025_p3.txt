" Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you," President Trump said after taking the Oath of Office, administered by U. S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump continued: We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
