This is complex territory. To successfully navigate this terrain, one must have a deep sympathy for those who feel marginalized, while understanding that the traditions of free speech require us to allow many forms of speech that might be offensive.

Itâ€™s fiction, after all, and its main allegiance is to the truth of feeling conveyed by the work itself.
