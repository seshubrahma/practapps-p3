A federal judge in California agreed in theory last month, blocking the administration from enforcing the order by taking away federal funds beyond those Justice Department grants that already have preconditions built into them.   Mondayâ€™s memo from Sessions makes clear that the definition of "sanctuary jurisdiction" for the Trump administration will be narrow, specifically limited to localities that "willfully refuse to comply" with a piece of federal law requiring local jurisdictions to communicate citizenship status information with the federal government.   The memo also makes clear that the only federal funding at stake as punishment would be grants from the departments of Justice and Homeland Security.   That definition is far narrower than the conventional use of the term sanctuary city, and the vast majority of cities and states already comply with that piece of the law.
