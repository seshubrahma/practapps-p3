A path to citizenship for those in the country illegally would not be part of Trump’s vision for this deal, with the possible exception of "Dreamers"    those brought into the US illegally as children. News of the President’s support for a comprehensive reform of the US’s immigration system fell against a backdrop of increasingly aggressive actions by immigration authorities across the US, who under Trump’s administration have found new freedom to deport undocumented immigrants who have not been convicted of a serious crime    the bar they were told to abide by under President Barack Obama’s tenure. But Trump’s new apparent desire to grant legal status to many undocumented immigrants living in the US also marks a startling reversal from the positions he championed during his campaign for president. Trump focused on the need to build a wall along the   border, and for much of his campaign, called for deporting all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US.
