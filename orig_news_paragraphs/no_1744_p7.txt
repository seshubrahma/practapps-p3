Mrs. Clinton wove her attack on Mr. Trump into an address in which she also criticized other corporate actors, including top executives at Wells Fargo after employees opened roughly 1. 5 million bank accounts and applied for 565, 000 credit cards that may not have been authorized by customers, according to regulators.
