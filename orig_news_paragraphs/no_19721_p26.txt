Yet the formal vetting of those candidates has not, in most cases, begun before Trump selects them for a job. Take the case of Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the   Republican congresswoman who was poised to become Trump’s nominee for interior secretary before the   was persuaded to pick Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana instead. Over the course of about 10 days, McMorris Rodgers met twice with Trump and had phone calls with Vice   Mike Pence and one of Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. according to a Republican familiar with the process. Her name was leaked to the press, which reported that she was likely to get the interior job.
