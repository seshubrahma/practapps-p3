Mayor Kip Holden is by far the least popular person in the black community here, and it’s a direct result of the Alton Sterling affair. Black people flat out hate him and the professional public servants despise him. The same highway where Black Lives Matter’s Deray McKesson and others were arrested is now a valley of debris. I hope I’m not stretching too far by saying this: I believe the aftermath of the racial politics that rose from the Alton Sterling case prevented Obama supporting those most severely affected by this disaster.
