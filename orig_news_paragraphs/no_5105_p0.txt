House Speaker Paul Ryan pushed back against hysterical Democrats who insist Attorney General Jeff Sessions had improper meetings with a Russian diplomat during President Donald Trumpâ€™s political campaign. ["I think Democrats are lighting their hair on fire to get you to cover this story," Ryan said, pointing to House and Senate Democrats calling for Sessions to resign.   The Washington Post reported that Sessions did not reveal two meetings with a Russian ambassador during his confirmation hearings, even though he testified that he did not have contact with the Russians about the campaign. Ryan said there was zero evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to interfere in the election.
