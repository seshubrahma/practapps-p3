That’s what a Los Angeles gallery is hoping to get for Kanye West’s "Famous" sculpture, a   silicone homage to 12 of the biggest names in pop culture. Four million for George W. Bush curled in the fetal position, a     Donald J. Trump, coquettish Amber Rose and Rihanna, a cherubic Anna Wintour and Pollyannaish Taylor Swift   —   a rogues’ gallery including Bill Cosby, Chris Brown and Ray J, and arguably three of the most famous   in modern times: Caitlyn, Kim, and Kanye. So lifelike, they even breathe, chests rising and falling as if deep in REM sleep.
