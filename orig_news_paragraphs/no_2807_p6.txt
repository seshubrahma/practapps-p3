Noting that Jonathan Karl of ABC News predicted on Sunday that the Electoral College could come down to a    tie, Mr. Buffett said, "I am looking at the people that can change that 269 to 270. " Mr. Buffett harshly criticized Mr. Trump for claiming that he had made "sacrifices" by building buildings and working hard, an argument he made after Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of an Army captain killed in Iraq, said during a speech at the Democratic convention, that Mr. Trump had "sacrificed nothing" for the country. Mr. Buffett said he, like Mr. Trump, had made a lot of money. "
