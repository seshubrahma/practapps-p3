America has been lied to about every aspect of immigration in the United States," Crane said when announcing the endorsement. " We can fix our broken immigration system, and we can do it in a way that honors Americaâ€™s legacy as a land of immigrants, but Donald Trump is the only candidate who is willing to put politics aside so that we can achieve that goal. We hereby endorse Donald J. Trump, and urge all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives.
