The letters were sent Friday, the same day committee members discussed Russia in a private meeting with FBI Director James Comey. The move comes amid inquiries into whether President Donald Trump’s campaign officials were in contact with Russian officials and other Russians known to US intelligence during the 2016 race.    advisers close to   nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence, multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials have told CNN. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told NBC’s "Meet the Press’’ aired on Sunday that he is aware of the letter, adding that the request for records "doesn’t mean that there’s anything there."
