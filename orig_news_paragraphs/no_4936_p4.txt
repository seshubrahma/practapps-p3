As  I reported in April, 2011, Russia at that time adopted a policy of using the United Nations Security Council to cripple Nato and US foreign policy, a strategy that has been very successful for them for six years. Early in 2011, Russia had abstained on the UNSC resolution authorizing a "humanitarian" military action in Libya. As the Libyan intervention unfolded, Russia viewed the increasingly complex situation as "mission creep," and regretted not vetoing the resolution. After that, Russia demanded that Nato and the US strictly limit their activities, and Russia would back up this demand by vetoing any attempt to go further than Russia desired.
