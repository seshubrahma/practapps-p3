Americans may be divided, but some things still bring them together. Like meatloaf. Two Times writers, the   columnist Frank Bruni and the Congressional correspondent Jennifer Steinhauer, were able to bypass all kinds of societal fractures as they collected material from celebrity chefs and politicians for a book of 50 meatloaf recipes (including a vegetarian one) and related ruminations. Paul Ryan "was much more interested in talking to me about meatloaf than he was the earned tax credit," Ms. Steinhauer said.
