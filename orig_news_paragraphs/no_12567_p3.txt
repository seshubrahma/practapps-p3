As Cruz ended his brief comments to the press, the Senator raised the specter of the riots that plagued the 1968 Democrat convention held in Chicago, riots that ripped the city apart. " You know, the City of Chicago in 1968 saw some ugly days when politics descended into hatred and incivility and even violence and it is my hope that in 2016 that we can appeal to our better angels and avoid going down that road once again," Cruz concluded.
