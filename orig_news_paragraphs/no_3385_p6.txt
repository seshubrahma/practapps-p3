Convicted Nixon Attorney John Dean told CNN Tuesday that Comey’s Memo was a "direct parallel" to the smoking gun tape. Former Bill Clinton Speechwriter Bill Waldman argued roughly the same on the Daily Beast Wednesday. Buchanan found the comparisons "absurd," explaining the context in which the smoking gun tapes became public: If you’re talking about the smoking gun tapes, that was revealed when I was at Camp David before Nixon’s resignation   …      That was 18 months into a Watergate crisis that had all manner of allegations of felonies and misdemeanors, and convictions, and trials.
