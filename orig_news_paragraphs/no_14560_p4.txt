Another change to asylum procedures would make it easier for immigration officers to send   migrants to Mexico if they came through the country on their way to the US. The change could potentially send tens of thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, gangs and drug cartels back into Mexico, an issue Kelly and Tillerson will almost certainly have to address. A Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, said that Pena Nieto, Videgaray and other officials will make clear to Kelly and Tillerson that Mexico will not take deportees who are not Mexican nationals. A second Mexican official emphasized that Mexico is not bound by a US presidential order and said thereâ€™s nothing the US can do to force the issue.
