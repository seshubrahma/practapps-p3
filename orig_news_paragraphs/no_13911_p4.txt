He has said the government’s social welfare programs, including housing subsidies, make the poor "dependent" on the government and has called poverty "really more of a choice than anything else," making a case for personal responsibility. And he called for slashing public assistance programs indiscriminately. Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the committee, and Sen. Bob Menendez,   Jersey, pressed Carson about those criticisms and nudged him to go on the record that he would uphold HUD’s mission and that he supports its programs. Carson conceded that he believes HUD’s rental assistance program is "essential" and said it would be "cruel and unusual" to retire government assistance programs without a proper replacement.
