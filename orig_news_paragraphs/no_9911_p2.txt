Ms. Waters’s article, entitled "Europe’s Rape Epidemic: Western Women Will Be Sacrificed At The Altar Of Mass Migration" details Ms. Waters’s own experiences with sexually aggressive migrants, as well as using statistics from Norway, Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom to prove her article’s premise. Regardless, the Guardian, as well as Talking Points Memo and POLITICO have described her work, published by me (Raheem Kassam) on Breitbart London, as "white nationalist". When asked to apologise, author Tom McCarthy responded: "I’ve had my editors review the post and we’re going to let it stand".
