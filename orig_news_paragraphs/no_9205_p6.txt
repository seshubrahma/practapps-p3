Rep. Gohmert has no doubts that Ted Cruz would be a staunch supporter of Israel. Ted Cruz and I have talked about Israel many times, and we share the same feelings about Israel. I’ve shared with Ted that I’ve looked in the Bible for a verse that says "Those who betray Israel will be blessed" and it’s not in there. We’re both very concerned since the current administration is not only not blessing Israel, but that they are betraying Israel right and left, putting them in a terrible situation for their very existence.
