" This is a very emotional deal for us because of our friendship," said his longtime pal Tim Grigsby.   While Hernandez was still detained, Grigsby launched a local campaign asking the community to write letters of support for his friend to persuade an immigration judge to give clemency to Hernandez. Hernandez learned about the effort from inside a detention center in Missouri, when he talked to his wife by phone.
