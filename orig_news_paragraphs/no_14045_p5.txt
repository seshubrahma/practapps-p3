We plan to hold Trump to his word and stand ready to facilitate, however we can, a Trump administration that puts the jobs, wages and security    not only of   but all people of color    first.    Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary. We would support such a bill, if and only if, it contained a strong   component that guaranteed employment for workers in neighborhoods with high unemployment rates and minority business participation.   That said, Congress has not always been welcoming to infrastructure initiatives    particularly under President Obama.
