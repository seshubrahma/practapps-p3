In the   scenario, these four factors go the opposite   way. Insurers, facing the uncertainty of the next two to four   years, decide to exit the markets leaving Martha with just one or   even no choices for coverage. With only a small penalty, people   healthier than Martha leave the exchanges, which leads to an even   sicker group of people being covered by the exchanges and higher   prices for Martha. The "death spiral" predicted by GOP lawmakers   for Obamacare truly does set in and prices shoot to astronomical   levels, well above projections made before the passing of the   law.
