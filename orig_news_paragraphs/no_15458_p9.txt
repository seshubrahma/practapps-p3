Today the decision lies with the deputy attorney general, who has complete discretion over the matter. He might be responsive to public or congressional pressure and appoint a special prosecutor whose independence is above question    or he might not. If not, Sen. Schumer has proposed returning to something like the previous mechanism, so that a   panel would decide on appointing a special prosecutor. Either way, we need one.
