Tuesday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Sen. Rand Paul ( ) called on former National Security Advisor Susan Rice to be brought in front of Congress under subpoena and asked questions about allegations she was behind the unmasking of American identities in raw surveillance.   Paul also said she should be asked about former President Barack Obama’s knowledge of these alleged activities. " For years, both progressives and libertarians have been complaining about these backdoor searches," Paul said.
