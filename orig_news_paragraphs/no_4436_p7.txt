Trump addressed Abbas on the issue at their joint press conference, saying, "Peace can never take root in an environment where violence is tolerated, funded or rewarded. " According to Israelâ€™s Channel 2 TV, when Trump and Abbas met behind closed doors just an hour earlier, the U. S. president lashed out at the Palestinian leader for lying to him. "
