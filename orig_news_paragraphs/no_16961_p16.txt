Nevada, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, Nevada’s former attorney general, is seeking to become the first Latina in the Senate. Republican Rep. Joe Heck, meanwhile, is attempting to pull off what could be Republicans’ lone pickoff of a Senate seat in the 2016 election cycle.   Hovering over this race is retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, long the dominant Democrat in Nevada politics.   This race    like Nevada’s presidential contest    could be decided by Latino turnout.
