 (CNN) The US Secret Service is considering renting one floor in Trump Tower to protect   Donald Trump and his family by turning it into a   command post, a law enforcement official told CNN Friday. According to Jared Horowitz, who is with Newmark Grubb Knight Frank and responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent with the average floor office space running between 13, 500 square feet to 15, 500 square feet cost about $1. 5 million a year. The law enforcement official says the current plans for security at Trump Tower would differ if the future first family were living at the White House full time and Trumpâ€™s wife Melania and their son Barron were not staying behind in New York City through the Spring.
