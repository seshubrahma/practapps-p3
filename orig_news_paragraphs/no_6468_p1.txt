Trump and his White House team publicly supported the bill, hosting members of congress at the White House, visiting Capitol Hill, even conducting a rally with Senate Majority Leder Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. He also held several meetings with Speaker Paul Ryan and participated on several phone calls to promote the effort.

At this point, over 30 members have signaled that they will not support the bill.
