Called "the human embodiment of Twitter" by the New York Times, Sharp joined the company in November 2010 as its first hire in Washington, DC. Now based in New York, he is the   member of Twitter’s global media partnerships team. But that’s not all. The bio goes on to say that Sharp also served as the Deputy Chief of Staff for a Democrat senator in Louisiana in 2008, and that he is also a Term Member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
