Jihadi groups such as al Qaeda and its rival the Islamic State ( ) have urged supporters to target military personnel. Various "kill lists" containing personal information about U. S. service members, government employees, and civilians have been published online by jihadists. It remains unclear how the Fakhraldin chose Alcala as a target or if he was affiliated with any specific Islamic extremist group.
