McDaniel has proven he can win a statewide U. S. Senate race in Mississippi. Back in 2014, McDaniel won more votes than Cochran in the primary, but since both finished under 50 percent plus one vote, it was kicked to a runoff election. In the runoff, McDaniel won more Republican votes than Cochran. And Cochran only won because of a   effort to get Democrats to cross over to vote in an underhanded way in the GOP primary.
