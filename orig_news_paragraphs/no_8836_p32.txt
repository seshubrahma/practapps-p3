We must be there to make sure that anyone sympathetic to their message is unable to hear it and has an extremely discouraging day. By having a massive     protest at the State Capitol on June 26, we will make sure that any publicity or news coverage of the day will show thousands of   black, Asian, Arab and   white youth fighting for progress. If we stay home and allow them to have an open platform, any media coverage they receive will portray an unopposed successful event at which a small group of determined, proud racists were able to boldly assert themselves, recruit new members and advance a new campaign for racist terror and ultimately genocide. This is a scenario we cannot allow to happen.
