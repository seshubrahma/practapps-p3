CNN reached out to the White House for comment on the congressmanâ€™s remarks about the President but did not receive a response.   Amash also noted that he is one of just a handful of Republicans to sign onto legislation that would mandate Trump release his tax returns    an answer that was roundly applauded from the crowd of mostly   residents (although nothing like the rowdy crowds of angry progressives that have filled other town halls). Amash, a member of the far right House Freedom Caucus and leader of the   House Liberty Caucus, largely avoided the hot buttons that would have inflamed his crowd. Instead, he trained his fire on Trump and Ryan.
