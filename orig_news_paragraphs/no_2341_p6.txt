The murder rate last year was far below the levels of 30 to 40 years ago, when violent crime, fueled partly by gang violence during the crack cocaine epidemic, reached a peak. The overall 3. 9 percent increase in violent crime in 2015 was lower than levels from five and 10 years ago, the F. B. I. said. " It is important to remember that while crime did increase over all last year, 2015 still represented the   year for violent crime in the past two decades," Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said Monday.
