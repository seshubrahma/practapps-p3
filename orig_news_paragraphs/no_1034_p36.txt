Airey Neave, a Conservative Party member, was killed when his car was blown up. Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that the London attack was consistent with the recent pattern of attacks in which a vehicle was used to kill people, citing assaults in France, Germany and Israel. " Weâ€™ve seen a gradual movement away from terrorist attacks on the West to attacks on softer and softer targets with more improvised weapons," he said.
