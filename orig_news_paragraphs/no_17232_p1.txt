It depends on whom you talk to.   This weekend, Italians go to the polls to vote in a referendum on whether or not the country should amend its 1948 constitution.    The referendum is the brainchild of Matteo Renzi, Italyâ€™s energetic,    Prime Minister. His intention is to defang the upper house of the Italian Parliament, the Senato, by cutting its numbers from 315 to 100, thus reducing its powers dramatically, making it more of a consultative assembly.
