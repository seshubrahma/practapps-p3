ISIS, which claimed responsibility, warned of more attacks in a statement. " The Crusaders and their apostate followers must be aware that the bill between us and them is very large, and they will be paying it like a river of blood from their sons, if God is willing," the group said in Arabic. After the bombings, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   declared a period of mourning.
