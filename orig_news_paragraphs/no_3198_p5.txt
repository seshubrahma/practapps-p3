In reality, Islam is the largest practitioner of both gender and religious apartheid, but Israel served as the scapegoat for all the crimes perpetrated by Muslims including slavery,   racism, conversion via the sword, persecution of   religious minorities, imperialism, colonialism  —   and the most barbaric abuse of women," Chesler said.
