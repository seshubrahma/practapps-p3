But by the end of Tuesday night, it became clear that just enough members of the other portions of the Obama coalition decided either not to show up    or to vote for Trump. According to exit polling data, Trump actually won by 6 percentage points among white voters age   which underscores data from Pew showing that young white Americans’ views on many issues resemble their parents’ more than fellow young people of color, an   stressor inside the Obama coalition.   Not only that, but Trump nearly split the vote of educated white women with Clinton    despite the Billy Bush tape, despite the repeated allegations of sexual assault    even as black and Latino women provided Clinton with most of her female gender gap. And maybe more importantly, Trump received nearly a third of Latino male voters and 13% of black male voters, which raises the question: How much of a role did gender bias play in this election?
