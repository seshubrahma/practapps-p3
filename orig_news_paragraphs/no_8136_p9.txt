If, as Caddell thinks, the election is about an insurgency rather than ideology, Rubio’s strategy is doubly wrong. Caddell also said that he was "surprised [Rubio] hasn’t used electability" as a cornerstone of his campaign. More than half of Republican voters are angry at their political leadership, Caddell noted, but they also want to win in November. The growing animosity between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, and the very negative tone of their campaigns against each other, does provide an opening for a third candidate to surprise in Iowa or New Hampshire, Caddell said.
