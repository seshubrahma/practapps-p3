" Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s top spokesman, said Mr. de Blasio had flown to Rikers Island to Jacobi Medical Center, to be at the bedside of injured firefighters and to Hofstra University, for the first presidential debate last month between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton, whose campaign Mr. de Blasio has ardently supported. He traveled by plane to campaign for her in Ohio on Saturday. In each case, Mr. Phillips said, the decision to go by helicopter was made by the mayor’s police detail.
