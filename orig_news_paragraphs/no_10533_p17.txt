Sanders’ rise has establishment Democrats as panicked as establishment Republicans are at the rise of Trump and Cruz. And just like the RNC seems to have engaged in questionable tactics designed to tip the scales in favor of the establishment backed Rubio, Bush and Kasich, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has engaged in questionable tactics designed to bolster Clinton over Sanders. Despite Sanders’ blowout victory in New Hampshire, for instance, the DNC —  thanks to   "super delegates" —  has awarded the same amount of delegates from that state to Clinton as were given to Sanders. The Bush dynasty’s control of GOP politics in many ways comes down to what happens in South Carolina.
