Marconi was killed on Sunday, Breitbart Texas reported, when Otis Tyrone McKane allegedly walked up to his patrol car while he was writing a ticket and shot him in the head. McKane then allegedly fired a second shot striking the dying officer again. McKane was arrested Monday night after a   manhunt, but took time out from his fugitive flight to get married in a Bexar County courtroom.
