The closure of the Tornillo processing station comes just three days after officials shut down the Donna, Texas, temporary holding facility. Border Patrol officials moved 150 agents to the Rio Grande Valley Sector in November to help with the surge of migrant apprehensions. Officials have not yet stated if those agents are being returned to their home sectors.
