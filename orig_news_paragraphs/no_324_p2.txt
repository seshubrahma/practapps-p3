Take your seat for "Evening at the Talk House," an   comedy by the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn ("The Designated Mourner, " "Aunt Dan and Lemon") for the New Group that begins performances at the Signature Center on Tuesday, Jan. 31. Though written years before Donald J. Trump announced his candidacy, and first produced in London in the fall of 2015, the play may strike some as oddly prescient. Set in the course of one night, it eavesdrops on several people who worked together on "Midnight in a Clearing With Moon and Stars," a fictitious flop from a decade ago.
