The use of conspiracy by the President of the United States as a central part of his discourse is extraordinarily dangerous. By doing so President Trump gives credence and legitimacy to these kinds of arguments which generate anger and distrust, as well as total misinformation    in this case making an unfounded accusation against a former president of the United States.   Ironically, he is employing a main strategy of McCarthyism at the very time he is claiming to be a victim of those kinds of tactics.   His focus on conspiracy also turns his attention away from the serious political issues that the nation faces.
