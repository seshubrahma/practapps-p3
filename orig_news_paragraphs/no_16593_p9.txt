Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, forcefully condemned Clinton "in the strongest possible terms" Saturday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington. " The truth of the matter is that the men and women who support Donald Trump’s campaign are   Americans, farmers, coal miners, teachers, veterans, members of our law enforcement community, members of every class of this country, who know that we can make America great again," Pence said. "Let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, Hillary, they are not a basket of anything," Pence continued.
