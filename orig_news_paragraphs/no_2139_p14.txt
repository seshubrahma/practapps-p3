The recurring theme of Charlie Brooker’s   anthology is the entanglement of digital and emotional life. As the series’ foreboding title hints, it rarely goes well, but "San Junipero" is a delightful exception. A   technology that allows people to inhabit the past brings together two women (Mackenzie Davis and Gugu  ) in a 1987 of the mind, where they make a connection that survives death. There’s a bittersweet theme about nostalgia as an opiate, but for once this ingeniously dark series ends on a note of cyberhope.
