Perdue has   close relationships with the leadership of the National Farm Bureau and has been recognized by the Georgia   and FFA programs, among others, for his leadership in agriculture. Throughout Perdue’s career in Georgia politics and agriculture, Georgia’s Latino population has grown from 109, 000 in 1990 to 854, 000 in 2017. In 2016, Trump won the state with just 51 percent of the vote.   Perdue’s new hire for the agriculture department is likely Kristi Boswell, who was a registered lobbyist and director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.
