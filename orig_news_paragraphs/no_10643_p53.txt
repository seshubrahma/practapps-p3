As Howard Kurtz points out:   The current complaints center on the fantasy notion that news organizations have failed to aggressively report on Trump. But I have read hundreds of articles, and watched thousands of segments, about Trumpâ€™s business setbacks his casino bankruptcies allegations of mob ties and racial discrimination the use of foreign workers to staff his properties and make his merchandise how he gave large sums to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton how he changed from liberal positions on abortion and health care even accusations that he cheats at golf. I have consumed many   efforts about erroneous or questionable statements he has made, about how much Medicare spends on prescription drugs, or having watched reports of thousands of Muslims celebrating on   in New Jersey.
