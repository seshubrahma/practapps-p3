Sen. Lindsey Graham, a frequent critic of Donald Trump, met with the president for lunch on Tuesday to find common ground. [In a statement, Graham told reporters that the lunch went so well that he gave the president his "NEW cell phone number," referring to the old cell phone number, which Trump publicly gave out during his presidential campaign after the Senator criticized him.   " I had a great lunch meeting with President Trump today," he said.
