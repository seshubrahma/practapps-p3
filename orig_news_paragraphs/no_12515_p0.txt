Republican nominee Donald Trump and his runningmate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence both continuously criticized Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa on Friday afternoon. ["She’s like an unbalanced person," Trump told roughly 2, 000 supporters at the event, going after his competitor. " She’s pretty close to unhinged. "  Trump, citing a recent book from a former secret service agent who worked for the Clintons, said, "He thinks she would be a disaster as president," adding that she’s "totally unfit to lead. "
