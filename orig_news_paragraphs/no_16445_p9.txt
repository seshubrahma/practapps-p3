The Clinton supporter struggled to impact the elections in 2012 and 2014, but he has continued his efforts in this election, with the stated goal of inspiring action on climate change. Another Clinton backer, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, did some of his first 2016 spending by contributing $5 million to his super PAC, Independence USA. Other major   donations came from perennial Democratic donor Don Sussman, who contributed another $3 million to Priorities, and Daniel Abraham, who gave another $3 million. Clinton is scheduled to attend a   fundraiser Tuesday at the Hollywood Hills home of Justin Timberlake and his wife, actress Jessica Biel, a source with knowledge of the fundraiser told CNN.
