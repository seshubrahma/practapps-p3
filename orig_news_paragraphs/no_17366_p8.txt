On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest implied that statement was clear in identifying Russian leaders, including Putin, in US election meddling.   " At the risk of editorializing, when I read that statement for first time in early October, I didnâ€™t think it was particularly subtle," Earnest said. He emphasized he did not have an additional intelligence assessment to share naming Putin specifically as being behind the cyberattacks.
