Oroville, California  (CNN) A day after 188, 000 people were evacuated from the towns surrounding Northern California’s Oroville Dam, officials sounded a note of cautious optimism about containing the threat of flooding.   Still, the mandatory evacuation order remained in place Monday for Butte, Sutter and Yuba counties.   The evacuation was ordered Sunday after a massive hole was discovered in an emergency spillway    which catches excess water when Lake Oroville’s water level rises to overflow the dam    threatening communities downstream.
