Clinton backs public option on health care, Clinton on Saturday also expressed support for expanding   health insurance, in a nod to the desires of Sanders’ supporters. She affirmed support for the   "public option," which would expand health insurance coverage beyond the current provisions in Obamacare.   Clinton has supported the public option for decades. But she ran in the Democratic primary as a candidate who wanted to expand Obamacare and used Sanders’ support for a public option against him, saying it would be too costly and run into interference from Republican governors.
