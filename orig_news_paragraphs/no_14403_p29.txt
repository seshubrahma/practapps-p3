In Brooklyn, New York, an undocumented immigrant named Antonio    who asked that his full name not be used    said it has been an emotional week for his partner and their two children, ages 3 and 8. His partner cries at the many news reports of separated immigrant families.   " People are not leaving the house to get a cup of coffee, to have dinner or take their children to the library," said Antonio, who came to the United States from Mexico 17 years ago.
