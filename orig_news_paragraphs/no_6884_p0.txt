Former Florida Gov. and 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush said on Thursday that he doesn’t think President Donald Trump obstructed justice. [The charge of obstruction could apply if the President interfered with the FBI’s investigation into Russian tampering in the election by firing James Comey as director of the agency in charge of the probe.   " No, I don’t, but who cares what I think," Bush said when asked whether Trump obstructed justice at a conference at Boston College.
