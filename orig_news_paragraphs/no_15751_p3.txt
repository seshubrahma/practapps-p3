The intense focus on the Russia investigation has already been a distraction.   Next week’s testimony by Comey, who is expected to say the President asked him to end the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, could prove to be the most pivotal moment for Trump’s young administration. Democrats are likely to press the former director on whether he viewed the President’s comments as an effort to obstruct justice    an impeachable offense    and Republicans are likely to press Comey on why he did not make his concerns about his conversations with Trump known before he was fired. Comey kept detailed memos of his conversations with the President, a topic sure to come up during the hearing.
