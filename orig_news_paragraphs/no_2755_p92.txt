The beauty of this book lies not just in its prose   —   which, by the way, will shame just about anyone who writes for a living  —   but also in its vulnerable, highly appealing characters, including the Irish Republican Army man who’s tasked with doing the deed (a   accomplice to the   Patrick J. Magee). The tension in the book becomes so overpowering that it takes a monk’s restraint not to flip to the end. I am not a monk.
