: My view is that Trump is doing well precisely because things aren’t particularly bad for the U. S. right now. In difficult times, voters take their responsibilities more seriously, and wouldn’t embrace the buffoonery of a   star. People can indulge in Trump’s fantasies in a period of (more or less) peace and (sort of) prosperity. If such clueless condescension is a key part of Establishmentist thinking, we can also note a more brutal aspect: the process of bludgeoning the lower orders into submission.
