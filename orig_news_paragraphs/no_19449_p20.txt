What ties all those "Top stories" together is that they are AMP   sites, Google’s   project to promote     webpages. Basically, any website that conforms to a set of   technical standards gets labeled an AMP site by Google, and gets   an "AMP" tag (with a little lightning bolt). ’ ’    One of the perks of being an AMP site is that you have the chance   to appear in the "Top stories" carousel.
