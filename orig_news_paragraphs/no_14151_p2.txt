I have no idea where it came from, but it is not a White House document," White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters. The publication of the draft, along with Trumpâ€™s interview with ABC in which he said that "torture works," has raised concerns that his administration might seek to revive certain interrogation techniques like waterboarding. Trump did add that he would defer to his Cabinet as to whether he would adopt such policies. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, addressed these concerns during a Democratic lawmaker retreat in West Virginia, telling his colleagues he had spoken to Pompeo and that the CIA chief was just as surprised as the senators to learn of the document in question.
