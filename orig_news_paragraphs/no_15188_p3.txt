The case, While DHS initially said Tuesday they had a record of Montes’ DACA expiring in 2015, they released further information Wednesday saying he did, in fact, have DACA status until 2018. The problem, though, is on the part of the story both sides agree on: Montes tried to sneak back into the US on February 19 and was caught by Border Patrol. DACA requires individuals to get   to leave the country, and so Montes’   then showed he had left without authorization and voided his status, DHS said.    "Mr.   lost his DACA status when he left the United States without advanced parole on an unknown date prior to his arrest by the US Border Patrol on Feb. 19, 2017," said DHS spokeswoman Jenny Burke in a statement.
