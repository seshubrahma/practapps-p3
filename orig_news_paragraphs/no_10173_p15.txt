Every Republican who aspires to the presidency should acknowledge that immigrants of all skill sets can benefit the economy   …     with some 11 million people living in the U. S. illegally, every candidate should support a path to legal status —   short of citizenship —  for illegal immigrants willing to accept responsibility for their actions and take the consequences   …      This is simply an attempt to set forth unifying principles that are easily articulated and essential if Republicans have a chance at winning the next presidential election.
