Duterte has remained near the   mark, with his highest rating at 84 percent after his election but before his inauguration. Reuters adds that Duterte’s initial trust rating in December 2015 was at 47 percent.   Duterte’s ratings are better with men than women, as 83 percent of men and 79 percent of women say they had "much trust" in the president, gaining one percentage point among men and one among women. Regionally, his best ratings came from his native Mindanao, a southern Philippine island, where 90 percent of respondents said they had "much trust" in Duterte, down from 92 percent in December.
