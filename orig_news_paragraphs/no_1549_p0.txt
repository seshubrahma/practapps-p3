The bipartisan commission responsible for arranging presidential debates on Sunday rebuffed Donald J. Trumpâ€™s complaints that two of the three debates were scheduled to take place during pro football games, after Mr. Trump hedged about whether he would still participate. The Commission on Presidential Debates made the schedule last September after consulting with officials in both parties. The first two debates conflict with National Football League games: on Monday, Sept. 26 (Atlanta Falcons vs. New Orleans Saints) and Sunday, Oct. 9 (Giants vs. Green Bay Packers).
