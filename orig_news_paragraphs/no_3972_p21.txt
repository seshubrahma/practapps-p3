Federal immigration policy adds roughly 1 million legal people, workers, consumers and renters per year to the economy. This annual inflow is further expanded by the immigrants’ children, which now combine to create a population of roughly 63 million consumers and workers  —  not counting roughly 21 million illegals and their U. S. children. That means roughly   of the nation ’s consumers have been imported into the 330   economy via legal or illegal immigration.
