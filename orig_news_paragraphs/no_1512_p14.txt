Of the 34 seats up for   this year, 24 are occupied by Republicans. Six of those, including Kirkâ€™s, are in states to which the Republicans managed to lay claim in the Tea Party tsunami of 2010, but that President Obama won two years later. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, the Democrats need to retake only four of those six to control the Senate (because the vice president gets a Senate vote in the event of a tie). Presidential election years have increasingly brought out   nonwhite voters, so 2016 was sure to be an unpleasant one for Kirk and his Republican colleagues regardless.
