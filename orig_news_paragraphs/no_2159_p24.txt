—   must be sunk in a specific order. A "snooker" occurs when a player’s cue ball gets boxed in and can’t make contact with the ball he is next supposed to sink without fouling. The game was invented in 1875 by a British military officer stationed in India named Neville Chamberlain (no, not that Neville Chamberlain). At the time, the word snooker was a derisive term for a new cadet.
