She replied, "I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10, 000 to 65, 000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in." There’s no clean or accurate way to estimate how much each refugee costs the U. S. For an overly simplistic estimate: if we look at the part of ORR’s budget that is not dedicated to the custody of Central American children (about $611 million in FY2015) the total number of refugees admitted (about 70, 000) and then add in the 55, 000 more Syrian refugees Clinton is proposing, the cost to the U. S. government might look something closer to $1. 1 billion per year (about $500 million more than what ORR spends now) plus the $3 billion per year from the State Department.   That $4. 1 billion doesn’t include resettlement services funded by the private sector NGOs like the International Rescue Committee, which helps resettle refugees in the U. S. are heavily funded by private donations. It also doesn’t include the positive economic impact refugees have on their communities once resettled, according to studies.
