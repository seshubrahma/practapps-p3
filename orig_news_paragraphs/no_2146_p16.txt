Israel is increasingly polarized into different groups that have little to do with one another, despite its tight geography," said Robert Danin, a former State Department official who worked on Middle East issues. President Reuven Rivlin highlighted the changing Israeli society in a speech last year. Many Israelis, he said, still think of their country as consisting of a large secular Zionist majority with three minority groups: Arabs,   Jews and a national religious community more akin to Modern Orthodox in American terms.
