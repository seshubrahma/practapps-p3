The new rule includes several changes insurers requested to keep them in the insurance marketplace: Insurance companies cheered the new rule but cautioned that they will wait to see how the Trump administration will handle Obamacareâ€™s insurance reimbursements. Insurers threatened to raise premiums or leave the Obamacare exchanges if they no longer receive the Obamacare reimbursements for offering discounted deductibles and copayments for   Americans. The White House will continue to provide these   subsidies, although Trump signaled that he might cancel the reimbursements to force Democrats to sign a deal on health care reform. In 2016 a federal judge ruled against the Obama administration but allowed the federal government to continue providing Obamacare subsidies while the administration appealed the decision.
