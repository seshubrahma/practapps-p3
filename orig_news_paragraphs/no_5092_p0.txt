President Donald Trump has secured the release of an American citizen held in an Egyptian jail for three years, her Egyptian husband, and four fellow charity workers jailed with her. ["We are very happy to have Aya back home, and itâ€™s a great honor to have her in the Oval Office," Trump said on Friday during the meeting at the White House.   Trump arranged for a government aircraft to transport Aya Hijazi, 30, and her husband, Mohamed Hassanein, back to the United States, with the couple and family arriving late on Thursday. "
