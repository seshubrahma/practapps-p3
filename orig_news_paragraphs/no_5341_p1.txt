The data, obtained from ICE by the Herald, shows the Boston ICE office, which covers all of New England, saw 59 of its requests to hold arrested immigrants denied last year. Thatâ€™s up from 56 in 2015 and just 18 in 2014. Meanwhile, the denial rate of ICE detainers nationally has plummeted, from 10, 701 in 2014 and 8, 546 in 2015 to 2, 008 last year. In 2016, the Herald revealed in a report that Massachusetts had deported the least number of illegal immigrants out of every state in the US, with just 26. 9 percent of illegal immigrants being deported.
