The geography of victory for Mr. Trump, who barely campaigned in New York City, is also significant. Can he capture congressional districts in Manhattan, where Republicans are far from plentiful and are aligned more with, say, George Pataki, the former governor, than with Mr. Trump? If he can, it suggests that he may still be able to increase his support in the coming months if he tightens his message and becomes more disciplined. Other questions: Can Mr. Kasich capture the suburbs north of New York City, where his message should play best?
