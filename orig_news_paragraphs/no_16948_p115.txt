Clinton’s plan calls for a range of tax increases on wages and investments, but they target the   households, according to the latest analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The top 1% for instance, would absorb 93% of her proposed tax hikes. Among her proposed tax increases, Clinton wants to implement the   Buffett Rule. It’s named after billionaire Warren Buffett and would require anyone making $2 million or more to pay at least 30% of that in federal income taxes.
