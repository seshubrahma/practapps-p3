" I believe Tillerson repeated in the meetings what he said publicly in South Korea and Japan, and backed up Trump in his tweet," he said. That meant some public warmth was necessary, the diplomat said, because aside from talking about North Korea, Mr. Tillerson also had the task of setting a broad agenda for a summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi that is expected to take place in Florida in early April. At the summit meeting, China is expected to seek a reaffirmation of the "One China" policy, under which the United States recognizes a single Chinese government in Beijing and does not maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
