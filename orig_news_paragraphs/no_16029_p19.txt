The contributions of U. S. and foreign Muslims to American military efforts donâ€™t begin to include the contributions made by the large number of   civilians who have also been out there risking their lives and safety each day and night alongside their fellow Americans in uniform.   Some of them have come home with grave injuries.   One translator I know and consider a dear friend grew up in an   community in California and planned to do humanitarian work after school. She did not sign up for the military.
