I’m saying it lacks context. Looking at all the data for the past five years, February apprehensions ranged from 32, 000 to 42, 000, but this year there were 23, 589. That’s significantly lower, but January apprehensions were about 10, 000 higher this year than in years before. And December apprehensions were 58, 478, nearly double the norm.
