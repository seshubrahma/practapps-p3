Cruz: B. Cruz didn’t do anything wrong, but he didn’t do much that was special, either. His only memorable line of the night came at the end, when he joked that America is an amazing country where the son of a dishwasher, the son of a bartender, the son of a mailman, and the son of a wealthy businessman can run for president. He had some good points about Social Security and free trade in particular, but policy talk at this point has become a snoozefest.
