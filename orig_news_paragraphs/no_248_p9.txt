Ga. Jeff Lane, a county commissioner, surveyed the wreckage at the Sunshine Acres trailer park, where he said all of the countyâ€™s deaths had occurred. (He said eight had died, but Ms. Howden said later that the toll was actually seven.) Search and rescue crews were still making their way through the community. Photographs showed an open field surrounded by thin trees, strewn with splintered wood, metal sheeting and destroyed cars.
