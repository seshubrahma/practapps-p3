Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney said Wednesday he is "among those who think this is a terrific step," speaking with Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily about the firing of FBI Director James Comey. [He saw "abundant reasons" for President Trump to dismiss Comey.   " One among them is that in the past year or so, he has made a serial hashup of what is, and must be, the single most important role of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, which is to conduct investigations out of the public eye, and in a rigorous and thoroughly legal fashion," he said.
