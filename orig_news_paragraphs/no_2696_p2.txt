Mr. Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Mr. Trump last Wednesday, sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor, but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously. Mr. Putin repeated the congratulations over the phone. The Russian president said he hoped that Moscow could build a "collaborative dialogue" with Washington on the bases of "equality, mutual respect and noninterference in the other’s internal affairs," the release said. The two men also discussed Syria in the context of "the need to work together in the struggle against the No. 1 common enemy  —   international terrorism and extremism," the statement said.
