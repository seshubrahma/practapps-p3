It is called The Final Report of the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Based on detailed interviews with hundreds of Americans from the realms of law enforcement, education, government, business, the police unions, faith and community groups, the many minorities in our diverse nation, it is the people’s blueprint for modern policing. I was proud to have been appointed by President Obama to serve on the Task Force that compiled and wrote it.   I call it a blueprint because it is a plan for building law and order in what is still a new century.
