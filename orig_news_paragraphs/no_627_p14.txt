Fortress’s stock price is down 80 percent since it began trading, and its executives have made no secret that the joy of being a public company has largely evaporated. The firm’s struggles trace to the financial crisis, when it was slow to exit the subprime loan business, forcing heavy losses. The stock dipped below $1, and the firm did not consistently return to profitability until 2012. At the same time, Mr. Edens positioned the firm to capitalize on the economic recovery, piling back into the subprime business through its purchase of the mortgage servicer Nationstar and consumer lender Springleaf, now known as OneMain Financial.
