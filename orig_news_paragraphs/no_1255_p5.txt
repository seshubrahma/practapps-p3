At the same time, analysts said, China is unlikely to abandon North Korea as an ally and a strategic asset because it does not want to see a unified Korean Peninsula dominated by American troops. The first evening between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump looked warm and welcoming on Chinese   television, with lavish photographs of them chatting informally on an elegant sofa at    Mr. Trump’s Florida club. The news shows also broadcast images of the two leaders sitting side by side at a vast dining table set with candelabra, and of Mr. Trump’s    granddaughter, Arabella, singing in Chinese to Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, before dinner. The Chinese reports approvingly noted that the granddaughter did a   performance, singing a Chinese song, "Jasmine," and reciting the "Three Character Classic" and some Tang poetry.
