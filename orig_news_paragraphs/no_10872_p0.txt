JANESVILLE, Wisconsin  —   House Speaker Paul Ryan "appreciates the gesture" from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump for endorsing Ryan in Green Bay on Friday night, a spokesman told Breitbart News. ["He appreciates the gesture and is going to continue to focus on earning the endorsement of the voters in Southern Wisconsin," a Ryan aide told Breitbart News in response to Trump’s endorsement.   After previously refusing to endorse Ryan for Congress in his race against Republican businessman Paul Nehlen, saying he wasn’t ready to do so, Trump endorsed Ryan in Green Bay on Saturday. "
