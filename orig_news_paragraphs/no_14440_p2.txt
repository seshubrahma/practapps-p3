Heavy rains last week caused the lake level to rise until the water began to pour down the emergency spillway on Sunday. Authorities ordered people to leave the area when a hole developed in an eroded area of the spillway, affecting about 188, 000 residents. Officials worried the spillway would fail, and one warned a "  wall of water" could flood the communities below the dam. Fears of such a disaster have largely been alleviated.
