Organizers of an event at the University of California Berkeley with conservative firebrand Ann Coulter are fearful of more violence from   anarchist groups, following the riots that took place before an event with former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos last month. [The event, which is scheduled to take place in April, was organized by the nonpartisan student political group BridgeCal and the university’s College Republican group. Plans include a talk on immigration followed by a    session. It will also be sponsored by the Young America’s Foundation, who will pay the majority of Coulter’s $20, 000 speaking fee.
