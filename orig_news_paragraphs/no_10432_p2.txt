She did not give a great speech tonight, but she hit some ground that is very, very valuable to her. I think the arguments against Trump, particularly the one I mentioned on    the other one is going after on the I alone can can fix it, which I think we heard the president work that last night. I think thatâ€™s a very damaging argument against him, and not just with Democrats or Independents, but with conservatives and Republicans. I think on the economics, she probably scored very, very well, because people were looking for real proposals that they think might help them, not just trust me, I can do it.
