A few commentators discovered that earlier women’s movements were as conscious as we are of colors as symbols. They found Emmeline Pankhurst and the British militant Women’s Social and Political Union decorating their signage in white, purple and green and the   American Alice Paul choosing purple, white and gold to signify her National Woman’s Party, devoted to civil disobedience, who picketed Woodrow Wilson’s White House and were thrown in jail for it. They also found    and reproduced    stunning newspaper photographs of massive numbers of women parading in neat lines in places like New York’s Fifth Avenue, all in white dresses. Obviously taken with the trope, Rep. Nancy Pelosi urged Democratic women to attend President Trump’s address to Congress earlier this month wearing white.
