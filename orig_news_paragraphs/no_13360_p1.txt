Thursday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," host Joe Scarborough reacted to an interview hosted by Fox New Channel’s Bill O’Reilly on the network’s "The O’Reilly Factor" a night earlier with Republican presidential   Donald Trump.   Scarborough mocked O’Reilly, who begged Trump to reconsider his decision not to appear in the network’s GOP presidential debate in Des Moines, IA scheduled for later tonight. " First of all, I think we prove on this show that we don’t beg," Scarborough said.
