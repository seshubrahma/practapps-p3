A Vine video has emerged, purporting to show a new angle of the incident. The footage appears inconclusive, but visible in the background is Ken Kurson,    of the New York Observer, who appears to have had a   view of the action.   Breitbart News reached out to Kurson, who responded via  : I was five feet away from the alleged incident and didnâ€™t see anything. I was literally looking right at Corey when it supposedly happened.
