In an October 1997 poll cited by Fox, only 6 percent of respondents said they trusted politicians more than journalists, 61 percent said they trusted journalists more than politicians, and 20 percent said they trusted neither. So the 2017 numbers show journalists have lost   of their trust level, or 19 points, from the 1997 level of 61 percent to the 2017 level of 42 percent. The Fox news poll is validated by a recent poll from Emerson College. The poll also shows that the public believes the media is far tougher on Trump than it was on President Barack Obama.
