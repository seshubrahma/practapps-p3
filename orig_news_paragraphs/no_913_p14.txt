Casting those officials as a "deep state" forces them to choose between options that are bad for the agencies but also bad for the Trump administration. Almost any outcome increases the perception that institutions are politicized or in conflict with Mr. Trump, which hurts him as well. Even a pliant institution, if it is seen as politicized, will struggle to enact Mr. Trumpâ€™s policies. If the president and his institutions come to see each other as an enemy, trust could be difficult to restore.
