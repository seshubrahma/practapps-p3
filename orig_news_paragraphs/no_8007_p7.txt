According to the tabloid Express, the government is trying to find and prosecute a leaker in their own ranks who gave the press confidential information   â€”   namely, that the German government requested that Police did not include the word "rape" in their Cologne report. The German media has been complicit in these machinations.    ZDF initially refused to report on the incidents for reasons that remain unclear.
