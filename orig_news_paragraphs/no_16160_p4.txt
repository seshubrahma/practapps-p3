So Trump kept calling him Thursday, not quite saying he had chosen Pence, but trying to convince Christie to take the job of attorney general.    Everyone around Trump knew Pence was the logical    if boring    choice, the kind of guy everyone describes as "nice" but one who would be the first to blush if Trump told an   joke. He and Trump scarcely knew each other, and his understated demeanor could not be more different than Trump’s brash style.   Trump’s children and Manafort decided Pence was the safe choice someone who could be trusted, a calm, reliable counter force to Trump’s unpredictable and erratic tangents.
