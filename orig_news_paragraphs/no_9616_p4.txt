This means that instead of inspecting and counting each vote by hand, the optical readouts will simply be   through the machines for a recount to be tallied mechanically. Wisconsin Elections Commission chairman Mark Thomsen, a Democrat, cited the 2011 hand recount that changed a mere 300 votes out of 1. 5 million as the basis for his ruling that machine recounting was sufficient to satisfy Steinâ€™s recount petition. Thomsen said he doubted that any recount would close the more than 22, 000 vote gap Hillary would need to overtake and beat current state winner and   Donald J. Trump. The   commission Thomsen heads is equally split between Democrats and Republicans and voted unanimously to proceed with a machine recount.
