Democratic office vandalized  Fifteen miles south, in Carrboro, a Democratic office was   with the words "Death to Capitalism."    Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Matt Hughes says the office was closed midday Sunday after employees discovered the scrawl.   Capt. Chris Atack of the Carrboro Police Department told CNN in an email that the graffiti is consistent in theme with others officials have seen in the downtown areas for years.   He said the incident was not believed to be related to the GOP vandalism in Hillsborough.
