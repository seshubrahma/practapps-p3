This spring, a Massachusetts museum bought a copy of Grimm’s fairy tales in which she had inscribed her and her sister’s names. In 1989, another short piece of verse written in a friend’s notebook went on sale at Christie’s. The poem’s opening features traditional lines of encouragement, and can be traced to a 1930s Dutch periodical. The closing verses, which the auction house has not traced, may be Anne’s own.
