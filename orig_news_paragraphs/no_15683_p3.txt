Nixon even said in his inaugural address that "our lines of communication will be open" to signal how serious he, an ardent Cold Warrior, was about pursuing a new path. The reason that this comparison would be so attractive for Trump’s administration to use is that the Nixon back channel produced huge results. At a moment of great tensions between the two   super powers, Kissinger, who would become Nixon’s national security adviser, would use this secret channel after Nixon officially became President to conduct conversations that culminated in the historic SALT I nuclear arms agreement, a landmark moment in the policy of détente and the eventual end of the Cold War. But there is another, less favorable Nixon comparison to what Kushner allegedly did.
