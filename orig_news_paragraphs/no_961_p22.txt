In the village of Schiermonnikoog on the island of the same name, 105 percent of the population had already voted as of 5 p. m. The extras were visitors to the island. In this country with 12. 9 million eligible voters, there are 9, 000 polling places, so the lines are relatively short and all voters need to show is their registration card anywhere in the municipality where they live. (Those voting outside their municipality need a special pass.)
