Legislation authored by State Senate President pro Tem Kevin De Le√≥n (  Angeles) to make California a "sanctuary state" is rapidly advancing through the legislative process. In addition, the state legislature has produced stinging   resolutions. Last week, it was announced that the California legislature extended a controversial contract for former   Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm, at $25, 000 per month, focused on taking an aggressive posture against the Trump administration. Sacramento Democrats are not the first to engage in this very aggressive funding of efforts to stymie federal immigration enforcement.
