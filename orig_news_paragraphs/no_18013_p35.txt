A special counsel would not have the same degree of autonomy as   the independent counsels who in the   era probed     misconduct until the law authorizing such   appointments expired in 1999. Independent counsels were appointed   by, and answerable to, a   panel; special counsels can   be appointed, and fired, by the Justice Department. But a special   counsel would be expected to investigate much more aggressively   than the White House would like, and firing a special counsel   would only aggravate the scandal.
