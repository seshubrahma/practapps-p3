That’s 12. 5 points more than Romney’s share of the national vote in 2012, and if it proves true during the ballot, that 18. 46 percent   support translates into 2 point shift towards Trump. The poll also said another 4. 6 percent were undecided.   The Harper poll is small, with an error margin of 4. 4 percent, but an Oct. 30 poll of 1, 249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided.
