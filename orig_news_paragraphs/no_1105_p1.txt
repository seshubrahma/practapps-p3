But efforts to revive the legislation in the House could take weeks, lawmakers conceded, as Congress moves forward with a full plate of other   issues. And the renewed push did not meet with much enthusiasm from Senate Republicans, who said they had other priorities at the moment. Nonetheless, Speaker Paul D. Ryan vowed to renew efforts to repeal the law, despite last weekâ€™s crushing setback when House Republicans tossed aside a repeal bill because they lacked the votes to pass it. Just days after President Trump said he was moving on to other issues, senior administration officials said they still hoped to score the kind of big legislative victory that has so far eluded the White House.
