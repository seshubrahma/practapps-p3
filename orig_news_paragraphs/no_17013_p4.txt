As late as Monday, there was even discussion among Senate Democrats and some Republicans over whether Garland would see a vote in the lame duck Senate before Hillary Clinton had a chance to nominate a more liberal justice. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of four conservatives and four liberals was in a holding pattern, deciding as little as possible and deadlocked on the most contentious issues. Roberts was waiting it out, engaging in modest negotiations, giving up little and watching for the political situation to clarify. Now it is clear that Trump, backed by a   Senate, will choose the next justices.
