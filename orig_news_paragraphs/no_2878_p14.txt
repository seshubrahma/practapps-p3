These bots are meant to distract trolls by goading them into fighting with unthinking machines. Accounts like @arguetron and @good_opinions tweet out automated progressive lines, then lure in the folks who scan Twitter, looking for a fight. All it takes is tweeting out flash point terms like "affirmative action," "feminist" or "Drudge Report. "
