He was just 3. 3 percentage points behind Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who won the race by shamelessly pandering to the state â€™s huge evangelical population, which has determined the outcome of every Republican caucus there since at least 2000. If Rudy Giuliani had done as well in Iowa as Trump did, the media would have declared him the winner and he very likely would rushed through New Hampshire and South Carolina on waves of positive press and his ultimate gambit of winning it all in Florida very likely could have worked. In other words, if Mr. Giuliani had done as well as Mr. Trump did in Iowa, we quite possibly would be referring to him now as former President Giuliani.
