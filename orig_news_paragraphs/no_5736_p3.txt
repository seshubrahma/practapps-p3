It’s a great day today when we can welcome, here in Zagan, American soldiers who represent the best, the greatest army in the world. Poland’s Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said: We have waited for you for a very long time. We waited for decades, sometimes feeling we had been left alone, sometimes almost losing hope, sometimes feeling that we were the only ones who protected civilization from aggression that came from the east. The American troops will be part of a Nato contingent that will include troops from Britain and Canada.
