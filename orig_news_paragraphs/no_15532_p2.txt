Among the candidates, Trump will meet with 2000 Democratic vice presidential    Joe Lieberman, a former senator who supported Republican Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Trump will also meet with acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and Richard McFeely, a career FBI official who retired in 2014 as head of the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services branch. Lieberman told CNN the appointment "was not sought after or expected," but that he got a call Tuesday asking him to fly into Washington for the interview. Keating, the governor of Oklahoma during the 1994 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, left the White House with a smile on Wednesday.
