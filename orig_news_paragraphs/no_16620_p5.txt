The "deplorables" saga represents a passport for each campaign to reach the distinct coalition of voters they need most to win November’s election. For Trump, Clinton’s dismissal of many of his supporters as racists, xenophobes, sexists, Islamaphobes and bigots is a gift that allows him to recreate his victorious GOP primary persona of a champion of blue collar Americans demonized by patronizing East coast political elites. It’s exactly the kind of posture the billionaire New Yorker needs to electrify white, working class voters in the swing states in the industrial Midwest, where he must outperform recent GOP nominees to win an Electoral College majority. The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, knows its best hope of victory is maximizing the Obama coalition from 2012    especially young people, minorities and single women    exactly the kind of voters likely to be most horrified by such a dire picture of the Trump coalition and the man who leads it.
