 (CNN) The FBI asked the Justice Department on Saturday to refute President Donald Trump’s assertion that President Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump’s phones last year, two sources with knowledge of the situation told CNN. The FBI made the request because such wiretapping would be illegal, since the President cannot just order the eavesdropping of a U. S. citizen’s phones, the sources said. A court would have to approve any request to wiretap.
