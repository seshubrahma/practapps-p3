Across the country, flag supporters staged more than 350 rallies after the Charleston shooting. During the campaign, the activist and filmmaker Rod Webber documented the sale of Confederate flags with "Trump 2016" emblazoned on them outside a Trump rally in Pittsburgh. He said that he saw the flags for sale outside about 10 other campaign rallies. In August, inside a rally in Kissimmee, Fla. a Trump supporter named Brandon Partin draped such a flag over a railing, although a campaign staff member and the local police eventually had it removed.
