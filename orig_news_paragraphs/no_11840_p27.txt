Trump currently has 460 delegates, and would need 1, 237 to win the GOP nomination. Winning the three    states would put him well over 700 delegates, potentially closer to 800 delegates, and within striking distance of wrapping this thing up in the next few weeks. So, while the entire world has come at Trump with everything they’ve got, he’s not only still standing. He’s in prime position to potentially win the nomination soon, if his momentum continues on the trajectory it’s on, and then the question would become whether the party would support him —  or whether GOP leaders would go back on their pledges to support the eventual nominee.
