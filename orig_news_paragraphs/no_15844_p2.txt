The comment was quick and   but the crowd of Romney loyalists appreciated it and applauded. The two men were on opposite sides of the 2012 election     Biden as the running mate of President Barack Obama and Romney as the Republican presidential nominee.   Romney and Biden both considered running for president last year, but both deferred to candidates they saw as having an overwhelming financial advantage (Jeb Bush on the Republican side Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side).
