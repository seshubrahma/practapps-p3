As mortgage rates go up, people are a little less likely to buy a house, and those with   mortgages are less likely to refinance (because they probably will not end up with a better deal). An interesting wrinkle is that as a result, volume  —   that is, the amount of new mortgage contracts being issued   —   goes down. So brokers could also start loosening their requirements for new mortgages.
