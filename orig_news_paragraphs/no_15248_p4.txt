North Korea responded in a statement Tuesday, slamming the "ridiculous and foolhardy" Trump administration for taking steps that are "little short of lighting the fuse of a total war under the present    situation on the Korean Peninsula."   The statement, attributed to a Foreign Ministry spokesman and using the acronym for the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea, said that "the root causes of pushing the DPRK to have access to nukes" included US attempts to isolate them internationally along with "the nuclear threat" the US has posed to North Korea for "more than half a century. " The DPRK will stand against the US and "cut the windpipe of the US imperialists by dint of the strong revolutionary forces with the nuclear force, an almighty treasured sword, as their pivot," the statement said.
