This covers a period of the race   Trump’s sweep of six Northeastern states, beginning April 19th in his home state of New York. The NBC poll was conducted immediately after Trump’s sweep of the Northeast, but before Cruz’s announcement of Carly Fiorina as his   and his endorsement by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Additionally, both polls show John Kasich with much lower levels of support than he garners in other public polls. The NBC poll seems to assign much of the evaporation in support for Kasich to Trump, while the Downs Center tips that support to Cruz.
