People who use Uber and Lyft often were more likely to use public transportation, according to a study last year by the American Public Transportation Association that examined seven cities, including Washington and Boston. " We’ve seen that it’s been a symbiotic relationship between public transit and these   services," said Darnell Grisby, director of policy for the association. But in New York, where fewer than half of residents have a car, people have long relied on public transit and yellow cabs, and many are using the apps to replace those transportation modes.
