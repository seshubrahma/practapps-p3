Donald Trump’s campaign is calling for the FBI to release additional records on its interview with Hillary Clinton and the investigation into her use of a private, personal email server during her time as secretary of state. [The Trump campaign press release on Monday states that the FBI’s redacted interview notes, which were released late on Friday before the Labor Day weekend, raise questions on whether or not Clinton’s emails, which were under subpoena, had been intentionally destroyed.   " Not only do the FBI’s interview notes underscore Hillary Clinton’s terrible judgment, incompetence, and dishonesty, they raise serious questions about whether emails regarding the terrorist attack in Benghazi were intentionally destroyed while under congressional subpoena," stated Trump’s deputy campaign manager David Bossie.
