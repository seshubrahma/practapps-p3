In Greensboro, Clinton spoke about the issue of "how we lift up our children and families," in remarks that marked Clinton’s second in a series of "Stronger Together" speeches    part of a broader effort to inject more of the candidate’s personal story into the narrative.   " One upside to Hillary Clinton’s break from the trail was having time to sharpen the final argument she will present to voters in these closing weeks," communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement ahead of the speech.   But if Clinton is trying to change the subject away from her health, Trump may make that difficult.
