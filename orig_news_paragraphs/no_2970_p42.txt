It’s 20, 000 interviews, or about 24 times more respondents than the    poll in Pennsylvania. In that data set, there are 1, 881 black respondents, and just 55 of them supported Romney. So in 2012 you would have expected there to be about two voters who were black and supported Mitt Romney in an     national poll. With numbers like that, you’re going to get more than a few polls where there are no black voters for the G. O. P.
