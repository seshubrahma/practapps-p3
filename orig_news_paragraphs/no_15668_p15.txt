This is the type of case that can only be heard by the justices if they want to hear it. There is currently no "split in the circuits" because there is no contrary ruling from the 9th Circuit or any other circuit.   That means that this case is not the type of case the Supreme Court normally accepts. The fact that the 4th Circuitâ€™s opinion is limited to a decision on a preliminary injunction makes it even less likely that the Supreme Court will see any real need to weigh in on the issue at this time.
