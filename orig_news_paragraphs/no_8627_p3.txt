Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols also fought against Question 3. He appeared in a television ad, where he stressed that "background checks are ‘already’ [the] law and that [an expansion] wouldn’t stop criminals, but it would rather create them out of otherwise   Mainers. " In other words, background checks for retail sales have been the law of the land since 1998, and expanding those checks to private sales would only criminalize   Mainers who refused to comply with new fee requirements and more government oversight on gun sales.
