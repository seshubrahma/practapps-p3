—    Suspected killer wasn’t deported because he had no papers, Ralf Jäger, the controversial   home affairs minister for the state of North   has spoken in a press conference this afternoon on the background of suspected killer Anis A, who lived at least part of the time in the state. When asked by a journalist why the Tunisian migrant hadn’t been deported despite having failed in his application for asylum, the politician responded: "the man could not be deported because he had no valid identity papers". This refers to a common paradox in German immigration policy, where asylum seekers have their claims rejected for not being from a sufficiently dangerous country but can’t be returned because they have lost or destroyed their legitimate identity papers   to Europe.
