BERLIN   —   Even in Germany, where consensus is highly valued, it had never happened before. On Sunday, Martin Schulz was anointed leader of the Social Democrats, Europe’s oldest democratic party, with 100 percent of the valid votes cast at a special convention. The result places Mr. Schulz, 61, a former president of the European Parliament, in pole position to unseat the world’s most powerful woman, Chancellor Angela Merkel, when the two face off on Sept. 24 in the national election, in which Ms. Merkel is seeking a fourth term.
