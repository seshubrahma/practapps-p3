Judge Curiel said more than 100 potential jurors would be in court on Nov. 28, and nine would be picked to begin hearing arguments no more than two days later. He said he expected both sides to finish presenting their cases around Dec. 14. Mr. Petrocelli said it was unlikely that Mr. Trump would attend the trial, and Judge Curiel said he did not expect he would. The lawsuit, filed in 2010 on behalf of former students, says Trump University gave seminars and classes across the country under the guise of being an accredited school and pressured people to spend up to $35, 000 on mentorships from Mr. Trumpâ€™s "handpicked" instructors.
