Only the Adamsâ€™s, the Roosevelts, and the Kennedys could make the same claim as goes political dynasties.   Years ago, Sports Illustrated ran a cover story on the Green Bay Packers the year after Vince Lombardi left and the team had reverted back to losing. The headline read, "A Dynasty Totters" and I recall the wistful feeling as I held that issue. Years later, I am experiencing that same sentiment even as conservatives often disagreed with the family.
