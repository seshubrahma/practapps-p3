As prescribed by city law, records containing the personal data of the roughly one million people who have applied for the IDs were set to be destroyed by Dec. 31. But on Wednesday, Justice Philip G. Minardo of State Supreme Court on Staten Island delayed that destruction until a full hearing could be convened in the first week of January, preferably with Mr. de Blasio or Melissa   the City Council speaker, present. " I donâ€™t want to order the mayor or the council speaker to be here, but it would be helpful," Justice Minardo said, issuing an unusual request.
