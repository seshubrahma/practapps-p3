Neither Mitchell nor the network provided any documentation or evidence to back up the "discredited" claim. As critics pointed out in response to Mitchell’s claim, Broaddrick’s accusation has not been discredited. NBC itself vetted Broaddrick’s story when she originally broke her silence by speaking to the network’s show Dateline in 1999. The network also caught up with Norma Rodgers, Broaddrick’s friend and employee, who confirmed Broaddrick’s story of how Norma found Broaddrick in her hotel room in the immediate aftermath of the incident with a badly swollen lip and mouth and that Broaddrick’s pantyhose had been ripped off.
