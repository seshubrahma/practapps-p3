" From threat of removal to celebration, Earlier this week, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple ordered the protesters to leave the campsite by Monday, citing the harsh weather conditions as a reason why they needed to decamp. The US Army Corps of Engineers had warned that come Monday, activists who refused to leave the campsite could be arrested, then backtracked, saying the agency had no plans to forcibly remove those who stay. Instead of backing away, the protesters came out in full force and showed no signs of backing down, even inviting over 2, 000 veterans to join their already robust presence.
