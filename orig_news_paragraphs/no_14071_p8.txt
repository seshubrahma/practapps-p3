While Israel has long wanted the US to move the embassy and has welcomed Trump’s pledge, top Israeli officials have said the issue is not the most important in the relationship, stressing the threat posed by Iran, the violence in Syria and the need for Israel to improve its relations with Arab states remained the government’s top priorities. Netanyahu’s office said the two leaders had a "very warm conversation" and pledged to "work closely with President Trump to forge a common vision to advance peace and security in the region, with no daylight between the United States and Israel."
