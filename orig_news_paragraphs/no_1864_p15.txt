Ms. Conway went further on "Fox News Sunday," saying that it was incumbent upon Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, President Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, to calm the passions of their supporters who are objecting to Mr. Trump. She said that many of them were "masquerading as protesters," and that Democratic leaders should ask those critical of Mr. Trump "to give this man a chance so that this country can flourish. " She said on NBC’s "Meet the Press" that she disagreed with Mrs. Clinton’s remarks to donors on Saturday in which the candidate blamed the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, for her election defeat.
