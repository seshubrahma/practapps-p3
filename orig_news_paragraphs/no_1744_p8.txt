Mrs. Clinton wove her attack on Mr. Trump into an address in which she also criticized other corporate actors, including top executives at Wells Fargo after employees opened roughly 1. 5 million bank accounts and applied for 565, 000 credit cards that may not have been authorized by customers, according to regulators. The bank paid $185 million in fines, including a $100 million penalty from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the largest penalty the agency has ever issued. Mrs. Clinton seemed upbeat at the rally, her first since the revelations Saturday about Mr. Trumpâ€™s taxes. She boasted of being endorsed by LeBron James, who led the Cleveland Cavaliers to the N. B. A. championship and grew up in Akron, Ohio, which Mrs. Clinton was also visiting Monday.
