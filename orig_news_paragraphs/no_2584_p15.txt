Mr. Trump quoted extensively from the book "Clinton Cash," written by a Republican author who was forced to correct several inaccuracies after the book went to press. He said the United States was the "highest taxed country in the world," which is not true. He said there might be five Supreme Court vacancies for the next president to fill, a number that has not been suggested before. Mr. Trump overtly appealed to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to back him instead of Mrs. Clinton, borrowing from the senatorâ€™s own words to describe her as unfit for office.
