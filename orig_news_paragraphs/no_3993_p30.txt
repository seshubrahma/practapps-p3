Tenney also said she was pleased to see so many Gold Star families: The Gold Star families were some of the most important people represented. They were there, some of the Gold Star mothers from my district were there who Iâ€™ve known for years back to my time in the state assembly. Just about everybody had an American flag, and no problems supporting the American flag and the troops and freedom and Second Amendment rights and all those things. It was very interesting times, and very emotional.
