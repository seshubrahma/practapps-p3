The campaign announced this week it had raised around $20 million in the 4th Quarter, bringing its total haul to just over $45 million this year. Super PACs affiliated with the Cruz campaign raised $57 million in the first reporting period of the campaign, second only to Jeb Bushâ€™s allied super PAC. The $4 million in reserved advertising is the first significant buy by any organization linked to the Cruz campaign. To date, the campaign or affiliated super PACs have only spent around $1 million on all paid advertising.
