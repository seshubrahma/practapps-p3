, If we study UK politics, we notice something interesting: Elections across the Atlantic have a way of anticipating American elections. For example, in 1951, Winston Churchill was returned to Number 10 Downing Street. A little more than a year later, here in America, another World War Two hero, Dwight Eisenhower, was given the keys to the White House. Similarly, Margaret Thatcher was elected to the prime ministership in 1979 the following year, Ronald Reagan won the presidency.
