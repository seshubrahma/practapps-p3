Art, literature, music and drama in the west are expressions of the licence given to Christians to explore themselves and their relationship to the ineffable.   Islam does not see God in this way. Allah is said to be Compassionate and Merciful, but he does not, in the words of a medieval historian friend of mine, enter into his creation.   He does not invite his creatures to be fellow creators.
