S. intelligence officials" were saying the United States was prepared to launch a "  strike with conventional weapons against North Korea, should officials become convinced that North Korea is about to follow through with a nuclear weapons test. " [The report was quickly denounced as wildly inaccurate by Trump administration officials, but a North Korean official said on Friday that his country was prepared to launch a   nuclear strike against U. S. forces if they carry out "reckless military maneuvers. "   The NBC report quoted unnamed intelligence officials who said the U. S. has positioned two destroyers with Tomahawk missiles near North Korea, within range of the   nuclear test site where a detonation may be imminent.
