As MEMRI points out, the paragraph mentioning a Palestinian state in the 1967 boundaries, which ostensibly attests to the organizationâ€™s pragmatic evolution, is written in such a way that it is not possible to understand clearly whether Hamas actually accepts such a solution. Furthermore, the document continues, "There is no compromise on any part of Palestine under any conditions, any circumstances, or any pressure, no matter how long the occupation continues. Hamas rejects any alternative to the complete liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea. "
