The ambush followed peaceful protests of fatal police shootings of Alton Sterling  in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, both of whom were black men. Three police officers were later killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in an another ambush in July. Texas, California, Louisiana, Georgia, and Michigan were the five deadliest states for   agents, according to the report, based on the total number of officer fatalities in each state. The uptick in officer fatalities took place amid calls for greater police accountability in response to lethal shootings of black men and women by police.
