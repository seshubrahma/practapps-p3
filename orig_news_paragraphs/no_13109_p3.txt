The poll states that Cruz would also handily defeat possible Democrat challengers   —    U. S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary and former San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro, and failed gubernatorial candidate, former State Senator Wendy Davis  —   by a margin of 12 points. Cruz failed to win a majority of voters in the 2016 Texas GOP presidential primary election in March, garnering only 44 percent of the Republican voters.
