The PredictWise numbers, for example, tend to be more certain about the outcome in both directions   —   giving Mrs. Clinton zero chance of picking off a conventionally red state like Texas, Alaska or South Carolina, and giving Mr. Trump zero chance of shuffling the electoral map and capturing a small blue state like Rhode Island or Maine. The extent to which the lines move together shows how correlated the states are to one another. In some models, like FiveThirtyEight’s, the states are very correlated in others, like the Princeton Election Consortium, they are much less so.
