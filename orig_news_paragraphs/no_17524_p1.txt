Trump’s campaign to be the Republican presidential candidate has swelled in support and media attention following his controversial remarks about the threat posed by undocumented immigrants in the United States.   He sparked outrage by saying that some people crossing the border from Mexico were "rapists" and "criminals."   The comments found support among some, but also a pile of criticism. A slew of corporations, including Macy’s, NBC, Univision and ESPN responded to his inflammatory remarks by severing business ties with the real estate magnate.
