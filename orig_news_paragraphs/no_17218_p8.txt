But with Trumpâ€™s own team in transition, that was no easy feat.   For example, Trump was connected with the Australian prime minister, sources told CNN, by a mutual acquaintance, golfer Greg Norman, who happened to have his phone number. Several diplomats told CNN that they reached out to Trump Tower to schedule congratulatory calls for their head of state. Once the calls were arranged, they were connected without being asked for any verification of their identities or measures to verify the authenticity of the call.
