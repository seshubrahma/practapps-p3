Sandown, New Hampshire (CNN) Donald Trump took the stage at a town hall here Thursday night and insisted the forum was not set up to help prepare him for Sunday’s town   debate against Hillary Clinton. And after fielding a dozen softballs for just a   from a   group of voters inside the small, sweltering   room, it seemed Trump was right : the forum had "nothing to do" with the upcoming debate, despite Trump campaign sources telling CNN earlier Thursday that the evening’s town hall event would serve as a practice run.
