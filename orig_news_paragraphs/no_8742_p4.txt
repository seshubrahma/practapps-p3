For years, President Obama and the comprehensive immigration reform crowd has distracted the American public masterfully, getting people to focus on   workers and ignore the more perilous drag on our economy the devastating impact of immigration policy on the middle and   class due to guest worker programs that have led to stagnant wages and massive American job losses. Both Democrat and Republican advocates of comprehensive immigration reform were happy to let both citizens and pundits focus on the problems at our southern border. When President Obama announced his executive action on immigration, he focused on the "bedmakers and fruit pickers" that he claimed were doing jobs Americans didn’t want to do. Obama’s messaging wizards kept the frame of the debate on low skill, low wage workers.
