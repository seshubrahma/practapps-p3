MacArthur explained how Democrats deceived the public on the issue of   conditions: The other side has spent too much time speaking to people ’s emotions and misstating the facts.    For example, with   conditions the bill could not be more explicit that insurers cannot discriminate, they can’t deny coverage, they can’t deny renewals, they can’t health rate someone who’s sick in the middle of being insured. If you get sick, your health rates don’t skyrocket.
