Last year, the Senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign  â€”   not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee. Democrats are calling for Sessions to resign, or recuse himself from any investigation into Russian involvement in the U. S. elections. They have also called for an independent review, outside of a current review being conducted by the Senate Intelligence Committee.
