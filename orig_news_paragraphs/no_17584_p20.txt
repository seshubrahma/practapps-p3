I’’m always at a loss of what to give back to you as you’’ve   given so much. I want you to know how much Bridgewater, your   principles, and our way of being have meant to me and have helped   me, especially through this past year. I’’ve had one of the   toughest years of my life personally, and I can’’t tell you how   grateful I am to have the instilling and learning of values from   this company as well as amazing people who have been there to   help and to support me. Everyone will have tough times.
