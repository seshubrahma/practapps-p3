Yesterday, Hillary Clinton gave a speech in Reno, Nevada, calling out Donald Trump on a lot of things on this equality idea. Calling him out on the fact that he has supporters like David Duke connected with the Ku Klux Klan who are going around and saying Donald Trump is their candidate because Donald Trump is pushing their values," Kaine told a crowd of young students here. " Ku Klux Klan values, David Duke values, Donald Trump values are not American values, they’re not our values. We’ve got to do all we can to fight to push back and win to say that we’re still about heading toward that north star that we set out so long ago," he added.
