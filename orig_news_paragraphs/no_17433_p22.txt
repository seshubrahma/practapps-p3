It’s not clear how any federal funding would be distributed, since spending per pupil at charter schools can fluctuate wildly. Nationally, the median spent on charters was $8, 866 per student. But that ranges from the District of Columbia spending about $18, 000 per charter school student (thanks to legislation that AFC supported) to Idaho spending roughly $5, 000.   Based on DeVos’ track record and past practices, school choice supporters anticipate a mix of federal and state funds will go toward vouchers that can be used on a variety of schools, including completely private schools, religious schools or even home schooling.
