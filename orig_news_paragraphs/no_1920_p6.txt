Although contractors at the Austin technical support call center earn as little as $14. 50 an hour, equivalent to about $30, 000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical   contract is up. Experienced call center employees earn around $45, 000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers.
