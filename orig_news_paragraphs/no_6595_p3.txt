We continue to support our Somali and regional partners to systematically dismantle this al Qaeda affiliate, and help them to achieve stability and security throughout the region as part of the global counterterrorism effort," the statement said. In March, President Trump designated some parts of Somalia as "areas of active hostilities," which allowed the U. S. to strike   without having to meet the conditions of "near certainty" of no civilian deaths and an existent direct threat to Americans. The change would allow the U. S. military authority to conduct offensive strikes and raids against   terrorists instead of waiting for them to attack local forces with whom U. S. forces may be embedded.
