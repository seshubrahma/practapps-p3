By Mr. Kurzman’s count, 123 people have been killed in the United States by Muslim terrorists since the 2001 attacks  —   out of a total of more than 230, 000 killings, by gang members, drug dealers, angry spouses, white supremacists, psychopaths, drunks and people of every description. So the order addresses, at most, 870th of the problem of lethal violence in America. If the toll of Sept. 11 is included, jihadists still account for just over 1 percent of killings. "
