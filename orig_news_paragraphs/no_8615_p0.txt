Marco Rubio ( ) the man who is emerging as the   establishment and   candidate for president in 2016. [According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Luther Stan Pate IV —  an Alabama real estate developer worth millions —  has donated thousands of dollars to Rubio’s electoral efforts.   On Jan. 29, 2015, Pate donated $5, 200 to Rubio —  who, at the time, hadn’t yet officially launched a presidential campaign but was acting as if he were running for president.
