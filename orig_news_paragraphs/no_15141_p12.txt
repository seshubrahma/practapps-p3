In recent days, North Koreans have been seen practicing choreographed dance routines in brightly colored national dress.   Before the event, foreign journalists invited into the country to report on the occasion were entertained by children at the Childrenâ€™s Cultural Palace on the outskirts of Pyongyang. An enormous amount of work goes into preparing for April 15. Joseph Bermudez, an analyst for North Korean monitoring group 38 North, said preparations could even be seen on satellite images, which showed thousands of people and hundreds of vehicles practicing ahead of the event.
