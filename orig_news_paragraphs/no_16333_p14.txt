When asked about differences between himself and Trump, Pence told reporters Thursday that although they may have different styles, they have "the exact same goals, the exact same vision. "    "I’ve seen my role as simply amplifying the points that Donald Trump is making," Pence said, adding that the two talk almost every day.   Pence also said there’s time for Trump and Ryan to grow closer in the upcoming months.
