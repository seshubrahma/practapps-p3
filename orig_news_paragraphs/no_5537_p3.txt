While in Iraq the United States has fought alongside   Iraqi government forces and Shi’ite militias against Islamic State, in Syria Washington has lined up against Assad’s   government and wants to block a further expansion of Iranian influence, with its regional allies, points out Reuters. " The stakes are high as Iran seeks to secure its influence from Tehran to Beirut in a ‘Shi’ite crescent’ of Iranian influence through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, where Sunni Arab states have lost out in power struggles with Iran," it adds. Reuters learned from the Badr militia, linked to the U. S.  PMU, that its advance to the Syrian border would benefit the Assad forces.
