Not so fast. And not without an apology first   —   from all of you, from every single journalist who covered up Obama’s abuses, from every   "good government" champion who looked the other way, from every pundit that   the IRS scandal or excused Hillary’s email server or said nothing when "stimulus" cash went to Obama’s cronies and political allies. I’m talking about people like Norm Eisen, who left Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) to become Obama’s ethics czar.
