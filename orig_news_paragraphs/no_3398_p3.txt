Netanyahu on Saturday night left for a three day trip to China and, according to the Times of Israel, the fact that he was not accompanied by Horowitz underscores the importance of settlement negotiations with the U. S. In a joint press briefing last month, Trump told Netanyahu to "hold back" on settlements. However, in a departure from traditional U. S. diplomacy in the region, Greenblatt  met with settler leaders last week, including Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan and Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy for the Council of Jewish Communities of Judea and Samaria in the West Bank.
