According to the court: In the INA of 1952, Congress delegated some of its power to the President through Section 212( f) which provides: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. In response, the court argues that: "Section 1182( f) [of the law] requires that the President find that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States," adding: Section 1182( f) [of the law] requires that the President find that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. This section requres that the Presidentâ€™s findings support the conclusion that entry of all nationals from the six designated countries, all refugees, and refugees in excess of 50, 000 would be harmful to the national interest. There is no sufficient finding in EO2 that the entry of the excluded classes would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.
