the very same TV station KMVT did a piece aiming to put a good face on the local Muslim community. The TV segment and corresponding written piece titled "We do not agree with those people doing bad things" was an attempt to put a positive spin on the local Muslim community. The segment showed an   interview with now jailed Mohammed Hussein Ibraheim Eldai and quoted him as saying: "These bad people they do this stuff in the name of Islam, and Islam doesnâ€™t say it like that," said Mohammed Hussein Ibraheim Eldai.
