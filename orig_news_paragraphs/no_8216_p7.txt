Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement after the vote that, like Cotton, he blames Obama for his efforts to ensure that the resolution came up for a vote in the first place. Netanyahu said his hopes for Israel lie with the support of   Donald J. Trump. " Israel rejects this shameful   resolution at the U. N. and will not abide by its terms," the prime minister said.
