The foreign policy adviser also downplayed the significance of Australia’s growing ties to China in the region     engagement that has accelerated following the US withdrawal from the   Partnership trade pact. That dynamic was natural given China’s economic growth and Australia’s geographic proximity, the adviser explained, saying TPP and regional trade would be a topic of discussion during the vice president’s visit. China’s territorial claims in the contested South China Sea are another subject that Pence expects to discuss with Australian officials during the visit.
