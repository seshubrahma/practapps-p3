" I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other, but I’m certainly not going to be telling you," Trump said. Trump said he was flexible in reaction to foreign policy around the world, but criticized the Obama administration for declaring the use of chemical weapons as a red line in Syria and then backing down. He said that after the attacks his attitude toward Syria and President Bashar   "has changed," despite past statements urging the United States to stay out of Syria.
