" Based on the conversation we’ve had last night and today, I don’t think Austin and Travis County qualify as a sanctuary city," Adler said.   Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told reporters in a separate briefing Tuesday held before the ruling, the agency had not yet settled on a definition of sanctuary jurisdictions. He said it might not include some of the things DHS would like cities to do, like honor requests to hold people in jail extra time so that immigration agents can pick them up.
