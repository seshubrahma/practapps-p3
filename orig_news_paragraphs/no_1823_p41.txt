Walking into the park, we heard music and followed it to the festival grounds, a grassy area in the shadow of a temporary Martin Creed sculpture that reads "Understanding" in letters so red and intimidating that it seems more of an imperative than a suggestion. We sat on the grass, enjoying the festival as well as our food. The American music festival (which was free) was something we lucked upon. Some of Brooklynâ€™s other cultural offerings have a price, but are well worth it.
