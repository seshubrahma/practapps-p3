Though DeVos has continued with comments that Common Core is no longer an issue because of its elimination through ESSA, those who have studied the federal law and observed the secretary ’s choice of staffers say her comments are typical of the establishment GOP.

" "Betsy DeVos was confirmed and began assembling a team of staffers, most of whom represent pretty establishment Republican experience and positions," Joy Pullman, managing editor at The Federalist, also tells Breitbart News.
