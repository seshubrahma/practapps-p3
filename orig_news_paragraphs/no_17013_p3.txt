Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a respected moderate liberal and former prosecutor who is chief judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked Senate action on Garland, insisting that the open seat should be filled not by Obama but by whoever won this election    a line he drew within an hour of the announcement of Scaliaâ€™s death. Obama had nearly a year left in his White House term at that moment, and given the tenor of the presidential race most of the year, installing a liberal on the court seemed just a matter of timing. As late as Monday, there was even discussion among Senate Democrats and some Republicans over whether Garland would see a vote in the lame duck Senate before Hillary Clinton had a chance to nominate a more liberal justice.
