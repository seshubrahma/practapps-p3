The staff of the science office developed the White Houseâ€™s recommendations for regulation of commercial drones and driverless cars at the Transportation Department. Last year, the staff produced an   report that raised concerns about the threat that robots posed to employment and that advocated retraining Americans for   jobs. The staff also put on the annual White House science fair. In 2011, when lawmakers proposed an online piracy bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, internet architecture engineers on the team advised the president to veto the bill because of security and privacy issues it would create.
