Let me say this to my mishpacha: I believe if we can ever achieve peace in Israel, it is Trump who may be able to broker the deal. The attacks he has gotten for saying the term "Palestine" are unwarranted. Do any of you phony pundits and Cruz bots think for one second Trump isnâ€™t a friend to the Jewish people? I would need 2, 000 words to explain the strategy and subtlety of his words on this and what he was trying to set forward.
