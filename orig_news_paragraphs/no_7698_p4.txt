Free speech in the sports media is constantly neutered except in the instance where someone advocates for a liberal point of view. Since they announced that their   personnel were no longer permitted to touch anything resembling political commentary in a public fashion, people such as Stephen A. Smith and Bomani Jones have continued to note their aversion to someone such as Donald Trump and yet they’ve not suffered anything in the way of being sanctioned. There is no question that if you’re comparing the different sectors of media in this country it is within the sports media where there are more   liberal voices being heard to the complete exclusion of anyone being able or permitted to articulate and counter with a      argument. In the sports media, your political ideology and your societal stance is more than welcomed as long as you peddle a leftist mentality.
