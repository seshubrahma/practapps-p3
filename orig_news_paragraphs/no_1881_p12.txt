In a statement, Speaker Paul D. Ryan called Mr. Stivers "a talented leader. " Eliot A. Cohen, who wrote one of the "Never Trump" pieces this year that called Mr. Trump’s view of American power and influence in the world "wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle," said in an interview on Tuesday that a Trump transition aide had asked him for recommendations for the national security team. But when Mr. Cohen, a former national security official in George W. Bush’s administration, suggested the caveat that many foreign policy hands would enlist only if there were credible people leading national security agencies and departments, he said he received a vituperative email in response.
