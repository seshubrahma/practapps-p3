He was recaptured in January 2016 in his native Sinaloa state after a shootout that killed six of his people. Actor Sean Penn and Mexican actress Kate del Castillo had traveled to Mexico last October to interview Guzman for a story that appeared in Rolling Stone. Before the public knew about the interview, two U. S. law enforcement officials said the tracking of cell phones and electronic exchanges of people close to Guzman led to his recapture. Mexican authorities said they got Guzman partly because his representatives contacted filmmakers and actors about making a biopic of his life.
