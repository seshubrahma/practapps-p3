A scandal over communications between key Trump aides and Russian officials ahead of the President’s inauguration widened yet again on Friday as it emerged that Trump’s senior aide and    Jared Kushner had met with Russia’s ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak, at a time when the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia was under close scrutiny. On Wednesday evening it emerged that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had also met with Kislyak twice during the campaign period, even though he told Congress upon his confirmation that he did not communicate with any Russian officials. It is a case of deja vu for Trump    just two weeks earlier his top national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation with the same diplomat, Kislyak.
