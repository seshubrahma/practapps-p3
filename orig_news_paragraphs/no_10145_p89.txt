9:11 : Clinton says she won 100, 000 more votes and more delegates than Sanders. She says it is a marathon and says she is running an "inclusive campaign" [Tony Lee: Sanders, though, was the person who has hired top amnesty advocates and Black Lives Matter advocates to help him better reach out to minorities.] Clinton was asked that she may have thought she was the nominee but voters may have said "not so fast" last night.
