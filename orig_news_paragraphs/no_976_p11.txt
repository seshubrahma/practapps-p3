The federal investigation examined at least a dozen different circumstances, mostly in which donors to his 2013 campaign, his nonprofit or both sought action from the mayor, including several in which they had direct conversations with Mr. de Blasio. At least one, Gina Argento, the operator of a Brooklyn soundstage company that depends on City Hall for film permits and a generous contributor to both the mayor’s campaign and his nonprofit, said last year through her lawyer that she felt pressured to donate. Late in their inquiry, federal prosecutors obtained grants of immunity for three of the mayor’s donors who they believed had received some special treatment from the mayor, several people with knowledge of the matter said. The United States attorney’s office, which until Saturday was headed by Preet Bharara, announced its decision in a brief statement (Mr. Bharara was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration and replaced by his deputy, Joon H. Kim) the Manhattan district attorney’s office, headed by Cyrus R. Vance Jr. disclosed its findings in a   letter to the state Board of Elections official whose Jan. 4, 2016, referral prompted Mr. Vance’s inquiry.
