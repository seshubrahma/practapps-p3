Hollywood crashed out apocalyptic superhero movies that burned into our consciousness the idea that the world is on fire    when it is actually safer than ever    and that only a strong man can put out the flames. Hollywood has also promoted cynicism, spinning a line in perpetual irony that encourages us to take everything as a cruel joke. For years, movies and shows like "Family Guy" have been encouraging us to laugh at pain and, yes, sometimes disability. Trump is the logical extension of this culture.
