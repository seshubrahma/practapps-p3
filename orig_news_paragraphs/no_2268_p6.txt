A professional runner’s sponsor is 99 percent of their income, as opposed to many other professional sports players that receive a team salary in addition to the money made through sponsorship and ensuing promotions of that brand. The brand that a professional track athlete wears is their backbone, their financial support, and many of these athletes are extremely grateful toward these companies for providing them with financial support as they compete in a sport with little prize money out there. The wearing of a brand is a give back from these athletes, who take pride in their sponsors, as a way to showcase these companies on such a major platform.   —
