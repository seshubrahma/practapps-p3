According to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the GOP electorate oppose Ryan’s vision for expanding immigration levels and instead want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced. Similarly, Trump ran against globalist trade policies, whereas Ryan supports the multinational trade policies backed by the Republican Party’s donor class. Ryan even worked as President Obama’s "partner" to fast track the   Partnership agreement. According to polling data from a recent POLITICO   survey, 85 percent of GOP voters disagree with Speaker Ryan’s vision on the issue of trade and believe that   "free trade" has lost the U. S. more jobs than it has created.
