Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign still lacks a sufficient number of supportive delegates to guarantee that any revolt at the Republican National Convention could be put down, a key committee delegate says. RNC Committeeman from Georgia and Rules Committee delegate Randy Evans, a lawyer who also works with the RNC and the Trump campaign, estimates that Trump has the support locked up of 888 delegates to Cleveland this month in the event of an effort to unbind delegates, leaving them free to vote for any candidate. That’s far short of the 1, 237    a simple majority of total delegates    that will be necessary to pass rules for the convention, leaving open the door for efforts to block Trump’s nomination to continue.
