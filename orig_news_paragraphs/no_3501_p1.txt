Police say the vehicle carried on down Borough Market where it came to a stop and three attackers then disembarked from the vehicle. They began stabbing members of the public with knives in pubs and restaurants in the popular dining area, some fatally. Within eight minutes of first calls being made, at 22:16, the three attackers were shot dead by armed officers outside of the Wheatsheaf Pub. The Metropolitan has confirmed seven fatalities, in addition to the three terrorists, and 48 injured individuals being treated in five hospitals across the city.
