Earlier in the day, Comey announced that despite "evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information," including evidence that Clinton and her team were "extremely careless," he would not recommend that Clinton be prosecuted because, he said, the FBI had not uncovered sufficient evidence of intent to convince a reasonable prosecutor to pursue the charges. While arguing for "transparency," and laying out a convincing case against Clinton, Comey did not say exactly how he had arrived at a conclusion that Clinton’s intent had ben insufficient to rise to the criminal standard. No information was given about what Clinton and her subordinates had told the FBI. Republican rival Donald Trump, who reacted to the FBI’s announcement by reiterating that the system is "rigged," earlier raised questions about Clinton’s use of Air Force One for campaign travel, and who will pay for it.
