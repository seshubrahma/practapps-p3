Let’s not even start talking about all the crap that Hollywood produces that sets the jihadis off like a cheap cellphone detonator. Also, it seems like poor form for these protesters to be whining about "extreme vetting" inside actual airports, where every single day more than a million actual   Americans endure humiliating, obnoxious and insulting "extreme vetting" at the hands of   bureaucrats with serious police complexes. We remove our shoes, our belts, our hairpieces and the lint from our pockets and then stand prone with our arms aloft in an   tube that penetrates the deepest of our fat rolls. And the small town I am from wasn’t even a terrorist breeding ground!
