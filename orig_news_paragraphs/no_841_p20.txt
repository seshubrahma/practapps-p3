The federal government would pay different amounts for different categories of beneficiaries, including children, older Americans and people with disabilities. The bill would also repeal subsidies that the government provides under the Affordable Care Act to help   people pay deductibles and other    costs for insurance purchased through the public marketplaces. Eliminating these subsidies would cause turmoil in insurance markets, insurers and consumer advocates say. However, the House Republicans would provide states with $100 billion over nine years, which states could use to help people pay for health care and insurance.
