Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat, and Jason Chaffetz, Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee,   a letter to the Office of Government Ethics Thursday, asking the government agency to investigate Conway’s comments. Because Trump is the ultimate authority on reprimanding Conway, the letter said, "we request that you use authority Congress granted to you. ..to ’recommend to [Trump] the appropriate disciplinary action be brought against" Conway. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday that Conway was "counseled" on the comment, but declined to elaborate on what that meant.
