the Company’s values and the unyielding respect it has for the members of our Nation’s Armed Forces.   Regardless of whether the comments in the tweet were intended to cause the hurt and anger that they ultimately generated, they were unacceptable to us, and the individual who issued the tweet is no longer affiliated with Liberty.   Liberty’s culture places a high value on the men and women of America’s military who fight to defend us and our families. We honor them.
