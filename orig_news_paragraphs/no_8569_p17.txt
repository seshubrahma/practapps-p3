A vote for Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, would be a vote to repackage and rename the TPP, and ram it through to congressional passage, all the exact same approach we have seen for the last several decades since the rise of the Bushes in the GOP and the Clintons in the Democratic Party. The voters of the United States of America have Paul Nehlen to thank for this stark choice in November. It would never have gotten to this point with the sitting Speaker of the House —  who obviously stands with Obama and Clinton on this trade deal —  coming out against the TPP to win reelection without a challenge from Nehlen.
