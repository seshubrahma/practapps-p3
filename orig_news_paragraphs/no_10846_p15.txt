And now, according to a report from the Tampa Bay Times, Rubio told reporters on Jan. 7 that he will not reveal his position on the very trade deal he endorsed and voted to   until May 18th —  two months after Super Tuesday. Rubio’s refusal to openly discuss how he will vote on the trade deal has been enabled, in part, by the fact that Rubio has not been asked a single question in any of the GOP debates about his longstanding support for the   Partnership agreement. This, of course, includes the first Fox News debate. Neither Megyn Kelly nor any of her fellow Fox moderators asked Rubio a single question about his support for the   Partnership agreement, which both he and the network’s founder have endorsed.
