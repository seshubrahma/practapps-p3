"  Clinton made her remarks during a town hall with YouTube creators and commented specifically on the Supreme Court’s deadlocked decision on President Barack Obama’s executive amnesty for parents of childhood illegal immigrants. "Let me say that I think it’s heartbreaking what the Supreme Court decided which created so much uncertainty and fear in the minds and hearts of millions of people," she said. Clinton reminded the audience that the Supreme Court decision only applied to Obama’s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans plan and not the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. She encouraged the   DREAMers (illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children) to enroll in the program.
