In 2014, the Department of Homeland Security expanded DACA and added DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) making as many as four million more people eligible to stay here and work if they met certain requirements, including having no criminal record. There’s a    view of these orders, which you’ve expressed in the past: The government chooses how to enforce laws, and whom to deport, all the time. It’s called prosecutorial discretion. Obama’s orders merely formalized one form of that, allowing millions of people to breathe easier and to plan, while allowing the government to retain the power to make    determinations and exceptions.
