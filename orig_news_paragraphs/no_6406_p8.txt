The most recent Real Clear Politics average of polls on the generic Congressional ballot question, which does not include that Quinnipiac University poll, gives the Democrats a 6. 1 percent advantage for April 2017, which is actually slightly less than the six percent advantage they held in a January   2017 poll conducted by PPP.
