Numbering about 3. 3 million, American Muslims make up just 1% of the US population, according to the Pew Research Center. That figure is projected to double by 2050, surpassing many other religious minorities, including Jews, Hindus and Sikhs. Though cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles host sizable Muslim communities, the population is spread all across the country. American Muslims are also quite diverse, with 38% of them white, 28% black, 28% Asian and 4% Latino.
