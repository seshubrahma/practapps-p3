Such an interpretation largely strips "Streetcar" of its poetry. And there were certainly moments when I missed that poetry. But I was also willing to trade the delicate lyricism of Mr. Williams and Blanche for genuinely original insights into a play Iâ€™ve seen many times. In particular, you become conscious of a prescient feminist streak in "Streetcar," a piercing awareness of a society that values its women according to youth and attractiveness.
