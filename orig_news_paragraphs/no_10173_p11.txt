Those taxpayer subsidies to employees are transferred back into businesses when the migrants buy food, lodging, transport and other products and services.    The migrants also prevent an   shortage of labor, dubbed a "tight labor market," which generally forces up the wages paid to workers. The last time U. S. workers gained wage increases from a tight labor market was in the late 1990s when the Internet grew the economy faster than the supply of young Americans, plus legal and illegal immigrants.   The publicâ€™s opposition to cheap labor immigration is usually ignored or dismissed by GOP politicians, including Bush and Cantor.
