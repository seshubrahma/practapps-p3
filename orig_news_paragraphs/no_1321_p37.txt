you haven’t suffered an injury. Maybe you feel injured, but the injury isn’t "individualized" because it’s shared by others, it doesn’t count for standing. With a bunch of exceptions not relevant here, citizens can’t sue the government for doing things they do n’t like, or not doing the things they want to see done
