—    Analysts at the Homeland Security Department ’s intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven   countries included in President Donald Trump’s travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States. A draft document obtained by The Associated Press concludes that citizenship is an "unlikely indicator" of terrorism threats to the United States and that few people from the countries Trump listed in his travel ban have carried out attacks or been involved in   activities in the U. S. since Syria’s civil war started in 2011.
