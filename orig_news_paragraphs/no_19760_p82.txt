Elsewhere on McGinty’s desk were guides to the science of crowd control, an encyclopedia of airport operations, even a pamphlet or two on extremist groups, including how to recognize and interpret White Nationalist tattoos we had discussed   missiles, Hezbollah, and disgruntled cargo employees. To protect LAX, you had to know about all of this —  from riots to lone wolf terrorists, car bombs to incoming dignitaries. I was beginning to get a feel for how the true extent of LAX might have seemed overwhelming to McGinty and Sosa —   this entire world, stretching far beyond its perimeter fence, its true international boundaries unreachable by foot patrols or CCTV.
