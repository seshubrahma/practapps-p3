And then, as now, the attacks of the media only made that peaceful majority more determined. In another parallel to the campaign against Gamergate by the establishment press, Salon published an article on Wednesday titled "Donald Trump’s supporters are so fanatical that now they’re sending threats to other conservatives," regurgitating the same    talking points that The Daily Beast relied on to attack Breitbart News. Readers may be reminded of the torrent of nearly identical articles lambasting gamers in the early days of Gamergate to establish a narrative of gamers inciting harassment among the establishment media that is used as a club to bludgeon supporters to this day. As The Daily Beast helpfully points out, Breitbart has more than 17 million readers.
