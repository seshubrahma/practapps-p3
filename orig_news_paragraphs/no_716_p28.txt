Scholars have long predicted that social media might alter how we choose cultural products. In 2006, Duncan Watts, a researcher at Microsoft who studies social networks, and two colleagues published a study arguing that social signals create a kind of "inequality" in how we choose media. The researchers demonstrated this with an online market for music downloads. Half of the people who arrived at Mr. Wattsâ€™s   site were shown just the titles and band name of each song.
