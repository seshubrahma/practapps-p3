Mr. Key was prime minister during the 2011 earthquake in the city of Christchurch that killed 185 people. During his tenure, Mr. Key pushed for New Zealand to adopt a new flag, saying the old one symbolized a bygone colonial era. But voters chose to keep the old flag in a nationwide referendum. Mr. Key successfully negotiated the first visit of a United States warship to New Zealand in 30 years.
