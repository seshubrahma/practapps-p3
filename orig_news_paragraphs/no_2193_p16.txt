I am disturbed by the willingness of so many people to demonize a young man in the court of public opinion. A man who was quite drunk and with impaired judgment. People do many stupid things when they are drunk, sometimes with serious consequences. If Brock Turner had been driving the victim in a car, and gotten into an accident resulting in the victim breaking several bones and bleeding profusely, nobody would consider calling him a violent person, even if the victim had been too drunk to stay out of the car.
