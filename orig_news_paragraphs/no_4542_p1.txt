Tuesday on NBC’s "Today," former first daughter Chelsea Clinton explained her new outspokenness, particularly on social media in the months after her mother Hillary Clinton’s loss to Donald Trump for the White House.   Clinton, who was promoting her book "She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World," told   Savannah Guthrie she found a voice during the campaign and thought it was necessary "not to stay silent now" given the political climate.
