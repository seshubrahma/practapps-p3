This year has set new benchmarks for accusations about tainted elections. In Maine, Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, this month certified state elections, in which Mrs. Clinton won, but refused to call the vote count accurate. (Maine’s secretary of state says no voter fraud was detected.) In North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory, also a Republican, charged that   fraud in more than half the state’s 100 counties contributed to his   defeat by the state attorney general, Roy Cooper.
