Those encounters were deemed unsafe and unprofessional because of how close the Russian planes flew to the American destroyer, a senior defense official said at the time. Moscow denied that its aircraft had made any unsafe moves. Russian aircraft have also been spotted recently flying near the coastline of US allies, including Japan, which has scrambled fighter jets four times this month in response, according to a statement from the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The Viktor Leonov, a Russian spy ship, has also been spotted near the US coastline twice in recent months.
