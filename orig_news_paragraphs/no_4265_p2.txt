Benedict XVI is a man who put the truth first. How can someone so blatantly contradict what he said and then solemnly reaffirmed?" In statements earlier this week, Archbishop Negri claimed that the Obama administration may have been complicit in the "tremendous pressures" that led the former pope to resign in 2013. It is "no coincidence" that some Catholic groups "have asked President Trump to open a commission of inquiry to investigate whether the administration of Barack Obama exerted pressure on Benedict," Negri said in an interview Monday, citing revelations by Wikileaks regarding efforts by the Democratic Party to influence the Catholic Church in the United States.
