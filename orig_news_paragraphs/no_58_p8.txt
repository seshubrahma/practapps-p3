On Twitter,   Donald J. Trump said that he was "monitoring the terrible situation in Florida" and that he had spoken to Gov. Rick Scott. Hours after the attack, a picture began to emerge of Mr. Santiago as a man who had served his country, but who had experienced trouble and failure. Mr. Santiago was discharged in August from the Alaska Army National Guard for "unsatisfactory performance," according to Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, the spokeswoman for the Alaska Guard. In September, Mr. Santiago became a father when his son was born, according to an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, a resident of Union City, N. J. who spoke on Friday to the newspaper The Record.
