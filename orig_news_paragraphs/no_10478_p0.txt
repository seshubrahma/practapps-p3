On this weeks broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," host Chris Wallace repeatedly pressed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to apologize for an incident involving former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields at a Jupiter, FL campaign event on March 6.   Lewandowski said, "I’ve never spoken to Ms. Fields. I turned over my phone records to the Palm Beach County District Attorney’s office, it clearly shows I called her phone number that evening, when I got back and read about this on the Twitter feed. I’d be happy to have a conversation with her.
