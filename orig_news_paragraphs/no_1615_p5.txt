" Last week, Mr. Trump hired as his campaign chief Stephen K. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart, a conservative news website that has frequently given voice to Mr. Trump’s claims of a manipulated process, holding forth on perceived voter fraud and "propaganda polls" showing Mrs. Clinton ahead. And on Friday, Mr. Trump released his first campaign ad, focused on immigration, featuring an image of a polling site with the word "rigged" flashing onscreen less than two seconds after the spot begins. Election law officials have expressed concern that Mr. Trump’s incendiary words will create a   prophecy, all but ensuring claims of fraud from his poll watchers and a delegitimization of the election results should Mrs. Clinton win.
