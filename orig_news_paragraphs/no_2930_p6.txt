Mr. Duterte, who has been criticized by the State Department for waging a bloody and ruthless antidrug campaign that has killed about 2, 000 people in the Philippines, has called President Obama a "son of a whore" and, in September, said he "can go to hell. " The remarks prompted Mr. Obama to cancel a planned meeting with Mr. Duterte in Laos at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Mr. Trump has business and government connections in the Philippines, where he has partnered with a real estate company controlled by Jose E. B. Antonio, named in October as Mr. Duterteâ€™s special envoy to the United States, on a $150 million office tower in Manila.
