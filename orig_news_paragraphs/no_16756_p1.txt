On almost every other channel, Donald Trump was reminding us that Chicago has had "thousands" of shootings this year. This month, the city passed the grim milestone of 500 homicides in 2016. Trump made me cringe    and not in the way he makes many Americans cringe. As a defender of Chicago, I cringed because heâ€™s right, and I wondered what the estimated 80 million viewers must think about the city I love.
