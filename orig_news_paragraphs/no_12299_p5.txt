De Niro, who endorsed Clinton in April, has taken repeated aim at both Trump and his celebrity supporters in recent months. In an outtake from a voter registration PSA he appeared in last month, the Raging Bull star called the Republican candidate a "dog," a "pig," a "bullsh*t artist" and a "mutt who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. " " He’s an embarrassment to this country," De Niro said of Trump.
