In Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Trump has chosen for the Office of Management and Budget a spending   to join an economic team that could be ideologically in conflict, setting up possible collisions during major   next year. The team includes at Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner turned hedge fund manager who has spoken favorably of infrastructure spending that Mr. Mulvaney has opposed a commerce secretary nominee, Wilbur Ross, known for the billions of dollars he has earned through international investing and a National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, who as president of Goldman Sachs has channeled tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to Democrats as well as Republicans. Mr. Mulvaney, who did not respond to emails seeking comment, has cut an influential swath among House conservatives since he was elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, when he defeated a longtime representative, John Spratt, a Democrat. He won by characterizing his opponent as a   liberal, unconcerned about fiscal prudence, even though as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt was among his partyâ€™s leading deficit hawks.
