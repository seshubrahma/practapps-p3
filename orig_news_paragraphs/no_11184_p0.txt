President Barack Obama has dismissed three separate attempts by the media to get the president to criticize   Donald Trump’s decision to appoint Stephen K. Bannon to a top White House post. [One reporter questioned Obama about Bannon’s appointment during the president’s press conference on Monday in the White House briefing room, before his trip to Greece.   The reporter asked: What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by   Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I’m talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the     movement, what many call the white nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist and senior advisor.
