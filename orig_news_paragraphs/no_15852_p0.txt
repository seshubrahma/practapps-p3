Washington (CNN) Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union" that she does not understand why President Donald Trump has refused to give a "straight yes or no" answer to questions about whether he secretly recorded his discussions with FBI Director James Comey. The Maine Republican added that if any audio recordings do exist, she expected Trump to provide them to federal investigators looking into Russia ’s efforts to influence the 2016 election, saying if he did not, he should be legally compelled to do so.
