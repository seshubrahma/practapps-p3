The Terry family met with   candidate Donald Trump several times during the campaign. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas, the Terry family expressed hope that President Trump would get to the answers their family has been searching for over the past six years. " I want people to grow a conscious and come clean as to what transpired, what was covered up and what the hell were they thinking," Terryâ€™s sister, Kelly   told Breitbart Texas.
