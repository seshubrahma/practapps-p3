Mr. Ryan  —   who during the campaign called Mr. Trump’s attacks on a judge of Mexican heritage "the textbook definition of a racist comment "  —   has scarcely said a cross word about him since the election. (He did allow on Thursday that he had "seen no evidence" to support Mr. Trump’s claim that President Barack Obama had wiretapped him.) The president’s assessment of Mr. Ryan has vacillated at least as much.
