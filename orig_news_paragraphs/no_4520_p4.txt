The Apprentice  —   became a flashpoint for both protesters and Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign. Less than a week before Election Day, a homeless woman guarding Trump’s star from   vandals was harassed and assaulted by a group of   protesters. The star had also previously been defaced with graffiti and swastikas. The day after Trump won the election, his fans gathered around the Hollywood star to celebrate his historic victory over Hillary Clinton.
