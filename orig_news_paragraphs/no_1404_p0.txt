Donald J. Trump, who said last week that a judge’s Mexican heritage should disqualify him from a lawsuit against Mr. Trump, expressed doubt on Sunday that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case, comments that are unlikely to ease concerns among his fellow Republicans who fear his controversial remarks could hurt the party in November. Mr. Trump’s comments, made in an interview with John Dickerson, the host of CBS’s "Face the Nation," followed his criticism of Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, a federal judge in California overseeing a suit against the defunct Trump University. Mr. Trump said Judge Curiel had a "conflict of interest" in the case because of Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico. Republicans, concerned about how his contentious statements could harm their ability to retain control of the Senate and have a detrimental effect in   races, have struggled with how to distance themselves from Mr. Trump’s language without alienating his   voters.
