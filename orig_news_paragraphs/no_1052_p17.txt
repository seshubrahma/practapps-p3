Some of the earliest American targets of bomb threats were schools, centers and museums in Alaska, Florida and New York that were affiliated with   an Orthodox Jewish movement, according to a Chabad official. The movement did not publicize the threats, which received little or no news coverage. Mr. Gleicher said he had met in early March in Washington with James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, who asked about efforts to find the person making the threatening calls, and made it clear that he had "great interest in getting this thing done. "
