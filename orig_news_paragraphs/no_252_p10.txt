Dr. Choulika said the inspiration for the October gathering was a dinner more than two centuries earlier, by   Parmentier, a French scientist who was enthralled with potatoes brought to Europe from South America. But many Europeans scorned the potato. France even outlawed the growing of potatoes in 1748. Largely because of Parmentierâ€™s work, potatoes were declared to be safely edible in 1772, and the ban was lifted.
