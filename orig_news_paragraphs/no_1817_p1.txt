In late January or early February, its strip malls and   main drag can feel like the center of the political world, as the news media descends and the voters decide whom they will rocket to the center of the presidential race with their     primary. It has also become part of a more predictable biennial battle: The tug of war between Representative Frank C. Guinta, a Republican, and former Representative Carol   a Democrat, over the congressional seat that one of them has held for a decade. Watching them debate is "like seeing an old married couple rehash the same argument year after year after year," said Andy Smith, the director of the Survey Center at the University of New Hampshire.
