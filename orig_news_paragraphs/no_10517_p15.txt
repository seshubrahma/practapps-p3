Early success enabled Ben and Jerry to rent space in a spool and bobbin mill to package the ice cream for sale to local mom and pops in addition to grocery stores and restaurants. In 1984, the company created a   public stock in order to raise money for a new plant. The company went on to name ice creams after instrumental American music figures, such as "Cherry Garcia," which was named after Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia, along with "Phish Food," named for the band Phish from Maine. In 2000, Ben and Jerry sold to the company   company Unilever for $326 million.
