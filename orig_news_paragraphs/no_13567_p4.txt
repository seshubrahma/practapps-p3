Dunkin’ Donuts announced Thursday that the number of new locations that would open this year in the U. S. were set to be on the low end of the   range. " What is driving franchisees towards the lower end is several factors, and I’ve described it, put it together as uncertainty, as uncertainty over the general election, Senate, obviously, the House, and local elections," Travis said. Travis added that the franchisees with whom he spoke were worried about the uncertainty of the election because of its effects on regulation and whether or not there will be a raise in the minimum wage.
