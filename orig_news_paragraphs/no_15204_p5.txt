While outrageous comments from the President and members of his administration are all too common, I expect the top law enforcement officer to remember that all federal judges are confirmed by the US Senate, and to understand the independent role of the judiciary.   Watson was indeed unanimously confirmed by the Senate    including by Sessions, then a senator. Sadly, we can expect more of this outrageous rhetoric from the Trump administration. But it cannot be the accepted norm.
