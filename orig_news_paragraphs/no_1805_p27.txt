When Barack Obama was a summer associate at her Chicago law firm, they met because she was his mentor. After his successful campaign for the U. S. Senate, I noticed that she chose not to go to Washington. Instead, he commuted to their home and two daughters in Chicago where Michelle had a big job as head of community affairs for a hospital. But she really entered my imagination once she became first lady, a tall, strong, elegant and seriously smart woman who happened to live in the White House.
