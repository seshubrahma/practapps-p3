Broad City’ (Comedy Central) Leave it to Ilana on "Broad City" to accidentally wear a dog hoodie to work   —   and to "solve" that by simply coloring in her exposed midriff with a red marker to match the hoodie. Also leave it to her to sing while sitting on the toilet, accompanying herself with an egg shaker. Abbi’s rabid competitive spirit at a work outing makes for a good   for the episode, but the crowning moment of the episode (and maybe the season) comes from Ilana’s   celebrating her firing.
