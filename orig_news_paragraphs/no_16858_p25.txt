The presidential race is over," said a second GOP strategist working a key Senate race. Three GOP sources familiar with conversations at the highest level of the party leadership said House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would prefer Trump step aside, even though they understand the mess and confusion that would cause because early voting is under way, state ballots are mostly printed and deadlines for getting off the ballot have passed in most states.

John Thune of South Dakota, a McConnell leadership deputy, did say Trump should step aside, and the GOP sources pointed to that as evidence of leadership thinking.
