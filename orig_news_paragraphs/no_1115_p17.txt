—    an allegation dismissed not only by senior law enforcement officials, like the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, but also by the heads of the Senate and House investigations, including Mr. Nunes. Another obstacle to bipartisanship came on Monday, with the revelation that Mr. Nunes had viewed what he characterized as "dozens" of reports containing classified information on the grounds of the White House. Democrats fumed, their suspicions fueled by speculation that the source of Mr. Nunes’s information was a Trump administration official and that Mr. Nunes may have even coordinated with the White House.
