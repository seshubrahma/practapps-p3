A majority of voters back the Republican party on the issues of the economy, jobs, and taxes. Voters also prefer Republicans handling foreign affairs. The Democrat party does better addressing health care, fighting for the middle class and, by a very slim plurality, addressing the cares of voters. Votersâ€™ views on these issues largely flip, however, if the candidates are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
