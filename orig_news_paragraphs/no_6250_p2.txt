—   as reported repeatedly by the Times   —   that the last administration conducted surveillance on the Trump campaign, whose results were disseminated and leaked. If that is a "conspiracy theory," then the Times must retract its own reporting that the Obama administration gave the National Security Agency new powers to share intelligence information before removing privacy protections (Jan. 12) that "American law enforcement and intelligence agencies" intercepted "communications and financial transactions" of Trump "associates" (Jan. 19) that the same agencies intercepted "repeated contacts" between the Trump campaign and Russian officials (without finding any evidence of collusion in the election) (Feb. 14) and that the outgoing Obama administration "rushed" to disseminate the evidence it had gathered on Trump’s Russia ties throughout other government agencies, ostensibly to "preserve" it from destruction (Mar. 1).   All of that is a scandal on its own, even if it transpires that Trump’s "phones" were not tapped. The Times reported on Sunday night that FBI director James Comey is asking the Department of Justice to deny publicly "that President Barack Obama ordered the tapping of Mr. Trump’s phones," as if that amounts to a refutation of the entire scandal.
