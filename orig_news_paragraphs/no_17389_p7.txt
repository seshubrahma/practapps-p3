Past generations of executives more regularly consulted with (and lived among) those different and rivalrous stakeholders who prioritized any number of considerations over profit maximization. Those employee and community stakeholders are now relatively marginalized, and the executives more socioeconomically cloistered. These dynamics leave corporate leaders ill situated to run highly pluralistic government agencies    where career civil servants and the public writ large exercise considerable influence    let alone take account of the interests, needs, and lived experiences of working Americans.    Government too has changed.
