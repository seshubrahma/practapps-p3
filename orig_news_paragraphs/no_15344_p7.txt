What’s more, there’s data suggesting many of those   voters were less concerned about losing the things for which Democrats have been fighting and more about making sure those unlike them don’t receive "too much."   The question remains: What should Democrats do about it? As a party, they should redouble their efforts to help those in the lower economic and middle classes, even when it goes underappreciated, and should do so without instituting purity tests against Wall Street. It’s natural for a party to undergo a painful, public kind of soul searching after a devastating loss, and changing nothing makes little sense.
