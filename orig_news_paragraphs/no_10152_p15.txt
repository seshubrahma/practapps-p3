This simple fact goes a long way to explaining why gun control is a political loser. The obsessive focus by both political parties on future and potential voters has the inevitable consequence of ignoring an awful lot of current voters. Mitt Romney might very well have been elected President but for the apparent disappearance of millions of white,   voters. In Ohio, the share of Hispanics voting actually fell between 2008 and 2012, but the   vote grew by almost 40 percent, while the White vote fell by 5 percent.
