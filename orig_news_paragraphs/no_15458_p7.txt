My experience as a member of the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate and the impeachment of Richard Nixon suggests the next steps that need to be taken, and "moving on" is not one of them.   First, Comeyâ€™s firing means we now need a special   counsel. No president should be above the law.   No president should control a criminal investigation of his own conduct.
