Throughout his career, Trump has expressed his faith in   talents    especially his own    and the extreme loyalty of family. As President, he is acting true to form as he makes his daughter Ivanka an official White House employee    with security clearances and a West Wing office    and heaps responsibilities on his    Jared Kushner.
