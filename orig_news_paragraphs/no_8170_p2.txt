Not so Monday night in Iowa. The support for Bernie Sanders is based on his socialist ideology, not his sparkling personality or good looks. Cranky, white and old, Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist and tied Hillary Clinton and her     political machine by preaching explicitly socialist policies. Sander’s success wasn’t a case of "New York values" or West Coast kooks.
