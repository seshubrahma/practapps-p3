Cleveland (CNN) The team that was in charge of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s convention delegate strategy is now actively lobbying to change the primary rules for 2020 as a reaction to Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 process. Former Cruz delegate chief Ken Cuccinelli and his organization, Trusted Leadership PAC, are working to convince the convention Rules Committee that starts here on Thursday to consider proposals that would close primaries to only Republican voters and decentralize the control over the primary process away from the Republican National Committee, Cuccinelli’s spokeswoman Mallory Rascher said. Cruz is not publicly a part of the effort, and his campaign office confirmed he is not getting involved.
