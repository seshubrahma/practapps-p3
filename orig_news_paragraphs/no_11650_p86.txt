Dozens of outraged Donald Trump supporters are protesting the state’s Republican Party Saturday, accusing party leaders of attempting to tamp down on support for the GOP presidential   as they move to finalize Tennessee’s delegation to the national convention. The protest comes one day after the Trump campaign accused the party of trying to "steal" delegates, even after he handily won the state’s primary last month. On Saturday, Trump’s backers flocked to the party’s executive committee meeting in Nashville, doubling down on the allegations that officials are trying to stack the Tennessee’s delegation with members likely to vote for another candidate if given the chance.
