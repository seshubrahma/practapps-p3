Democratic Nominee Hillary Clinton has remained silent after a second night of riots in Charlotte, North Carolina caused major damage in the city. [Protesters angry about the killing of a black man, Keith Lamont Scott, by an   police officer terrorized the streets Wednesday night, beating citizens, looting, vandalizing, blocking interstate traffic and setting fires.   But Clintonâ€™s campaign has been silent, as she remains at her home in Chappaqua, New York preparing for her first debate with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Trump was the first candidate to weigh in, voicing his reaction in an interview on Fox and Friends Thursday morning calling for law and order, leadership, and unity.
