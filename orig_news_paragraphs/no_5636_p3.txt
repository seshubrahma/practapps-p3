twitter.    —   Department of State (@StateDept) June 6, 2017,   The U. S. has had a tense relationship with the Council since Trump took office, particularly over the Council’s   bias and its membership, which includes countries with poor human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Cuba. The U. S. has mulled leaving the Council for months and boycotted its opening session in March due to the   agenda.
