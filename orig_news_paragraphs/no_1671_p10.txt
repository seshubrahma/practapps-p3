In a CNN interview Thursday, Mr. Pence seconded Mr. Trump’s contention that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a stronger leader than President Obama. " I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country," Mr. Pence said. Mr. Pence did, however, break with Mr. Trump in saying he believes Mr. Obama was born in the United States.
