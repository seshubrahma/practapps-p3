Megan Twohey and Michael Barbaro of the New York Times write that two women  —   Jessica Leeds of New York and Rachel Crooks of Ohio   —   approached the Times alleging that Donald Trump came on to them with unwanted kissing and touching.   This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous.
