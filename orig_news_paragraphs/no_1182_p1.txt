It was 2:40 p. m. on Monday, a lull before the evening rush hour in Russiaâ€™s   city, St. Petersburg, where the subway normally carries two million people a day. The train had just entered a tunnel between stations, on its way out of a sprawling downtown hub, when the bomb exploded. The homemade device, filled with shrapnel, tore through the third car. It killed 11 people wounded more than 40, including children and spread bloody mayhem as the train limped into the Technology Institute station with smoke filling the air.
