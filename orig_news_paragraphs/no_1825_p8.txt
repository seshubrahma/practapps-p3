In Wisconsin on Sunday, Mr. Kaine hailed the historic nature of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s candidacy and urged confident Democrats not to take victory for granted. " If it had been easy for there to be a woman president of the United States, there would have been a woman president of the United States," he said. The Clinton campaign also booked national airtime during football games on Sunday night to run a pair of commercials featuring men who said they could not vote for Mr. Trump because of his treatment of women.
