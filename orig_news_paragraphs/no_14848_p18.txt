New York punk band Told Slant shared the language on Twitter and threatened to boycott the event, along with other bands. Organizers eliminated the language, which previously stated that the festival could "notify the appropriate U. S. immigration authorities" if they "or their representatives have acted in ways that adversely affect the viability of their official SXSW showcase."   " Iâ€™m happy that sxsw agreed to make changes to their contract so that it no longer threatens deportation as a means of controlling artists," Felix of Told Slant tweeted.
