The main purpose, as one well familiar with the case explained to me in DC, was merely to put the frighteners on the chosen target of this campaign, ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil had been carefully selected as the Green Blobâ€™s shakedown victim because it seemed to fulfil all the necessary criteria. It was a huge oil company with masses of money to squander (its annual revenue is around $270 billion) on environmental pay outs and, under its CEO Rex Tillerson, it had a track record of corporate cowardice (withdrawing funding from   think tanks failing to speak up for fossil fuels   to greens) which meant that it was considered highly likely not to contest any court action but instead to settle. The legal case against ExxonMobil would be based on the one used so successfully against Big Tobacco.
