His name remained on the ballots but all of the Republican electors voted for the new   nominee, Nicholas Murray Butler, who had been chosen in late October by the national Republican committee. On the Democratic side, the death of Horace Greeley in 1872 came after the election but before the Electoral College cast its votes. In that case, most electors voted for other presidential and   candidates. Congress rejected the votes by Democratic electors that went to Mr. Greeley, who had lost to Ulysses S. Grant.
