Carson says liberal policies have destroyed   families and have been detrimental. He says Republicans should be interested in finding ways to heal those families. He mentions that 73% of   babies are born out of wedlock, which means the baby is four times as likely to grow up in poverty while education will most likely end for the single mother. Carson says we should support those mothers not get   the cycle of poverty by providing child care and encouraging them to get GEDs and continue their education.
