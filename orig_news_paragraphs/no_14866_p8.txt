Chaffetz asked William Callahan, the acting director, to provide documents and video related to the incident and to brief the committee on Monday at 5 p. m. ET. A Secret Service source tells CNN that Tran was observed looming around Pennsylvania Avenue as early as 6 p. m. almost six hours before he was arrested on the White House grounds. Video surveillance footage shows Tran, the accused jumper, first jumping a fence in the Northwest corner of the Treasury Building, immediately adjacent to the White House.
