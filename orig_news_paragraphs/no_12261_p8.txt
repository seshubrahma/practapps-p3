That sympathy for employers’ demand for cheap labor is part of Ryan’s   libertarian worldview. For decades, he’s and other GOP leaders have believed that companies should be able to hire foreign workers when they’re not pleased with supply of American workers. This "any willing worker" view would condemn Americans and their grandchildren to an economy where salaries can’t rise above the poverty wages that are acceptable to the next African or Asian willing to fly into the country. Ryan also justifies his support for migration by saying migrants are needed to fund retirement for a growing number of retired Americans: Boomers are retiring, we’re going to need medical professions.
