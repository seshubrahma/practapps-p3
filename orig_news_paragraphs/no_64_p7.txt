Describing the article as "an attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand Turkey," Ms. Kaplan said that Turks have good reason to be suspicious of the United States. She pointed out that Fethullah Gulen, the cleric and former Erdogan ally who many Turks believe was behind the coup attempt, lives in Pennsylvania, and that a former C. I. A. official had once vouched for Mr. Gulen on his green card application. In addition, she called attention to something else: The United States has provided military support to a Syrian Kurdish militia fighting Islamic State extremists, a militia that Turkey considers an ally of the P. K. K. the outlawed Kurdish separatist organization regarded as a terrorist enemy. In her Friday column, headlined "Why Turkey is looking forward to Trump administration," she added, "do they really need such details if their only wish is to represent the Turkish people as paranoid and Erdogan as a villain?"
