Relations between North Korea and the US and South Korea have deteriorated in recent months, as the rhetoric and military posturing on both sides has increased. There have been occasions in the past when political tensions have reached crisis point    most recently in April 2013     but Trumpâ€™s firm rhetoric on North Korea in recent weeks is unusual for a US leader. Fears have also mounted in recent weeks that North Korea could soon conduct a sixth nuclear test or another missile launch.   On Monday, US President Donald Trump said the status quo with   North Korea was unacceptable, calling for new sanctions on the country.
