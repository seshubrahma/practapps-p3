—   dutty✨ (@BlaiseAmb) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 7:10 P. M. ET, Fallon is dodging yet again when asked if he is "comfortable" with having the DNC staffers involved in this latest email scandal aboard the Clinton campaign, but did say there is "no excuse" for what they did. Again, it remains to be seen if there will be any real accountability for this since Wasserman Schultz has been promoted into the Clinton campaign in a senior position and others involved at the DNC have not faced any consequences. They include vice chair Donna Brazile, who will take over as a   chair, and people like Brad Marshall and Amy Dacey —  who plotted attacking Sanders for being Jewish.
