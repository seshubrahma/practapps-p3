China has waged a steady campaign to take trade secrets and intellectual properties from American companies both through traditional espionage and cyberespionage. The Justice Department has gone after Chinese individuals on both accounts, charging five Chinese military officials in 2014 for hacking American companies and stealing intellectual property, a case that took years to build, and have charged other individuals with infiltrating companies as employees to steal information for China. In 2012, former National Security Agency director and Cyber Command chief Keith Alexander called Chinese hacking "the greatest transfer of wealth in history," a line that has often been repeated by top officials. President Barack Obama himself has called out this behavior, pressing Chinese President Xi Jinping in    talks in 2013 in California on the topic of cybersecurity and continuing the pressure today.
