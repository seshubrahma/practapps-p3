The rule, which was drafted without the input of   states, has been written so broadly as to potentially designate half of all U. S. coal reserves   to mining. And where the coal industry has already shed 68, 000 jobs in recent years, a fully realized SPR could potentially cost another 78, 000 jobs. The Obama Administrationâ€™s hostility to coal also extends to the recent moratorium on federal coal leases. Under the guise of seeking a more equitable leasing program, the administration launched a review of the federal coal program that generated revenues of $1 billion for American taxpayers in 2014 while also producing 40 percent of the total   electricity in the United States.
