The UN and the United States call for an immediate investigation of Syrian activistsâ€™ claims that the   government used chemical weapons in an attack on civilians on August 21.    activist groups in Syria say more than 1, 300 people were killed in the attack outside Damascus, many of them women and children. Video footage and witness reports appear to bolster claims that chemical weapons were used.
