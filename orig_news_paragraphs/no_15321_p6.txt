The White House originally referred questions about the program to representatives for first lady Melania Trump, who declined to comment. In their comment, the White House did not say whether "Let Girls Learn" would be maintained in the future as a standalone program     and they also did not directly address the memo or why it had been sent. In the agency memo, Crowley indicated that aspects of the initiativeâ€™s programming focusing on girls education around the world would continue, a sentiment reinforced in a statement from a Peace Corps spokesman on Monday.
