An Arizona   for Mr. Trump on Saturday will be held at the former home of Senator Barry Goldwater, the conservative firebrand and Republican nominee in 1964 who is often blamed for exacerbating racial tensions. In Texas, where Mr. Trump will hold   over two days, campaign aides had sought to hold events in two cities, Irving and Grand Prairie. But they were rejected by local officials, who told The Dallas Morning News that they had been approached only a few days ahead of time and cited concerns about security. They eventually found a location in Dallas for a Thursday rally.
