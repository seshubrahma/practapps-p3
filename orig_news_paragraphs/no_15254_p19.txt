Presidents in his time took office in March rather than on January 20 as they do now.   Between election and inauguration, Roosevelt had 17 weeks to assemble his team, prepare his legislative agenda and build support in his party and beyond.   He was ready to govern from day one.    Since then, the Constitution has been changed so a new president has only 11 weeks or so before inauguration    and the appointment and approval process for the top posts in an administration has become a nightmare.
