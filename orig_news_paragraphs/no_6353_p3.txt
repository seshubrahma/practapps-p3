Breitbart Texas reported back in September 2016 how African migrants, specifically from   terror hotbed Somalia were being helped across Mexico via special permits that allow them to continue to the U. S. unimpeded. When African migrants are detained by Mexican officials, they are given a   pass, which allows them to freely move throughout the country, eventually into the United States.
