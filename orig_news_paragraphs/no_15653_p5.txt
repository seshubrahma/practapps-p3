Grisham, the first lady’s communications director, would not comment as to whether the first couple would raise their son in the Catholic faith, nor did she answer a request for specifics about Melania Trump’s religious habits, including whether she regularly attends Mass.    However, this week’s news of Mrs. Trump’s Catholicism means she is the first Catholic first lady in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy. " When the Kennedys visited Pope John XXIII in 1962, more than 15, 000 people cheered Jackie when she entered Vatican City," says Kate Andersen Brower, an historian and author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies.
