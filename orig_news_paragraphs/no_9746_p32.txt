A press conference is a scheduled event where the press is given the opportunity to prepare and ask questions. Clintonâ€™s impromptu gaggle was not announced in advance and was limited to just the press traveling with her on her campaign airplane. Clinton fielded just seven questions in her attempt to quell the "hiding Hillary" speculation before excusing herself during a coughing fit. She returned later to answer five more questions.
