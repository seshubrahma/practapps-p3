After weeks of reports of severe exhaustion and ensuing hospitalization, Kanye West walked into Trump Tower on Tuesday morning. Journalists who caught a glimpse of the musician entering the tightly guarded building in Manhattan took to Twitter to document the strange spectacle. Mr. West’s appearance occurred shortly before former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was named as   Donald J. Trump’s pick to lead the Energy Department   —   the same agency that Mr. Perry said during the 2012 presidential race that he wanted to abolish.
