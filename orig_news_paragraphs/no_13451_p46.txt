Fox News contributor Karl Rove argued on Wednesday evening that the inaccurate information, sent to Cruz supporters at caucuses throughout Iowa, could have caused rival Donald Trump to lose by switching thousands of votes from Carson to Cruz. Trump, who came second to Cruz in Iowa, tweeted on Wednesday morning that Cruz had won by "fraud" and called for the Iowa caucuses to be held again. This was sent out from Ted   as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud pic.
