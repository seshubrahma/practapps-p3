On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton plans to embark on a   bus tour through the state largely focused on   economic issues. Recent polls have shown that Mrs. Clinton has gained an advantage on Mr. Trump when voters are asked who will best handle the economy. Ever since the Democratic nominating fight, Mrs. Clinton has called out specific corporate players for criticism, trying to demonstrate to voters how she would approach corporate misbehavior as president. The same day Mrs. Clinton fought to present herself as a champion of   Rust Belt voters, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the Clinton familyâ€™s finances.
