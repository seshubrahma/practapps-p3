People chanted "single payer," "tell the truth," "shame" and "people will die" and asked Walberg questions promoted by the left, including questions about President Donald Trump’s tax returns and whether Walberg supports calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Trump’s alleged ties to the Russians and the firing of James Comey as FBI director. Walberg attempted to answer all of the questions posed, even after it became clear that, as Walberg put it, "community organizers" had infiltrated the town hall.

Tim Walberg’s town hall meeting in Jackson was a hot mess. "
