Last week, actress Elena Verdugo passed away at age 92   Many remember Verdugo for her role, from 1969 to 1976, as Consuelo Lopez on ABC’s "Marcus Welby, M. D. " It’s hard to believe that, at the time, Elena’s supporting role was the most visible and recognizable Latina character ever on seen American TV.   It would take 28 more years before another actress, Eva Longoria, would have that distinction, as Gabrielle Solis on ABC’s "Desperate Housewives"    although actresses Sonia Manzano, Rita Moreno, Lynda Carter, Constance Marie and Jessica Alba also had prominent TV roles during that time.
