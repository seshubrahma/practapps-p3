Texas is Sen. Ted Cruz’s ( )    state. He is leading by nearly 10 points in the RealClearPolitics average of the polls and a victory in his home state will give him his second primary victory and an even stronger argument that he —  and not a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) —  is the best   alternative. But a Cruz victory in Texas may not be the worst thing for Trump because it will make it much tougher for GOP elites to force Cruz out of the race. For Rubio, it will be critical that he finishes the night in second place in the delegate count so he can put forth a more credible argument about why he is the best   alternative for Republicans going into the    contests on March 15.
