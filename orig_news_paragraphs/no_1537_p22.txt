At a panel event on Tuesday, Ms. Clinton took aim at Ms. Trump, with whom she had become friends in recent years, in response to a question about Mr. Trump’s policies. Ms. Clinton reminded the crowd that some of Ms. Trump’s paeans to women’s economic issues in her convention speech last week bore little resemblance to anything Mr. Trump had said on the campaign trail. " There are no policies on any of those fronts that you just mentioned on his website," she said, imagining a conversation with Ms. Trump.
