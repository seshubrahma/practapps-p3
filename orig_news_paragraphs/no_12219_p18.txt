Trump must do this while simultaneously shattering the Left’s and Muslim Brotherhood’s favorite propaganda lie: that standing up to Islamic Supremacism and telling the truth about its inspirations is somehow instigating hatred of all Muslim people. This is a pernicious ploy based on a faulty conflation of Islam with Muslims. It must be made categorically clear that we are dealing with an ideology we are not hating all the people who fall under its grasp. There are millions of people who go under the label "Muslim" but who may not agree with, or follow, all Islamic mandates, or who may want to reform them, or who may not even know anything about them
