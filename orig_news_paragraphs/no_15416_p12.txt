Removing the person charged with overseeing an investigation into a foreign country attempting to influence US elections by hurting one candidate (Clinton) and helping another (Trump) sends a chilling message up and down the federal bureaucracy    not to mention the populace.

It looks    to anyone paying attention    like Trump got rid of someone who he did n’t think would come to a conclusion he liked regarding Russia.
