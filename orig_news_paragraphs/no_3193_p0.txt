President Donald Trump should expand the economy by welcoming illegal immigrant consumers, rather than by boosting Americans’ wages and productivity, says a growing chorus of establishment voices on Wall Street, the federal government, and industry. ["There are millions of [illegal] immigrants living in this country   …     [who] are not going out and shopping," because of Trump’s enforcement policies, said Robert Kaplan, the head of the Federal Reserve of Dallas, and a voting member of the Federal Reserve which regulates the economy by adjusting interest rates.   " They are staying home," Kaplan complained during a May 31 presentation at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
