But a recent summit meeting in Japan between Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and Mr. Abe ended with little progress. Perhaps an even bigger disappointment for Mr. Abe is Mr. Trump’s vow to pull the United States out of the   Partnership, on which both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama spent considerable political capital. For Mr. Abe, it was in part an excuse to push for changes in Japan’s agricultural industry, as well as an opportunity to gain   access for Japanese manufacturers to export markets in the United States and elsewhere. Now his only hope is to try to persuade Mr. Trump to resuscitate the deal.
