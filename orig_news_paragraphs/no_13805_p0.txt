Washington (CNN)   Donald Trump plans to repeal a raft of President Barack Obama’s executive actions in his first day in office, Trump’s incoming White House press secretary said Sunday.   Members of the transition team are meeting this week to discuss what actions the incoming president will undertake on day one, a source told CNN Monday.   Sean Spicer, Trump’s incoming White House press secretary, said on ABC’s "This Week" that Trump will immediately "repeal a lot of the regulations and actions that have been taken by this administration over the last eight years that have hampered both economic growth and job creation."
