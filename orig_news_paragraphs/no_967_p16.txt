Cutting scientific research in E. P. A. and NASA and NOAA and other science agencies is not going to help us have more information on the causes and, more important, the effects of climate change," said Vicki Arroyo, the executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center and a former E. P. A. official. The budget also calls for eliminating some programs that help bridge the divide between basic research and commercialization. Among the most prominent of these is the Advanced Research Projects Agency  â€”   Energy, known as   the Energy Department office that funds research in innovative energy technologies with a goal of getting products to market. Its annual appropriation of about $300 million would be eliminated.
