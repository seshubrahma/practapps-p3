 (CNN) President Donald Trump’s job approval rating has dropped to 37% while 58% of Americans disapprove of his performance so far as president, new Gallup figures show. The approval ratings, Trump’s worst since taking office two months ago, come as FBI Director James Comey is expected to tell lawmakers that there is no evidence for the President’s unverified claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the election. Trump’s approval rating hovered in the    40s in the weeks following the beginning of his presidency.
