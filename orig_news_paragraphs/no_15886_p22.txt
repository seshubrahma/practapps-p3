It is this belief that has motivated us as chairmen of the Congressional Civility Caucus.     You may not find two members of Congress who disagree more on issues. We represent neighboring districts in Kansas and Missouri as Republicans and Democrats, but if you ask our constituents at home about the nature of our relationship, youâ€™ll hear that we are great friends.     We often spend our periods of district work doing joint events, promoting the idea of civility and bipartisanship.
