Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had some tough words for Russia on Thursday on the matter of Syrian chemical weapons. [Speaking from President Trump’s    estate in Florida, where Trump is meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Tillerson referenced Russia’s 2013 agreement to oversee the destruction of Syria’s chemical arsenal and said Russia has "clearly failed in its responsibility" to eliminate those weapons.   " Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver," he said.
