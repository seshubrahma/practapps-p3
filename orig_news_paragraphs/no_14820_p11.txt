The campaign’s funding of the event also gives Trump more leeway in what he says on the stump, keeping him out of legal trouble if he delves into talk of his reelection bid or urges supporters to endorse or oppose any candidate for political office. When Trump sweeps into the Nashville Auditorium on Wednesday night, it will mark the second official campaign rally of his presidency, after one in Melbourne, Florida, last month, and the second time he’s bucked past precedent by doing so at such an early stage of his term, according to officials from the last three administrations. President Barack Obama didn’t file   papers until April 2011 and President George W. Bush until May 2003    both of which were in the third years of their presidency. Both held rallies during their presidencies to drum up support for their legislative agendas, but those events were run by the White House outside the campaign season.
