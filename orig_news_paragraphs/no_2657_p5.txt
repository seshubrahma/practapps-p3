The trial, which began last Monday, has been no kinder to the governor: Prosecutors waited exactly zero days before asserting, during opening statements, that Mr. Christie knew three of his aides and allies were involved in the plot as it was unfolding. Neither governor is accused of breaking the law. But for two men who once prided themselves on managing    administrations, claiming to have been blind to alleged acts of petty revenge and bribery at the highest levels of state government seems bad enough. As they campaigned for the governorâ€™s office, each promised to cut through what they called partisan nonsense, bureaucratic inertia and dodgy dealing to get real results for residents in their states.
