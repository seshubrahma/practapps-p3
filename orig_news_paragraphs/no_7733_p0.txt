Reports surfaced on Thursday afternoon that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice president (VP). ["As Trump narrowed in on his choice of Pence, the two men spent time at both Trump’s golf resort in New Jersey in early July and at the Indiana governor’s mansion this week," Roll Call notes, citing an anonymous Republican source for the report.   The New York Times and CBS have also reported the pick is Pence. However, the Trump campaign is denying this is true.
