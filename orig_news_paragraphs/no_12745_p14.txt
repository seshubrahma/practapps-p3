When the Tea Party held its first major rally in 2010 in Washington, D. C. Pence was the only member of leadership from either the House or Senate to speak. He denounced an    federal government and Barack Obamaâ€™s imperial presidency, and the Tea Party crowd loved it. On taxes, in Congress Pence called for abolishing the current income tax system in favor of a flat tax, under which all Americans would receive a standard deduction and additional credit or exemption for children, and beyond that all Americans would pay the same percentage in taxes. As governor, Pence has cut taxes repeatedly, passing the largest tax cut in Indiana history.
