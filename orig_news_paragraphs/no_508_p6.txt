That means Mr. Sessions’s confirmation vote should come later this week, at which point the Senate will start the process over with the nomination of Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be secretary of health and human services, followed by a vote on the nomination of Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary. Of course, just because Democrats may not have the votes to block Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees does not mean they will go quietly. Having stacked up as many parliamentary roadblocks as they could find last week, Democrats are expected to take advantage of the mandatory debate time, probably to air their concerns about Mr. Trump’s picks as well as grievances against their Republican counterparts, who they believe have stymied a thorough examination of some nominees. That could be bad news for senators with plans on Saturday: Republican leaders may keep the Senate in session over the weekend to get the job done.
