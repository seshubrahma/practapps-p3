" Early Monday morning, Mr. Trump announced that he intended to nominate Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to be the secretary of housing and urban development. In that post, Mr. Carson, who enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump’s candidacy after dropping his own, will oversee the federal agency that fights urban blight, provides rental assistance and helps homeowners battle foreclosures. If he is confirmed, Mr. Carson will embrace a starkly different approach to those problems, compared with housing secretaries during Mr. Obama’s tenure.
