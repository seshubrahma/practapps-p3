I tried Rubio, who has undergone more public agony than perhaps anyone about Trump. Rubio looks nauseated whenever someone asks him about the man he called "the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency" but who later said he would be "honored" to speak for at the Republican convention before clarifying that if he did speak, he would only "speak about things I believe in, not somebody else’s platform. " Rubio also holds the astonishing position of saying he’ll vote for someone he has previously declared unfit to hold the American nuclear codes.
