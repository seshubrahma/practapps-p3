This group has grown rapidly in recent years, and now makes up about   of registered voters   —   about the same share of the electorate as white evangelicals. Religiously unaffiliated voters back Mrs. Clinton by 68 percent to 26 percent, but their support is softer than evangelicals’ support for Mr. Trump. The poll found that 36 percent of white evangelicals said they strongly supported Mr. Trump, while in June 2012, just 26 percent said they strongly supported Mr. Romney.
