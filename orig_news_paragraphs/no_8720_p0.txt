Donald Trump’s victory in the Presidential race is comparable to the "  elections" of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, Nigel Farage has said. [In an interview with Fox News’s Neil Cavuto on Saturday the interim leader of UKIP said that Brexit was the "first brick out of the wall," but that Trump’s "dramatic victory" was the next brick to fall.   " It was the first real kickback against the liberal establishment that has dominated, with its friends in big business and big banks, the world for the past couple of decades," Farage said.
