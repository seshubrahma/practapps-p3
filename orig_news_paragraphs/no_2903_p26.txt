Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was back in the headlines over the 2013 Bridgegate scandal. Newly filed court papers said one of the governor ’s aides texted another that Mr. Christie had "flat out lied" when he denied that any senior member of his staff knew about a plan to snarl traffic heading to the George Washington Bridge. Prosecutors say the backups were meant to punish a local mayor for declining to endorse Mr. Christie’s   bid.
