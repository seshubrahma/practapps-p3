China called the US description of the incident "inconsistent with the facts."   The Chinese defense ministry said their aircraft’s operations were "professional and safe" and were in accordance with military law and regulations. The country’s ministry also urged US officials to "take concrete measures to correct its mistakes" and "avoid similar incidents." "Recently, the US military has dispatched multiple ships and aircraft to conduct operations in waters and airspace facing China, infringing upon our sovereignty and endangering the lives of front line personnel from both sides," the ministry said in a statement.
