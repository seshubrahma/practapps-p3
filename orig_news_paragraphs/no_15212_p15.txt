That makes good sense    planned military operations remain classified for a reason, and the element of surprise is a real advantage against our enemies. But that is a very different matter from explaining, after the fact, why we have taken the most serious step a country can take: using deadly force. A failure to explain our actions cannot be divorced from an evaluation of the wisdom of those actions themselves.   How we talk about our use of violence and distinguish it from othersâ€™ illegitimate use is, itself, an essential part of good strategy, wise foreign policy and effective counterterrorism.
