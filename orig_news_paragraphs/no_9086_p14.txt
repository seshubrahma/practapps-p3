Trump, in both this debate and previous experiences, has talked about how making donations to politicians in both parties, especially the heavy hitters in top positions, was necessary to protect his business interests. Cruz later challenged that idea by attacking the notion that some of Trump’s donations, particularly to Clinton’s earlier campaigns, had any tangible relationship to his business enterprises. It might also be said that Trump never quite gets around to denouncing the necessity of such donations, or explaining how he’ll end the perpetual Olympics of freestyle   while Cruz wants to make it a centerpiece of his campaign. To put it bluntly, there is no way to end government corruption without dramatically reducing its size and power, especially the kind of centralized power that can only be influenced by huge buckets of bipartisan palm grease.
