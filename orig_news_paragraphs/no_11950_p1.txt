—   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 3, 2016,   "Burning a black church is a political act"  —   Vox, Vox Media, the same news outlet which has officially banned employees from "mansplaining," falsely labelled popular Trump supporters as   and whose popular   commentator Ezra Klein was seen by the Clinton Campaign as an attack dog to "hold journalists accountable," pulled out all the stops in their attempt to make the Mississippi church arson attack seem like a racist crime from the right. " The message   on the burned bricks is drawing attention to a history of racist violence that has been amplified over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign," claimed Vox’s Victoria M. Massie in her piece.
