For Fortress, the motivation was to join with one of the world’s most innovative investors and to enter global markets, like the Middle East, where they have trailed some of their peers.

But shares of Fortress, like shares of other publicly traded private equity firms, have performed poorly in recent years. Fortress’s stock price is down 80 percent since it began trading, and its executives have made no secret that the joy of being a public company has largely evaporated.
