Companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Netflix have all publicly condemned the order, whilst promoting the impact of mass immigration on their businesses. Jeff Bezos was a prominent critic of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, assembling a team of 20 people at his newspaper the Washington Post to investigate every aspect of Trumpâ€™s past. Meanwhile, Trump attacked Bezos, saying that Amazon had a "huge antitrust problem" whilst "getting away with murder" on corporation tax. The editorial board of the Washington Post also called in 2016 for an influx of illegal immigrants to fill   jobs in America.
