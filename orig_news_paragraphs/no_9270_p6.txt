Trump does want to pull back from   abroad. He also wants to spread the financial cost of global security to U. S. allies, and insists Muslim nations in the Middle East must reciprocate America’s good intentions. That is not "isolationist" as much as it is an alternative to years of incoherence and appeasement. Combined with Trump’s focus on ending illegal immigration and on   free trade deals on more favorable terms, what "America first" means to Trump is a shift in American priorities without abandoning American leadership.
