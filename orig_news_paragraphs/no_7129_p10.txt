Federal agencies order up studies that focus on their concerns, so politics ends up guiding science according to its particular interests. " Government actions have corrupted science, which has been flooded by money to produce politically correct results," said Dr. William Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
