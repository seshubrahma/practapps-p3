In their first argument, the state’s lawyers rewrite the petitioners’ claim, suggesting they are grifters trying to create out of thin air a   right to an "automatic money judgment" when convictions are set aside. This is too clever by half. The petitioners aren’t seeking a payment as compensation for being convicted they just want their own money back.
