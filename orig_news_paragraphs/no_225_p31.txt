For his oath, Mr. Trump placed his hand on two Bibles held by his wife, one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and again by Mr. Obama in 2009 and 2013. Standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages, Donald Jr. Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany. Also there was Barron, his    son with the first lady. Joining them was Ivankaâ€™s husband, Jared Kushner, who will serve as an unpaid senior adviser.
