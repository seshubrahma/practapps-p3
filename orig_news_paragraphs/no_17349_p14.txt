Over cookies and muffins at Tops Diner in Newark on Wednesday, Burwell spoke with several individuals who said they would not be able to afford their current coverage if not for the Affordable Care Act. David Moyer, a    man from Westwood, New Jersey, says he is a big beneficiary of Obamacare. Prior to the law, he said, he and his wife paid around $500 a month for a plan that covered little and had a   deductible of over $10, 000. Now, he says, the couple pays less than $300 each month, doesnâ€™t have a   for their doctor, pays nothing for generic medicine and has a deductible of $1, 000 each.
