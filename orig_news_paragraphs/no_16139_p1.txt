But if the election were held today, 78% of white evangelical registered voters say they would vote for Trump, including about a third who "strongly" back his campaign. That number is higher than the 73% of white evangelicals who supported Romney at a similar point during the 2012 election. However, 55% of white evangelical voters say they are dissatisfied with the choice of presidential candidates, with 42% saying it will be difficult to choose between Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton because neither one would make a good president. Still, 93% of Republican and   white evangelical voters would choose Trump over Clinton if the election were held today.
