 (CNN) CNN rode the rails with former Vice President Joe Biden as he took the train from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, following President Donald Trumpâ€™s inauguration. Biden rode with his wife, Jill. This is the first time in eight years that Biden has taken the train with a ticket actually in his name. Usually he rides with a ticket without a name for security reasons.
