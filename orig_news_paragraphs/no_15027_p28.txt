Russia, Syriaâ€™s most powerful ally, made clear it would not support a resolution put forward by the United States, the UK and France condemning the use of chemical weapons within Syria and requiring the regime to provide flight logs from the day of the attack. Russia has used its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council at least seven times on Syrian resolutions. On Wednesday afternoon, Security Council members left closed consultations without taking a vote on the draft resolution. No member spoke as they left the chambers.
