The jobless rate for high school dropouts, which has been elevated throughout the recovery, fell more than a full percentage point to 6. 3 percent, suggesting that employers who had previously ignored these   workers are now taking a second look.

Increases in the minimum wage in many states recently, and increases in the   salaries by big employers like Walmart, Target and Aetna, are also beginning to ripple through the broader work force. But a   job market remains in place, with workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills.
