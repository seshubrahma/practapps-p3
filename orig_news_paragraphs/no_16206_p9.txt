Kasich sources said the vice presidential    began when Donald Trump Jr. reached out to Weaver, Kasich’s adviser, shortly after Kasich dropped out of the race in May. Weeks later Trump and Kasich spoke on the phone and afterward Weaver sent Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort Kasich’s "Two Paths" speech    a pretty clear signal Kasich had no interest, a Kasich source confirms. Another Kasich source says there were also separate instances of Trump allies reaching out to Kasich allies asking whether the Ohio governor might consider the VP slot. Manafort also described the vice presidency in a Trump administration as being similar to the COO of a company in an interview with the Huffington Post in May, a role that would appear consistent with the job being described by Kasich sources.
