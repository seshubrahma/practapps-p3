His comment in 2014 that ISIS was a "JV" team will haunt his legacy, and his frequent comment that ISIS is not an "existential threat to us"    though perhaps factually correct    plays into critiques that he has minimized the group’s reach. Critics argue that his decision to pull all U. S. troops out of Iraq and to sit on his hands as Syria imploded directly contributed to ISIS’ seizure of parts of the fractured nations to form its   caliphate. Republican Sen. John McCain on Thursday said Obama was "directly responsible" for the Orlando attack because of the withdrawal from Iraq, in remarks that quickly caused an uproar. The Arizona senator later partly walked back the comments, saying he had misspoken by implying the President was personally responsible for the attacks.
