Democrats are fiercely opposed to vouchers because giving parents the power to choose would break the Democrats’ monopoly, undermine the lock that teacher unions have on the public schools, and threaten the slush fund that the unions provide to the Democratic Party. At the same time, Democrats  —   the Obamas and Clintons prominent among them   —   send their own children to private schools where they know they will get a decent education. Republicans have long proposed voucher systems.
