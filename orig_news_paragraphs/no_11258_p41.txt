Tripp was brought to the Clinton administration from the George H. W. Bush White House, where she served as executive assistant to the deputy chief of staff to the president, a role that enabled her to become familiar with the inner workings of the West Wing. During the Clinton administration, she first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton’s Oval Office. After three months, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster asked Tripp to work for the White House Counsel’s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons in their infamous scandals. Last week, Breitbart News reported on the first part of Clinton’s interview on "Aaron Klein Investigative Radio," in which she discussed some of the most infamous scandals to rock the Bill Clinton White House.
