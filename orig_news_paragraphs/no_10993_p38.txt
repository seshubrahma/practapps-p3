New York   power broker Carl Paladino, who predicts a "war" if anything happens, is positioning himself as the bad cop, vowing to step into any contested convention situation with the full force of his political machine. Unruh’s "affirmation" rule change is unlikely to pass the Rules Committee, which houses Cruz supporters like Morton Blackwell who still don’t want to ruffle feathers and throw the convention into chaos. So the plot will live or die on whether the "conscience" vote is really able to be invoked, in defiance of state laws, on the first ballot. And, of course, how many delegates will actually do it?
