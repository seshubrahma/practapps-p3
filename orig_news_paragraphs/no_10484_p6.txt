Late in the week students from the mostly white Andrean High School hoisted signs featuring an oversized Trump head to heckle students from the majority Hispanic Bishop Noll Institute at the Gary Diocese Catholic Cup championship game in Merrillville, Indiana, a town about an hour southeast of Chicago. Andrean students also reportedly held up signs reading, "ESPN Deportes. " Authorities from the two Catholic schools hastened to note that fans from both teams were engaging in a back and forth over the game, with Andrean High School students chanting "Build a wall" as Bishop Noll students replied with "Youâ€™re a racist!"
