Andrew Jackson himself was a Southerner, but with the help of a wily Northern political strategist, Martin Van Buren, Old Hickory managed to pull together a   coalition, composed of Southern whites and Northern Catholics, that won the 1828 election in a landslide against John Quincy Adams.

And then, four years later, in 1832, Jackson won a second landslide victory.
