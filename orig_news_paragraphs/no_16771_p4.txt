Christian Flores, a    junior at Exeter Academy, is too young to vote, but came to Wednesday’s rally with the hopes of getting a photo with Sanders. Flores is a member of his school’s Democratic club, and credited Sanders for his new interest in politics.   " When Bernie started saying things that really appealed to my generation, that’s when I really started to get involved," said Flores, the son of immigrants from Ecuador.
