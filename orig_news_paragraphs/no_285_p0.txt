Justin Peck stops short of calling it a protest dance, but his newest ballet, "The Times Are Racing," is certainly of the moment. The dancers wear sneakers, and   and hoodies emblazoned with words like Unite, React, Act, Protest and Fight. (The costumes are by Humberto Leon for Opening Ceremony.) The electronic music is Dan Deaconâ€™s     suite from "America," a 2012 album written out of his frustration with the state of the country and the world.
