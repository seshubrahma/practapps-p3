Mr. Trump has attracted some generous individual supporters, according to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission through last week. The casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have donated $10 million to groups running advertising against Mrs. Clinton. Bernard Marcus, the   of Home Depot, has provided $7 million to a pair of   super PACs. A surprisingly small donor to Mr. Trump is Robert Mercer, a New York hedge fund executive.
