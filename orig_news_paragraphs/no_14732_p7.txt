The attorney general did not address a written question he had answered from Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, which asked explicitly: "Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day? " The question was presaged by a statement that some of Trumpâ€™s nominees or senior advisers had ties to Russia. Sessions replied "no," without any elaboration.
