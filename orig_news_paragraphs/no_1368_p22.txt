Calif. Ms. Peters, a movie producer, dated Mr. Redstone in the late 1990s and remained friends after he moved to the Beverly Park mansion in 2003. She said she had not seen the   tycoon in two years. Despite his position, Mr. Redstone was not a creature of the scene, she said. He avoided galas and opening nights, preferring intimate dinners at Dan Tanaâ€™s, the dimly lit,   Italian place on Santa Monica Boulevard with   booths, waiters in black bow ties and bartenders in red   jackets.
