Not mentioned in the Boeing announcement, but still a significant hurdle for both sides, is how the company would be paid for the aircraft. Under sanctions that are still in place against Iran, the country cannot use the American banking system, so transactions must be conducted overseas in currencies other than the dollar. Iran has one of the oldest commercial aircraft fleets in the world, a legacy of the prolonged estrangement with the United States that blocked the Iranians from refurbishing or replacing many of their   planes. American critics of Iran in Congress and elsewhere have repeatedly objected to Boeingâ€™s plans to sell new aircraft to Iran, arguing that at least some of the planes could be diverted for illicit military use.
