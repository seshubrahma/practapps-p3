How quickly do you want this to start, and what is the expectation for the time frame of the entire operation? Tough questions, but these are just a sample.   My experience has been that many civilian masters in government want to avoid answering them, so a good chairman of the Joint Chiefs or Combatant Commander    those four star generals and admirals who must execute the plans within their areas of operation    must continuously push for those answers. These senior officers must be ready and willing to provide information based on their pragmatic experiences and the judgment they have learned from the battlefield the President needs that kind of input before making such important decisions.
