Premier venture capitalist and Trump supporter Peter Thiel famously stated that Silicon Valleyâ€™s symbiotic business relationship with Washington D. C. earned it the nickname "Valley of the Democrats" in the 2012 presidential election, when 83 percent of Silicon Valley top tech firm employee donations went to Obama.    CrowdPac found the trend continued in 2016 presidential contest, with 95 percent of the $8. 1 million contributed by Silicon Valley tech employees going to Democrat Hillary Clinton. Silicon Valley captured a growing percentage of the $1. 24 trillion federal procurement budget during the Obama Administration, including half the $86. 4 billion information technology budget, and billions in secret "black"   budgets.
