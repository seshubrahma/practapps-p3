" CBO is going to come out and say a lot of people are not covered," Paul said. The bill backed by Ryan and the President, dubbed "the American Health Care Act," would repeal Obamacareâ€™s individual mandate requiring all people to have health care coverage, but it also would force people to pay a premium surcharge if they have a gap in coverage and then buy a policy on the individual market.   For this and other reasons, some analysts have said the bill would lead to a large drop in coverage.
