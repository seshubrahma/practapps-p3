All you have to do is take a   drive deep into Big Bend National Park, follow a scenic footpath to the edge of the Rio Grande and wave across the water to Adrian.   He’ll probably be waiting on the other side with a   boat and he’ll paddle over to pick you up for a few dollars.    Then you can climb on a donkey for the   ride to reach Boquillas.
