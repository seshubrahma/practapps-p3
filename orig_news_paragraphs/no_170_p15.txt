" General Repass said that while Mr. Zinke was his deputy commander for four months, he had named him acting commander for only about a week and a half, when the general traveled to the United States. General Repass said Mr. Zinke "did a good job" as his deputy and was "a competent guy," and he had nominated Mr. Zinke for one of two Bronze Stars he received. Admiral Pybus said that Mr. Zinke was "embarrassed and humbled" when he left SEAL Team 6 and "did quite well" as his deputy at a command using   SEAL units in Europe.
