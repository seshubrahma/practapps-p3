The intrusion was discovered by private investigators hired by the campaign, according to one of the law enforcement officials. The private investigators believe it is similar to the Democratic National Committee hack, but federal investigators are still working to determine the scope and nature of the intrusion, the official explained. The campaign intrusion is the latest in a series of Democratic party organizations who have had system breaches that are being investigated    including the DNC and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). The Justice Departmentâ€™s national security division, which was already investigating the DNC intrusion, is handling the investigation because of the believed similarities, one of the officials explained.
