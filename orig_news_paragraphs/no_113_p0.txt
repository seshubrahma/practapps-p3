WASHINGTON   —    Elaine L. Chao, a veteran cabinet secretary who has served under two Republican presidents, offered remarkably few specifics but many promises of cooperation on Wednesday as she cruised through her confirmation hearing to become transportation secretary. Democrats on the Senate committee charged with reviewing Ms. Chao’s nomination by   Donald J. Trump made it clear that they have no objections to her, suggesting that she will be easily confirmed in a full Senate vote.
