" Late Wednesday, Trump advisers had huddled at the White House to discuss options for responding to the chemical attack, including both military action and economic sanctions, according to a senior administration official. It was unclear how fast the president planned to decide and implement a response, according to the official, who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the sensitive planning. Tillerson has been in contact with his Russian counterparts, the official said, but Trump has not spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
