Recently, the firm shut down its flagship hedge fund. The purchase of Fortress, a prominent private equity firm with a specialty in investing in distressed assets, was driven by Rajeev Misra, a former top derivatives expert at Deutsche Bank who has taken a leading role in setting investment strategy for the SoftBank Vision Fund. After leaving Deutsche Bank in 2008, where he had worked closely with Anshu Jain, who headed the bank ’s global markets operations, Mr. Misra went to UBS and then spent several months at Fortress, where he came to know the firm’s chairmen, Mr. Briger and Mr. Edens, well.
