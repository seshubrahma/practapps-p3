Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue (R. .) cheered President Donald Trump’s new executive order on immigration Monday shortly after the president signed it at the White House. ["Since Day One, President Trump has kept his promise to protect our country and keep all Americans safe," said Perdue, the only Fortune 500 CEO serving in Congress. He went on:   Trump and his National Security Team have closely examined our vetting procedures for countries with ISIS strongholds and continue to take action to stop ISIS from exploiting our country’s immigration system and refugee programs.
