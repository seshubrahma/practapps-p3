Commentators, especially those on the left, rushed to invoke the "smoking gun tape" in explaining the Comey Memo Tuesday and Wednesday, a reference to the commonly used name for the   recording of a 1972 conversation between President Nixon and his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman. President Nixon’s own voice ordering Haldeman to have the CIA prevent the FBI from following up on areas of their Watergate investigation was the "smoking gun" of presidential obstruction of justice. Its release in the summer of 1974, more than two years after the sensational   at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in Washington, DC’s Watergate development, finally made defense of President Nixon untenable and led swiftly to his resignation. Convicted Nixon Attorney John Dean told CNN Tuesday that Comey’s Memo was a "direct parallel" to the smoking gun tape.
