The   communities of San Jose, Costa Mesa, Burlingame, Anaheim, as well Chicago, New Mexico, and Virginia have come out strong and taught racist and fascist Trump supporters about the painful consequences of openly supporting Trump and his political platform of bigotry. Our movement cannot allow his   supporters to grow in size and number. " Free speech" does not mean freedom to organize for racist terror, lynchings and genocide.
