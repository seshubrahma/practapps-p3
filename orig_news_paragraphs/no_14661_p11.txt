Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russiaâ€™s top spies and   in Washington, according to current and former senior US government officials.   Russian officials dispute this characterization. Sessions met with Kislyak twice, in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention, and in September in his office when Sessions was a member of the Senate Armed Services committee. Sessions was an early Trump backer and regular surrogate for him as a candidate.
