Ohio parent activist Heidi Huber observes to Breitbart News that Ross clearly "considers DeVosâ€™ work with Jeb Bush as a top qualification. " " Unfortunately, Mr. Ross must have missed news of the really low international performance of the first Common Core generation," Huber states, and continues: Per the recently released TIMSS and PISA reports, American students are losing ground against their international peers since the introduction of the Common Core standards. Just a small application of discernment by the Trump transition team should disqualify anyone involved in this education reform disaster, much less a known leader and financier, from serving in the "No Common Core" promised administration.
