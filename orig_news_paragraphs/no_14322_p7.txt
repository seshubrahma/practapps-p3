After a campaign in which Trump cast doubt on US alliances in Asia, his new defense secretary, James Mattis, used his first trip to the region to reassert conventional US security guarantees to Japan and South Korea. He also said he didn’t see any need for "dramatic military moves" in the South China Sea, contradicting earlier White House suggestions that Washington would move aggressively to counter Beijing’s territorial claims in the region. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, added to the uncertainty when she said last week sanctions would remain on Russia until it left Crimea. Her stance    in line with the previous administration’s policy    appeared to conflict with Trump’s desire to improve relations with Moscow.
