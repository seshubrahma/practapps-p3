Saft America is a unit of Saft Groupe, a French company with holdings around the world. Sales of   batteries have been considerably slower than anticipated, and the factory has yet to turn a profit. The French parent doesnâ€™t expect profitability for another two or three years and has already written down part of its investment on the factory. Here was a factory built, in part, with U. S. government dollars for the benefit of the local and national economy.
