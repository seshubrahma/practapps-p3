Along with asking the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to investigate whether Mr. Obama eavesdropped on Mr. Trump, Mr. Spicer called on the committees to investigate what he called a steady stream of national security leaks since Mr. Trump took office.

" I don’t think you would ever just blanketly say, ‘I’m going to accept any outcome,’" Mr. Spicer said.
