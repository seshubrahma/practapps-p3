Piątek alleged that these    media were "owned by  " and "perhaps even KGB collaborators linked to Gazprom" as well as "various   Polish outfits". He drew negative parallels between Matthew and his late father Leopold Tyrmand, considered a national treasure in Poland on account of his literary and   dissident work. Mr. Piątek went so far as to insinuate that Matthew’s supposed " " links were tantamount to a "mafia membership" suggesting his late father would have disapproved.   Mr. Skwirczynski comments: "Given Gazeta Wyborcza is without a doubt THE establishment newspaper in Poland, such reckless behaviour in running a highly emotional, badly or   unsubstantiated hit article is unacceptable in a free society where rule of law regarding infringement of personal rights proliferates".
