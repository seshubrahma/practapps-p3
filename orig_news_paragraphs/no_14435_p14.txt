Saman Ali, a    Yazidi, was eager to help when he heard about how Muhsin and Dilbireen needed an interpreter while they were in Boston for the boy ’s first round of surgeries. Ali graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a master’s degree in law in 2015. He drove seven or eight hours from State College, Pennsylvania, to Boston to help Muhsin and Dilbireen with translations, Becker said.
