While a significant percentage    44%    of white evangelical Republicans viewed Trump as "not too" or "not at all" religious in a January Pew poll, more than 6 in 10 believe Trump understands their needs "very" or "fairly" well. Only 24% believe this about Clinton.   Evangelical support for Trump over Clinton isnâ€™t limited to the socially conservative issues of abortion and marriage. Evangelicals overwhelmingly prefer Trump on issues related to gun policy, the economy, terrorism and immigration.
