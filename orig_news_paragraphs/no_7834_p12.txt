It’s highly ironic that now over a hundred of the protesters have been arrested, and not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America, nobody, not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008, who created schemes, financial schemes, that not only destroyed the economy, but took away the future of this generation," Moore told Goodman. Five years after the birth of Occupy Wall Street, Moore has continued to remain politically outspoken. During an appearance on HBO’s Real Time in July, the director predicted that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will win the White House over Democrat hopeful Hillary Clinton. On Friday, Moore suggested the media refuse to cover Trump for two weeks as a way to get back at the candidate for his   press conference on   "birther" controversy.
