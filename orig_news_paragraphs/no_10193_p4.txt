I personally feel that’s wildly insufficient. They should be calling for Lewandowski to be fired. If this had been Robby Mook [Hillary’s campaign manager] dragging Michelle Fields down to the ground, there’s no question they’d be calling for Lewandowski, or Robby Mook in this case, to be fired. It’s ridiculous.
