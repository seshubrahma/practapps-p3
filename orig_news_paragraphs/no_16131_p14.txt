House Republicans seek Clinton Foundation investigations, Hughes, a Democrat, asked Ryan a question about improving health care for returning veterans who may have   stress disorder and asked him what he would do to ensure guns did not get into the hands of people with mental disorders. Ryan said the House had just passed the first mental health legislation in a generation and said there was common ground between Republicans and Democrats on the issue. He also pledged that "we have got to clean up the VA" so that it could treat issues unique to veterans, including PTSD. Ryan deflected a question from audience member Steve Lonegan, a New Jersey Republican, who wants to incite a revolt to stop Trump from claiming the nomination.
