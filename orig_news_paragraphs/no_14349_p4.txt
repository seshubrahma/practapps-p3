South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford is taking the lead on the new legislation, taking input from Freedom Caucus members and others and putting them into legislative language. The group met Monday evening to go over the framework and is likely to endorse the measure. It will take some elements of a proposal already introduced by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has argued that both efforts    rolling back the law and creating a new system    need to happen simultaneously. Meadows stressed that the measure will protect coverage for those with   conditions and said another focus was "making sure costs go down."
