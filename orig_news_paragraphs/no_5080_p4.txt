The number of Syrian refugees admitted to the United States under the federal refugee resettlement program has declined for the fourth consecutive month," Breitbart News reported earlier this week. In February, the first full month of the Trump administration, 673 Syrian refugees were admitted into the country. In March, that number fell to 282. The decline continued into April, when 226 were admitted and the number admitted so far in May has declined further to 156.
