Spicer said Monday that Trump is open to working "with any country" when it comes to defeating ISIS. " I think if there’s a way that we can combat ISIS with any country, whether it’s Russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure we’ll take it," Spicer said. Trump campaigned on a platform that included defeating ISIS and regularly blamed former President Barack Obama and his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for the rise of the terrorist group.
