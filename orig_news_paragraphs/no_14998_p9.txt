China has repeatedly said that its influence over the North Korea has been overstated, and the US and South Korea should stop antagonizing North Korea with its annual military drills. Thousands of US and South Korea troops are currently engaged in the Foal Eagle joint annual drills that finish on April 30.   "On one hand, North Korea has violated UN Security Council resolutions banning its ballistic missile launches on the other hand, South Korea, the US    and now Japan    insist on conducting    military drills. Itâ€™s a vicious cycle that could spiral out of control    and such a scenario would benefit no one," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said during a press briefing on March 14.
