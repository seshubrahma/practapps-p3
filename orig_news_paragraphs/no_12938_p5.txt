As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the most recent case of a U. S. citizen being taken at gunpoint into Mexico took place less than three weeks ago.   In the border state of Coahuila, Breitbart Texas carried out a   investigation that revealed the Los Zetas drug cartel had systematically kidnapped, tortured, murdered and incinerated hundreds of innocent victims from rural communities. Some of those victims were U. S. citizens. While Los Zetas cartel members were murdering innocent victims and terrorizing the state, Coahuilaâ€™s Governor Humberto Moreira turned a blind eye and was arrested in Spain for having been a surrogate for the fearsome drug cartel.
