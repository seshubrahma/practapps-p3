When asked about where the site in the photo was, Mulvaney said he "didnâ€™t know where it (was) being built."  CNN has learned the site is in Sunland Park, which borders the small town of Juarez, Mexico. Mulvaney claimed the wall was going up because "the President wants to make this country safe."  Mulvaney and White House press secretary Sean Spicer both pointed out the   fence that they claimed was a part of the border barrier on the   border. However, workers and law enforcement tell CNN the fence is actually just a part of the construction site that was put up for safety purposes.
