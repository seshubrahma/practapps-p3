The Agriculture Department memo to employees was modeled after one written by Tom Vilsack, President Barack Obama’s agriculture secretary. " In order for the department to deliver unified, consistent messages, it’s important for the office of the secretary to be consulted on media inquiries and proposed responses to questions related to legislation, budgets,   policy issues and regulations," wrote Mr. Vilsack, a former Democratic governor of Iowa, in 2009. "  statements should not be made to the press without notifying or consulting with the office of the secretary. "
