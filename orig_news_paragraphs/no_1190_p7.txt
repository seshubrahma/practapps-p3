The scale and brazenness of the assault threatened to further subvert a nominal and often violated   that had taken hold in parts of the country since Mr. Assad â€™s forces retook the northern city of Aleppo in December with Russian help, emboldening the Syrian leader to think he could win the war. The attack also seemed likely to dampen peace talks that have been overseen by the United Nations in Geneva and by Russia and Turkey in Astana, Kazakhstan. Incredulous over the chemical assault, humanitarian groups demanded action from the United Nations Security Council, where partisan divides over who is to blame for the Syrian war have paralyzed its members almost since the conflict began in 2011.
