I received the call from the host of the website saying that we are receiving tremendous amount of hits and especially on certain pages of your website. I have a   small website and there is a risk that somebody will damage it, somebody may hack it. I asked them what do you suggest. They said under such circumstances, we normally keep it offline when this madness will go away, we will bring it back.
