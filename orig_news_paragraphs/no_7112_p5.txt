" I don’t know that there is a bill at this point that has the necessary 218 votes to coalesce around, and so we got more work to do as the Freedom Caucus to come up with a solution," Representative Mark Meadows, the chairman of the caucus told reporters. Conservative groups Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, Club for Growth, and Americans for Prosperity also opposed the bill, urging conservative members of Congress to vote against the bill. Price signaled that he was willing to work with those groups but reaffirmed that the House bill was very much in line with the administration’s priorities.
