The current regulations were written for the earlier generation of genetically modified organisms, where scientists used bacteria and viruses   —   typically from plant pests   —   to drop a payload of new genes into the nuclei of the plant cells where they merge with the plant’s DNA. That worked, but scientists could not control where the new genes would be inserted, and that led to worries of potentially dangerous genetic disruptions or crossbreeding with  .
