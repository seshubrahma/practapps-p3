Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an    Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about "binders full of women," and now they canâ€™t quite remember what they were going on about. As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse    motherhood.
