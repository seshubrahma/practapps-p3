Once the winner, statewide or in a Congressional District, drops below 50 percent, delegates are allocated proportionally. While Cruz himself is aggressively campaigning in California on Monday, his wife and top surrogate, Heidi Cruz, is hitting three retail campaign events in different Long Island and one in Queens the same day. Switching some votes in those areas might move the needle a few points in Cruz’s direction —  enough to keep Trump below the magic 50 percent number. And if Cruz can pass the 20 percent threshold, he can earn delegates while losing the state overall.
