Women can often obtain quicker and more convenient care from Planned Parenthood facilities than from other clinics. The majority offer   appointments, while only 42% of health departments do, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. The average wait time for initial contraceptive care at Planned Parenthood is 1. 2 days, but it is 4. 1 days for health departments and 2. 5 days at federally qualified health centers.
