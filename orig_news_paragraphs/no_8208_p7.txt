I think the campaigns would’ve all needed to come together to say, "Hey, there’s a line in the sand here that’s been drawn, and we need to come together to vote someone off the island. " In a typical election cycle you wouldn’t need all the campaigns to make that agreement. It would just be recognized by all of them that Trump is a huge threat, not just to the collective but to each campaign, and they would all target him in their own way and put an immense amount of pressure on him and his team.
