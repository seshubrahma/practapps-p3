The event, held for the fifth year in a row, took place at Friendship Park —  where the U. S.  Border separates San Diego from Tijuana. Families were allowed a   window to embrace their loved ones as the event celebrated Mexico’s National Children’s Day. The San Diego   highlighted the emotional toll that can take place when families are separated. Lorenzo, 31, was able to see her mother for the first time in years.
