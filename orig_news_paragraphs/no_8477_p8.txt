Stanley Kurtz, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, writes: Under Coleman’s leadership, the College Board has begun to radically redesign all of its Advanced Placement exams, not just AP U. S. History. Ultimately, this transformation will also include subjects such as Physics, World History, European History, U. S. Government and Politics, and Art History. So in effect, Common Core covers English and math, while the College Board’s AP subjects cover the rest of the curriculum. "
