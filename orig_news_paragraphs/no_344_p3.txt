On Thursday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, took note of the feedback in her home state, California, with notes tacked onto her Twitter timeline by people trying to reach her and blaming telephone backlogs. At 10:17 Eastern on Friday morning, for example, no one picked up the telephone at the main number for the senator’s office in Washington. Two minutes later, when a call was placed to Ms. Feinstein’s San Francisco office, a recording said the voice mail box was full. The mailbox was still full at 1:17 p. m.
