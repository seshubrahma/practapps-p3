Ms. French has been a corker among crime writers ever since "In the Woods" won the Edgar for best first novel. But her sixth, "The Trespasser," has expanded her renown. It features Antoinette Conway, the lone woman on the Dublin Murder Squad, who has to put up with    harassment while she tackles the murder of a woman who seems eerily familiar. Be warned: This book is a   ticket to its five predecessors.
