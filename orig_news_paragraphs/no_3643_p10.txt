Would you please tell the Saudi Kingdom that this deceitful campaign must stop? Under U. S. law, foreign governments are generally immune from the jurisdiction of U. S. courts and cannot be sued for injuries they cause, unless one of the exceptions to sovereign immunity  —   which is set forth in a statute called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act  —   applies. Congress included a provision in JASTA designed to encourage and empower the president to press for, and ultimately, broker settlements of cases brought under JASTA law. But JASTA provides a path for President Trump to raise this issue with the Saudis and work towards a resolution should he choose to do so.
