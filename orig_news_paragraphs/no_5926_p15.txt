Both Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza condemned the bombings as well. The bombings added to fears that Islamic extremists who have long been battling security forces in the Sinai Peninsula are shifting their focus to civilians. An Islamic State affiliate claimed a December suicide bombing at a Cairo church that killed about 30 people, mostly women, as well as a string of killings in the northern Sinai that caused hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas of the country. The militants recently released a video vowing to step up attacks against Christians, whom they regard as "infidels" empowering the West against Muslims.
