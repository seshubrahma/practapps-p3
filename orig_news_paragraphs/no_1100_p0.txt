President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that calls on Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to take steps to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, a set of rules regulating energy plants powered by fossil fuels. The plan, which would have regulated carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil   electricity plants, has been tied up in courts for more than a year, after more two dozen states, industry representatives and others sued the E. P. A. They claimed that the plan was unconstitutional, and it hadnâ€™t yet taken effect because the Supreme Court had said the plan could not be carried out while it was being argued before a lower federal court. Mr. Trump criticized the Clean Power Plan during the campaign and promised to bring back coal mining jobs and create new jobs in the fossil fuel industry the rules would have made that more difficult.
