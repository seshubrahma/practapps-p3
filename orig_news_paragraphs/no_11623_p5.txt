A much more erudite analysis of the "Trump rally" was offered by Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, to CNBC. In essence, he thinks some of the   rally was a "bounce" back from the market testing some dangerous lows right before the election, and the rally is unlikely to last because the tech titans are still pulling the market down. (CNBC adds, without attribution, that there is "growing speculation that   Trumpâ€™s policies could hurt technology companies. ")
