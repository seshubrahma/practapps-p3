But Trump is different.   And that is the very point Bee and others have raised. Trump, who literally kicked off his campaign spewing hate, has demonized Latino immigrants, demeaned an   federal judge for his Hispanic heritage, stoked hate against Muslims, despicably mocked a disabled reporter, made sexist remarks, led the racist birther campaign and even defended a black protester being beaten up by his white supporters.   And itâ€™s no coincidence that Trump is proudly and publicly supported by a frightening number of white supremacists and   such as David Duke.
