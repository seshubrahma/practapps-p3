Campaigners toured from the University College London down to Parliament blasting Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Born in the USA’ while chanting "Don’t Vote Trump" from an open top bus.   While illegal for registered U. S. charities to work with or for presidential candidates, a spokeswoman for Avaaz denied any connection to the Hillary campaign when quizzed. Campaigners with Avaaz however, were recorded shouting, "Vote for Hillary!" during the demonstration. A huge 88 per cent of Americans living abroad did not register to vote in the last presidential election, and Avaaz points out that "this massive untapped voting block" is much more likely to be "progressive" because "56 per cent of us [in the UK] have masters degrees" and overwhelmingly donated to Democratic candidates in the last three presidential primaries.
