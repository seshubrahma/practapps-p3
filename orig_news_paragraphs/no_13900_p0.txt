Washington (CNN) Sen. Jeff Sessions, in the middle of his confirmation hearing to become   Donald Trump’s attorney general, said Tuesday he would respect laws allowing abortion despite his deeply held personal belief that the courts are wrong on the issue. The Alabama Republican said specifically that he would respect the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that said the right to privacy gives women the right to an abortion. Sessions, who has consistently voted against abortion rights in the Senate and has a 0% rating from several abortion rights groups, told senators overseeing his committee hearing that although he believed Roe v. Wade violated the Constitution, he would defend it.
