Evelyn   the vice chairwoman of the Orange County Republican Party, who stepped carefully through the glass shards of the blackened office Monday morning, said she had witnessed the cultural change since moving to the area in the early 1980s. She said she was long used to living among Democrats and was friendly with many of them, including members of her garden club.
