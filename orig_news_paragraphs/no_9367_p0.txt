When it comes to defeating Democrats, I have only one guiding principle: defeat Democrats. In 2012, Team Obama accused Mitt Romney of murder and of not paying his taxes for ten years, and the DC Media let them. I do wish the world was a just and fair place, but it is not, and unless you want all the income you generate from being forced to bake   cakes to fund   abortions, we must defeat Democrats.   Other than his promise to build a wall along our southern border, his zeal for killing terrorists, and a lifelong dedication to sticking up for a working class decimated by obscene trade deals and illegal immigration, Trumpâ€™s ability to control the media narrative, stay on offense, and dodge the   our corrupt media loves to lay out for Republicans, is why a large number of Republicans believe he can win a general election.
