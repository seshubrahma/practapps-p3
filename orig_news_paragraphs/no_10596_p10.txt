Trump supporter Chris Christie, who leads the Republican Governors Association, said recently that "I do not want to go back to the days of the 1800s and 1700s  â€¦     where a bunch of, you know, legislators, no offense, pick the United States Senator or pick, you know, who is going to be the Presidential electors. " " The fact is I like the way this system works and even though sometimes it has worked to my advantage and sometimes it has worked to my disadvantage," Christie said in remarks at a press conference that were provided to Breitbart News by his office.
