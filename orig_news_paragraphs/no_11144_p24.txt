Romney doing some minority outreach:   6:25: Clinton, like GOP politicians and their bevy of consultants who are not that much different from Democrats in the permanent political class, keeps trying to use Trump’s past comments about women against him and treating Trump like a traditional politician whom Americans have never heard of. What they don’t   (because they are in their bubbles) is that Trump is not a typical politician. He has been a celebrity for decades, and Americans and conditioned to give celebrities a pass for outlandish comments that they think is just part of their schtick. Trump can’t say he treats women with respect.
