Each of us can stand our ground in our own way, but the lessons that come to us from a century of authoritarian rule around the world    and the civil rights movement in America    meet up in one phrase: Do not lose hope. Do not hide away. Be visible and be heard, on the street and in phone calls to your elected officials.    Some of us have taken our freedoms for granted.
