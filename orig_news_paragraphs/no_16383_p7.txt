Emergency services detailed the almost   operation in which crews tried to isolate the climber, after first trying to talk him down through a vent on the 5th floor. When the   man in a baseball cap and climbing gear continued to scale vertically and horizontally, emergency personnel removed window panes and lowered scaffolding from the roof of the building to eventually corner him near a   thick glass window that would not support his weight, a police spokesman said.   Trump Tower is Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€™s   property, and where his campaign is headquartered    next to Central Park in Manhattan.   The real estate mogul was not in the building at the time of the climb, but on the campaign trail.
