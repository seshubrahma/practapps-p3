The events of this week seem to be firmly in the    space. Trump and his White House seem to be careening from one    disaster to another. There appears to be no consistent message, no consistent strategy and no real plan to get one.    The image that keeps coming to my mind is Trump, alone, angry and tweeting, while his staff runs around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to put out a fire    even as two more start behind them.
