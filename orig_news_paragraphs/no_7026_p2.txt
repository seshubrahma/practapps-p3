With this statement, Judge Chuang makes it clear that he accepts the argument made by plaintiffs HIAS (formerly Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) about refugee resettlement numbers in FY 2017. The plaintiffs argue that former President Obamaâ€™s September 22, 2016 "presidential determination" that he wanted Congress to fund the resettlement of up to 110, 000 refugees in the United States in FY 2017 means that Congress must fund the resettlement of 110, 000 refugees this fiscal year, and that President Trump has absolutely no say in the matter. The facts and the law say otherwise. In November, Donald Trump was elected president on a platform that called for a reduction in the number of refugees allowed to enter the United States, and a suspension of of refugees from Syria and other   countries into the United States, a significant event which plaintiffs HIAS and IRAP give no consideration in their complaint.
