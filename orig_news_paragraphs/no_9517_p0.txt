Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld stated he was "glad that we were suckered" into covering former Alaska Governor and GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s endorsement of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump over "Hillary Rodham Clinton having   classified information on her email" and the endorsement "shows in a way the opportunism of a lot of top conservative leaders" on Tuesday’s broadcast of "The Five. "  Gutfeld said, "Palin’s endorsement is massive, because it will definitely get Palin’s vote. And I think that’s really important, and I think it is bigger than Hillary Rodham Clinton having   classified information on her email. So I’m glad that we were suckered into leading with this huge, huge announcement.
