The move has been a familiar campaign promise for other candidates, but it looks like one Trump is committed to keeping —  based on Thursday’s announcement that attorney David Friedman would be Trump’s envoy to Israel. Friedman said, "I am deeply honored and humbled by the confidence placed in me by   Trump to represent the United States as its Ambassador to Israel. I intend to work tirelessly to strengthen the unbreakable bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region, and look forward to doing this from the U. S. embassy in Israel’s eternal capital, Jerusalem. " Another foreign policy objective would be achieved when Trump takes the United States out of international programs that fund and encourage abortion, the   Mexico City Policy.
