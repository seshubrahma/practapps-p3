Playboy Mansion encounter with Cosby to the media in an attempt to obtain a payoff from Cosby approximately 10 years ago, demonstrating that the claim of a recently revived memory is a fraud.   Allred’s claim of victory is somewhat misleading in that the appellate court has allowed the Cosby vs. Huth case to proceed only through the pretrial "discovery of evidence" process. The merits will be decided later on, and Allred will face the difficult task of proving that her client only recently remembered sexual abuse and injury that a   encounter with one of America’s most famous television personalities induced.   If Allred is able to secure Cosby’s deposition, as she says she will, her real goal will be to obtain damaging admissions from Cosby regarding illegal drug and alcohol use to assist in the incapacitation and molestation of helpless victims.
