The Democratic vice presidential nominee, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees and has a son serving abroad in the Marine Corps, flexed his foreign policy muscles in remarks primarily focused on Clinton’s Republican rival and the contrasts between the two candidates on national security.   The push is part of a campaign focus of hitting Trump on national security, according to Clinton aides speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. They noted early voting begins in many states this month, and Clinton relishes going after Trump on the topic because she feels like she knows it well and he doesn’t. At Tuesday’s speech, Kaine called out Trump for his shifting stance on the Iraq War, saying he "misled" voters about his position.
