The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee issued a statement shortly after Trumpâ€™s visit ripping the new president.   " While standing in front of the stars representing CIA personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country    hallowed ground     Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice," Rep. Adam Schiff said, adding that Trump "meandered through a variety of other topics unrelated to intelligence."
