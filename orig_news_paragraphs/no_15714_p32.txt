It’s not nearly as hot there as in the sun’s 3 million degree corona.   But the spacecraft will still have to endure temperatures of 2, 500 degrees, and to do that, it will have a coat of carbon solar shields measuring almost five inches thick.    The mission costs $1. 5 billion.   It’s scheduled to launch in the summer of 2018.
