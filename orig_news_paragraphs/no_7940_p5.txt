Odd. In July, searches for "presidential candidates" would only reveal three names at the top of Googleâ€™s search results: Hillary Rodham Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein. After the absences of Republican Party candidate Donald Trump and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson were revealed, Google blamed the results on a "technical bug" rather than manipulation. Claims that Google have been manipulating other search results in favor of Hillary Clinton have also been prominent during this election, with negative Clinton suggestions frequently being ruled out from searches, despite being top search suggestions on other engines.
