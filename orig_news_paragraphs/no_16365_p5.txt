This implies a reduction in revenue from the corporate income tax of more than 25% or a loss in revenue of close to $100 billion a year. These tax cuts are virtually certain to lead to large deficits, as occurred with previous tax cuts under President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush. Trump has also proposed a substantial boost to infrastructure spending (although, while more spending on infrastructure is badly needed, this will further boost the deficit).   Trump has suggested he will address the deficit by reducing waste, but presidents from both parties have promised to reduce waste for decades.
