Tait said that while "it’’s possible" that the GCHQ picked up   Trump’’s calls with other targeted people, it would have happened   only "if Trump was in contact with people GCHQ was authorized to   listen to. " ’ ’    "If GCHQ was authorized to target, say, a Russian intelligence   officer, and Trump phoned up that Russian intelligence officer,   then GCHQ might overhear that conversation, not because it wants   to hear what Trump has to say, but because they want to hear what   the Russian intelligence officer is up to, " Tait said.
