The YPG do not appear particularly, While Marxist in ideology and sporting some ties (how strong they are is a matter of heated debate) with the U. S.  terrorist group Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party (PKK) the YPG is largely   and even boasts several American volunteer fighters. Western YPG volunteers receive funerals with high honors when they die fighting for the Kurds against ISIS. The YPG opposes Assad only so far as it is seeking an independent Kurdistan, but has no overt interest in the Arab leadership of Damascus.
