Corey Lewandowski, the former campaign manager for Donald J. Trump, is joining CNN as a political commentator, effective immediately, a spokeswoman for the network said Thursday. Mr. Lewandowski was fired by the Trump campaign on Monday after increasing concerns from allies and donors, as well as Mr. Trump’s children, over whether he could handle a national campaign against Hillary Clinton’s   operation. Mr. Lewandowski’s contract will make him exclusive to CNN, meaning he won’t be able to appear on other networks. CNN currently has another Trump surrogate, Jeffrey Lord, as a frequent guest.
