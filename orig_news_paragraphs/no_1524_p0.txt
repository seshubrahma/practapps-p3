CLEVELAND   â€”    The tensest exchange yet between the police and protesters at the Republican National Convention unfolded Wednesday afternoon with officers arresting several people after some of them tried to burn a United States flag near the site of the convention. Just before 4 p. m. demonstrators spread word that someone would be burning a flag near the entrance to the Quicken Loans Arena, where the convention is being held.
