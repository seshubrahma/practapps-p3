In a particularly striking development, UK voters completely disregarded warnings from elite voices of the consequences of tearing the political system that has largely delivered peace and prosperity since World War II. Similar warnings have been heard in the U. S. election    especially from Clinton and establishment politicians who fear Trumpâ€™s "America First" stance would send shockwaves through the global system and see America pull back from its role as a guarantor of Western security. But in the UK this week, outsider politicians seem to have carried just as much weight with many British voters as more conventional   arguments. World authorities like the IMF for example warned about the consequences of a Brexit    but voters went ahead and voted to leave anyway.
