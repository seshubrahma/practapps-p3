The   poll found that while nine out of 10 respondents had seen coverage of the firing, opinions of Trump had remained stable.   The poll found that Trump’s approval rating dropped marginally from 40 percent in April to 39 percent in May, with his disapproval rating remaining at 59 percent in both May and April. This is supported by Gallup’s Daily Tracking Poll, which has Trump’s job approval rating at 39 percent, down a point from 40 percent on Tuesday, the day Comey was fired. More damaging to Trump’s approval, it seems, is the unpopular Republican healthcare bill.
