After initially describing a planned meeting with Mr. Trump as a pro forma exercise, Mr. Pence told a number of associates afterward that he would be inclined to accept the second spot on the ticket if it was offered. Mr. Pence’s   aspirations have developed to the point where Republicans have begun preparing for his departure from the Indiana governorship. Joining Mr. Trump’s ticket would prompt Mr. Pence to abandon his campaign for   potentially leaving state Republicans without a nominee for governor less than four months before the election. The Republican Governors Association, which has already spent money on television commercials for Mr. Pence, has been drawing up contingency plans in the event he withdraws from the race, according to people familiar with the committee’s preparations.
