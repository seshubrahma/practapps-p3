The Palestinians strongly oppose the move, saying it would kill any hopes for negotiating an   peace agreement and rile the region by undercutting Muslim and Christian claims to the holy city. Trump hasn’t yet laid out a clear Mideast policy, but has signaled he will be more sympathetic to Israel’s   right than previous administrations. He has also vowed to move the US embassy. Abbas has written to Trump warning of the risks of such a move and asked him to reconsider, while also flagging the concern to Arab and other world leaders, said the Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad Malki.
