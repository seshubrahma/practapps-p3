Rights group blames Arpaio’s policy, Her detention prompted two consecutive evenings of demonstrations. On Wednesday evening, seven people were arrested outside the Phoenix ICE office when protesters attempted to block an agency van from taking Garcia de Rayos away. Immigrant advoacy group Puente Arizona said Garcia de Rayos was a victim of controversial policies of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Enforcing   laws was one of Arpaio’s most   tools to crack down on illegal immigration in the border state.
