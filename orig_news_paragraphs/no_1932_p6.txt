" Mr. Trump’s charity reported paying out $896, 000 in grants for 2015, some of which was disclosed during the campaign. The donations included support for health causes like cancer research and the American Red Cross, as well as $50, 000 for the private school attended by Mr. Trump’s youngest son, Barron. In late September, Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, ordered the charity to cease   in the state after his office found that the foundation was not properly registered to solicit donations.
