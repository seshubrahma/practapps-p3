A source familiar with the case told CNN that Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III    a Reagan appointee and one of the most highly respected judges on the court    recused himself from the case because Wall is his    as well as his former law clerk. Judge Allyson Duncan, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, also stepped aside. That means 10 of the 13 judges who heard Monday’s case were appointed by Democrats.    What’s at stake?
