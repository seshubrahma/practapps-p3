The arrest comes as progressives step up their judicial and media push to force American adults and youths to share all of their public bathrooms and changing rooms with the small number of people who try to live and look like people of the opposite sex. In   for example, Target stores announced they would only allow   changing rooms and toilets. On April 21, media outlets claimed that Donald Trump supported the progressive campaign to eliminate   bathrooms.
