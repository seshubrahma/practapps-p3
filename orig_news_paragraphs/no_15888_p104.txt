although the security detail was wounded in the leg, he came out to try to make sure that Steve Scalise was OK because that was his job, his responsibility.    We tried to shoo him off but he showed his dedication that he was going to check with the person he was responsible for taking care of because, again, Steve Scalise is the Majority Whip. That puts him in the line of command. So he gets the security detail to help protect him.
