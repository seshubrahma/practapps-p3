Ossoff will have to face Republican candidate Karen Handel in a runoff election in June. Ossoff’s campaign was boosted by the support of numerous celebrities, including from Star Trek actor George Takei and   talk show host Chelsea Handler, the latter of whom donated to the young Democrat and used her nearly 7   Twitter following to urge Georgia voters to turn out.
