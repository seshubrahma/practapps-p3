The teenaged crowd booed after Key told them they couldn’t write in Justin Bieber or a Pokémon for president during the show’s live voting. Throughout the night, viewers could use their smartphones or computers to vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. The initiative also encouraged older teenagers to sign up to vote through Rock the Vote’s online voter registration platform. After all the votes were in, the results were announced at the end of the award show.
