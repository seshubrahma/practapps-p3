Because of his wide swathe of support, I believe he will easily defeat Hillary Clinton in November. As one who has recently changed her views on issues after in depth investigations, I truly believe Donald Trump is now embracing conservative ideology and will be a strong fighter for conservative principles. He has a track record of winning and has already won in relegating Republican establishment darling Jeb Bush to underdog status despite hundreds of millions of dollars in his war chest. Would any other candidate have been able to accomplish that?
