House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan said Tuesday that he adamantly refused to accept the Republican nomination for president, even if a deadlocked convention tries to place his name into nomination in July. ["Let me be clear, I do not want, nor will I accept, the nomination for our party," Ryan said at the Republican National Committee offices in Washington, D. C. this afternoon.   Ryan has unsuccessfully tried to tamp down speculation that he would accept the nomination if he was pressed into service by Republican delegates at the summer convention in Cleveland. "
