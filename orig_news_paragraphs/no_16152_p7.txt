Doctors and surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic have also been told to remain on call    and prepared for a situation in which the hospital is cut off from outside aid and supplies    for the convention’s four days, according to a report from Stat News, which covers health care.   On Wednesday, Amnesty International USA announced it would be sending "human rights observers" to both Cleveland and Philadelphia, which will host the Democratic convention from July  . " Given the inevitable demonstrations at each and the uptick we’ve seen in excessive force at protests recently, AIUSA felt it was crucial that we have folks on the ground," the group said in a statement.
