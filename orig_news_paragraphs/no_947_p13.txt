For Mr. Li, his annual news conference at the end of the legislative session was a rare chance to dominate the political stage, which is usually filled by the   president, Mr. Xi. Unlike his recent predecessors, Mr. Li has not taken a lead in setting economic policy, and some observers have wondered whether he might be replaced as premier after his first term ends next year. But on Wednesday, Mr. Li held center stage, while crediting Mr. Xi with keeping the economy in good health since they were elected premier and president in 2013. Mr. Li presented an optimistic view of Chinaâ€™s economy this year.
