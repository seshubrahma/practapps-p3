Last month, the vocal Trump supporter announced his book deal with Threshold Editions, the part of Simon  Schuster that has published books from Donald Trump, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. The book is called "Dangerous," and will seek to explain the rise of the "populist, nationalist Trump phenomenon," according to a press release from Yiannopoulos. In July, he was banned for life from Twitter after a deluge of tweets from users were directed at comedian Leslie Jones. Yiannopoulos later defended his tweets in an interview with CNN.
