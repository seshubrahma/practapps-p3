Although organizers hail the event as a "grassroots effort," in reality, it is a massive   choreographed assembly paid for by major donors such as George Soros and Planned Parenthood, "helmed by four national   and a national coordinating committee who are working around the clock to pull it all together. " The list of "Partners" of the event reads like a who’s who of radical feminism, and includes Catholics for Choice, the Center for Reproductive Rights, The Coalition of Nasty Women, EMILY’s List, Free the Nipple, GLAAD, NARAL   America Foundation, National Abortion Federation, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Institute for Reproductive Health, Pussyhat Project, and, of course, Planned Parenthood. The usual Hollywood shills for the abortion lobby will also be out in full force.
