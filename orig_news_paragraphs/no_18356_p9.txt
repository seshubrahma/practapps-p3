YayYo says it wants to be   the Kayak of the   industry, allowing you to compare   prices and book rides on Uber, Lyft, and other such companies in   a single app. ’ ’    At the center of it all is Ramy   whose life before   starting YayYo involved working with an arms dealer, promoting   "Men Are from Mars, Women Are From Venus," and led ultimately to   accusations of a   scheme and one of the   biggest securities bailouts in history.
