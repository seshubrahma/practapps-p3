From the   protests indulged by San Francisco 49ers second stringer Colin Kaepernick, to repeated bile disgorged by sports reporters, the hate has poured from the sports world. Of course, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been ladling out his brand of hate for the entire NFL season. He has labeled police officers as pigs, attacked the U. S. military, disrespected the national anthem, praised domestic terror group Black Lives Matter, and said the country is intrinsically racist. This must not be "negativity" as far as Wilson is concerned.
