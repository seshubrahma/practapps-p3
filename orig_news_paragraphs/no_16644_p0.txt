Miami (CNN) Donald Trump said Friday that he would reverse the deal President Barack Obama struck to reopen diplomatic relations and   some trade with Cuba unless the Cuban regime meets his demands to restore political freedoms and free political prisoners. While Trump has said the US should have struck a better deal with Cuba, his new position was an apparent shift from his past statements that he supported the reopening of diplomatic relations after more than 50 years. Trump    speaking in a state with a heavy Cuban voting bloc    characterized Obamaâ€™s deal as " " and benefiting "only the Castro regime."
