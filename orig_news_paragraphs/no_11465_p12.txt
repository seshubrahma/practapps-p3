The speech created an eruption of applause, with Democrat RoKhanna even publicly praising Thiel afterwards, but the majority of progressives took advantage of the moment in order to try and further isolate the entrepreneur. On the whole, I’m against waving one’s identity around like a flag. There’s nothing special or brave about being gay in the United States today (unless Obama gets his way and we have more Muslim immigration, of course). And, except in Muslim ghettos, I disagree with talking about one’s gayness as an object of pride.
