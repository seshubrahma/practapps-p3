If Mr. Trump fills his cabinet with generals, what kind of message will he send to the rest of the world? In a news article, the Times claims the  ’s appointment of military general contradicts a "constitutionally enshrined principle" of civilian control of the military. However, former Department of Justice (DOJ) official under George W. Bush Shannen Coffin, writing an opinion article for National Review, argues that statutory limitations on the president’s nomination power are unconstitutional. The U. S. Constitution does not explicitly prohibit the president from appointing military officers to any executive branch position.
