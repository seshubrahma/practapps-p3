The Secret Service came under criticism because in its initial account of the episode, officials indicated that Mr. Gonzalez had made it only steps inside the North Portico after running through the door. The fuller account emerged from Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and chairman of a subcommittee that investigated the breach. The National Capital Planning Commission recently approved plans for the Secret Service to install a stronger and higher perimeter fence around the White House.
