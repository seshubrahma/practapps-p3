The promise of freedom, liberty and the rights of man. " We must never cease" Churchill said, "to proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are the joint inheritance of the   world and which through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and the English common law, find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence". So it is my honour and my privilege to stand before you today in this great city of Philadelphia to proclaim them again, to join hands as we pick up that mantle of leadership once more, to renew our Special Relationship and to recommit ourselves to the responsibility of leadership in the modern world.
