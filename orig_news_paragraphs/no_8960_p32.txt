In 1960, two years before Jeff Flake was born, the foreign born population of his home state of Arizona was 70, 000. By 2013, there were nearly one million   residents in Arizona (896, 310) which represents a population larger than the size of San Francisco. This transformation was largely the result of a 1965 immigration bill, which lifted Calvin Coolidge’s immigration caps and opened up American immigration visas to the entire world. The bill resulted in an explosion of America’s   population from 9. 6 million in 1965 to roughly 45 million today.
