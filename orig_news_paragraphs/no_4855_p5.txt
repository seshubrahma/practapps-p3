In April, an Alabama man live streamed his suicide on Facebook Live following a relationship breakup, while a Thai father also streamed himself hanging his    child before killing himself. In January, four people were arrested in Chicago after they filmed themselves torturing and beating a tied up disabled man, who was repeatedly forced to say, "f*ck Trump," and, "f*ck white people," while on Easter Sunday, Facebook user Steve Stephens filmed himself shooting and killing    Robert Godwin Sr. before he evaded police for days   â€”   eventually committing suicide in a standoff.
