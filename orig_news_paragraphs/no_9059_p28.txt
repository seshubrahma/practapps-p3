Needless to say, natural conservativesâ€™ concern with the flourishing of their own culture comes up against an intractable nemesis in the regressive left, which is currently intent on tearing down statues of Cecil Rhodes and Queen Victoria in the UK, and erasing the name of Woodrow Wilson from Princeton in the U. S. These attempts to scrub western history of its great figures are particularly galling to the   who in addition to the preservation of western culture, care deeply about heroes and heroic virtues. This follows decades in which   on campus sought to remove the study of "dead white males" from the focus of western history and literature curricula. An establishment conservative might be mildly irked by such behaviour as they switch between the State of the Union and the business channels, but to a natural conservative, such cultural vandalism may just be their highest priority.
