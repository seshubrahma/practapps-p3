And some of the things that the Mexican government most covets will rankle many Trump supporters. For example, Mexico wants better access to a program, widely enjoyed at the Canadian border, in which shippers that pass a security review are allowed to cross the border with a less intensive customs process (this is the international trade equivalent of the "T. S. A. PreCheck" security line at the airport). Mexico also seeks more favorable treatment for Mexican citizens with advanced skills seeking visas to work temporarily in the United States. Needless to say, making it easier for Mexican trucks and Mexican workers to get into the United States isnâ€™t exactly what Trump campaigned on.
