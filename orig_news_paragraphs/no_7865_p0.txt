Once again, frontrunner Donald Trump is proving to the Republican base that, unlike the Establishment GOP, he is willing to do what is necessary to win, even if it means bringing up a subject the corrupt DC Media has declared off limits. The subject, of course, is Hillary’s (and the media’s) appalling double standards on the issue of the War on Women.   Using a clip from one of Hillary’s most famous speeches, one from 1995 where she equated women’s rights to human rights, this   Trump video puts Hillary’s words over images of the Clintons’ sick reality: photos of Monica Lewinsky,   Bill Cosby, and   Anthony Weiner, who is married to Huma Abedein, Hillary’s chief aide.   —
