The statement said: We are hopeful todayâ€™s announcement will do what FWD. us has long advocated improve our high skilled immigration system.   We should do so in a targeted manner by increasing the wage floor, treating   companies (50 employees and 50% or more of domestic workforce  ) differently and banning their ability to do   placement.    immigrants create new American jobs, raise wages for   workers, and contribute enormously to growing our economy.
