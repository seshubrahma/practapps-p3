" The more we can focus what’s impacting people    the stronger our message becomes and that’s the two cents that I’ve offered," Rep. Tom Reed, a New York Republican, said as he left Thursday’s meeting. Rep. Ryan Zinke, a Montana Republican, said Trump needed to stay on the issues and avoid personal attacks like the ones he said Clinton brought up at the first debate. Zinke cited Clinton’s hammering on Trump for criticizing Alicia Machado’s weight, the exchange which came to dominate the first debate.
