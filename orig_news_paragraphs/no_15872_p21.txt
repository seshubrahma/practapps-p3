Warmbier appeared emotional at a news conference organized by the North Koreans before his trial in March 2016. He tearfully confessed to being "lured by the United States administration to commit a crime in this country."   Itâ€™s not clear if he was forced to speak by the North Koreans. His case largely stayed quiet after that until May of this year, when his parents decided it was time to speak out.
