"   groups cheered the decision. " The nomination of Abid Qureshi to fill a seat on the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia sends a message of inclusion that is welcomed by the American Muslim community and by all Americans who value diversity and mutual respect at a time when some seek division and discord," Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on   Relations, a civil rights group, said in a statement. Although Muslims have served as judges at the state level, Qureshi would be the first Muslim to serve as a federal judge, according to the legal advocacy organization Muslim Advocates.
