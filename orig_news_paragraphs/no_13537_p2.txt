The Obama administration adopted a regulation requiring employers to provide healthcare coverage for birth control and   matters, which the Supreme Court struck down in the Hobby Lobby case as applied to   businesses owned by people with religious beliefs against contraception or abortion. The Court ruled   that this regulation violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). While churches were exempted from this Obamacare administrative rule, religious nonprofit organizations were offered only an "accommodation" that they could sign a form declaring their religious objection, which would transfer their legal obligation to pay for abortion to their secular insurance companies. These nonprofits —  mainly evangelical organizations like East Texas Baptist University and Catholic groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor —  objected, saying that signing a form that obligated someone else to pay for abortion still made them complicit in sinful activities.
