In the past, officials were often able to push homeless people out by setting strict rules and finding reasons to remove them. But over the years, advocates and civil rights groups have successfully challenged attempts to oust or block homeless people, calling those efforts discriminatory and selective law enforcement. Today, all parties accept that transit terminals are public spaces that homeless people have as much right to occupy as anyone else, provided they follow regulations. Restrictions must be enforced for all terminal users, not just for "people who some members of the public donâ€™t want to interact with," said Tina Luongo, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society.
