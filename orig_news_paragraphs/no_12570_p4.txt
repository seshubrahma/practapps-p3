one of the most famous decisions ever written by Justice Antonin Scalia —  held that the Second Amendment is an individual right, and as such does not allow the federal government to bar   and peaceable American citizens from keeping a handgun in their home. Heller was a   decision, and left other   questions for future cases. Heller specified that it was not weighing in on certain issues, including laws that prohibit certain people from owning guns. Federal law in 18 U. S. C. § 922( g)(4) is one of these   laws, providing that no one "who has been committed to a mental institution" can own firearms.
