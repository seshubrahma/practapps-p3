Colleges, of course! As long as campuses are churning out students who hate free speech and free markets, what hope is there for libertarian policy priorities? If libertarians want to live in a free society, they’d better get ready to tread on their opponents. At my UC Berkeley show last week,   set college property on fire, smashed up bank windows and ATMs, jumped on people’s cars, and looted downtown stores, including the   liberal Starbucks.
