" While Clinton has not spelled out her long term plans for how many Syrian refugees she would take into the country, the number who could come from that country is certainly enormous," Camarota added. If the same policies were followed in Clinton’s second term, roughly 1. 7 million migrants from the Muslim world could potentially arrive during two terms of a Clinton presidency. Camarota explained that these figures are just part of the larger immigration expansion that would take place under a President Clinton, who could potentially add as many as 10 million new immigrants to the country —   not including the millions of illegals to whom Clinton would grant amnesty.
