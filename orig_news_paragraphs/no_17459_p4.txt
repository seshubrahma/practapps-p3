Until then, North Korea will continue to launch military provocations and conduct nuclear tests in a bid to frustrate Seoul’s and Washington’s   policy towards Pyongyang, Thae said.   "North Korea believes that relentless provocations must shift new (South Korean and US) governments’ policy lines into more   ones," he said according to the Yonhap News Agency, one of the few outlets allowed into the briefing. North Korea has recently stipulated a dual   development policy to be part of the ruling party’s official platform, but in reality, the decision puts nuclear development at the top priority, he said.   "Following the ruling party congress in May, Kim   made it a party policy to finish nuclear development within the earliest time possible," he told the news agency.
