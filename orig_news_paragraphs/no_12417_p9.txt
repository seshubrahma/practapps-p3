I mean the first female President, it did not attract a critical mass of women. I always said, knew and said publicly, probably on Breitbart radio, that she would need about 60 percent of the female vote to win, and she got nowhere near there because she had this reverse gender gap with men. But Iâ€™m excited, I want all the little girls out there to know that the lessons are very simple. Be kind your entire life because all the kindness I showed to other people came back to me manifold in this campaign.
