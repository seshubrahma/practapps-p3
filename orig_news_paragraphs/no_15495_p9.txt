I’d be very happy to see Trump go, but McCarthy’s Spicer offers some   comedic relief right now.     In fairness, McCarthy’s depiction of Spicey as an    buffoonish character has made me acutely aware of the concern some of my fellow progressives have about comedians’ take on Trump.   There’s a fear that comedy will minimize the grave risks Trump poses to America    at least as seen by those who oppose him. Even Baldwin implied as much when he stated recently he might retire his Trump impression at the end of this "SNL" season next week.
