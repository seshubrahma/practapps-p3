North Korea will be a top priority for Tillerson and Mattis going into Wednesday ’s talks with China, said Susan Thornton, the State Department’s acting assistant secretary for the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.   Thornton told reporters Monday that US officials are "aiming to advance concrete cooperation with China towards a peaceful resolution of the nuclear and missile threat from North Korea." Noting that repeated UN resolutions forbid the DPRK’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs, Thornton added that, "we continue to urge China to exert its unique leverage as North Korea’s largest trading partner, including by fully implementing all UN Security Council sanctions.
