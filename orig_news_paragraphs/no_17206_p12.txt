This case has also been interpreted to mean that a person can be pardoned for a crime regardless of whether charges were filed.      There is certainly no bar to a President issuing a pardon to groups of people, rather than individuals.   In 1863, Abraham Lincoln pardoned former Confederate soldiers, while in 1893 Benjamin Harrison pardoned members of the Church of   Saints (Mormons) for polygamy.   In 1977, Jimmy Carter granted pardons to thousands of Americans who had evaded the draft during the Vietnam War.
