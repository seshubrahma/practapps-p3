T. S. Eliot could not have written "The Waste Land"    the most important poem of literary modernism    without feeling free to "steal" lines from Hindu rituals, from dozens of other cultures. I doubt that the US Constitution could have been written without our Founding Fathers "stealing" from Montesquieu and other Enlightenment thinkers. In the globalized world we occupy, we can and should expect all sorts of fascinating acts of appropriation that open up new veins of thought and feeling. Yet itâ€™s never appropriate to insult people.
