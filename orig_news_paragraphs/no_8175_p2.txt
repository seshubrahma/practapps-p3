The meeting was at my request, and Mr. Trump was gracious enough to agree to it. We met for about an hour, just the two of us, and had a chance to clear the air. Mr. Trump and I discussed the possibility of an interview, and I hope we will have news to announce on that soon. By the way in case you were wondering, yes the doormen appeared a bit stunned when I walked in, and they too were incredibly gracious.
