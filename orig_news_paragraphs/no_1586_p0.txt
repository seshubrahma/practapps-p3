WILMINGTON, N. C.  â€”    Donald J. Trump on Tuesday appeared to raise the possibility that gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges who favor stricter gun control measures. Repeating his contention that Mrs. Clinton wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. Trump warned at a rally here that it would be "a horrible day" if Mrs. Clinton were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice.
