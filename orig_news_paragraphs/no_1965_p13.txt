For now, the administration intends to continue its strategy in Somalia of primarily helping partner forces battle the Shabab  —   including carrying out airstrikes to defend them when they get into trouble during missions. It is not declaring Somalia an "area of active hostilities," which would free up the American military to carry out airstrikes targeting   militants more expansively. In particular, officials said, Somalia  —   unlike Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Surt   —   will continue to be subject to the Presidential Policy Guidance, the set of 2013 rules for drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations outside conventional war zones.
