Al Sharpton, who quickly positioned himself beside Mrs. Clinton and took care not to relinquish his perch. By about 2 p. m.

(In a speech there hours later, she addressed Britainâ€™s vote to leave the European Union, arguing it reaffirmed the need for "steady, experienced leadership" in the presidential race.)
