I truly mean what I say and have said   to my parents often over the past six months. Thank God for   Bridgewater and you, Ray. While I’’m sure you do not realize the   extent of my gratitude to you, please know that I’’m eternally   grateful for you, all of your teachings and for this amazing   company that I have been honored to be part of in the past 12   years, and I hope will be my home for the rest of my career. I   will also do everything I can to make it and keep it great.
