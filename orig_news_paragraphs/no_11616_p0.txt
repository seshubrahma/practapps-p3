Fox News’s Eric Bolling is coming out with a new book, Wake Up America, on Tuesday that focuses on the problems facing the country right now. Bolling, one of the few newsmen at the Fox News Channel who has actually understood the outsider effect of Donald Trump upon the electorate, which led the billionaire to win the GOP nomination, paints a gruesome picture of the day of Hillary Clinton’s inauguration if she wins the White House. [The book is so powerful, in fact, that even Trump himself recommends it —  calling the book "huge" and saying on the back cover that it will help "Make America Great Again. "  Bolling has been one of the leading outsider voices on a network that didn’t seem to ever get it right with the rise of Trump, and has had to fight back against   people even on his own programs like The Five.
