President Trump campaigned on a process of "extreme vetting" in the cases of travel from high risk countries to the United States, allowing them in only a    basis. The Department of Homeland Security asserted in a statement today that they would continue to implement Trumpâ€™s executive order. " The Department of Homeland Security will faithfully execute the immigration laws, and we will treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism," the statement read.
