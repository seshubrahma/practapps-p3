As Robert Kelchen, an assistant professor of higher education at Seton Hall University pointed out in a response to Cuomo’s announcement, students face many expenses in addition to tuition.   A State University of New York website reveals that the   costs to attend the college beyond tuition and fees are $16, 570 for   students and $8, 680 for commuters.   Free tuition, this table makes clear, does not make college free. And that is where Chingos and other critics take issue with Cuomo’s plan.
