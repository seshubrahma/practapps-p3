Sen. Rob Portman was considered an endangered Republican when popular former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland decided to run against him, although polls show Strickland’s bid has fizzled.   Portman, a former U. S. Trade Representative in the George W. Bush administration, initially backed current Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s campaign for the White House, but when Kasich withdrew, Portman quickly threw his support behind Trump. However, after the "Access Hollywood" video, Portman withdrew that support and said he would   Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, instead. Before the controversial video surfaced, Portman, a   veteran of Washington and proud policy wonk, said Trump’s unorthodox candidacy helped his   race by energizing the GOP base.
