Durham, New Hampshire (CNN) President Barack Obama was wrapping his stump speech here Monday    the ninth time heâ€™d delivered it in six days    when his mind drifted back toward where his story began.   Standing at his last rally as a political headliner during the last day of his last campaign, Obama recalled the first time he heard the rallying cry "Fired Up, Ready to Go" from a South Carolina supporter named Edith Childs. Obama paused amid his urgent advocacy for Hillary Clinton to reflect upon his own political trajectory, which after more than a decade is coming to a close.
