 (CNN) The dramatic quest to repeal Obamacare this spring left House Republicans politically bruised, exhausted and    perhaps most of all    relieved to finally be done.   Senate Republicans are hoping not to repeat the same experience, but nevertheless face similar obstacles, despite a determination to push forward. They will have to bridge ideological divides among fellow senators and reach consensus on several major health care policy fronts    from what to do about Medicaid expansion to how patients with   conditions would be affected    while at the same time, selling their plan to those in the public who are disturbed by efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.
