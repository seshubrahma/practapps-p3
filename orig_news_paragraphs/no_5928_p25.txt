In the name of diversity and inclusion,   and  "choice" Democrats, alike, should challenge their leadership to recant this intolerant position. However, with the now deeply entrenched   political relationship between the Democrat Party and the abortion industry, there may be little chance for the party to open its tent to include more   candidates in the near future.
