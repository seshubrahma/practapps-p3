Democrats now make up nearly 44 percent of the state’s 24. 6 million registered voters by contrast, Republicans make up just 27 percent, barely ahead of independent voters, who make up 24 percent, according to California’s secretary of state. Jim Brulte, the chairman of the California Republican Party, said that he expected the disparity to increase even more in the months ahead because of the competitive Democratic primary, while hopes for a contested Republican primary fizzled after Donald J. Trump all but locked up the nomination.
