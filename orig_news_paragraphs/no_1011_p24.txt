â€”   a reef. But when the water near a reef gets too hot, the algae begin producing toxins, and the corals expel them in   turning ghostly white. If water temperatures drop soon enough, the corals can grow new algae and survive, but if not, they may succumb to starvation or disease. Even when the corals die, some reefs eventually recover.
