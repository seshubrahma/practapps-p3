Together Cruz and Trump have more than twice the establishment popular vote   â€”   13, 023, 702 vs 6, 091, 821. " The Establishment clearly intends to seek changes in the convention rules at the last minute to enable them to circumvent the votes of millions of people and the vast majority of Trump and Cruz delegates at the Convention to slip in a nominee who does not reflect the   appeal of the two leading candidates," former Nashville talk show host Steve Gill, a Ted Cruz delegate in Tennessee, tells Breitbart News.
