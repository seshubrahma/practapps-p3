Hillary lies and says that the FBI cleared her of misleading the public about her emails, but attention is on Trumpâ€™s internal GOP feud. President Barack Obama gives Iran $400 billion for hostages, but the media focuses on the Republican rift. Hillary proudly boasts a tax increase for the middle class and the media focuses on whether Trump is in need of a GOP intervention. Make no mistake the mainstream media will use any excuse to avoid putting Hillary under the microscope.
