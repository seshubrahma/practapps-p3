Glenn is on the record, repeatedly, expressing concern for all people, especially the President of the United States. With every scandal at the Secret Service, Glenn has implored his audience to pray for the safety of the President and for the restoration of the Secret Serviceâ€™s judgement and abilities. And to answer the question before it has been asked: No one from any governmental agency, Secret Service, police force, etc. has been in contact with our company about this story in any way, shape, or form. For the past several months, Glenn has warned his audience, and anyone else willing to listen, that the current political climate is worse than anything he has ever witnessed or studied in American history.
