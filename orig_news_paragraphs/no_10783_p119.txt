Somewhere in the middle of the Economy’ First questioner asks Sanders about raising taxes on the middle class and how that would help him (makes around $40, 000 a year) and his family. Sanders says "we’ll raise your taxes" if you are somewhere in the middle of the economy. He says he will raise taxes $500 and claims healthcare costs will be lowered by $5, 000. But the line about raising taxes on people who are "somewhere in the middle of the economy" will be a tough sell, though Chris, the questioner, replies that he will gladly pay more in taxes if he doesn’t have to pay healthcare premiums.
