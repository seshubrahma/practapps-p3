Washington (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence cast a historic   vote Tuesday to confirm Betsy DeVos as the next education secretary after the Senate was evenly divided over the controversial pick. The   vote ends Trumpâ€™s toughest confirmation battle yet. Senate Democrats debated through the night and into Tuesday morning in a   attempt to derail DeVos, buoyed by support from Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.   DeVos was sworn into office shortly after 6 p. m. ET.
