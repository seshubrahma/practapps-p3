Former Dallas lawyer Dolly Kyle, who says she had a   affair with Clinton, claimed in a recent interview with this reporter that "Billy" Clinton, as she called him, once boasted to her that he had had sex with about 2, 000 women. She described Clinton as a "sex addict" who has some "sick, sick need" to "control women. " The 2, 000 number is similar to a figure provided by Linda Tripp, a pivotal figure in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
