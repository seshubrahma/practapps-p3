Mr. Trump swept into office promising to dispense with the political correctness of Washington’s establishment, and his choices reflect that. President George W. Bush assembled a Republican cabinet with a variety of shades of conservative ideology, including some members who challenged the president. Mr. Trump’s early decisions suggest he favors a cabinet that will echo his opinions. The choices also suggest that on the perennially vexing question of how the government should balance security and civil liberties, Mr. Trump will throw his weight firmly behind security, in matters of both counterterrorism and traditional law enforcement.
