We have faith in   Trump, and although General Kelly does not have immigration experience, we recognize that he comes in with stellar credentials. We caution, however, that because   Trumpâ€™s meteoric rise was built on border security, we believe no other   nominee will be under more pressure to produce. The NBPC was proud to endorse   Trump very early on, and we stood by him through thick and thin, and we continue to do so. However, our endorsement does come with expectations.
