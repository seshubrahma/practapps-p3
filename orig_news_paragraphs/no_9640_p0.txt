Tuesday at the White House press briefing, President Barack Obama addressed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s plan to cut off funds sent to Mexico through money transfers, called remittances, unless Mexico payed for the border wall.   Obama dismissed the viability of Trump’s plan and argued it would increase immigration into the United States from Mexico. " I’ve been clear earlier that I’m getting questions constantly about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made," Obama said.
