’s presidential transition team issued Friday a stunning rebuke of Intelligence communities who have said, in recent reports from CNN and the Washington Post, that Russian hackers not only wanted to disrupt US elections but actively worked toward getting the Republican presidential nominee elected. RNC Communications Director Sean Spicer attacked the New York Times for reporting that the Russian government was involved in hacking the 2016 presidential election, according to Intelligence experts. The paper also reported that the RNC was hacked. Although Graham    who also ran for president in 2016    did not dismiss the election results, he said he was concerned about Russia’s involvement.
