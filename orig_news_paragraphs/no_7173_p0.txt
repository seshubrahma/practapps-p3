Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s "Happening Now,"   Donald Trump’s transition team senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said, "It is very clear the political left is fomenting an opposition trying to discredit, delegitimize what is obviously the election. "   Conway said, "David Plouffe went out and started Organizing for America, that then became Organizing for Action for President Obama trying to push through Obamacare and some of the things he wanted. If you read the New York Times article this morning by Jonathan Martin where I am quoted, it is very clear the political left is already fomenting this permanent opposition trying to discredit, delegitimize what is obviously the election, solidified yesterday by the electors. " "
