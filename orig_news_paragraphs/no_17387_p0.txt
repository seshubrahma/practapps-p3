 (CNN) Donald Trump’s pick to be ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, said in an interview earlier this year that the Trump administration’s approach to the   peace process would be guided by what the Israeli government wants to pursue. Friedman, a fiercely   bankruptcy lawyer who first worked for Trump in the 1990s, added that a Trump administration would undo the Iran nuclear deal and expressed his belief that most Arabs would prefer to live under Israeli rule.   The comments reinforce Friedman’s hardline position on the   conflict, which is a departure from   US support for the   solution.
