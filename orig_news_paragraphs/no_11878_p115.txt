I offer the people a different choice from the other candidates, one they deserve to be able to make for themselves, as they support the principles in which they really believe. That is why I won’t listen as the pundits and politicians decree from on high. I refuse to play by Washington’s political rule book, or subjugate myself to the whims of the political class. At times this decision has put me at a disadvantage, subjecting my supporters to underhanded tricks from other campaigns.
