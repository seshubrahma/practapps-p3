This is a safe, stable pick. If she wants somebody who is not going to cause any controversy, somebody who is a sort of reliable person for campaigning and governing, he would be it. As one Democrat pointed out to me in this week in bringing up Vilsack, he also would have no impact at all on the Senate. If you think about her other options, almost all of them would have some impact on control of the Senate.
