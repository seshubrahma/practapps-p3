Neither the Black Lives Matter national organization nor its Chicago chapter responded to CNN’s requests for comment Thursday. DeRay Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter supporter, said those linking the attack to the movement don’t have their facts straight. " It goes without saying that the actions being branded by the   as the ’BLM Kidnapping’ have nothing to do   the movement," he tweeted.
