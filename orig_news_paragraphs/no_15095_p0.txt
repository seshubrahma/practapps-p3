Washington (CNN) White House press secretary Sean Spicer said twice Monday that the Trump administration will respond if the regime of Syrian President Bashar   uses barrel bombs against his own people, something thatâ€™s been a regular occurrence in the   civil war. " If you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bombing to innocent people, I think you can see a response from this president," Spicer said in response to a question during his daily briefing.
