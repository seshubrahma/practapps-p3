One big difference between Mr. Trump’s proposal and current policy is that the Obama administration has told enforcement agents to use discretion and avoid deporting undocumented immigrants with families in the country who committed no crimes or minor offenses like traffic violations. Mr. Trump said he would cancel any programs based on Mr. Obama’s discretionary policies, and he appears to be far more willing to deport people who have committed less serious crimes. Another large difference is the speed and sweep of the deportation drive Mr. Trump proposes. He suggested he would find ways to deport many immigrants with new, expedited procedures.
