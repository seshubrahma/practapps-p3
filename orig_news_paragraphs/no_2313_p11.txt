Navy SEALs were unsuccessful in freeing an American and his Australian colleague from the Taliban in a raid in Afghanistan last month, officials said. Kevin King, an American university professor, and Timothy Weeks, the Australian, were taken at gunpoint on Aug. 7 from their vehicle near Darulaman Road in Kabul, above. President Obama personally authorized the raid, and officials said the SEALS are believed to have missed the men by hours. _
