I’m just saying what I feel and I feel like the organization is a great organization and, you know, I don’t think that’s their organization that would give me repercussions for saying something I felt during my own off time and they usually have everybody have their own voice there, as long as it’s not distracting towards the season or anything and we’re not playing right now , so I feel like I’m pretty good.
