The difference, of course, is that a Christian seeks forgiveness from God, while a  a progressive might seek absolution by resolving not to think implicitly biased thoughts, and, of course, by  spending more tax money on immigrants. Yet in the meantime, the    mantra is politically precious to the left, because it advances the notion that all extant institutions are inherently racist â€”  and thus justifying massive legal and political intervention to "fix" them. Of course, some might conclude that an endless battle against such a   concept as "implicit bias" is really just a recipe for an endless battle against human nature. Others might wonder if one can retrain, for example, the police and still keep the crime rate down.
