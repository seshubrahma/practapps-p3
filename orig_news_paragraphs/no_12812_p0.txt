DES MOINES, Iowa  —   Rep. Steve King ( ) the   endorser of Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) told Breitbart News on Monday evening that Team Cruz is "confident without being cocky" just hours before the caucuses open here at 7 p. m. CT. [King said:  I think that’s where things are. Cruz peaked a little bit earlier than his strategy would have liked to happen, and when that happens all guns are turned on the guy because he’s the political king of the hill. If the caucus were another month from now or two months from now, it would be really hard to sustain ourselves at the top of the heap.
