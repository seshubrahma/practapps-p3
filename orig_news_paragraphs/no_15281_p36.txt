The social secretary oversees the planning and execution of all White House social events, according to a White House statement, including state dinners, parties, official   events, and the first lady’s initiatives. Daniel Fisher took over as head of the White House visitors office along the way, a major role filled as she prepared for the egg roll. It wasn’t until late March that the East Wing got an official spokesperson, snagging White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham to serve as the first lady’s communications director. Grisham was the director of traveling press during the 2016 campaign, and her relationships will be helpful as she integrates messaging between the East and West wings.
