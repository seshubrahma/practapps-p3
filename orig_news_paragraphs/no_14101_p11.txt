It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall," the source said. Another US official told CNN the Trump transition team has also reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers’ Southwest Division, that has previously built border security fencing, to determine what previous fencing cost and how it was constructed. The team also asked Interior several questions, including how much wall would be needed, in an effort to determine a solid number of miles of wall necessary to secure the southern border. Trump’s announcement comes as a   delegation of Mexican leaders arrive in the US for talks.
