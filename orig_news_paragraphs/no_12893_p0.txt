Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump responded to President Barack Obama’s assertion that he was "unfit" to hold the office of the presidency, pointing out Hillary Clinton’s failures. ["They have betrayed our security and our workers, and Hillary Clinton has proven herself unfit to serve in any government office," Trump said referring to the Obama presidency.   Trump cited the   foreign policy failures   —   including losing Iraq, Libya, and Syria to Islamic state terrorists.
