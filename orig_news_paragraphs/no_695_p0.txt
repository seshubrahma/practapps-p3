Sitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isnâ€™t a lot of money in 1997. Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, "O. K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion. "
