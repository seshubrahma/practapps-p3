Greg Cote of the Miami Herald asks the question: ‘What NFL team will be brave enough (and smart enough) to give Kaepernick a chance? ’ [The sports writer, therefore, implies that team owners who prefer signing players who respect the National Anthem and don’t wear socks mocking police officers as pigs are cowards and stupid.    Incredibly, Cote blames team owners for not hiring the "healthy"    quarterback "coming into his physical prime," who has "taken his team to a Super Bowl" because they may fear negative tweets from President Donald Trump.
