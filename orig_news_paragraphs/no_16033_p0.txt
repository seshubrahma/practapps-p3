 (CNN) President Barack Obama laid into Donald Trump’s protectionist trade stance Wednesday, blasting the presumptive Republican nominee’s call for a withdrawal from trade deals as the "wrong medicine. "  Obama’s comments, which came during a trip to Canada to meet with his fellow North American heads of state, came as Trump fights a public war with the business lobby over the issue.   "Ordinary people who have concerns about trade have a legitimate gripe about globalization," Obama continued, pointing to "growing inequality and stagnant wages."
