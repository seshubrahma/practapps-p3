On July 29, Business Insider published an interview with Kevin Roberts, chairman of global ad agency Saatchi  Saatchi. In it, Roberts seemed dismissive of the gender inequality within the ad industry, where only 11. 5% of agencies’ creative directors are women.    "I can’t talk about sexual discrimination because we’ve never had that problem, thank goodness," he said, adding that he doesn’t spend "any time" considering gender issues in his company. He also posed the theory that women occupy fewer leadership roles because they "reach a certain point in their careers" and choose happiness over   success.
