After Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 from Amsterdam was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 civilians on board, for example, local rebel commanders at first bragged about shooting down an aircraft at the very spot. When the extent of the tragedy emerged, Russia went into overdrive pumping out alternative versions, most of them fanciful and most blaming Ukraine. One such version suggested that it was a failed attempt to shoot down President Vladimir V. Putinâ€™s jet, which was aloft at the same time. A   investigation concluded that the powerful    missile system that took down the airliner had been trucked in from Russia at the request of   separatists and returned over the border the same night.
