Hayek explained in the last century —  that "democratic" socialism is an oxymoron, because the state cannot micromanage our economic affairs without ending freedom as we know it. Young Americans are particularly ignorant about socialism —  not only because they have no personal memories of it, but because they have been educated to see it as a noble idea that failed because of political mistakes and outside pressure.

S. economics classes.
