Raddatz, who was then the White House correspondent for ABC News, and her producer Patel were also provided with personal accounts of the collusion between ACORN and the Obama campaign in October 2008, Moncrief told Breitbart News.

But if Raddatz ran the story, the election may have turned out differently, especially had the public known the depths to which this scandal went. Moncrief told Breitbart News that she met with Raddatz’s producer Patel in Washington after initially having made contact with Raddatz herself through a representative.
