MARA, Chad  —   From Yemen to Syria to here in Central Africa, the Trump administration is relying on Special Operations forces to intensify its promised fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups as senior officials embrace an   strategy to minimize the American military’s footprint overseas. In Africa, President Trump is expected to soon approve a Pentagon proposal to remove constraints on Special Operations airstrikes and raids in parts of Somalia to target suspected militants with the Shabab, an extremist group linked to Al Qaeda. Critics say that the change  —   in one of the few rejections of President Barack Obama’s guidelines for the elite forces   —   would bypass rules that seek to prevent civilian deaths from drone attacks and commando operations.
