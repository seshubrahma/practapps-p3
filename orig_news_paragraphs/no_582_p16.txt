The Obama administration faced it when it began to overhaul the health care system eight years ago. Many liberals argued that the United States should move toward a   system in which the government pays for all health care, called a   system. The Obama team saw that approach as appealing in theory, but too disruptive in practice so many Americans had become accustomed to receiving health insurance through their employer that it didnâ€™t seem feasible to make a wholesale shift to a new and, perhaps, more efficient system. In other words, decisions that lawmakers made decades or even a century ago have essentially locked us into ways of doing things, as the cost of changing looms more heavily than the potential benefits of trying something different.
