Some conservatives (including me) are left wondering how different this electoral cycle might be if Pence was at the top of the ticket instead. But while Pence’s performance Tuesday evening will be a bright spot in what has otherwise been an abysmal stretch for the Trump campaign, it’s not immediately clear whether a vice presidential debate will impact the race more broadly.   And over the next week, the Trump campaign will surely be asked to reconcile the differences in policy positions articulated by Pence and Trump on areas such as U. S. policy toward Russia and Syria.    It’s ultimately up to Trump to turn in a better performance on Sunday in St. Louis and again when he and Hillary Clinton debate in Las Vegas on October 19, if he wants to alter the trajectory of his own campaign.
