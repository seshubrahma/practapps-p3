But I will also say this, I think Trump is getting nervous because he is seeing in virtually every national poll, last NBC poll we were 18 points ahead of him, statewide polls we are way ahead of him. People in America know that we cannot have a president like Trump who insults Mexicans, who insults women, who insults Muslims, who insults veterans in John McCain. People are catching on to Donald Trump. That’s why he’s getting reckless.
