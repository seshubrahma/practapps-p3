Mr. Pence said in a statement that he was "offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump" in the video, and cast Mr. Trumpâ€™s second debate with Hillary Clinton, on Sunday, as an urgent moment to turn around the campaign. " I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them," Mr. Pence said, adding, "We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.
