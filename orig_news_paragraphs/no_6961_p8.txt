During the interview, Binney referred to a 2008 report referencing two NSA whistleblowers who said they worked at the agency â€™s station in Fort Gordon, Georgia and were asked to not only monitor phone calls of U. S. citizens but transcribe them. Utilizing data provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden, the Guardian and Washington Post in June 2013 released a series of articles reporting that the NSA was collecting the telephone records of millions of Americans. Prior to those reports, National Intelligence Director James Clapper claimed on March 12, 2013 during an open session of the Senate Intelligence Committee that the NSA was not "wittingly" collecting data on Americans.
