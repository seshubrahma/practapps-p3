While noting that UNPACU initially supported the Obama "normalization" process, the letter concluded that the   implications of the policy, particularly the increase in human rights violations against dissidents, has forced them to rescind their support. Among the specific instances of this mentioned in the letter are "the tripling of the number of political prisoners on the island," the beatings dissidents regularly receive from government agents, and robberies of dissident homes. A third prominent dissident, Agustín López Canino, told EFE, according to the U. S.  Martí news network, that he expects Trump to "be fair to dissidents and the exile community and condition the situation on human rights in Cuba, that facilitate a true presence of civil society" in the government.
