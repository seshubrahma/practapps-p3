The tombstone first appeared in the middle of the night one night in March, just after more than a thousand activists and supporters of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign had participated in a demonstration in Central Park, as Breitbart’s Lee Stranahan reported. In a brief interview with the New York Daily News this week, the    Whiteley said the tombstone  —   which was seized and later released by the New York Police Department and led the Secret Service to visit the artist  —   was intended to make a "pointed statement" about the "hateful" nature of Trump’s campaign. " I was surprised at how few artists were speaking out about Trump," Whiteley told the Daily News.
