Pyongyang paraded two new intercontinental ballistic   canisters as well as displaying its   ballistic missile and a   version of the same for the first time, according to analysts. The regime followed that with an attempted missile test Sunday from the eastern port of Sinpo. If that test leads to a nuclear test or an ICBM launch, there would be "a powerful punishing measure that North Korean authority canâ€™t endure," South Korean officials said.
