Sunday on CBS’s "Face the Nation,"   columnist for The Washington Post Michael Gerson said some Republicans are at stage of panic over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.    Gerson said, "Well, I think that Republican leaders, like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have proven that it doesn’t matter what Trump says, they’re willing to swallow it. He has already accused his opponent of possible complicity in murder, and now he’s accused the president of treason. There’s nothing they won’t take.
