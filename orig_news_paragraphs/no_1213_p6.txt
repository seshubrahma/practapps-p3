A regular guest on "The O’Reilly Factor," Mr. Trump has attended baseball games with Mr. O’Reilly, praised his collection of   political books, and, as   granted him a prominent interview that aired during Fox’s Super Bowl pregame show. The men share a taste for vanilla milkshakes, bantering   about how many of the confections Mr. O’Reilly has bought for his friend. The two have something more ominous in common, too: Each has been accused by women of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. Like the president, Mr. O’Reilly maintains that the accusations against him are without merit.
