Killer Mike (because he likes to "kill microphones") and I met a few years back in our hometown of Atlanta. We were introduced by a mutual friend, and after Ferguson happened, I invited him on my show. He talked about being a black father in this country (and his police officer dad) why his rhymes intersect with politics and the reason he and his wife Shay bought a barbershop.
