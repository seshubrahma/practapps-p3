O. said as much, reflecting on Mr. Trumpâ€™s nominations with dismay and predicting, or perhaps hoping, that Americans would reject the direction of his government as too extreme. " Donald Trump the candidate claimed he would rein in the power of Wall Street traders, protect Social Security and Medicare, and ensure all kids have great schools," Mr. Trumka said.
