The last major terrorist attack in a Russian city was in Volgograd in 2013. " If somebody announces that it is related to the Russian invasion in Syria, it would be a sensitive scenario for Putin, because the Syria campaign would lose support inside Russia," said Kirill Rogov, a political analyst, while adding that it was too early to connect the attack to Mr. Putin’s Syria policy with any certainty. The dead and wounded had barely been evacuated before the factions in Russia’s heated political sphere began blaming one another.
