Why? Because he personally recused himself from all things related to the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia the day after he was sworn into office. What Sessions didn’t explain is why he waited a month to tell the public    and his own associates    that he had stepped aside from the probe. Comey testified last week that as of February 14, he still believed Sessions had not recused himself    but that he almost certainly would.
