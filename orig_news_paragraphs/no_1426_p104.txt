In 2011, the casinos reported leasing a Trump helicopter for $390, 000 and spending $236, 000 for "Trump labeled merchandise," including $197, 000 for Trump Ice bottled water. In retrospect, David Hanlon, a veteran casino executive who ran Merv Griffinâ€™s Atlantic City operations at the time of the Resorts battle, said, Mr. Trump succeeded in repeatedly convincing investors, bankers and Wall Street that "his name had real value. " " They were so in love with him that they came back a second, third and fourth time," Mr. Hanlon said.
