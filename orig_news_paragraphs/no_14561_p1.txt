" Senator McCain traveled to northern Syria last week to visit US forces deployed there and to discuss the   campaign and ongoing operations to retake Raqqa," Tarallo said, using another term for the terror group.   Calling the visit an opportunity "to assess dynamic conditions on the ground" there, his office praised President Donald Trump for requesting a review of the US strategy to defeat ISIS. McCain has argued for more aggressive military involvement in the Syrian Civil War.
