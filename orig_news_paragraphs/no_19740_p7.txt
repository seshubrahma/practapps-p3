Lyndon Johnson was said to compare the intelligence community to his boyhood cow, Bessie, who would swing her "shit smeared" tail through a bucket of milk as soon as he’d finished milking her.

(Woolsey, incidentally, had been advising the Trump transition team until resigning yesterday, reportedly due to "growing tensions over Trump’s vision for intelligence agencies. ")
