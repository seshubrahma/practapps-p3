While Franklin Roosevelt was not a   strategist, he was a prodigal tactician with a very clever ability to influence people and immediate events with an extraordinary sense of timing. Many political wonks and historians agree that Kennedy and Johnson were powerful politicians who understood the game and played it energetically, shrewdly, and unflinchingly. Both were crafty,   opportunists, able to use any event to accomplish a goal. Clearly the same can be said of Trump.
