At the time of the shooting I would guess somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 25, but it is hard to tell because it is early in the morning and we do have work early in the morning, and sometimes after people have gotten their at bats in during batting practice, they then leave rather than continue to field or try to get a second round of batting practice. So some of the congressmen had started to leave but we still had, I would think,   at an absolute minimum, maybe as high as  . And of course we had another dozen or so staff members who help with our team. These younger guys, they can throw pitches that are strikes with speed.
