Mrs. Clinton sorely needs to win over liberals and millennials, who strongly favored Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary many of them still doubt her trustworthiness as a progressive and oppose her stands on Wall Street reform, free trade, the minimum wage and fracking. But with these voters, too, Mr. Pence gives Mrs. Clinton some breathing room because of his   conservative positions on abortion and gay rights. Mr. Pence has signed some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, including a bill banning abortion based on a fetusâ€™s race, sex, or disabilities like Down syndrome. He has also opposed   marriage and allowing gays to serve in the military and transgender people to use bathrooms of their choosing.
