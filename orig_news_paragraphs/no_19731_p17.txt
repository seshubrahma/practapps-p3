It’s not clear how a new tax would affect corporate behavior. Oil majors have been factoring the likelihood of a price on carbon into their   financial planning for some time. Exxon first started accounting for a tax in 2007, setting its estimations for a price as high as $80 per ton in some regions. The company’s own spokesperson told the Houston Chronicle in 2016 that curbing warming to a 1. 6 degree target —  "well below two degrees," per the Paris Agreement’s text —  would drive the cost of carbon up to $2000 per ton, far beyond the level set out in any proposal currently on the table.
