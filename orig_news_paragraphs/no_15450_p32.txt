Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland, made national headlines when he talked with Trump during a White House meeting in February about fixing the gang violence problem In Chicago, including comments he later revised on meeting with top gang thugs. (Scott, who later said he would meet with former gang members, said Thursday progress on the issue has been made, but some initiatives are in the early stages.) He told CNN that Comey was a "national distraction" and needed to be fired. He thinks the President tried to make it work.
