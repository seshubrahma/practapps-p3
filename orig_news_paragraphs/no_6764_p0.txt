Dr. Sebastian Gorka, deputy adviser to President Donald Trump and former National Security editor for Breitbart News, discussed the London terror attack with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily. ["We need to note that for jihadists, dates are very important:   itself was the anniversary of a great defeat against jihadi fighters centuries ago. The fact that this happened on the anniversary of the Brussels attack really should not have surprised anybody," Gorka said.    "The attack itself shouldn’t have come out of the blue," Gorka continued, referring to Kassam’s earlier mention of the   decapitation of British soldier Lee Rigby, in which a vehicle was also used as a weapon.
