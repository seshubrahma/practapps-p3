Iran has a rich history and culture, but the people of Iran have endured hardship and despair under their leadersâ€™ reckless pursuit of conflict and terror. Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve. The decisions we make will affect countless lives. King Salman, I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history, and for your massive investment in America, its industry and its jobs.
