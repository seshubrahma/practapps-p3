["This is a commitment that the   made numerous times on the campaign trail, that he remains firmly committed to," Jason Miller, a transition team spokesman, said Friday. His remarks came on the heels of Trump’s nomination of David Friedman to be the U. S. ambassador to Israel.   In a statement, Friedman said he looked forward to working from the embassy in Jerusalem. Miller said that a timeline as to when the embassy would be moved would be "premature" at this point, but reiterated Trump’s commitment to the transfer.
