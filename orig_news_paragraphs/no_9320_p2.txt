The NBPC, though a union, poses a unique challenge to traditional conservative ideologues because it is the only legal mechanism for Border Patrol agents to advocate and defends themselves. The group is widely conservative, has a lengthy history of endorsing Republicans, and while conservatives are largely in favor of border security and   they would have no ability to obtain the information needed to properly secure the border without the NBPC. Border security advocates would have to rely upon   bureaucrats in the management of the agency to determine what the realities are along the border were it not for the NBPC providing a mechanism for actual agents who work the border to have a voice. The latest attack on Border Patrol agents comes in the form of an online petition to the   to boot the NBPC for simply expressing an opinion that contradicts what most leftists want.
