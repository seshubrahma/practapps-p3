Armstrong Williams, a close confidant and business manager for Dr. Ben Carson, told Breitbart News exclusively on Friday that Carson is confident he will   as a formidable candidate, place top three in Iowa, and win South Carolina —  and eventually win the GOP nomination in 2016. ["He remains in control," Williams said in a phone interview. " He made the changes that were necessary to give him the best chance to surge again to place first, second or third in Iowa, to win South Carolina, and establish the necessary momentum to win the GOP nomination. "  Both Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett and communications director Doug Watts resigned on New Year’s Eve, a major campaign   just a month before voting begins in the Iowa caucuses on February 1.
