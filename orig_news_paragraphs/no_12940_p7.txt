In 2012, 56 percent of South Carolina Republicans made their final decision in the last three days of the campaign. In 2008, just 34 percent made a final decision in the last three days. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this latest poll is the terrible headwinds against the three "establishment" candidates, Bush, Kasich and Rubio. Together, they earn just 30 percent support from likely Republican voters.
