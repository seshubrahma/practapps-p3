Sweden’s Minister for Culture and Democracy has told Facebook to censor   "fake news" voluntarily or else face "compulsory measures" by the government. [Alice Bah Kuhnke indicated that the government would be willing to take a tougher line on Facebook following the publication of an open letter to the company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. The Green Party minister said the piece was "of great benefit" to the national debate on censoring "hate".   The letter, penned by Expressen’s culture editor Jonas Gardell, says Zuckerberg should feel "ashamed" because by allowing people to post links to   "fake" news on Facebook, the   social media chief is "providing liars with a megaphone".
