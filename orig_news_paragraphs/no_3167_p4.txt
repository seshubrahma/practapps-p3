While mostly active in Turkey, the PKK has established a presence in northern Iraq, helping eradicate ISIS from the homeland of the Yazidi religious minority, Sinjar. Turkish officials consider the PYD and the PKK the same organization and have petitioned the United States to cease cooperating with the YPG, among the most successful militias fighting ISIS in Syria or Iraq. On Wednesday, Turkish airstrikes attacked both YPG and PKK positions in Syria and Iraq. In Syria, at least 18 YPG soldiers died in the attack.
