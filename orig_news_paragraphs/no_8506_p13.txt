We are going to work with the NBPC, and not just in a token way. But in depth, on a regular basis, they are going to have a direct line into our policy making on a routine basis. We are going to sit down with them and figure out how to secure this border and how to make life better for their agents and for the country. It will be a new day in America for the NBPC.
