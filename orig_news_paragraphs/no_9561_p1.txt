It assumes that each candidate wins all of the congressional districts in the regions where he is currently ahead, and that Trump and Cruz split congressional districts in regions where they are running even, with Trump taking slightly more.   Delegates are awarded on a    basis, three per district. Ten are also awarded to the statewide winner, and three state officials are required to vote for the winner on the first ballot. If Trump were to win 94 delegates, that would probably move him close to, but not past, the overall total of 1, 237 he will need to win the partyâ€™s nomination on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.
