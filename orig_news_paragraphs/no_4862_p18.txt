President Trump has mandated that the Secretary of Homeland Security regularly collect and make public available information regarding the number and types of acts of   violence against women, including honor killings in the United States by foreign nationals. Several studies have concluded that while the reported number of honor killings in the United States is relatively low —  rough estimates of 23 to 27 killings annually —  the number of honor violence victims increases exponentially when other nonlethal forms of honor violence are added to the equation. Information about honor violence is closely concealed by families and communities. Victims or potential victims may not report victimization out of fear.
