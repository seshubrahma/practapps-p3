One other regrettable byproduct of the   hysteria over the "travel ban" is that the public spotlight was diverted from the equally important executive order signed by Trump two days earlier on interior immigration enforcement. That executive order aiming to end "sanctuary cities" and other unlawful obstructions to immigration law enforcement has not yet been challenged in federal court, but sooner or later, it will be. Why? Because the left thinks they own the courts â€”   they can always find an activist district court judge to agree with their noxious views.
