About a year ago, the Odgaards sold Görtz Haus to Harvest Bible Chapel, a church   that had been meeting in rented quarters. Its senior pastor, Ryan Jorgenson, 36, leads Sunday services in sneakers and jeans. He was trained and sent to Des Moines three years ago by a   network of conservative evangelical churches based in Elgin, Ill. that believe the Bible is God’s inerrant word. Mr. Jorgenson jumped at buying the Odgaards’ picturesque property on the busiest street in Grimes, a suburb of Des Moines.
