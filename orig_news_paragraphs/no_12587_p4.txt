In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News shortly after the incident, Otis  —   who described himself as a "Bernie Democrat "  —   said he had originally planned to remove the star intact and auction it off to benefit women who have accused Trump of sexual assault. " I was just so fed up, so saddened and fed up by Mr. Trump and how he continues to denigrate women, and he continues to joke and make fun about sexual violence and his own exploits against women," Otis told the paper.
