In Next Door, One of the others charged in the case in the third example —   Abdurahman Yasin Daud —  is a native Somalian who wound up in Minnesota, thanks to the U. S. government. But not only was he allowed into the country, according to the Tribune wire service piece in the Chicago Tribune, he was granted "permanent resident" status by the U. S. government. Maybe if federal policy did not let people like this into the United States in the first place, FBI agents would not have to chase people like Daud and his buddies across the country as they plot to leave the United States to join the Islamic State in Syria.
