And White House ethics officials have now begun circulating a new version of the questionnaire. The new form, unlike the previous one used by the Obama administration, asks nominees just one question about conflicts of interest and skips over queries about ties to corporations or investments in properties, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times. The   form focuses mainly on questions of character and potential lawsuits that could arise from sexual and racial harassment claims. The White House did not respond to emails and calls requesting comment for this article.
