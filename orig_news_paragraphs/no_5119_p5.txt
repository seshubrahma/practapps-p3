In his brief speech, Scheer, aged 38, making him younger than Trudeau and newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron, said he would get rid of the unpopular carbon tax enacted by the Liberal government and slammed Trudeau for being more focused on   than on the concerns of Canadian families. Scheer also said that as prime minister he would resume Canada’s involvement in fighting Islamic State in the Middle East. Shortly after becoming premier in 2015, Justin Trudeau ended Canada’s military participation in air strikes against the terror group.
