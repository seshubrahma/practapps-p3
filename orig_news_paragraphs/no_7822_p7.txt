" Rubio’s problem is not just that voters are "indignant," but that they’re weary of   upbeat rhetoric, especially on the immigration issue. There are few other issues where mushy rhetoric is so liberally slathered atop grim realities, or where bromides are administered to numb our common sense.    Soaring rhetoric about huddled masses yearning for the American Dream in a nation of immigrants hangs heavy in the air, but Republican voters want to know what their prospective candidate is going to do about illegal alien murderers who skip through our immigration system with impunity,   tidal waves rewriting the U. S. census, and visa programs used to replace American workers with cheap imported labor.
