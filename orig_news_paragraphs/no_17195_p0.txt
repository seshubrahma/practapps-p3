 (CNN) Donald Trumpâ€™s baseless assertion that there were "millions of people who voted illegally," and the Jill   recount in up to three states, both desecrate the beauty of our democracy, revered worldwide: that the winners humbly accept their victory and the losers graciously accept defeat. There is absolutely no evidence of widespread voter fraud, much less that there were millions of illegal voters. It diminishes the office of the presidency for the   to peddle these allegations.
