But, to a nation dying on the desert of Political Correctness, that is salvation enough. We would rather spend the next four years fighting a potentially dying Party and an America First President, though both are not   in our principles, than figuring out how to survive a third Obama term run by the feeble, dishonest, Alinskyite heads of the   (for those who care to see) Clinton dynasty. There is a very small space between #NeverHillary and #NeverTrump.
