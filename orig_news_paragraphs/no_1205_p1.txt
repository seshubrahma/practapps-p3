The ruling on Tuesday comes as gay rights advocates have voiced concern about the potential rollback of protections under President Trump. While the Supreme Court legalized   marriage, many other legal protections, including in employment and housing, have not been extended at all levels to gay people. The White House considered and then scuttled a plan to overturn   protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. But the Trump administration also rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity.
