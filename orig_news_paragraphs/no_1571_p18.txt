Republicans enjoy a more substantial majority in the House, where Democrats must capture 30 more seats to take control. But Mr. Trump’s difficulties have become so acute that there is rising concern that Republicans could lose enough House seats to loosen Mr. Ryan’s grip and, in subsequent elections, threaten his majority. Speaking in private to a group of donors last week at a political conference in Colorado sponsored by the industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, Mr. Ryan expressed concerns that the House was increasingly at risk, according to a Republican who was present for the conversation. Mr. Ryan implored the donors not to assume that the House was impregnable and not to entirely focus their efforts on retaining the Senate.
