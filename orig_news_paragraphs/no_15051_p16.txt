On Thursday night, as Trump was weighing the most consequential national security decision of his presidency, it was the Kushner wing of Trump’s staff who appeared to win over their boss.   Instead of leaning upon the nationalist worldview of Bannon    who has argued against US intervention abroad and was a key architect of Trump’s "America First" policy     Trump dove headfirst into a foreign conflict, ordering airstrikes in Syria to punish the regime of Bashar   for its use of chemical weapons on civilians. The decision was made just ahead of Trump’s dinner with Xi.
