For example, the current House Speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan, supports a radical measure that would have allowed business groups to freely hire Americans who ask for higher wages, and he changed a law in 2015 to allow many additional   workers to be be imported each year.   Nassif’s confession matches the lessons learned from change to labor and immigration law made by Arizona, as described in a 2015 study by Moody’s Analytics, a Wall Street investment firm. Arizona’s labor and immigration reforms began in 2004, and the state’s population of roughly 450, 000 illegals gradually dropped by roughly 180, 000 people from 2007 to 2012, the WSJ reported in February. Because of the 40 percent drop in illegal labor, the wages earned by Americans rose significantly, said the analysis by Moody’s Analytics.
