WASHINGTON   —    The Trump administration defended on Sunday a reorganization of the National Security Council that elevates the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  —   a political adviser with no direct national security role   —   to full membership and downgrades the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
