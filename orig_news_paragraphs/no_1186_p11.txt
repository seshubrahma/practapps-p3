Irena Briganti, a Fox News spokeswoman, declined to comment on advertising decisions, Ms. Roginsky’s lawsuit or Ms. Walsh’s news conference. Ms. Walsh, speaking in Los Angeles, repeated the account she provided to The Times. She said that Mr. O’Reilly did not follow through on a verbal offer to make her a contributor to his show after she declined an invitation to go to his hotel suite after a 2013 dinner in Los Angeles that was arranged by his secretary. She has not received a settlement and said she does not want any money.
