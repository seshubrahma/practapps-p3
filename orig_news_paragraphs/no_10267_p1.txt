Following the accusation, Lafayette police said there were no witnesses or surveillance footage to back up the story. After the New York Times, Times Picayune, Washington Post and Huffington Post all ran with the womanâ€™s claims, Lafayette police said the entire story was fabricated, as Breitbart Texas reported. " During the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males," Lafayette police said in a statement.
