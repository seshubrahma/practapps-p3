Democratic Senators think homeland security chief John Kelly is not doing enough to implement their Democratic priorities, according to a litany of partisan complaints showcased by Politico. [The Democratic priorities for Kelly include him ending the enforcement of immigration laws which keep Americans’ wages from disappearing in a flood of cheap labor and cheap drugs, him publicly backstabbing other leaders in President Donald Trump’s cabinet, and him sabotaging Trump’s   promise to build a border wall.    "I would like to think he would be a moderating force   …      He has an understanding of why people want to come to this country, so I would think, hopefully, that would be part of his thinking," a disappointed Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto grumbled to Politico.
