Mr. Pavlic worked for decades installing and repairing   and heating units, but three years ago, with multiple sclerosis advancing, he had to leave his job. By 2015, Ms. Pavlic was supporting her husband and their three children on an annual salary of $9, 000, earned at a restaurant. That year, they tapped a county program funded by Congress, called the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, to help repair their house. The next year, they voted for Donald J. Trump, who has moved to eliminate the HOME program.
