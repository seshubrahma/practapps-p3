Committee members declined to provide   details on the investigation. " We have a document that we’ve signed and we’ll be giving out obviously, some announcement at some point," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes told CNN when asked if the members had agreed on the terms of their investigation. Nunes, a California Republican, added that members have already been briefed on the transcripts of calls between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador and are proceeding deliberately on the investigation.
