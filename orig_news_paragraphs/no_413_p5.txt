Mr. Depp, by his own admission, often had no idea what was occurring in his bank accounts and would regularly sign whatever documents the Management Group put before him, without bothering to read what they said, on the assumption that his financial adviser "was behaving as a loyal fiduciary and prudent steward of his funds and finances," his lawsuit asserts. And this is where the Trump administration comes in, because that word  —   fiduciary   —   is at the heart of a battle raging within the federal government over how much responsibility we ought to bear in managing our own finances, and how much we should trust the people giving us advice. (Fair warning: The next few paragraphs are wonky, but I promise we’ll get back to Johnny Depp.)
