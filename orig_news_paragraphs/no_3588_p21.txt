We now know that girls as young as eight years old died in the terror attack in Manchester last night. We know in neighbouring communities, young girls were targeted, groomed, and raped by Pakistani, more often than not Muslim, men living in the United Kingdom. And while the political left hurls accusations of a "war on women" at the right, for refusing to accept taxpayer subsidy of contraception or abortion, the real war on women is taking place in British towns and cities, conducted by fellow travellers of the high chiefs of multiculturalism. We must protect our beautiful daughters with the beautiful daughters of St. Augustine: courage, and anger.
