But according to Robertson Williams, a professor at the University of Maryland and director of academic programs for Resources for the Future, a   group that studied the climate change agreement, it is difficult to know exactly what the economic impacts of withdrawing will be. Williams was interviewed by the Boston public radio station in May where he was asked about the economic impact of leaving the agreement. " One of the problems we have, weâ€™re much better at modeling the cost of doing something to reduce emissions than we are modeling the cost of doing nothing," Williams said.
