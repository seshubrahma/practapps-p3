Yeah, these people are about as credible and reliable as President Obama drawing red lines in Iran or Syria. And just as we are learning that women and children in Syria were gassed with chlorine that may or may not have been funded with $400 million in laundered ransom cash President Obama had flown into Tehran in an unmarked cargo plane, the American political media was seized with the notion that somehow Donald Trump is crazy. Well, if gassing children and sending my   tax money to the worldâ€™s largest theocratic sponsor of terrorism is sane, then please tell me where the hell the line for crazy is! It was widely speculated in every corner of the media last week that Mr. Trump suffers mental illness.
