Mitt Romney in 2012 got 59% of the white vote that, translated into 206 electoral votes. Romney got 17% that is all, of the nonwhite vote. Trump by every measure would do worse than that. Which means he would have to get not just the 65% of the white vote to win that Ronald Reagan got sweeping 49 states, he would have to get 70% of the white vote.
