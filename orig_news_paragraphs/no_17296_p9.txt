Mattis appears to be someone in that mold. Trump presumably is drawing heavily on the military    not just because he seems to like strong leaders, but because, at a time when Americans are questioning their institutions, the military remains one of the few that enjoys widespread credibility and respect. In this regard    and perhaps despite some of Trumpâ€™s broad campaign criticism of US generals involved in drawing up plans against ISIS    generals have the authority and legitimacy to serve as a counterbalance to imprudent action. If Trump is likely to listen to anyone outside of his family, it could be the military.
