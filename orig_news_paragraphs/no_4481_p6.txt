Following President Obama’s announcement of new sanctions on Russia in December, shortly before Trump took office, Putin said in a statement he would not retaliate, calling President Obama’s actions "regrettable" and implying he would wait for Trump to assume the presidency before evaluating how bilateral relations should go forward. Putin also came to Trump’s defense following the publication of unverified documents by the entertainment website Buzzfeed, which claimed Trump had engaged in inappropriate behavior while in Russia. Putin called those giving publicity to the documents "worse than prostitutes" and stated that, while he did not believe that Trump had requested the services of "loose women" while in Moscow, "ours are undoubtedly the best in the world. " Putin also appeared unintimidated by President Trump’s call for the refurbishing of America’s nuclear arsenal, stating that there was "nothing unusual" about the President wanting to maintain the quality of the U. S. military.
