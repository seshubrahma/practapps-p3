A Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters ahead of Thursday’s meeting, told CNN that Kelly and Tillerson would hear from Pena Nieto, Videgaray and other officials that Mexico would not take deportees who are not Mexican nationals. A second official pointed out that no bilateral agreement requires Mexico to take these immigrants and that Mexico isn’t bound by any US presidential order. There is nothing the US can’t do to force the matter, this official said.   And Mexico has some leverage, the second official said.
