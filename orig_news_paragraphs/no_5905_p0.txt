Olympian and first   female to win gold for the United States who is also an American citizen born and raised in New Jersey, claimed last week that she had been detained and questioned by U. S. Customs and Border Patrol Agents for two hours without explanation.   Muhammad made this claim on February 7th, saying her detention occurred only a "few weeks ago," putting her incident right around the time of President Trumpâ€™s inauguration.
