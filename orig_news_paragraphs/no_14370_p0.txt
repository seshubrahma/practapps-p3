Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) Yemen’s government has requested that the United States stop ground operations in the country unless it has the government’s full approval after an   raid authorized by US President Donald Trump killed civilians, two senior Yemeni defense officials told CNN on Wednesday. The Yemeni officials said the government had sent a firm message to the US administration condemning the January 29 operation that left one US Navy Seal dead along with Yemeni women and children, complaining of a lack of coordination with its officials. A US defense official, however, told CNN that "nothing has changed" in terms of restrictions on American counterterrorism efforts.
