The problem with this   initiative is that the new administration is likely to walk away from the U. N. Security Council position and the speech. This means that the end result, rather than constraining Israeli settlement activity, may be to produce the opposite effect. By acting now, the Obama administration may have emboldened the Israeli right, an international community determined to use the Security Council resolution to hammer the Israelis and a Trump administration eager to defend Israel and provide it greater latitude for carrying out unilateral acts on the ground.    Suffice to say, itâ€™s no exaggeration to suggest that a perfect storm may be brewing in the weeks and months ahead.
