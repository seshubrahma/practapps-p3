Trump brought up the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya where four Americans died under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s tenure. After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep! Incredible.
