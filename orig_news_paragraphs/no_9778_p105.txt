Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of someone killed by an illegal immigrants, says her son was an integral part of her community. She says "this was a good cop story" that was "cut short" by an illegal immigrant who was high on meth and should never have even been in the country. She says her son’s life was stolen by an illegal immigrant and it’s time we have an administration that cares more about Americans than illegals.
