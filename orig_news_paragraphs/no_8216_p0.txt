The Airborne Ranger serving as the U. S. Senator from Arkansas blasted President Barack Obama on Monday for his stage management and failure to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the State of Israel for its settlements on land it seized after Arab nations attacked it in 1967. ["President Obama is personally responsible for this   resolution," said Sen. Thomas B. Cotton (R. .) who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan as an Army officer.   " His diplomats secretly coordinated the vote, yet he doesnâ€™t even have the courage of his own convictions to vote for it," he said.
