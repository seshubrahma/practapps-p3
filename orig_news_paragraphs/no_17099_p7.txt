In countries where the United States appeases a foreign dictator or negotiates a bad trade agreement, the Presidentâ€™s critics will look for a Trump hotel or casino. Or perhaps there will be a building owned in part by a sovereign wealth fund and bearing the Trump name under a licensing agreement. Or a bank loan from a   bank such as the Bank of China, from which The New York Times reported that Trump businesses took out at least one large loan. These latter two scenarios, and any other scenario involving transactions with foreign   entities, also could violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits any government official, including the president, from taking payments from foreign governments without the consent of Congress.
