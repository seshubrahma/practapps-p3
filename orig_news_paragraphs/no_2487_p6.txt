Ms. Stein has gained more traction pushing for recounts in the other two battleground states, where Mr. Trump leads by narrow margins. Election officials in Wisconsin on Thursday began the task of recounting about three million votes across the state, while continuing to face legal challenges from Trump backers. A recount is also pending in Michigan, amid a flurry of litigation, including opposition from the stateâ€™s attorney general and Mr. Trump, as well as a federal lawsuit from the Stein campaign. The review of the votes there could begin as early as Tuesday.
