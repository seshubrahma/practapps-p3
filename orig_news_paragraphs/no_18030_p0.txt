’   ’ ’   White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday that   President Donald Trump was "extremely confident" the Department   of Justice would find evidence that the Obama administration   wiretapped him before the election. ’ "   Spicer made the comment during Tuesday’s press briefing when he   was asked whether Trump was confident that any evidence would   surface to support Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of   surveillance. " ’   "I’’ll let them do their job, I’’ll let the House and Senate and   I’’ll let the DOJ report this, but as I’’ve commented in the past,   I think there’’s significant reporting about surveillance   techniques that have existed throughout the 2016 election,"   Spicer said.
