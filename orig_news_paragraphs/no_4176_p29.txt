The answer seems to be, "Yes" —  the Obamans truly believed that they could get way with it.   They thought that Trump would be buried by a blue demographic wave in 2016, and that Hillary Clinton would be continuing their favored globalist policies in 2017.   To which we can say: Perhaps the elite aren’t as smart as they think they are.   And yet, of course, even after being booted out of power, the Obama globalists will enjoy a soft landing: Many of them will soon be working for some George   think tank, or pressure group.
