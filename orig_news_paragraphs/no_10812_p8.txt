If Trump is the nominee, I see Rubio as the best option to balance Trump’s northern, moderate to liberal version of Republican because of Rubio’s proven conservative record in the State House and the U. S. Senate. He can help Trump navigate the intricacies of   in Washington. That alternate delegate and Rubio supporter also suggested that Trump bring in Dr. Ben Carson —   who’s already endorsed him —  as the leading figure to undo Obamacare, and that Trump place Cruz on the U. S. Supreme Court.
