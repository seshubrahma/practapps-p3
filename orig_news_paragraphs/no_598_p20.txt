Celebrating his 10th anniversary, he provided an unofficial retrospective of greatest hits: from neat camel and glen plaid trouser suits to slouchy coed cashmeres over handkerchief hem skirts     cocktail frocks that danced around the body and a series of draped gold dévoré evening dresses. They had a quiet   that made for a good background check. But it was at Victoria Beckham that   really came into play. In her strongest show in seasons, she walked a fine line between the masculine and feminine, fragility and power, layering strictly tailored jackets and slouchy trousers in houndstooth, tartan and gray flannel over and under flyaway chiffons and sheer   all worn with      leather gloves and     leather boots for protective cover.
