Down   with just over three seconds left on the clock, a young man who also plays quarterback for ADM High School got the ball and he did down the court.   It was intercepted by the other team but then coughed up and ADM guard Jared Sapp took the shoot he knew he could make.   It did not go right in, but after a high bounce off the rim, it won ADM the game.
