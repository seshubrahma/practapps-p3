That’s what Paul was trying to get across. What you’ll see tomorrow from Mr. Trump, detailed foreign policy speech in Washington, we’ll go out to Indiana, which coach Bobby Knight is joining us for a massive, raucous crowd, something that many people on the channel have had the opportunity to see because you cover it well usually. Again, what Paul is talking about in smaller meetings, when Donald Trump is    with someone, he may not be having the same type of loud, verbose conversation because it’s a more private intimate setting.
