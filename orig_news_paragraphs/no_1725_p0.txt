Hillary Clinton held a modest and potentially vulnerable lead over Donald J. Trump ahead of the first presidential debate Monday night, with a large number of voters remaining undecided or saying they’ll support a   candidate. It’s not where it seemed the race would stand a month ago, when Mrs. Clinton led national polls by around eight percentage points. Her large advantage has dwindled. Now she is ahead by around two percentage points in   national surveys of likely voters, and in the key states she needs to win the Electoral College.
