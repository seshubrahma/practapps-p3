After all, it’s lousy supposedly Catholic regimes in Latin America that are the reason so many people want to get into Texas, California and Florida, isn’t it? Come to think of it, why didn’t Il Papa go to Mexico’s southern border to feel sorry for all the Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans who desperately flee to Mexico but get marched immediately back home? Either way, Trump’s right when he says the Vatican is clearly ISIS’s number one target. And Francis’s   blundering on immigration is going to do nothing to help Catholics either in Europe or already legally in America.
