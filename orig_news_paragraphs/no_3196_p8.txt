The friend brought with him an     helmet with   scuff marks on the crown: Von Miller’s Super Bowl 50 helmet.

S. citizens of merchandise totaling more than $500, 000, and American law enforcement seem more concerned over "appeasing" Mexico than they are with securing justice for the Americans who got robbed.
