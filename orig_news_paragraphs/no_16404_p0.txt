Havana, Cuba (CNN) Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro was a legendary survivor    besting what Cuban officials say were more than 600 attempts to kill him. He lived much of his long life in the spotlight    and much of it in the cross hairs    surviving a half century of assassination plots. Castro died Friday, his brother Raul Castro announced.
