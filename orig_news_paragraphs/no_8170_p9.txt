There’s apparently no public relations downside to calling yourself a socialist. Have no doubt: Bernie Sanders’s success is not going unnoticed by the younger generation of hipper, much more charismatic socialists like Van Jones. Jones has had to downplay his socialist background for years trying to play the establishment insider role but looking at the numbers that Bernie is racking up is probably going to make him think twice. It’s time for every Republican candidate to start focusing on the real issue, and start explaining to Americans why the tyranny of socialism and sharia are bad.
