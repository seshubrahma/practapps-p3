Stephen was the kind of guy who would make a passionate ideological argument to a roomful of people who were there to make pragmatic decisions," said Alex Conant, a former aide to Mr. Rubio who remembers squaring off against Mr. Miller at a routine Republican messaging meeting that turned into a   immigration debate. Mr. Miller has been at the epicenter of some of the administration’s most provocative moves, from pushing hard for the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico to threatening   trade deals at the heart of Republican economic orthodoxy, to rolling out Mr. Trump’s travel ban on seven largely Muslim nations, whose bungled introduction he oversaw. Working in an administration that "didn’t come here to do small things," as Mr. Bannon has put it, is a role that Mr. Miller  —   universally known as a tireless worker   —   has been preparing for much of his life.
