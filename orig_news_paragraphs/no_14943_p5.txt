The current four justices appointed by Republican presidents vote, by and large, for conservative results the four Democratic appointees vote generally for liberal outcomes. Gorsuch’s record on a   US appeals court indicates he would align with Scalia’s views as a fifth conservative justice. That would return the court to the   posture that produced such decisions as the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which lifted limits on corporate money in elections, and 2013 Shelby County v. Holder, which curtailed   protections for racial minorities and others who face discrimination at the polls. Along the same   lines, the justices in recent years have restricted   claims by consumers and workers allowed more religion in public life, such as prayer at local government meetings and rejected challenges to the death penalty.
