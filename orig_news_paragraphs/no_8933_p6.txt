U. S. officials promised to join events at Mexican consulates that are intended to help Mexican nationals get jobs in the United States. The deal will also establish a system for Mexican officials to push discrimination complaints up to the U. S. Office of Special Counsel for   Unfair Employment Practices. Gupta said: The Mexican government plays a vital role in helping the Justice Department ensure workers know about their rights and the protections the law provides. Mexico has taken a leading role in Labor Rights Week, ensuring that workers in Mexico and throughout the world know about their rights in the workplace and where to access help and support.
