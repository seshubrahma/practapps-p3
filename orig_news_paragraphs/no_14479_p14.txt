The detentions over the last week are in the hundreds and have been across the country, especially in states with higher concentrations of immigrants.   In California alone, officials say they detained 160 individuals.   According to authorities, 150 of the detainees had criminal histories and the rest were in deportation proceedings for other reasons. Activists say the raids have terrorized the immigration populations and caused widespread fear in these and other states.
