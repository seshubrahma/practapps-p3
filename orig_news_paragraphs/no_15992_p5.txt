But I am even more disillusioned by GOP leadership than by our candidate. The party   failed to sound the alarm at the outset of the primaries that the nominee has never been a Republican and does not follow the partyâ€™s platform.   Now they continue to pay lip service to a candidate who undermines the principles of our party, our Constitution, and our country    all while violating the most basic rules of civility.   I cannot watch idly as the country is forced to face a "lesser of two evils" election, where corruption, illegality, and untruths are the order of the day.
