The $54 billion increase the Trump administration announced for defense was coupled with an equal $54 billion cut to domestic spending, which kept federal spending under the budget caps agreed to as part of a 2011 law to raise the debt ceiling. " The core of my first budget blueprint is the rebuilding of our nation’s military without adding to our federal deficit," Trump said in a letter attached to the budget blueprint released last month. The $54 billion increase happens to be the same figure called for by both McCain and Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton.
