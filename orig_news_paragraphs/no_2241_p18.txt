Sarah Hurwitz, a White House speechwriter who composed Mrs. Obama’s 2008 address, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, but Democrats were watching the fallout carefully. Advisers to Hillary Clinton said they decided to take a restrained approach to the controversy. The Clinton campaign often challenges the integrity of the Trump campaign, but doing so over the speech could create an opening for Trump advisers to suggest that Mrs. Clinton was to blame for the furor. After Mr. Manafort tried to do so anyway on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton’s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, replied "nice try, not true" on Twitter and added, "blaming Hillary Clinton isn’t the answer" for every Trump campaign problem.
