 (CNN) Former national security adviser Michael Flynn is willing to testify before federal and congressional investigators in their ongoing probe into Russian meddling in the US elections, but only if he is granted immunity. The possibility that Flynn    formerly a key adviser to President Donald Trump during the campaign    could testify potentially represents a major development in the probe into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.   Questions have swirled about the nature of Flynnâ€™s ties to Russia and whether he violated any restrictions on contacts with foreign officials.
