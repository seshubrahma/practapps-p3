For example, Dongguan, near Hong Kong, has endured job losses on a scale similar to large Midwestern cities. To buffer job losses and limit political unrest, Beijing is pursuing a two pronged strategy. It is imposing tougher restrictions on foreign investment, which further depresses the value of the yuan, ladling on more subsidies for basic manufacturing, tightening administration restrictions on imports and consolidating state owned enterprises to enhance their monopoly power. Simultaneously, it is encouraging more   activities that strike at the heart of American and European competitiveness through lavish subsidies for startups, acquisitions of U. S. and European businesses, and toughened regulation of American and other foreign technology companies operating in China.
