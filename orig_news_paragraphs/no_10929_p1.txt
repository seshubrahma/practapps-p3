The survey was of 1, 157 likely primary voters and has a margin of error of three points.   The survey also found that 80 percent of respondents found Ryan favorable, with just 14 percent finding him unfavorable and six percent having no opinion. Nehlen, meanwhile, was viewed by 16 percent as favorable while 47 percent view him as unfavorable and 37 percent are unsure. The wild card here is Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president whom Ryan has used his position as Speaker of the House to undermine whenever he can.
