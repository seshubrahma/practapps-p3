the premise of a question posed by a (sympathetic) Jewish reporter who asked Trump what he was going to do about antisemitism, that was treated as evidence of his guilt. And when he condemned antisemitism, it was not enough for Democrats, who are still alleging that he is to blame.   Last weekâ€™s arrest of a Jewish teenager in Israel, with dual citizenship in the U. S. proved that much of the antisemitic outbreak was, in fact, fake news. Though there has been a surge in   rhetoric and imagery online, and there has been some vandalism at synagogues and cemeteries, the bomb threats that caused the media sensation were not carried out by white supremacist Trump supporters, but an     journalist and the Israeli teen.
