In the case, three protesters, Kashiya Nwanguma, Molly Shah and Henry Brousseau, accuse two men, Alvin Bamberger and Matthew Heimbach, of assaulting them at a Kentucky rally in March 2016.   The lawsuit also names Trump for allegedly inciting the men’s actions, pointing to Trump telling the crowd, "Get them out of here" with regard to protesters during the rally. Trump’s lawyers contended that Trump was speaking to security and not the crowd, but the federal judge in the case has already ruled that it’s plausible Trump had incited a riot, allowing the lawsuit to move forward.   In Friday’s filing, Trump’s lawyers make several claims in response to the lawsuit, including that Trump had a right to remove protesters from his event, that getting tickets to the rally waived their claims, and that their "claims are barred by their unclean hands," in addition to claiming immunity.
