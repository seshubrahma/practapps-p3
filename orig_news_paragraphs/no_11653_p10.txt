But what Trump did today, I have never seen in my lifetime: A Republican presidential nominee go out and do a     much less   press conference and just refuting everything heâ€™s heard at the Democrat convention to date. He just blew it up. And, in addition to that, he answered questions about this email business and the hack and the Russians and so forth. It just has the media outraged.
