No arrests, injuries or property damage were reported from protests Friday night into Saturday morning, police said. Central to the protests are the differing accounts between police and Scott’s family over what led to his death. Authorities said a black police officer fatally shot Scott, a father of seven, in an apartment complex parking lot as officers looked for another man named in a warrant they were trying to serve. Police said Scott had a gun as he exited his vehicle, and that Officer Brentley Vinson shot him after Scott did not comply with officers’ commands to drop the weapon.
