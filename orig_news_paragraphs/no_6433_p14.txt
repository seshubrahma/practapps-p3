Carsonâ€™s life was turned into a 2009 movie "Gifted Hands" with Cuba Gooding Jr. playing the surgeon.

The operation lasted more than 20 hours, and Carson led a team of more than 20 doctors and nurses to complete the task. Brown, who holds one of the 23 Senate seats Democrats are defending in 2018, tried to walk the line.
