Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow will not expel American diplomats in response to US sanctions against Russia. Putin said he would not pursue "irresponsible ’kitchen’ diplomacy" and would instead attempt to rebuild relations with Washington after the inauguration of US   Donald Trump. However, Putin said that Russia reserved the right to respond to the new US sanctions, which included the expulsion of 35 diplomats from the US.
