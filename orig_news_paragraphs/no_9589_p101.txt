Even corrupt religious leaders do not somehow make the religion wrong. Jesus overturned the money changer’s tables in the Temple, he didn’t burn the temple down.   Thirdly, reporters think they can do a Google search or worse yet pull up Wikipedia and become fully versed on a religious concept. This results in amazingly stupid analyses of topics they have not the slightest clue about.
