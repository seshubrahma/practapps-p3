Petraeus, the   general who oversaw military operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned as CIA director in 2012 after his extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, became public.   The FBI and Justice Department later recommended felony charges against him for sharing classified information with Broadwell. He ultimately avoided jail time after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor last year, resulting in two years probation and a $100, 000 fine. At the time, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle rallied to Petraeusâ€™ defense and criticized the Justice Department for pursuing the case.
