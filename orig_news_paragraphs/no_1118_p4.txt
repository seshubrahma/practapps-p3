The biggest rhetorical turning point came in January, when Xi Jinping, China’s president, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the Paris Agreement was "hard won" and should remain in force. " All signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations," he said.
