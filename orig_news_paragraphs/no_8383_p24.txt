A leaked screenshot of an internal discussion among Facebook employees revealed the extent to which the company seeks to influence the 2016 election against the GOP’s presumptive nominee Donald Trump. The Hill reported: Gizmodo published a screenshot Friday of an internal poll that Facebook employees were purportedly using to decide what questions to ask CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a meeting in March. Several of the questions concerned either the company’s business position or internal matters, but one was about politics: "What responsibility does Facebook have to prevent President Trump in 2017?" Some employees apparently voted for the question to be posed to the CEO.
