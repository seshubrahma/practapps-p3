It took the spy novelist John le Carré (legal name David Cornwell) a while to come around to this   golden age of television: "The Night Manager," a   based on his 1993 book, is the first   adaptation of his work in 25 years. Starring Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie, it premieres tonight at 10 o’clock Eastern on AMC. (Because of a transcription error, Mr. Cornwell’s last name was misspelled earlier.)
