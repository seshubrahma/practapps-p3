Mexico’s most profitable export to the U. S. is not oil or avocados or automobile parts, it is people.   Mexicans living and working in the U. S. send home over $20 billion annually in cash remittances   —   more than Mexico earns in foreign currency from tourism or any export commodity. In 1979, Mexico received only $177, 000 (U. S. Dollars) in remittances in 2016 it was $26.
