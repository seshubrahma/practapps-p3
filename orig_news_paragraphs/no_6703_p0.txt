Montana isn’t known for exciting political races, but a race for an open House seat in the Treasure State has turned into a cocktail of "House of Cards" and WWE, with Democrats smelling an upset in the traditionally red state as the Republican candidate was charged after allegedly   a reporter. [Republican Greg Gianforte (pictured) a millionaire and tech entrepreneur, and Democrat Rob Quist are vying to take the seat left vacant by Ryan Zinke after Zinke became President Trump’s Interior Secretary.    Voters go to the polls Thursday night in a race being watched closely by politicos across the nation trying to get a sense of how Trump’s turbulent time in the White House may affect the midterms next year. Trump won Montana by over 20 points in 2016, and while Gianforte was expected to win easily, polls have the lead tightening as Democrats look to make the race a referendum on Trump’s recent controversies in Washington and the GOP health care bill.
