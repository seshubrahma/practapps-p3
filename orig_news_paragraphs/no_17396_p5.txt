In 2008, a NY Times editorial  urged then   Obama to take practical steps to prevent new instances of genocide. Unfortunately, we failed then    and we are failing now.

Each time a   fanatic group is finally beaten down, we view the remains and repeat the promise of "Never Again" articulated at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1946.
