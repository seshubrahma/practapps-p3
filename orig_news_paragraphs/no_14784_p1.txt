Pussy hats were pink at the big women’s marches in January, but pink signifies breast cancer awareness, or did. Does it still? While I support every person out there protesting and admit to a   aversion to describing women in terms of what they are wearing, turning political activism into a color war does have its limits. I understand that visual symbols of solidarity are important, but when meanings are ascribed to these colors, as they are, we run into peculiar and often misleading interpretations of history.
