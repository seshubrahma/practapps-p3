" The multipronged threats of   today demand concerted action," said Rabbis Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper, of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a leading Jewish human rights organization.   The Council on   Relations offered a $5, 000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of people behind the threats.   The JTA, a Jewish news agency, says it has obtained a recording of one of the calls.
