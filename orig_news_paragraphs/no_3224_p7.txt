Of course, that event occurred during a   and   halftime show and not in a   commercial ad, such as whatâ€™s happening here with 84 Lumber. Certainly, 84 Lumber should not be allowed to construct a giant replica border wall during the halftime show, even though that might be the greatest thing ever. But, if a performance that denigrates and endangers police officers can get an entire halftime show, a   border wall commercial can get some love, right? Probably not.
