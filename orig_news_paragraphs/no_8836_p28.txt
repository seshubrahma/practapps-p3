Free speech" does not mean freedom to organize for racist terror, lynchings and genocide. Granting the Nazis a rally permit and providing them with thousands of dollars worth of police protection only perpetuates the long and sordid history of government officials citing "free speech" to protect racists by prosecuting black,   other minority and   protestors who speak up against racism. It is outrageous and despicable that the City of Sacramento is planning to roll out the red carpet and spend huge sums of taxpayer money to ensure that the Nazis are able to rally while at the same time city and state workers are constantly being threatened with furloughs, layoffs and cut backs. If not for the protection of the Sacramento police and county sheriffs, these murderous scum wouldnâ€™t get out of their cars
