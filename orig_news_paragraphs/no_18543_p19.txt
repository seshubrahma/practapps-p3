Congress is     supposed to intervene when presidents and their officials     violate laws, norms, and standards of conduct. Instead,     virtually the entire Republican Party is running interference     on behalf of a president who, by his own account,     fired the FBI director in order to block the investigation into     Russia and protect his friends and associates. Congressional     Republicans have taken, essentially, a "see no evil" position     on actions that in any other circumstance they would view as     illegal. For Republicans, it seems, rule of law is less     important than partisan loyalty.   â€™
