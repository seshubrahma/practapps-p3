The trope of a violent   eater   is so common in popular cinema, Roger Ebert’s Movie Yearbook 2005   contained this observation from a contributor: "When characters   order steaks, they always ask for ‘rare,’ which people hardly   ever order in restaurants, instead of ‘medium rare’ or ‘medium,’   which is what most people order. This is because the kind of   character who orders a steak in a movie would sound like a wimp   asking for ‘medium. ’" ’ ’  ’ ’    No matter how it’s cooked, meat —  especially red meat —   is one of the   most heavily gendered foods on the pyramid.
