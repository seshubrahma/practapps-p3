Gillespie, a former George W. Bush aide, campaigned off the goodwill he established with Republicans after his narrow loss to Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in 2014. Gillespie worked to tiptoe around the presence of Trump, embracing policies that are popular with Republicans without directly tying his campaign to the President. Gillespie basically ignored his competition, including the   Stewart, and the strategy seemed to work. Most polls showed Gillespie with a   lead before Election Day.
