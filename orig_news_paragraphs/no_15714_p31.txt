NASA is planning to send a spacecraft there on the first mission to fly into the sun’s atmosphere.   The outermost part of it anyway.    The sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth, and the Parker solar probe is scheduled to orbit the start from a distance of more than 3 million miles.   It’s not nearly as hot there as in the sun’s 3 million degree corona.
