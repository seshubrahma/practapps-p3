Mrs. Clinton, who has pledged to raise taxes on rich Americans, while Mr. Trumpâ€™s plans would sharply reduce them, responded that a   Congress had repeatedly blocked such efforts. Mr. Buffett declined to comment further on his letter. George Soros, another billionaire entrepreneur who has supported the Clinton campaign, was also singled out by Mr. Trump for claiming outsize deductions of $1. 5 billion on his taxes. A spokesman for Mr. Soros, Michael Vachon, said he had no comment.
