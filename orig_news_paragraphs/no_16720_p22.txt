Scott’s DNA and fingerprints were on the gun, police said. Scott’s family has said he was reading a book and waiting for his son to come home from school at the time. Police said no book was found at the scene. When asked if the family has changed its feeling about whether Scott had a gun, Bamberg said no, but the attorneys were just beginning to gather facts.
