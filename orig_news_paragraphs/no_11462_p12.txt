" "Whether its drug, terrorism, or violent crime our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country," Trump said, adding: The most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives   â€¦     Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office (loud applause). Every day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized and killed
