It continued for 23 days until June 28, 2014, when the entire family departed for Columbus, Ohio. Resettlement and Placement grants provide about $1, 900 to local resettlement agencies to cover the lodging, food, and other expenses for the first 90 days in the United States per refugee. The resettlement agencies typically keep about $800 of each refugeeâ€™s funds for themselves, and provide $1, 100 in cash assistance to each refugee, usually spread out over the   period. If that standard arrangement was applied to the eight members of the Artan family, Catholic Charities of Dallas may have received an estimated $15, 200 in Resettlement and Placement grant monies by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to resettle the family ($1, 900 per family member) in Texas for 90 days.
