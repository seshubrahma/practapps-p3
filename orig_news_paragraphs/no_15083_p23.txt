Justice Gorsuch fills the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February.    If you missed any of our shows last week, we had a couple of   explainers on the Senateâ€™s rules, rule changes and confirmation process regarding Gorsuch.   Our April 5th show defined terms like filibuster and the nuclear option.   Our April 7th show explained how they actually played out.
