The National Economic Council was created by President Bill Clinton   —   another frequent foil of Mr. Trump’s   —   to show that domestic policy would be equal to foreign policy. Like the older National Security Council, the N. E. C. coordinates the policies of the Treasury, labor and commerce departments, as well as other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Council of Economic Advisers.
