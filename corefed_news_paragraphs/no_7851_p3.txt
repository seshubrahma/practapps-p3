In this Standard Test , if one mentioned Conservative principles in speeches , policy positions , and debates , the person was automatically a Conservative , and , if one did not mention them ,    was not .   Determining one ’s Conservatism by measuring the use of buzzwords in speeches , however , is a flawed test .   It focuses too much on one ’s rhetoric rather than one ’s actions .   The Standard Test ’s limitations is one of the reasons why politicians who do not vote based on Conservative principles ( such as voting for debt increases ) are still considered Conservative .
