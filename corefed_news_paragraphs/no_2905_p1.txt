Mr. Trump faced anger , confusion and disgust from across the political spectrum on Thursday after indicating that Mr. Trump was open to letting some undocumented immigrants remain in the country legally provided that some undocumented immigrants paid " back taxes ."The comments , made at a     event broadcast the night before on Fox News , were strikingly similar to the views of former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida , fellow Republicans whom Mr. Trump vanquished in the primaries with slashing attacks that they were soft on immigration .Mr. Trump newest formulation also bore a close resemblance to President Obama â€™s approach to an immigration overhaul , which similarly calls for paying taxes as part of a program to live legally in the United States .
