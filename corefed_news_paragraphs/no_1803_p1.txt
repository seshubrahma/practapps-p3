In a car , Mayor Bill de Blasio might have taken 30 minutes or longer for Mayor Bill de Blasio to make the roughly    drive from Mayor Bill de Blasio old Brooklyn stamping grounds to an event in Queens .By air , the trip   —    a fantasy of nearly every New Yorker ever caught in traffic on the    Expressway   —    was considerably shorter .But the headache it caused Mr. de Blasio on Monday might not have been worth the trip , as a photograph and a video of the copter incongruously parked in the middle of a city park ricocheted around the internet , and reporters waited outside City Hall to ask Mr. de Blasio about it .The attention to Mr. de Blasio flight presented a    situation for Mr. de Blasio , a Democrat who has been criticized for arriving late to events and now finds Mr. de Blasio justifying Mr. de Blasio attempts to arrive on time .
