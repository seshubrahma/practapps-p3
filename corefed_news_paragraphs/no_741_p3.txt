The head of the copy desk , Jill Taylor , agrees with the reader that " illegal " would have made for a clearer headline , though she pointed out that , for space reasons , the desk took a calculated risk that readers who â€™ve been paying at least a little attention would not equate " immigrants " with all immigrants .Two reactions from me .First , I sympathize , as always , with the dilemma of the copy editor trying to fit " undocumented immigrants " into a headline .But making the choice to lose the qualifier distorts the meaning .
