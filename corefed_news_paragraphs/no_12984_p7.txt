It was the people who took to the streets during the Stonewall Uprising .It was the Watts Rebellion , not the Watts Battle of Ideas , that exposed the enduring systemic neglect , poverty , inequality , and racism faced by that community .Similarly , it was the LA Uprising , not the LA Protests , that led to significant changes in the Los Angeles Police Department .Those who condemn violence are just privileged .
