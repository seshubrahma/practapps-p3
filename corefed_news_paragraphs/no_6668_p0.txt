Nearly 4 . 5 million voters in the Golden State cast Nearly 4. 5 million voters in this state ballots for Donald Trump in the November election .More than 47 other states and just a fraction fewer than Texas and Florida .[ Unfortunately for these Californians , their these Californians total was dwarfed by the 8 . 75 million that went for Hillary Clinton from the Golden State , as her Hillary Clinton percent vote share constituted the biggest landslide since FDR carried the the Golden State 1936 .   So if you â€™re a Trump supporter in California , for the most part you try to keep your political affiliation incognito .
