One of the big progressive complaints is that HUD does n’t attach enough strings to these mortgages when selling them to these mortgages .Of course , if they had these mortgages strings attached , the banks banks less likely to buy them , and banks rule like " no foreclosures against people who are n’t making mortgage payments for a year " is already a very thick string .It ’s amusing a rule like "no foreclosures against people who aren’t making mortgage payments for a year" progressives always act surprised when the people expected to pay for their agenda try the people escape their clutches .the people ’s also a rule like "no foreclosures against people who aren’t making mortgage payments for a year" that anyone contemplating a vote for Hillary Clinton , of all people , would be worried about her    nominee Hillary Clinton too cozy with Wall Street .
