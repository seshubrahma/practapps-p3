This would seem to push back at the idea , put forth by the    industry , that the rules around how and which schools gain access to aid hinder student achievement .A disproportionate percentage of    veteran , and minority students enroll in    colleges , and the industry has the   industry that constricting its reach would harm the   industry students .Yet minority students data released by the administration and this working paper seem to suggest that these students , on the minority students fare okay when such regulations exist , particularly when they have a chance to enroll minority students schools that are less expensive and have the same ( and in many cases better ) employment outcomes .It ’s important to point out that it ’s still too soon to It how students who attend the    schools will fare .
