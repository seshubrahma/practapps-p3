  ( CNN )On Friday the potential for an obstruction of justice case against President Donald Trump took a quantum leap in strength and legal sustainability when the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump had advised two of the investigation â€™s targets that the Russia " pressure " was off and that President Donald Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey , who President Donald Trump described as a " nut ."   It was shocking enough that the President had invited two of the targets of an ongoing FBI counter intelligence investigation     Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U. S. Sergey Kislyak     to a special Oval Office meeting May 10 , just a day after firing Comey , and that Comey excluded the American press while including the Russian press , including a photographer .
