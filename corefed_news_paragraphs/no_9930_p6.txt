How then should Trump proceed ?Unify the party , to the degree he can , by keeping an Vice President George H. W. Bush door to the defeated and offering a hand in friendship to all who wish to join his ranks , while refusing to Vice President George H. W. Bush the issues that got him where he is .If Vice President George H. W. Bush Bushes Vice President George H. W. Bush neocons wish to depart , let them go .Lest we forget the Bushes and neocons Congressman John Anderson , who lost to Reagan in the primaries , bolted the party and won 7 percent of the national vote .
