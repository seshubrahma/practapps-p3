I grew up in a political family and my dad was very , very wrapped up in politics , but I had never taken on anything on my own .The only way I know how to write is the smallest , most microcosmic way .I had attempted to write something more overtly political , more of a polemic , and it did nâ€™t feel true to me .Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence ?
