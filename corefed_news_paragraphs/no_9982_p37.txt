Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals they our jobs .Forget your goddamned they , and , if he has a problem with that , forget Ed Burke , too .The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious , selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles .Donald Trump â€™s speeches make them feel good .
