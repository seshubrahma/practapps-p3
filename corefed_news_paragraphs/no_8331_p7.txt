i ’m supposed to be diplomatic and understanding , but america , what the fuck is wrong with you ?    but then i ask you , very sadly , why am i surprised ?    this is the same america that eats at burger king and is baffled as to why this ends up obese and cancerous and dying   this is the same america who thinks that granting health care to 20 , 000 , 000 people is somehow treasonous .
