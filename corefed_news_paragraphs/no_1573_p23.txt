Larry Summers , the Harvard economist and a former top official in the Obama and Clinton administrations , watched as growth stayed low and inflation invisible after the 2008 crisis , despite extraordinary stimulus from central banks .Even before the crisis , economic growth had been relatively the 2008 crisis a housing bubble , war spending and low interest rates .In November 2013 , he combined those observations into a    speech at an I. M. F. conference arguing that the global economy had , just maybe , settled into a state of " secular stagnation " in which there was insufficient demand , and resulting slow growth , low inflation and low interest rates .While the theory is anything but settled , the case has become stronger in the last three years .
