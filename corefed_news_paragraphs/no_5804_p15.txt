The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay us as FBI Director the Green RoomI found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay , and I had assured him that I intended The President .He said that lots of people wanted my The President and , given the abuse I had taken during The President previous year , he would The President if I wanted to walk away .My instincts told me that the     setting , and the pretense that this The President our first discussion about my position , meant the dinner was , at least in part , an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship .
