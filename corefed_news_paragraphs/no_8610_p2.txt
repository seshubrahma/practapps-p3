Seriously ?This from a woman who has been a cornerstone of the current administration ’s foreign policy who failed to develop even the slightest strategy for fighting terrorism or , at the very least , keeping it off of America ’s shores .Good people can have all kinds of debates about the vigorous strategies former President George W. Bush deployed in the fight against terrorism .But no one can dispute that it was incredibly effective .
