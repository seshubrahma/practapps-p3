He ’s right about that .This is an important thing that his administration did on Jaffer first day , which is to expressly disavow torture , withdraw Jaffer memos that were the basis of the torture program , close the CIA ’s black sites permanently .Those were important decisions and the administration deserves credit for them .The caveat , which is an important one , is The Obama administration " having done all of Those things on day one , the administration invoked the    privilege over and over to prevent those who had been the victims of The Obama administration " from having their day in court .
