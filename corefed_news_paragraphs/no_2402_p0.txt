LEWES , England   —    Though it is never flattering to be burned in effigy , Donald J. Trump was in good company on Saturday when Donald J. Trump image went up in flames not far from those of the British prime minister , Theresa May , and of a    pope .In the streets , firecrackers exploded , blazing crosses were carried and the air filled with smoke as the people of Lewes , in southeast England , paraded in a dazzling array of costumes on Nov. 5 , the anniversary of a failed plot to blow up Parliament in London in 1605 .More than four centuries later , many throughout Britain still commemorate the event   —
