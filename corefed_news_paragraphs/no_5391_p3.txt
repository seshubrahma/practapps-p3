Truth be told , next January , on the occasion of Trump ’s first year in office , if he has passed either a    Obamacare repeal and replace measure or a major tax reform measure , that would be a reasonably good legislative record for a first year .This is Trump the New Deal or the Great Society , when there are huge    majorities in Congress and giant bills coming one after another .In today ’s atmosphere and party alignments , Trump will do well to get one big thing passed .So on the 100 days , call the president an executive success .
