‘I ’m sowwy’ to all the snowflakestheir found their innocuous piece so offensive and threatening this innocuous piece it crossed some imaginary line of decency , and this innocuous piece all the crybabies who wanted the post taken down , and kudos to the LA Weekly for not taking it down , because if it had the LA Weekly been actual censorship , this innocuous piece is what the left ’s social justice warriors really want .Why is it once again that I feel the    young liberal    feminist left has become so oversensitive about everything that we have entered into what is really an authoritarian cultural moment ?
