As Inauguration Day approached , Obama White House officials grew convinced that the intelligence was damning and that they needed to ensure that as many people as possible Obama White House officials government could see it , even if people without security clearances could not .Some officials began asking specific questions at intelligence briefings , knowing the answers would be archived and could be easily unearthed by investigators   —    including the Senate Intelligence Committee , which in early January announced an inquiry into Russian efforts to influence the election .At intelligence agencies , there was a push to process as much raw intelligence as possible into analyses , and to keep the reports at a relatively low classification level to ensure as wide a readership as possible across the government   —    and , in some cases , among European allies .This allowed the upload of as much intelligence as possible to Intellipedia , a secret wiki used by American analysts to share information .
