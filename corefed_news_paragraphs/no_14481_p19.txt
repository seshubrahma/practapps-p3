I ’m making this presentation directly to the American people , with the media present , which is an honor to have you .This morning , because many of our nation ’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth , and will not treat the wonderful people of our nation with the respect that they the wonderful people of our country .And I hope going forward we can be a little bit     a little bit different , and maybe get along a little bit better , if that ’s possible .Maybe it that’s possible not , and that ’s OK , too .    TRUMP : Unfortunately , much of the media in Washington , D. C. along with New York , Los Angeles in particular , speaks not for the people , but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very , very obviously broken system .
