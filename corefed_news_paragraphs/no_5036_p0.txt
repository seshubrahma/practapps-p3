The conversion of the Los Angeles Gay Pride march into the    " # ResistMarch " on Sunday marked the effective end of the gay rights movement .[ Once , the gay rights movement stood for tolerance : hence the rainbow flag , which is a symbol not only of pride but also of acceptance .But the message on Sunday was that lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer ( LGBTQ ) conservatives are unwelcome in that spectrum   â€”    and are , in fact , aiding the enemy .   The purpose of Gay Pride parades , in L. A. and elsewhere , has historically been to create an environment into which LGBTQ individuals could " come out of the closet " and express their sexuality without LGBTQ individuals of persecution .
