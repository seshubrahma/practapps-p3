As currently written , Rule 40 does n’t require a candidate to have won eight states during the primary season — a majority of delegates or even to have competed in them—   it only a majority of delegates that a majority of delegates from those states declare their support in writing one hour before the convention vote in question .Again , the rulebook is written in such a way that it ’s open to interpretation ; most delegates ’ll be the most delegates committee and the delegates that decide most delegates they want to do the interpreting .If enough Republicans want a white knight to slay Trump , they ’ll find a way to get him to the floor.
