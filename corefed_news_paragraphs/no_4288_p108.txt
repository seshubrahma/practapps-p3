Do n’t say anything about Bill Clinton   …      without him we would n’t have had Sick Hillary ’s hilarious campaign !I call on everyone in this room and the many thousands of people watching at home to reject the cultural conditioning favoring abortion that we are all exposed to .You have already rejected so much , like the lie of campus People like Julius Caesar, Bach, Steve Jobs, Aristotle, Louis Armstrong, Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Bill Clinton and the gender pay gap .
