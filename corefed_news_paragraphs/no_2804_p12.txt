I worked my way through my education , sometimes two and three jobs at a time .As a young man , I cut my teeth in local and state politics , and so I was fully and painfully aware of how badly our area was hurt by the collapse of industry and the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the Northeast .So I understand perfectly well how Trump is appealing to those voters .He â€™s promising to Trump back time , to restore factories that were demolished years ago and to deport the Hispanic arrivals who turned the local barbershop into a storefront church .
