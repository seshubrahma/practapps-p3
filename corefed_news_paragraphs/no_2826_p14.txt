Demographic shifts in these areas were often canceled out by considerable losses among white voters over the same period .My view is that this is somewhat coincidental .Many of the red states with growing nonwhite populations also have the sort of older , Southern , less educated and more religious white populations that have trended toward the Republicans , even in states with far less demographic change and far fewer nonwhite voters ( Arkansas , Oklahoma , Kentucky , Missouri ) .The states with rapid demographic change but fewer Southern white voters   —    like California or New Jersey   —    did not see the same weakening in Democratic strength .
