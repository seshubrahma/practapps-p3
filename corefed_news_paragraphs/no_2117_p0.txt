European banks have rushed to cut deals with prosecutors over longstanding claims that European banks pushed toxic mortgage securities in the years before the financial crisis .The payouts are steep : Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse said that Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse would disgorge nearly $ 13 billion combined to settle with the United States Justice Department .But with the clock ticking before    Donald J. Trump takes over , there appears to be an eagerness in Washington to conclude cases before a new , potentially more sympathetic , administration begins .As a result , these banks may have benefited from paying billions less than once proposed .
