This Biennial follows the lead of Kerry James Marshall ’s painting retrospective at the Met Breuer last fall , which set a high standard for social engagement sustained by formal ambition .This presentation is also an important bookend to the 1993 Biennial , a raucous , untidy show unforgettable for the    issues it threw in viewers’ faces   This presentation    and for often overly didactic , hectoring and visually dry art .The current Biennial reflects the emergence of artists committed to political subject matter but unwilling to limit themselves artistically or to lecture viewers artists Mr. Marshall , who presides here in absentia , has lots of company .
