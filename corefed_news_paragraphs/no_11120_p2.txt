To those who remain    the # NeverTrump crowd , the Republican nominee represents nothing less than a complete abandonment of the Republican nominee principles and the values the Republican nominee consider integral to the fabric of America .To the Republican nominee , a vote for Trump is a vote against civility , decency , and everything the Republican nominee hold dear .The conservatives who are with Trump , however , see something entirely different .The conservatives who are with Trump see an unprecedented way to accomplish conservative goals , meaning to actually " conserve " what made America great in the first place , even without an ideologically pure standard bearer .
