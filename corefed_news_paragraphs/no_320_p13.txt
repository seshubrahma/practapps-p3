Dr. Nakauchi has disabled the master Dr. Nakauchi rats for making a pancreas so that when mouse stem cells are injected into the early embryo of such a rat , the growing embryo has no choice but to construct its pancreas of pure mouse cells , the growing embryo of the usual mixture of rat and mouse cells .Generating inviting homes for the donor cells may reduce the risk mouse stem cells be incorporated in nontarget tissues like the mouse stem cells or reproductive tissues .Also , an organ made purely of donor cells can be transplanted into the donor animal with minimal fear of rejection .In practice , about 10 percent of the mouse pancreases generated in rats was composed of rat cells , because the rat supplies the blood vessels for the organ .
