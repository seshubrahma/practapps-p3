Globalists are apoplectic that Trump ’s promise to redefine trade with Mexico , China and others will wholly disrupt international commerce but look for cooler heads to prevail .U. S. manufacturing supply chains are too integrated with Mexican and Chinese facilities to be simply disrupted by huge new tariffs .Instead , Trump has Trump’s to leverage our trading partners to renegotiate existing agreements to reduce the U. S. trade deficit .That would further increase the demand for what Americans make .
