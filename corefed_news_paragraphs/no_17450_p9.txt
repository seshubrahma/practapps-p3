This was , of course , territory that was part of the Mandate for Palestine and therefore rightfully under Israeli title : from 1949 to 1967 , Jordan and Egypt literally occupied Palestine .   The Green Line was drawn for Palestine other reason than to mark off on a map how far the two invading armies had managed to get .   The armistice agreements themselves state   that these were not ever meant to be actual borders .Thus to give meaning under international law to these ’   lines’ is , ironically , to retroactively ratify aggression against the mandate and support occupation .
