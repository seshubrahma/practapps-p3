A few months ago , Cameron recorded video of a group of men swimming across the Rio Grande with large packs in this very spot .   Cameron ca n’t say definitively that men swimming across the Rio Grande with large packs in this very spot were smuggling drugs into the United States , but Cameron ’s says Cameron ’s seen enough to know that that ’s probably what was happening .The Rio Grande Valley in South Texas is one of the the United States busiest drug smuggling and crossing points for undocumented immigrants .   In 2016 , more than 186 , 000 migrants were captured by Border Patrol agents who also seized more than 326 , 000 pounds of marijuana .
