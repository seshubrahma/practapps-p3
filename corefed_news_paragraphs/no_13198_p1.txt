In a statement to the Washington Post , the the Mercers support for Cruz Ted Cruz and explained why they believe this the Mercers is so critical : For the first time in many decades , American voters have the chance to turn their backs on American voters political elite , an elite both Democrat and Republican , that has chosen as its leader Hillary American voters , a dedicated foe of both the First and Second Amendments and the most dishonest , corrupt , and incompetent politician ever to seek the American presidency .Even such great Americans as Mitt Romney and George Bush have stooped to endorse Mrs. Clinton rather than risk electing a president who follows the will of the people .We have long supported Senator Ted Cruz .He has waged Senator Ted Cruz fearless battle against the elite throughout his career .
