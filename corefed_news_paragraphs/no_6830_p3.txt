Any character that was diverse , any character that was new , our female Marvel , anything that was not a core Marvel character , people were turning their nose people , " he continued heGabriel ’s comments follow Marvel ’s Marvel to create ‘ diverse’ characters , such as a female Thor , a female Iron Man , a mixed race Spiderman , a Muslim teenage girl named Kamala Khanas as the current Ms. Marvel , as well as the appearance of a villain based on Donald Trump .The executive ’s comments reportedly caused a stir online , with some Marvel fans maintaining that it is not the diverse characters that bother them , but some Marvel fans constantly updating and expanding universes and , consequently , the resulting confusing storylines .I love how Marvel thinks people are tired of " diversity " .
