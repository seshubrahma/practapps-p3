Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a possible vice presidential pick for Trump , said that " normal white Americans " do n’t understand " being black in America ."   " It took me America long time , and a number of people talking to me through the years , to get a sense of this : If you are a normal white American , the truth is you don’t understand being black in America and you instinctively underestimate the level of America and the level of additional risk , " Gingrich said on CNN Political Commentator Van Jones’ Facebook Live stream .
