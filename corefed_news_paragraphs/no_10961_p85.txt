But stop looking down on people who want to stay true to their roots , and remember the national values and traditions that made our progressive , globalized civilization possible .Because for every national flag you take down to replace it with the faceless and sinister logo of the European Union , the International Olympics Committee or the United Nations , ten more will fly upwards in protest .This is what and who we are .Leftists will insist that racism underpins national pride , but this could nâ€™t be further from the truth .
