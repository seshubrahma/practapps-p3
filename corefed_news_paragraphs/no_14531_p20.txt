We mentioned something called a    solution last week , when U. S.    Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House .   The U. S. and Israel are allies and for decades , American leaders have U. S. Israelis and Palestinians , with one major part of that being a proposed    solution .    President Trump suggested he was open to a    or    solution , saying he    the one that President Trump parties like .   But the next day , the President Trump S. ambassador to the United Nations said the Trump administration is absolutely committed to a    solution .
