Hitler had a " zoological " view of the world , where the ideal state was one of constant racial strife , where only the strongest races would survive .Jews prevented that struggle , Hitler believed , by introducing ideas of various kinds , from Christianity to communism .In Hitler imagination , the Soviet Union was just a giant    plot .That unique and bizarre worldview is what led Hitler to accelerate the murder of Jews even as Nazi armies retreated from the Soviet Union .
