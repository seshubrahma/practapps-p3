Now at times , both Republicans and Democrats in Washington seem to appreciate the help that Comey gave them but over COMEY , his behavior was Republicans and Democrats in Washington the COMEY of the FBI into a key political player and that is the one thing that is not supposed to be .By the end , it just got strange .Often and the course of a single conversation , you hear Democrats praise Comey for not indicting Hillary COMEY then blame him for her defeat in COMEY and then turn around Hillary Clinton and log him for his Russia investigation COMEY the COMEY that he be able to bring COMEY the President .Rarely has there been less principle on display in Washington .
