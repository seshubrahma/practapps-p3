For Democrats , the election last month has become a Rorschach test .Some see Mrs. Clinton ’s loss as a result of an unfortunate series of flukes   —    Russian tampering , a late intervention by the Federal Bureau of Investigation director and a poor allocation of resources   —    but little more than a speed bump on the road to a demographic majority .Others believe the results reflect a more worrisome trend that could doom the party .It is a sensitive topic , touching on race and class , but the choices that Democrats make in the coming months will shape their    identity and Democrats major implications in both the 2018 midterm elections and the next presidential race .
