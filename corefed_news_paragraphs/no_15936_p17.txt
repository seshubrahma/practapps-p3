As the May 2010 special election in Pennsylvania ’s 12th District proved , a single race is not necessarily all that predictive .Democrats won that    special only to go on and lose 63 seats     and the majority     less than six months later .But as important as what Democrats wo n’t get is what Republicans avoid :The    panic that would have been triggered by a Handel loss .
