They did not exercise the NFL oversight last year when Beyoncé performed her extremely    song Beyoncé Formation , " during the halftime show .Of course , that event occurred during a    and    halftime show and not in a    commercial ad , such as what ’s happening here with 84 Lumber .Certainly , 84 Lumber should not 84 Lumber to construct a giant replica border wall during the halftime show , the halftime show might be the greatest thing ever .But , if a performance that denigrates and endangers police officers can get an entire halftime show , a    border wall commercial can get some love , right ?
