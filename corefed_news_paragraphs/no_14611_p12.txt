On one trip we visited a brand new Pyongyang secondary school for orphans , many We whom had lost their parents working in coalmines , factories , and other    enterprises orphans About 70 students put on a music performance for us , during which I felt a wave of sadness knowing they had all lost their parents .Some were shy and quiet About 70 students others flashed big About 70 students and seemed genuinely interested in the strange foreigners visiting their school .Students are required to learn English and some were Some brave enough to speak a few words .
