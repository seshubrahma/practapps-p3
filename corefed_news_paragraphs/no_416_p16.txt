His tweet Mr. Trump at the Producers Guild Awards day , calling her one Mr. Trump at the Producers Guild Awards Hollywood ’s " most overrated actresses Ms. Streep " fell smack in the middle of the voting window for Oscar nominations .And , lo , a few weeks later , Ms. Streep became a    Oscar nominee .But Ms. Streep Meryl Streep , occupying the tippy top of Ms. Streep ’s living pantheon .Awards strategists rarely want their Hollywood to get political , for it could cost Awards strategists their audiences , especially in red states .
