I have consumed many    efforts about erroneous or Secretary Clinton he has made , about how much Medicare spends on prescription Trump , or having watched reports of thousands of Muslims celebrating on    in New Jersey Trump I have read or seen a long line of commentators accusing Trump of being racist , sexist , misogynist , xenophobic , of being ignorant on policy , of encouraging violence .And yet he keeps winning primaries Trump negative media attention and    attempts bounce off him like rubber arrows .There are limits , it turns out , to Trump mighty power of the press .Voters do nâ€™t much trust the media Trump days , and they get to decide which candidates they like .
