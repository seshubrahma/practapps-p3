As conservative    American Enterprise Republicans reports , the fact that Republicans are aware of the destabilizing effect that a delay might cause and intend to build a reform in increments indicates that there is nâ€™t really a plan in place .But the longer the delay goes , the more political capital a delay to be expended in fixing the issues that it causes .A piecemeal plan with a delay the more political capital also exacerbate the instabilities in the marketplace , and continue to widen gaps in the current healthcare system .The market risk grows with each day without a clear picture of what comes next , and many people who have children , lose jobs , lose spouses or have other serious life events in the interim will be placed at the mercy of a volatile market , where    plans might evaporate , subsidies may suddenly dry up , or death spirals may collapse entire markets altogether .
