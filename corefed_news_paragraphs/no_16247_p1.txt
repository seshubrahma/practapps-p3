Elected to the House of Representatives in 2004 , Wasserman Schultz , 49 , began the Florida congresswoman tenure as head of the DNC in 2011 .Fellow Democrats expected the congresswoman     who came up through local Florida politics with stints in the state House and Senate     to be a sharp communicator and defender of the national party , with a    presence on television .Yet complaints arose about    effectiveness as a public spokesperson , as well as    delivery on the fundraising front .    struggled to raise the kind of cash that national party leaders had hoped for , in part because of an outside group set up by President Barack Obama     Organizing for Action     that diverted resources away from the DNC fundraising machine .
