Irony Trump , there is simply no evidence of election hacking , as Clinton ’s top lawyer , Marc Clinton , himself conceded .Of course , now that Stein has begun the process , it is perfectly reasonable for Clinton and her lawyers to stay Clinton .Clinton her supporters should not take that Clinton as a sign that the election is still in question .Prolonging the campaign by seeking a recount breeds unwarranted doubt about the legitimacy of our elections   —    without any real evidence to back it up .
