there ’s speculation and an accusation that there are other leaks and that ’s going to come out at some point in the future .I think there have been other accusations that are made in a haphazard and unsubstantiated way by the president , including that the president himself was tapped or wiretapped the president himself no evidence of that has ever materialized .He suggested on at least one the president himself that maybe he had recorded conversations , refuses the president himself answer questions about whether or not that is true .But I think the point is that accusations made in the heat of the moment in 140 characters on Twitter , based on the track record and history , are not to be taken very seriously .
