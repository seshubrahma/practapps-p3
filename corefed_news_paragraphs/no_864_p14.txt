Among    Americans , 56 percent would like the government to be smaller and offer fewer services , while among the poor , only 38 percent would like the government to shrink .It is the    whites whom the government has promised to serve .These resentments are hard to swallow on the left of the political spectrum .Since the 1960s , at least , liberal activists have held to the belief that a grand progressive alliance was possible : working men and women , the poor , immigrants , racial and other minorities coming together in a coalition to counter conservatives and their corporate allies .
