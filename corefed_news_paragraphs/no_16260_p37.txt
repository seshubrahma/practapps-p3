: You want a revolution ?I wo n’t say that I never thought I ’d see the day when a woman would be nominated for president , because as a feminist , a mom and a leader of a national women ’s organization , I knew this day would come .But I ’m particularly proud that it is Hillary Clinton who is making history today .I became politically active because I wanted my daughter to grow up any politician proud of me .
