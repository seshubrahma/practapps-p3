Donald Trump ’s next head of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) could be Donald Trump most inspired and devastatingly effective pick yet .The name of this dark horse candidate is Don van der Vaart and if reports that Don van der Vaart is being considered are true , then Don van der Vaart may go down in history as the first the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator who actually has a clue what Don van der Vaart is doing .[ No , really .   Since Richard Nixon founded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970   —    presumably as a cynical bid to greenwash his Don van der Vaart image at the height of the last     —    the organisation has been run by a string of useless placemen and placewomen , who ’ve done little that actually helps the environment , but plenty to burden the economy , consumers and business alike with more pointless regulation .
