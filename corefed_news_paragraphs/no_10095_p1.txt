In the wake of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom this week , many wondered if the same sentiments that drove voters to leave the UK , such as voter unease about the economic and cultural effects of globalization , were at work in the U. S. presidential election , too .Similar sentiments underpin Donald Trump ’s general election vote , though there is not yet enough for Donald Trump’s to surpass Clinton .Donald Trump’s is also competitive in large part because of partisanship , as    file Republicans continue to get behind Donald Trump’s , even as Republican leaders have been more lukewarm toward the way Donald Trump’s is running Donald Trump’s campaign .About    of voters in these states feel the U. S. has done too much in trying to become part of the global economy too much to make changes to the U. S. culture and values , and encouraged too much diversity of people from different backgrounds .
