So when Hillary Clinton makes a mistake     particularly a highly public one , as Hillary Clinton did Friday night     it ’s magnified .Friday ’s comments came at the end of Clinton ’s most media accessible week of the campaign , one in which Clinton answered questions from reporters four separate times .When Clinton took the stage to introduce Barbra Streisand at the New York event , it was only the sixth time Clinton pool of traveling reporters had been allowed into one of Clinton over 330 finance events .It may very well be Clinton last .
