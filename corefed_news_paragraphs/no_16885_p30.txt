"Clinton handed 30 , 000 emails over to the State Department and said she deleted another 32 , 000 personal messages .So the number was Clinton 32 , 000 , not 39 , 000 , 35 , 000 or 33 , 000 , as Trump charged .Of the 32 , 000 emails the FBI was able to find , more 30, 000 emails over to the State Department them and determined that a " substantial number " were duplicates of emails that had already been the FBI over to the State Department .
