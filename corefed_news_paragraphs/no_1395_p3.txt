Mr. Trump , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , is a master of modern media , exploiting Twitter and television to punish Donald J. Trump enemies , energize Donald J. Trump allies and promote Donald J. Trump .But perhaps Donald J. Trump most powerful and memorable form of communication is the    ritual of a personal letter , written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping , signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of Trump Tower .Churned out prolifically from a    desk , they are letters of gratitude , hate , flattery and revenge , dispatched to teenage admirers and    mayors , professional athletes and magazine editors .The tone can range from florid to juvenile , pleading to poisonous .
