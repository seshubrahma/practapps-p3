no bullshit .Real talk , driving down into the details , ideas launching from the stage like fireworks , while a packed house took it all in mesmerized like on July 4th .As President Obama said two days ago , the Presidency is serious work   —    if you care about our country and its future serious work   I have little doubt that had you heard President Clinton explain , last night , why he ’s President Clinton her , Hillary you would be , too .
