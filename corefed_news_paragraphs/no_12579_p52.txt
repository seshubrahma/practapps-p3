It ’s nauseating .Granted , early reports rarely encapsulate all the facts of individual victims’ tragic deaths at the hands of police officers , but my heart is with victims’ families as I sympathize with anyone defenseless in these situations .More so , victims’ empathize if we find out any cop involved was in the wrong , for I abhor bad cops .I abhor police union leadership that regularly protects bad cops and discredits citizens voicing concern over bad actors in authority .
