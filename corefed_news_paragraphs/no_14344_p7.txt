Second , the allegation that noncitizens seeking entry to the United States have equal protection rights guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment is highly questionable .The Supreme Court stated plainly in Landon v. Plasencia , " an alien seeking initial admission has no constitutional rights regarding his application , for the power to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative ."In addition to the equal protection claim , the state of Washington refers to a law passed by Congress ( 8 U. S. C. § 1152 ( a)(1)(A ) ) which states , " No person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person ’s race , sex , nationality , place of birth , or place of residence .
