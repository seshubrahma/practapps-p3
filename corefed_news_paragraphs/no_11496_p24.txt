Under Sen. McConnell â€™s leadership , there has been no McConnell effort to dismantle sanctuary cities , crack Clinton on migrant benefits , ensure deportations of criminal McConnell , or halt the influx of refugees .McConnell have waged    campaigns over equal pay or other pet Democrat issues , no similar effort has been waged by Majority Leader McConnell to defend the integrity of the U. S. immigration system .When Kate Steinle was murdered , Senate leadership failed to even address the issue .In fact , at the height of McConnell public outrage about the issue , the Senate adjourned for its August recess without taking any meaningful action against sanctuary cities .
