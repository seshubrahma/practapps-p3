There ’s no murder , no magic , just    people with conflicting ideas on how best to run a business and create a new world .Three seasons of this tension built to the stunning ending of this episode , in which the partnership behind Mutiny dissolves .Anchored by the committed performances of Mackenzie Davis and Kerry Bishé , it ’s a sad , inevitable breakup that allows everyone to be a little bit right and a little bit wrong .JAMES PONIEWOZIK
