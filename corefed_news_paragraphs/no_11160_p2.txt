The world is in a mess .This necklace of globalism that we have talked about has crumbled and shattered into a thousand shards .This necklace of globalism that we have talked needs a jeweler to take each of those jewels one by one , starting with America and This necklace of globalism that we have talked own diamond , and polish This necklace of globalism that we have talked .Then slowly , find the seamless strength to put them all back together , so what we look at is the necklace of prosperity and tolerance around the world .
