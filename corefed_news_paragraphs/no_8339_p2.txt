James P. Pinkerton , writing for the stridently    website Breitbart News , sees nothing less than a " Worldwide Trumpian Majority " forming to oppose globalization in all the stridently   website Breitbart News forms .Interestingly , commentators across the ideological spectrum also agree that these trends are fueled by economic conditions   —    manifested here as outrage at Wall Street and global trade deals   —    and can be solved by some government response .Both Trump and Hillary Clinton offer similar solutions , such as more trade barriers and massive infrastructure spending .
