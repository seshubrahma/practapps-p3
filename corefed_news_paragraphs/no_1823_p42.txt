The American music festival ( which was we ) was a music festival other cultural offerings have a price , but are well we it .I took a friend to " Remains , " a dance performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music , known as BAM .The show was excellent and the $ 24 seats were reasonable .A word of caution , though "Remains," a dance performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, known as BAM tickets say " obstructed view " at BAM , they â€™re not kidding .
