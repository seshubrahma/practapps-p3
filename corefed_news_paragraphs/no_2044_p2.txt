If you restrict yourself to a special show , or a gallery or two , you ’ll be able to see some art in a focused way , though you ’ll miss the breadth that makes the Met so awesome .If you opt to cover a lot of ground fast , you ’ll get the lay of the land , but as a    blur .Let me propose a compromise : a thematic tour , or set of tours , that would take in the multicultural mix of a great global museum , but selectively , in a purposefully hopscotching way , with an eye on the clock tours that would last somewhere under an hour , the span of a workday lunch break .In the future , The New York Times will apply this model to several museums , in and out of the city , only a few of them several museums .
