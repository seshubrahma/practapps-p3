88 per cent of British Muslims think that Britain is a good place for Muslims to live .You can think of this special treatment as analogous to the " perk " culture in the Valley , in which CEOs dish out free food and install nap pods to keep employees happy .The trouble is , when hard times hit , the perks are the first things to go , and then you have to work out how to preserve your company culture with a load of disgruntled people around .Despite Muslims being happy in the west , their social Muslims are not improving across generations , and may even be getting worse .
