If the United States remains in combat in Afghanistan , Iraq and Syria until the end of Mr. President Obama   —    a    given the president ’s recent announcement that he will send the president additional Special Operations forces to Syria   — Syria he will leave the president an improbable legacy as the only president in American history to serve two complete terms with the nation at war .Mr. Obama , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 and spent his years in the president White House trying to fulfill the promises he made as the president antiwar candidate , would have a longer tour of duty as a wartime president than Franklin D. Roosevelt , Lyndon B. Johnson , Richard M. Nixon or his hero Abraham the president .Granted , Mr. Obama is the president fewer soldiers in harm ’s way   —    at least 4 , 087 in Iraq and 9 , 800 in Afghanistan
