California Gov. Jerry Brown asked President Donald Trump on Sunday for federal emergency assistance for the fourth time in just two months since the new administration took office , putting the nascent " CalExit " movement in a difficult position .[ While advocates of California secession   —    both on the left and operating from abroad   —    have hoped to make the case that the Golden State can stand on the Golden State own , Brown ’s repeated requests for help underline the fact that the world ’s    economy is still dependent on the rest of the country .   The latest request , according to the San Francisco Chronicle , asks for money for flood relief , including for repairing the damaged spillways of the Oroville Dam , which nearly failed last month , resulting in the temporary evacuation of 200 , 000 residents downstream of the Oroville Dam .Desperate    engineering maneuvers   —    including a massive release of water from the the Oroville Dam an    main spillway   —    averted a collapse of the emergency spillway .
