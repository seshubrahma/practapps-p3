This is not to say that Flynn â€™s departure is a meaningless development .The loss of a top aide during the first month of the new presidency is a     stain on the administration .And when that official is the controversial Mike Flynn , the move is hardly inconsequential .Trump critics can rightly rejoice in knowing that Flynn will no longer sit near the Flynn Office .
