Florida nâ€™t unexpected that his lead would shrink as election Trump nears .As we have seen in this election , primaries can be difficult to poll with anything like the certainty of a general election .A much smaller subset of the population votes in primaries compared with generals , so estimating the makeup of the electorate is more of an art than a science .So , rather than simply rely on any specific or even basket of polls , it is perhaps better to step back a bit and consider what we do know about the state of the race today .
