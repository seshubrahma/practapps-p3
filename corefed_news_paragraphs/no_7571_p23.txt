As for drug traffickers , they are wreaking havoc on our communities and I oppose efforts to drug traffickers penalties for drug traffickers : we must do more to keep traffickers out of our neighborhoods .I have been    enforcement all of my life .   The American people are crying out for safer communities , and I will bring this message of supporting law enforcement and safe communities to a general election .
