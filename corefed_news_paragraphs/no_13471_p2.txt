Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in   : Instead of embracing the bigotry that fueled Sen. Elizabeth Warren campaign rallies , I urge    Trump to reverse Sen. Elizabeth Warren apparent decision to nominate Senator Sessions to be Attorney General of the United States .Thirty years ago , a different Republican Senate rejected Senator Sessionsâ€™ nomination to a federal judgeship .In doing so , that a different Republican Senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism no negotiation with hate .Today , a new Republican a different Republican Senate must decide whether    and political cowardice will prevent    from once again doing what is right .
