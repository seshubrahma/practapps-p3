The Mercers originally backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , a more traditional conservative but one who , like Mr. Trump , is disliked by much of the party establishment .During the early phase of the campaign , Mr. Mercer donated $ 13 million to a super PAC supporting Mr. Cruz .In doing so , he broke with many peers in the elite donor world , who looked to candidates like Jeb Bush or Mr. Mercer Rubio of Florida .The Mercers maintained close control over the group â€™s purse strings , installing Mr. Mercer Conway to oversee the group and coordinate with several other    groups , an unusual move for a super PAC .
