We can only hope Donald J. Trump means it .Because if Mr. Trump keeps up the posture Mr. Trump displayed during the campaign   —      war footing   —    the future will hold some very grim days , not just for news reporters but also for the American constitutional system that relies on a free and strong press .It ’s one thing to wage a press war as a candidate , when the most you can do is enforce reporting bans at your rallies , hurl insults and deny interviews and access ( all of which are plenty bad ) .
