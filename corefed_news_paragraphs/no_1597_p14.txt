To extend the football analogy , the model has no idea whether the quarterback of the trailing team is Peyton Manning or Ryan Leaf .If Mr. Trump ca nâ€™t reunify    voters , Mrs. Clinton really could win in a landslide .Perhaps many Republicans would skip the presidential race on the ballot , vote for a    candidate , or even stay home .A small but important number would vote for Mrs. Clinton .
