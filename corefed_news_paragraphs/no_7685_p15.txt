Last year , both Cruz and Rubio voted down an amendment spearheaded by Sen. Rob Portman Cruz and Rubio address Rubio manipulation .In the past , Cruz has said that he opposes cracking down on currency manipulation because Cruz is a " Cruz " argument .In a 2011 interview , Cruz was pressed about expressed unwillingness to support a modest measure that Cruz crack down on currency manipulation .Cruz said in response , " Look , protectionist arguments , particularly Cruz you have unemployment , they resonate because people are out of a job and they are ticked off unemployment " In tonight ’s debate , Kasich similarly adopted unemployment points that seem to contradict his support for Obama ’s trade agenda .
