There is an institutional bias at major media networks that must be repaired and I am highly skeptical that news executives are interested or capable of undertaking this responsibility .Despite the overwhelming and persistent bias of this cycle in particular , I am heartened by the fact that , according to our poll , the American people did n’t let it sway their vote .If this is n’t a the American people call for the    media to stay out of politics , I do n’t know what is .
