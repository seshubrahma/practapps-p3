this deal that other government agencies approved this deal is irrelevant this deal if a jury of nine individuals is hearing a murder case and one of the jurors had financial ties to the individual on trial .If the jury came back    a jury of nine individuals , does that mean no bribery took place or no conflict of interest existed ?Of course not .The Assistant Secretary of State with responsibility in this area says that Hillary was not involved in the decision , so there is nothing to see .
