One of the largest universities in the country , Pennsylvania State University , will not become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants to be shielded from federal immigration law .[ In a new statement by Penn State President Eric Barron , the sanctuary campus proposal was shut down for holding " no legal validity " and for being " ambiguous , " according to The Inquirer .   "If used , it could imply that our university has the authority to exempt our campus from federal immigration laws , when in fact no university has that authority , " Penn State President Eric Barron said in the statement .
