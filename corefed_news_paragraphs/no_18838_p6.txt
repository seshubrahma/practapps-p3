’ ’Last week , I wrote   asking why Trump supporters are n’t bothered that Trump supporters candidate called Clinton a shameful abuser of women who may well be a rapist .After all , Trump used to insist that Clinton was a victim of unfair treatment during Clinton sex scandals .Either Trump spent years defending a man that Trump believed to be a sexual predator , even welcoming Trump as a guest at Trump wedding , or Trump is now cynically exploiting a rape allegation that Trump believes to be false.
