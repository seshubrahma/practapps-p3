The Florida Keys have a unique problem : Unlike areas farther â€˜ , which have barrier islands and then the mainland , the Keys are made up solely of a chain of    islands built on porous limestone .Stopping the water from rolling into neighborhoods here is The Florida Keys easy task .Sea walls , for example , do not work .Patience is a requirement nowadays on some Keys roads .
