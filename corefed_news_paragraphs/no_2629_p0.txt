STOCKHOLM   â€”    With a vigorous national debate underway on whether Sweden should enter a military partnership with NATO , officials in STOCKHOLM   suddenly encountered an unsettling problem : a flood of distorted and outright false information on social media , confusing public perceptions of the issue .The claims were alarming : If Sweden , a    member , signed the deal , the alliance would stockpile secret nuclear weapons on Swedish soil NATO could attack Russia from Sweden without government approval NATO soldiers , immune from prosecution , could rape Swedish women without fear of criminal charges .Swedish women were all false , but the disinformation had begun spilling into the traditional news media , and as the defense minister , Peter Hultqvist , traveled Russia to promote the pact in speeches and town hall meetings , he was repeatedly grilled about the bogus stories .
