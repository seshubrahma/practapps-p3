First came the reposting of photos by the National Park Service the Navy showed that President Trump ’s inauguration crowd was smaller than former President Barack Obama ’s in 2009 .That was followed by a contrite apology and lots of pretty pictures .But the national parks took up the cause , with a Twitter storm on climate change from Trump that was quickly taken down .And lots more : Now , with word that Mr. Trump is moving to shut down the flow of refugees and halt immigration from    nations , is the Defense Department joining the fray ?
