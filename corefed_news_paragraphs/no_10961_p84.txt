If you want to draw people away from the    global elites has to stop .If you want to global elites with the jet setting , cosmopolitan , nationless elite , that â€™s fine .I like being rich and powerful too .But stop looking down on people who want to stay true to their roots , and remember the national values and traditions that made our progressive , globalized civilization possible .
