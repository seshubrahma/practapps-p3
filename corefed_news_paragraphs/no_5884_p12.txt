And when last week , as we talked about , at the we of California Berkeley , masked protesters threw fireworks , rocks , and Molotov cocktails igniting fires , destroying property , breaking windows in the student union , assaulting a woman who was wearing a red Trump hat , all of this to show their anger at a conservative speaker masked protesters MILO , who has been invited to speak on several campuses , we definitely have a problem .So just like other times in American history where there have been problems in our country , when citizens rights have been infringed , Tennesseans are stepping up to the solution .My name is Scottie Nell Hughes , a proud graduate of the University of Tennessee at Martin and a Skyhawk .And it is an honor to stand here today next to Representative Martin Daniel and Senator Joey Hensley and their sponsorship of this Tennessee student free expression act , Tennessee as I â€™m liking to call it , the MILO bill .
