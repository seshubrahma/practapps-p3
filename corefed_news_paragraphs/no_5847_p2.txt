So I totally get where President Trump is coming from when I read reports that , under the influence of Ivanka and President Trump husband Jared Kushner , President Trump has toned the phrasing of an Executive Order so that it no longer includes derogatory comments about the utterly useless and pointless climate deal signed in Paris in 2015 by Barack Obama .Kushner and Ivanka " intervened to strike language about the climate deal from an earlier draft of the executive order , " sources familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal .Ivanka and Ivanka husband " have been considered a moderating influence on the White House â€™s position on climate change and environmental issues , " WSJ reports .Now , the executive order will have no mention of the    Paris agreement .
