Well , I think we need to have Comey come before the Judiciary Committee and clear the air .Did President Donald Trump ever say anything to the director of the FBI that would be construed as trying to impede the the investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election The President Donald Trump me about the firing and he referenced President Donald Trump Comey testimony last Comey and the judiciary committee about how bad it was .So , that ’s all I know .But I think it ’s time to call the FBI director before the country at large and explain what happened at that dinner .
