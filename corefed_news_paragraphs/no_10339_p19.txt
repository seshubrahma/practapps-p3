Trump â€™s joke the media how it breaks the sacred , unwritten rules of American political discourse .Never mind that it was Hillary who pushed the infamous " reset " button , which heralded an age of appeasement that saw the U. S. back down on missile defense , yield its dominance in the Middle East the U. S. and leave Ukraine defenseless against Putin .This is how the media work , and how they cover Democrats .They let the party write the they , and eagerly play their part .
