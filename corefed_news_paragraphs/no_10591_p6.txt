a third branch of government, our courts ’re supposed to be insulated from politics , a third branch of government, our courts ’re supposed to be in a position to resolve those kinds of questions .So if there are private citizens who believe their constitutional rights are being violated in some way , their do have an opportunity to address that before a judge in a court of law   …      a judge in a court of law   is n’t the first person to suggest I sue Twitter over Twitter bizarre , unexplained decision to    my account .But a judge in a court of law   ’s certainly the first senior White House official to do so .Silicon Valley should be very afraid if White House is advising private citizens to take them to private citizens over their free private citizens violations .
