Thanks Joe .This case has sparked a lot of Amy Reid refugees in the Magic the Fawnbrook case that is still under investigation which means anger from both sides of the spectrum .Against a video backdrop of Julie Ruf , a spokesperson for We the People Magic Valley speaking at the press conference , KMVT ran We audio from Nancy Taylor , a    activist who may not have even attended the event : I believe there is a very small group in Twin Falls , very small , and vocal , who , for lack of a better word are racist .The video then shifts to Taylor seated , apparently in a studio or residence as she delivers her pronouncement .
