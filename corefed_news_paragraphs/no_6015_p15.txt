I don’t think Comey ’s they was in it .He was always concerned , and he reaffirmed that yesterday , about getting Comey’s heart in Comey’s .If he was nervous Comey’s a letter getting involved in politics , can you imagine what Comey’s would have been nervous about if an indictment was in the offing , something Comey’s he wanted to pursue in the face of what he confirmed to be Justice Department Comey’s and lack of good faith ?
