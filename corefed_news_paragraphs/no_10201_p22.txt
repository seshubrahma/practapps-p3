Should Francis apologise for a faith that certainly clothes a nation in style and gives it great food and awesome parties , a nation in style which is hopeless at liberating the poor from corrupt governments ?After all , it ’s lousy supposedly Catholic regimes in Latin America that are the reason so America want to get into Texas , California and Florida , is n’t it ?Come to think of it , why did n’t Il Papa go itMexico ’s southern border to feel sorry for all the Guatemalans , Hondurans and Salvadorans who desperately flee to Mexico but get marched immediately back home ?
