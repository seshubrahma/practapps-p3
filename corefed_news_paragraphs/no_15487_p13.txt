These were truly    experiences for me .The unique nature of the action at Standing Rock combined with the honesty , pain and humor of all the conversations     including one with a mother and father on Pine Ridge whose son had been killed only days before I talked to them     took my breath away and also somehow inspired me .   I talked with actor and activist Adam Beach about the challenges of being a native actor in Hollywood , an industry that as he put it wants his people permanently " back in the 1800s ."
