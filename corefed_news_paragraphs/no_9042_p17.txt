I had a good laugh at that .Between the shadowbannings , hashtag manipulation , permanently banned users , and messing around with links to sites like Wikileaks , how could they describe themselves as the hashtag manipulation, permanently banned users, and messing around with links to sites like Wikileaks ’s hashtag manipulation, permanently banned users, and messing around with links to sites like Wikileaks network ?Unless , of course , the Maoist overtones of that name were on purpose .If you ’re curious how Twitter ’s leadership killed the platform , you must understand they have seriously considered banning Twitter’s leadership    of the United States from their service .
