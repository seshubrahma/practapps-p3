So , at least by a good secretary of Homeland Security , both Democratic leaders seemed to be endorsing some profiling Muslims Muslims as reasonably necessary to protect us from terrorist attacks .Something which has widespread ( albeit minority ) support among both our general population and our political and other both Democratic leaders can hardly be said to be    a label properly reserved for those ideas or proposals which are so abhorrent that no reasonable American would dare advance them .Returning to slavery , seeking to exterminate Jews or American Indians , summarily executing anyone thought to be selling drugs , etc our political and other leaders are certainly ideas which properly deserve to be termed   .   But executing convicted murders , performing abortions within current legal guidelines , possessing    assault rifles , hunting animals , etc . can not rationally be considered    even by those who most strongly oppose them .
