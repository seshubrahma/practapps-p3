Brooks decide to go around Steve Scalise third baseline , in which case he would have a direct shot at those of us who were lying next to home plate behind the blue Steve Scalise .Steve Scalise that â€™s when I made the decision, I think along with the Steve Scalise or three folks who were with CUOMO thrown on the ground , to try to get to the first base dugout if we could .
