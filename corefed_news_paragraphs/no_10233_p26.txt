Asked by FNC ’s Bill O’Reilly why he never got around to mentioning that the Bill in chief was , more likely than not , a rapist , Rather said , " When the charge has something to do with somebody ’s private sex life , I would prefer not to run any of it ."So according to our media , committing a rape is " somebody ’s private sex life , " but using a bad word is rape .Poor Billy Bush has to be fired from NBC ’s " Today " show so the media can pretend that Trump ’s using bawdy language is a very , very serious offense .
