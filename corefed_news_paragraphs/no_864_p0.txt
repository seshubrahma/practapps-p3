You could almost hear the gasps from both sides of the ideological divide when President Trump unveiled the outline of President Trump first budget late last month , proposing to slice $ 54 billion from the discretionary civilian budget next year to pay for a    defense .That part of his first budget pays for pretty much everything the government does other than the military , pensions and health insurance for older people .And it the government been slashed repeatedly already .It the government up to only some $ 500 billion , hardly the best place to balance a $ 4 trillion federal budget .
