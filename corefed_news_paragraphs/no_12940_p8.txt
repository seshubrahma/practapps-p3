In 2008 , just 34 percent made a final decision in the last three days .Perhaps the most interesting the last three days of the campaign poll is the terrible headwinds against the three " establishment " candidates , Bush , Kasich and Rubio .Together , they earn just 30 percent support from likely Republican voters .While Kasich and Rubio media focuses on which position each will finish , the levels of their actual support are very low .
