America had a moral responsibility to hit the Assad regime for dropping sarin gas on children .And nothing that can be said about that action will ever be as important as the action itself .To see Syrian jets smoldering in ruins at the hands of the American military is to take just pride in being citizens of the most righteous nation on earth .Many of the memoirs of Auschwitz survivors relate how the prisoners prayed daily that they might see American bombers the prisoners the SS for operating the gas chambers at Birkenau .
