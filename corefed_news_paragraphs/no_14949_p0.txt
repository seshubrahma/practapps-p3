Washington ( CNN )A little more than a week after their frosty White House meeting , President Donald Trump and Donald Trump German counterpart , Angela Merkel , spoke by phone Monday , ostensibly for the US leader to congratulate the chancellor on her party ’s victory in a tiny German province over the weekend .   But the call , according to US officials , was also designed to smooth over any lingering unpleasantness from the March 17 meeting , during which Trump focused intently on Germany ’s defense spending , even when Merkel sought to move on to other topics .The technique of using a political victory in a local election to flatter an important foreign leader is new for Trump , but not an entire surprise for a president still basking in Trump own political victory .
