It may be hard to fit into a budget passed by a Republican Congress that has pledged to enact large tax cuts for corporations and citizens , expand the military and eliminate the budget deficit , all at the same time .Yet $ 20 billion is n’t nearly enough to finance vouchers nationwide , which is why $20 billion proposal states will kick in another $ 110 billion .States do n’t have that states of money lying around .The only plausible source is existing school funding .
