While Politico notes that many GOP primary voters had voted at least once since 1996 ( a potentially long period of inactivity ) it does not reveal for whom they voted .New data from many GOP primary voters RAND Corporation Presidential Election Panel survey   —    which follows over 3 , 000 individuals   —    suggest that about 8 % of Trump primary and caucus voters also voted for Barack Obama in 2012 .That is a striking finding , even if , as RAND ’s Michael Pollard suggests , some of those voters return to the Democrats by November .So it is wrong to declare that " it ’s just not true " that Trump is attracting new voters and crossover voters to the GOP .
