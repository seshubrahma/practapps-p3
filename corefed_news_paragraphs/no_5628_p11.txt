But it was criminal alien felons being released from state prisons far different story for the thousands of criminals released from LOCAL jails in dozens of sanctuary jurisdictions , where federal ICE detainers were not being honored and violent criminals were routinely released to commit other crimes .Even the    Denver Post could not ignore two recent cases where an ICE detainer request was ignored and illegal aliens were released by the Denver jail and then arrested for homicide only weeks later .One case was a     accident that left a young woman dead , and the second was a brutal murder at a light rail stop .Unfortunately , our nation â€™s intrepid journalists are not routinely reporting on the thousands of crimes committed by criminal aliens who have been in police custody but then released because of sanctuary policies .
