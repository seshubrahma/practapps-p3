To estimate welfare payments and costs by household we use Census Bureau data and other the 2013 Annual Survey of Refugees get    costs for programs reported at the household level , we divide by four based on the assumption that average Middle Eastern refugee households receiving welfare consist of four people .This assumption is based on the Annual Survey of Refugees   â€¦      To estimate average payments by household for SSI , SNAP , and TANF we use the    files of the 2013 to 2015 Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey ( ASEC CPS ) collected by the Census Bureau .We match the countries listed as being part of the Middle East to the ORR list of countries from that area using the country of birth reported in the ASEC CPS .
