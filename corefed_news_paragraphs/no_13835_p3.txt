In his closed door pep rally with congressional Democrats , President Barack Obama even encouraged his President Barack Obama to use tea party tactics to galvanize Americans to urge Republicans not to dismantle the health care plan     which happens to be the cornerstone of his President Barack Obama .But the analogy is hardly perfect .Anyone who remembers the raucous town halls of 2009 knows it was the Democrats trying to sell Obamacare who got shouted down by constituents who did n’t like the law , and were encouraged by conservative media and the brewing tea party movement .   Still , there could be a silver lining here for Democrats .
