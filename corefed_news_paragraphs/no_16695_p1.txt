Jim Rhodes .   Gov. Jim Rhodes received letters of recommendation from several luminaries , including former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson , a Democrat , and    mayor ( and future Ohio senator ) George Voinovich , a Republican .In 1992 , King invoked his King Amendment rights and refused to answer questions before a Senate subcommittee investigating ties between boxing and organized crime .
