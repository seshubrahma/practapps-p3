Currently speaking , it ’s mathematically impossible for Ohio Gov. John Kasich to win the majority of delegates walking into the Republican National Convention in July .Similarly , while not mathematically impossible for Cruz to get there , it ’s close —    he ’d need it to 90 percent of Cruz remaining delegates to win a majority walking into the convention .As such , the strategy the Republican National Convention employing is force a contested convention —   and wrest the nomination from Trump there .
