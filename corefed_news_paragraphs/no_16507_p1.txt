A strong performance by the underdog , such as Mitt Romney ’s showing in the first debate against President Barack Obama in 2012 , can force voters to take a second look at a candidate voters may have written off and make the fall campaign competitive once more .Because these debates have potential to impact the race , observers are rightfully curious about what Trump has done to prepare for observers .After all , a disciplined and targeted debate prep process helped Mitt Romney’s win the first matchup four years ago , and could do the same for Trump .   Unfortunately , " disciplined " and " targeted " are n’t words that have often been used to describe Trump or Trump campaign to date .
