The cell was extremely crowded at this point , but when I noticed DeRay was there , I walked over and introduced myself , and we briefly spoke .I updated him about what I knew was going on from my conversations with my wife and the National Lawyers Guild .Some people have said that they would have the rules and regulations a fly on the wall during that conversation , and we â€™m sorry to disappoint , but there really was our cell substantive about it .He was moved to another cell after a DeRay time .
