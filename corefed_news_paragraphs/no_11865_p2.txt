the Hate Symbol Database launched as a definitive collection of some of the world ’s most hateful icons and symbols .It currently includes such entries the Hate Symbol Database the Nazi swastika , the burning cross , " 1488 " the Blood Drop Cross , the Confederate flag , the iron cross , Ku Klux Klan robes , a noose , the    South African flag , SS lightning bolts , and Stormfront ’s logo .It is unknown as to why Pepe the Frog , a cartoon frog meme whose minimal links to " white supremacism " have been proven to be the result of two notorious trolls , is listed among the other symbols on the site , but it is likely to do with the debunked recent reports from both the mainstream media and the Clinton Campaign that claim Pepe to be a new symbol for white supremacy .Hillary Clinton , George Stephanopoulos Clinton Tur , and even Louise Mensch ’s Heat Street have all branded the cartoon frog as a symbol for white supremacy , seemingly basing their claims on a Daily Beast article that interviewed two notorious trolls , Jared Taylor Swift ( who has " PARODY ACCOUNT " in his Twitter bio ) and Paul Town .
