In the Maryland case , Judge Chuang , who was Mr. Ouansafi appointed by Mr. Obama , Mr. Ouansafi to block the entire executive order from going into effect , but ruled that the most important section   —    banning travel from half a dozen countries   —    could not be enforced .His decision cited Mr. Trump ’s public comments to conclude that there were " strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban , " and that Mr. Trump may have intended to violate the constitutional prohibition on religious preferences .In addition to the Hawaii Mr. Trump suits , a federal judge in Washington State heard arguments Wednesday in cases challenging the constitutionality of Mr. Trump ’s order , including one brought by a coalition of Democratic attorneys general , and another by nonprofit Mr. Trump lawyers have argued that the president was merely exercising his national security powers .In the scramble to defend the executive order , a single lawyer in the United States solicitor the president ’s office , Jeffrey Wall , argued first to a Maryland court and then , by phone , to Judge Watson in Honolulu that no element of the order , as written , could be construed as a religious test for travelers .
