As a former Bucknellian and educator , Hanlon ’s focus should be on an email recently sent out by Bucknell professor Marcellus Bucknell , in which he instructs students Hanlon " impose a steep and lasting price " on organizers of a speaking event that occurred in February 2016 .Despite the controversial nature of the speaker , Hanlon should be Hanlon that a professor at his alma mater Hanlon instructing students to commit    acts of retribution against other students for their attempt to other students the intellectual space at their university .other students the Bucknell administration refused to even label this conduct " inappropriate " should be a concern for educators everywhere , as it runs against the Bucknell administration foundation of the university as their university and challenging intellectual space , where even Milo Yiannopoulos ’s style of provocation and humor should be welcomed .   Milquetoast speakers , like Dinesh D’Souza and James Rosen , who have both spoken at Bucknell , failed to generate the dialogue necessary for my conservative and libertarian peers to feel that we have a seat at the intellectual table on campus .
