One thing I ’ve discovered during my previous travels for Trump is that even those who , like me , have daughters may not care what Trump says or does     even those who, like me, have daughters ’ll support Trump anyway .In Pennsylvania , I met some people who were    at the prospect of what would have been our first woman president .But others literally hissed at the mention of our first woman president name and slammed the door in my face .
