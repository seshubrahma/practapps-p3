Priebus and I started talking last spring , as I was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the Republican Party .Priebus and I kept in touch during the campaign , drank the occasional Miller High Life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email .Priebus was constantly going on TV saying Priebus was certain Trump would win , even though Priebus could read polls and precedents like everyone else .Still , Priebus carried on as the chief carrier of Trump ’s choppy water because that ’s what a party chairman does : Priebus smiles and spins and swallows Priebus    plans and audibles in the name of getting Priebus nominee to the finish line .
