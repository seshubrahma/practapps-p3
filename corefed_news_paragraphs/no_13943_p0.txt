Washington ( CNN )   Donald Trump ’s transition team is engaged in active discussions with the US Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department to begin planning a wall along the Mexican border , including how specific environmental laws could get in the way , CNN has learned .   A US official with knowledge of a visit last last month to the Interior Department     which oversees most federal lands and major environmental laws     said the transition team was particularly interested in finding out " how long it would take " to build the wall given potential legal obstacles .   " It seems clear the Interior Department    which oversees most federal lands and major environmental laws     were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall , " the source said .Another US official told CNN the transition team has also reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers’ Southwest Division , that has previously built border security fencing , to determine what previous fencing cost and how it was constructed .
