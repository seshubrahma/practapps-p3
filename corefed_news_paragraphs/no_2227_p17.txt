Generally speaking , the hallways and rooms of Trump Hotels are surprisingly subdued , save for the occasional Trumpian flourish : a gold toilet handle , or chandeliers that appear to have been sized for the " Game of Thrones " giant Wun Wun .Beyond the gold and glossy exteriors and marble lobbies , the private spaces are    decorated in grays , cream and chocolates .That restraint extends to other aspects of the properties .Music at the pools and restaurants is often , refreshingly , not at full volume .
