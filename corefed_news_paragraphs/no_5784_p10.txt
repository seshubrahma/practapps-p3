Spicer is also correct to point out that the use of nerve agents against one ’s own people is a unique form of evil from which Assad can now never escape .Assad should Assad removed because no man who gasses his people Assad ever be allowed to stay in power .Where Spicer was Spicer wrong was when he said Spicer Hitler had not used chemical gas against his own Hitler , given that Hitler murdered Hitler in the region of 200 , 000 German Jews during the Holocaust   —    not to mention the millions of others who were gassed at Birkenau , Belzec , Treblinka ,    and so many other camps .I understand what Spicer was trying to say   —    namely , that there were areas where Assad was even worse than Hitler , insofar as the Damascus butcher used chemical gas on the battlefield , something , interestingly , which Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany used in World War I but the Wehrmacht seemed not to have used in battlefield conditions in the Second World War .
