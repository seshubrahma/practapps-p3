From experience in past presidential campaigns , I am sympathetic with their decision to remain silent : It would definitely have been a risky play , probably drawing headlines away from Hillary Clinton more positive message and perhaps converting few voters .   Even so , I thought their made a mistake .Bobby Kennedy liked to quote an old saying , " Hang a lantern on your problem ."
