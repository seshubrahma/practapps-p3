As bookends to each other , the pieces in this book give us two Americas , two ways of looking at history : the South , deep in the grip of the past   —    a place where many people are invested in holding onto ancient prerogatives of race and class and California , insistently focused on the future and the horizon   —    a place where the frontier ethos of shucking off roots is the one real tradition .It ’s 1970 , when America is being rocked by seismic cultural and political shifts , and yet Didion has the strange intuition here that the South , not California , would exert a gravitational pull over the rest of the AmericaShe had Didion some dim and unformed sense , " which she could Didion explain coherently , " that for some years the South and particularly the Gulf Coast had been for America what people were still saying California was , and what California seemed to me not Didion be : the future , the secret source of malevolent and benevolent energy , the psychic center ."
