"Murphy further stated , " [ W]e have got to compliment this military strategy with increased intelligence , increased intelligence sharing with Europe , and a commitment to try to stop giving isis recruiters recruitment fodder .And so , many of us are worried about some of the rhetoric of the Trump administration , because us worry that that combined with robust online recruitment might end up in an attack like this happening in the United States ."
