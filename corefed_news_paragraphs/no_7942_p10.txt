Therein lies the key to beating them everyone else as well .Ben Garrison , probably the most trolled man in internet history , will no doubt tell you that his life improved immeasurably when he his trying to fight the trolls ( who had by then convinced multiple media outlets that he his a    Neo Nazi street warrior ) and instead learned to laugh at himself his Trolls lose interest when their Trolls stop taking themselves Trolls seriously .More recently , it ’s been the right that ’s fallen foul of the Trolls With    establishment types already enraged by the rise of Donald Trump , trolls spied an opportunity to bait an entirely new constituency of    blowhards .Like the feminists , only a small minority realised they were only a small minority trolled .
