Perhaps I will delve further into this another day , but back to Donald Trump .While Donald Trump and Donald Trump surrogates denounce free trade , proclaiming that Trump and his surrogates stand with and for America ’s working men and women , Trump and his surrogates find it hard to explain away the billionaire ’s own practices for most of his business career .As it turns out , Trump has never shown any qualms about using foreign labor , foreign capital and even    companies to service Trump personal interests and acquire wealth .
