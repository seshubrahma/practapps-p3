I visited Steve , Steve wife , and Steve family in the hospital as Steve continues to fight for Steve recovery .   435 Members of Congress , and 300 million Americans , are pulling for Steve , praying for Steve , and pledging to Steve our full and total support .our continue to hold all of those wounded and fighting for recovery in our hearts and prayers , including Matt Mika , who was also badly wounded .In that terrible crime , our also witnessed the incredible heroism of Capitol Police .   Special Agent Crystal Griner   —    who I also had the honor of meeting during my visit to the Hospital   —    raced into gunfire , along with Special Agent David Bailey .
