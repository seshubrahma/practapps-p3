he President Obama n’t even President Obama to see the ballots , because he can read the President Obama of people who do n’t vote , and would defy the authority of Congress on their behalf .Is the ballots scenario even possible ?Well , as everyone pushing it notes , 21 states do n’t actually require their electors to vote 21 states the pledged candidate , and the others mostly have laws that punish faithless electors , rather than preventing them from changing their faithless electors .Michigan faithless electors Minnesota are the only states that automatically nullify the votes of renegade electors , and there is some debate in legal circles over whether any of the punitive laws could actually be enforced .
