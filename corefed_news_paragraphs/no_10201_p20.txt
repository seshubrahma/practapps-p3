According to Francis the pope " A person who thinks only about building walls , wherever they may be , and not building bridges , is not Christian ."Well , Holy Father , I think Pope Leo IV , Pope Paul III , Pope Pius IV , and Pope Urban VIII , all of whom expanded the Vatican â€™s fortifications , might beg to differ .Many other religious states have absolutely no problem with walls .
