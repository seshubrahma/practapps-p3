Sen. Marco Rubio said : We will win and I know We will win because last Saturday night , I traveled to the island of Puerto Rico , a place that does not vote for Republicans often .And I did not go there as a moderate , nor did I go there as a liberal, I went there as a conservative    â€¦      and on Sunday , over 70 percent of people on Florida voted for Sen. Marco Rubio and I won that primary !
