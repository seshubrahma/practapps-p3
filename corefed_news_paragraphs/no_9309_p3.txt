As a true supporter of people I am saddened by Senator Sanders decision .To Sanders crying and feeling robbed breaks my heart .His decision has led me Bernie founder Bruce Carter make Sanders moving forward the people have their own white house that is not owned the people an the establishment .The masses will not vote for the Democratic Party because they are untrustworthy .
