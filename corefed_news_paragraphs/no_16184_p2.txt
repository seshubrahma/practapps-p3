It was a remarkable moment to watch , with the head of CNN ’s Ankara bureau , Hande Firat , holding a lapel mic up to an iPhone .Erdogan managed to appear at once presidential and intimate , striking a balance between Erdogan assured rhetoric and the tenuousness of Erdogan connection to the media universe .At one point , the video cut out while someone else tried to call the phone , underlining the leader ’s luck at managing to get on air from ( we presume ) the leader’s vacation in the beach town of Marmaris in the midst of an extremely chaotic night .Perhaps realizing their mistake , the junta took over the CNN Turk studios three hours later , emptying the facility even as the staff continued to broadcast .
