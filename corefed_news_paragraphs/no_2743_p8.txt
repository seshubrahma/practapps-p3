It ’s worth noting that even the most    popular movies   —    as I write , Pixar ’s " Finding Dory " tops the yearly box office   —    are unlikely to show up on many    lists or scoop up critics’ awards .The Los Angeles Film Critics Association ( I ’m a former member ) for instance , recently gave Barry Jenkins ’s " Moonlight " best picture , best director and best supporting actor ( Mahershala Ali ) .The Los Angeles Film Critics Association other honorees included releases that , according to the website Box Office Mojo , opened in a limited number of theaters : " Krisha " ( 26 theaters ) " The Handmaiden " ( 125 ) and " Certain Women " ( 138 ) .The divide between what most Americans see and what critics reward is not new or surprising .
