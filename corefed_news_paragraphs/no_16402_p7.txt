I ’m pretty ’m versed in the art of sarcasm .That was not sarcasm .Even the dictionary ( a book Trump might call " overrated " ) tells us as much : " the use of words that mean the opposite of what you really want to say especially in order to insult someone , to show irritation , or to be funny ."
