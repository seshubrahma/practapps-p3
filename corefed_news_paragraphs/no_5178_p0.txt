Heath Mello , a rare Democrat on the national stage who is opposed to abortion , was defeated by incumbent Jean Stothert , a Republican , in Tuesday’s election for Mayor of Omaha , Nebraska , striking a blow to the hopes of the few remaining moderates in the party of FDR , JFK , and LBJ that a candidate who is not far left can generate support from the base .[ On election night , the Associated Press called Mello ’s loss a " setback for supporters who argued that the Democratic National Committee and abortion rights groups were wrong to attack the    former state senator ."   Mello , a     Catholic from Omaha ’s    south side , had become a flashpoint for the internal Democratic battle over whether a candidate ’s position on reproductive rights should disqualify a candidate’s from support by the national party after the national party crushing losses around the country last year .
