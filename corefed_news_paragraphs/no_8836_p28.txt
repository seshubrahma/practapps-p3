Granting the Nazis a rally permit and providing them with thousands of dollars worth of police protection these Nazis the long and sordid history of these Nazis officials citing " free speech " to protect racists by prosecuting black ,    other minority and    protestors who speak up against racism .It is outrageous and despicable that the City of Sacramento is planning to roll Sacramento the red carpet and spend huge sums of taxpayer money to ensure that the Nazis are able to rally while at the same time city and state workers are constantly these Nazis with furloughs , layoffs and cut backs .If not for the protection of the Sacramento police and county sheriffs Sacramento these murderous scum would n’t get out of their cars   —    let alone hold a recruitment rally
