So I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties , and I was still trying to figure out who I was still searching for a purpose to my life .And it was a neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills .It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith , and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss .( CROWD CHANTING " FOUR MORE YEARS " )
