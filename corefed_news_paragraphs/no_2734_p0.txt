TAOYUAN , Taiwan   â€”    The fields are overgrown with weeds .Warehouses lie abandoned , The fields corrugated shells covered in rust .In the distance , an air base , where pilots once took off on reconnaissance missions over mainland China , is devoid of activity , mainland China camouflaged hangars and guard towers symbols of a Cold War long over .
