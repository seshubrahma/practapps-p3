And I do think    media has had a lot more success in pioneering ways to challenge establishment authority that    media has .I think very much the same spirit that animates Breitbart this reporter also the animating force behind Matt Drudge and , to a lesser extent , Rush Limbaugh   —    none of which have ever been part of or comfortable within the Republican establishment .In fact , all of them , in varying degrees , has been very antagonistic to the the Republican establishment Certainly Drudge Matt Drudge and definitely Breitbart this reporter , maybe not Rush Limbaugh quite as much , but to some degree , too .So there ’s obviously a lot of things at Breitbart this reporter are published that I vehemently disagree with and sometimes find repellant just on an ideological basis .
