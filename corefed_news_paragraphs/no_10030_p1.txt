Bill Maher ( @billmaher ) September 28 , 2016 ,   During the " Real Time " segment , Maher said Kaepernick was a " fucking idiot , " but not for Maher protests .Instead Maher said it was due to Maher series of " false equivalencies " Maher had made about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ."
