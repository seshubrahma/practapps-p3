And Trump did that on two fronts this week .One was highlighting what seems to be a lack of depth on policy with Trump comments on abortion .And , two , is highlighting problems that Trump has with women .And so I think reinforcing both of those negatives could have problems going forward , but it is important , when you look at the math , to note that Trump is the only one who can clinch through this regular process .
