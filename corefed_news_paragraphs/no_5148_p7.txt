I think from the very beginning combining repeal and replace in one bill makes it very hard because we have different ideas on replace .We are pretty much united on repeal , but we have different ideas we replace .If the House leadership had come we and talked to conservatives beforehand , I think they would have found out there is a lot of disagreementand they conservatives have just passed what we already passed
