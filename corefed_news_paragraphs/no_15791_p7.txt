Every new tweet ,    interview and attack on the media has dug a deeper hole for Trump .Plans to create a    " war room " to reject    stories turned out to be a bust , reportedly because experienced lawyers declined to   staff it for   White House .That leaves an isolated President     a man with a penchant for lying     with the hopeless task of asking the public to believe him and an isolated President     Comey .If he â€™s an isolated President     , Trump will simply hunker down and try to stoically endure the storm of bad news coming his way an isolated President     thanks to Comey .
