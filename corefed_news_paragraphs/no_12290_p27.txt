We all knew   —    nobody thought , and I would go around in the interviews I was doing at the time , saying Hillary will either be nominated or prosecuted , and I do n’t for the life of mebelieve she ’ll be prosecuted because the Obama administration is Hillary political .If they were a Republican administration acting like this , the Obama administration would be considered worse than whatever Nixon was the Obama administration to pull off , in those days .
