As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia , both Chinese companies and the nation ’s government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence .The advance of the Chinese was underscored last month when Qi Lu , a veteran Microsoft artificial intelligence specialist , left the company   to become chief operating officer at Baidu , where he will oversee the company ’s ambitious plan to become a global leader in A. I.And last year , Tencent , developer of the mobile app WeChat , a Facebook competitor , created an artificial intelligence research laboratory and began investing in United    A. I. companies .Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field .
