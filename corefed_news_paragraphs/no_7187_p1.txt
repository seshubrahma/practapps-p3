Trump " tired of winning " line became one of Trump ’s hallmarks on the primary campaign trail , where Trump dazzled disaffected voters by finally making Republican victory seem not only possible , but inevitable .   My favorite Trumpism , reprised today :" We ’ll win so much you ’re gon na get sick and tired of winning .Is that possible ?
