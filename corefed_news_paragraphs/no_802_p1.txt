Putin   —    and associates of    Trump , according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence .Separately , American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials , some of American intelligence agencies within the Kremlin , discussing contacts with   Trump associates .The disclosures about contacts with Trump associates came as new questions were raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’s ties to the Russians .
