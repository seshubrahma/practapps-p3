From the Gateway Pundit :   Current polls show the race for President is much tighter than the race for President really is .   Ann Coulter warned us years ago in Ann Coulter best seller Slander that Democrats and the liberal media always use polls to manipulate and discourage conservatives from voting .   Thanks to social media there is more and more evidence that the polls are way offand if things stay as the polls are , Trump will win in a landslide !
