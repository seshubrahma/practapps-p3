A January report on the impact of Chinese imports , from David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Gordon Hanson of the University of California , San Diego , and David Dorn of the University of Zurich , casts some doubt on conventional assumptions .It found that pay remains low and unemployment high for at least a decade in communities where businesses are most exposed to Chinese competition .Workers there bounce among jobs and suffer a drop in lifetime pay .Rather than pick fights with trading partners , as Trump would , analysts favor retraining workers who lose jobs to foreign competition or giving them financial assistance to move where companies are hiring .
