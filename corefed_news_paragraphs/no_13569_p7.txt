As mayor , I made a point of never meeting privately with anyone on any issue pending before the Public Utilities Commission , the Planning Department , Muni , the port , the airport or any other area where there might be a conflict of interest .Any meetings on an issue like that were held with the office door wide open , so anyone could walk in at any time .The open door the office door message that someone could overhear everything that was being said .Former president Clinton is also a potential target of investigation , given accusations that the Clinton Foundation benefited from foreign donations during Hillary Clinton â€™s tenure at the State Department , and suspicions that    about donors may have been hidden on her private    server ,    later deleted instead of being turned over to the government .
