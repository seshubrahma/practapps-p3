Too many people Steve Bannon [ when him said that ] that ‘ ’ meant    Steve Bannon Dukes .Frankly , I ’ve urged him to make it clear that he never meant that and that Steve Bannon where this distortion of meaning about Steve Bannon came .But what ’s shocking to me is Steve Bannon even if this were true Steve Bannon we were there about Israel and not there about Donald Trump or Steve Bannon .So it showed to me the intense enmity that Sherrod Brown and many Democrats have toward the Trump administration —   a really irrational enmity that makes no Steve Bannon
