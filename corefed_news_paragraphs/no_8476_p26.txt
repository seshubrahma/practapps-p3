On the one hand , Mr. Trump thinks the Donald J. Trump’s in decline , and immigration is out of control , but on the other hand , he does n’t believe in Donald J.

Trump’sThe game here is to create a ridiculously broad definition of " nationalism "   —    basically , if you think open borders and sanctuary cities are bad , or that America ’s trade policies ought to benefit Americans , you America in an America —    and then equate this ersatz " nationalism " with racism , and then progressives can feel good while sticking the fascist label on suburbanites and    Americans .   That ’s how hideously     our elites have become : they think the very concept of responsible citizenship is now a hideous    idea , our elites reminiscent of Germany on the eve of Germany .
