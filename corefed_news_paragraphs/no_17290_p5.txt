A few examples illuminate how this cynical strategy can translate into the Electoral College and tip the balance in a presidential election : In Wisconsin , which Trump won by just over 25 , 000 votes , more than 10 times that many eligible voters     as many as 300 , 000 people     may have been disenfranchised because they lacked many eligible voters    as many as 300, 000 people     proper ID under a strict new voter ID law .While some of North Carolina ’s more draconian voting restrictions were struck down just before the election a presidential election purge of early voting sites remained in place .At the end of the state ’s North Carolina period , a GOP memo heralded that    turnout had dropped nearly 9 % .Trump won the state by fewer North Carolina , 000 votes .
