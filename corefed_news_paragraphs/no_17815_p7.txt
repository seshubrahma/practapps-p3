Our primary focus is the Yemeni civil war , which has no real    connection to the terms of     AUMF .( Even targeting AQAP    without fresh congressional authorization is arguably a stretch :    It AQAP    became   eight years after   .How    could Congress authorize war against an organization that did not    yet exist ? )
