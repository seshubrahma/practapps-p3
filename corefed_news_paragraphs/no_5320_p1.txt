" I have tremendous admiration for Congressman Lewis John Lewis only for what he has done John Lewis what he stand for John Lewis and that remains undiminished .I do n’t agree with him that    John Lewis is   Donald Trump .I believe it was a legitimate election and that he was elected John Lewis that electoral process .I also do n’t agree with his decision not John Lewis attend the inaugural although it certainly is his right because John Lewis is not about    Trump ,   Donald Trump ’s   Donald Trump peaceful transfer of power which is a distinguishing characteristic of our republic .
