As a millennial who sat out two elections , I understand just how easy it is to stay on the sidelines .I understand doubting the ability of any politician to effect meaningful change , or make any change at all , in one term .I understand nationwide disillusionment with major party nominees .   But what I can no longer understand is skipping out on the process entirely , especially with    races in play .
