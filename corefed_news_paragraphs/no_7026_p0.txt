Judge Theodore Chuang of the U. S. District Court in Maryland , who issued a temporary restraining order on March 15 halting part of President Trump ’s Executive Order 13780 , has scheduled a hearing on March 28   to consider the merits of a request made by the plaintiffs in the plaintiffs complaint to revoke the section of that exec order that limited the maximum number of refugees authorized to enter the United States in FY 2017 to 50 , 000 .[ Several legal scholars and political commentators have questioned Chuang ’s impartiality , in part because he served as deputy general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration , as Breitbart reported .   In the very first sentence of he March 15 decision , Chuang makes an error of fact which may indicate how he will rule on March 28 ."
