Depreciation is a noncash charge , and is largely an accounting conceit that benefits real estate investors .The theory is that real estate loses value over time and is eventually worthless .As everyone surely knows , most real estate has historically appreciated in value .How much Mr. Trump ’s property investments might throw off in depreciation depends on what he paid for them , how much he ’s spent on capital improvements and how the assets are categorized ( some assets qualify for accelerated depreciation ) .
