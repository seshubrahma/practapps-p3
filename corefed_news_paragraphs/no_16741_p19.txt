Will I be happy having this candidate in my this candidate next four years ?   She is winning on Hillary Clinton 1 but struggling on # 2 .On Monday night she needs to move Hillary Clinton needle on # 2     and avoid the gaffes that have plagued some   .     The good news for Clinton is that    like her have usually done well in debates and have Clinton on to claim the presidency     think Reagan in 1984 , George H. W. Bush in 1988 , Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 , George W. Bush in 2004 , and Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012 .
