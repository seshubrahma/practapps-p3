Right before the big blizzard hit this past weekend , I ran into a woman at a department store in Pennsylvania .a woman was wearing a Carolina Panthers scarf , so we struck up a conversation about the team .[ a woman quickly told me a woman was from North Carolina , which I could ’ve guessed by a woman southern drawl .a woman also told me a woman hoped to get back home for Sunday ’s NFC Championship Game .
