In 2012 ,    voted at a higher rate than    whites for the first time since the Census Bureau started reported voting rates for the eligible citizen population in 1996 .I wanted to find folks with different political perspectives but who would feel comfortable to speak freely .I did nâ€™t want talking points .No sugarcoating .
