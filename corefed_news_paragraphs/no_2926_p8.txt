There â€™s a part of me that thinks many in Congress were always so willing to vote for a " repeal " because they they it a "repeal" no chance of being signed into law .They they credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside .Actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their they insurance , without anything in return .This would be an unmitigated political disaster .
