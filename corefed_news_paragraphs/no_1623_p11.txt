Much of the weakness in the Republican position comes from seven G. O. P. incumbents in mostly    states trying to win a second term after first being elected in the Republican wave year of 2010 : Ron Johnson in Wisconsin , Mark Kirk in Illinois , Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire , Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania , Roy Blunt in Missouri , Rob Portman in Ohio , and Marco Rubio in Florida ( assuming he wins the Republican primary next week ) .In addition , the retirement of the Republican Dan Coats along with the entry of the former Democratic senator Evan Bayh in the race in Indiana shifted that seat from a likely Republican hold to a possible Democratic pickup .Richard Burr â€™s seat in North Carolina also seems vulnerable .Polling indicates that even Senator John McCain of Arizona could be swept out by the encroaching Democratic tide .
