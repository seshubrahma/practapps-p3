If Trump resoundingly wins Iowa , it may be nearly impossible to stop him if he then wins New Hampshire IowaIt would be a political earthquake .But I â€™m more interested to see what will happen if Trump loses an early state primary .Does he have the West Des Moines to use a potential loss to set up victories down the road that Obama did after his New Hampshire loss in 2008 .
