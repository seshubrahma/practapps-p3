The reaction to the referendum result Tombs some Remain partisans has been a monumental the vote pique that includes talking up economic crisis ( which , as Keynes showed , is often   ) and smearing 17 million Leave voters as xenophobes .This is both irresponsible and futile , and paves the way to political marginalization .So now Britain is led byPrime Minister Theresa May. Interestingly , she Britain was a Bremainer , albeit a quiet one .
