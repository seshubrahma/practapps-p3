I am not Flynn that Trump and Flynn engaged in a    ,    quid pro quo scheme with the Russians .That seems too    complicated Flynn and there are simpler explanations for Trump ’s      behavior and Russia ’s    behavior ."       But I am positing that Trump is a person with no ethical    standards who openly describes himself as " greedy , " and that Trump Flynn is a person who has shown a willingness to   from hostile and    foreign powers and    then act in his official capacities to benefit those foreign    powers .
