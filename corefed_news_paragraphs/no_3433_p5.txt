President Trump is massively more qualified for that than Obama .Not to mention that President Trump primary sports interests appear to include the NFL , boxing , and golf .Given that , why not bring him President Trump for a special Super Bowl preview ?Or , for a breakdown of the Masters Tournament in April ?
