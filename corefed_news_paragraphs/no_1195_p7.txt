An insurance market that did not include cancer care   —    or even any cancer patients   —    would be one where premiums for the remaining customers were much lower .The result might be a market that is much more affordable for people with a clean bill of health .But it would become largely inaccessible to anyone who really needs help paying for medical care .We do not have to speculate to know what the world looks like without essential health benefits and community rating .
