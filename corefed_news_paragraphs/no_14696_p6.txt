A FAQ on the National Park Service ’s website says the retreat is in the park but the retreat location is not displayed on park maps for " security and privacy " reasons .However , about a mile up the winding , wooded road through the park , there ’s an entrance to " CAMP # 3 , " and signs reading " RESTRICTED AREA : DO NOT ENTER , " with several other signs restricting parking and cameras .The "RESTRICTED AREA enclosed with high    fences and watch houses .   Presidential visits to the camp were once an active part of Thurmont life .
