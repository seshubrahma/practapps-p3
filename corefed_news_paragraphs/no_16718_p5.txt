A perusal of the 2016 primary debate transcripts shows that " excuse me " has been leveled in a caustic manner 22 times .Nevertheless , outside of the time a male directed it to a female , the " excuse me " interjection never graced a single headline .Perhaps this was because Bernie Sanders played directly into the hand of the " aggressive male " stereotype .A deeper walk through political debate history suggests a long history of both male and female gender stereotyping .
