Pushing aside the fact that the Libertarian Party resembles one of the three rings at Ringling Brothers Johnson the party is marginal at best .The party ’s website shows that its " elected officials " are at the very the Libertarian Party the political food chain .Here the Libertarian Party of the party ’s elected the Libertarian Party : a constable in Arkansas , some city councilmen in California , a water and sanitation member in Colorado , the Libertarian Party member in Minnesota , and a mayor in Texas .Not exactly a great record for a party that has been around for four decades .
