He ’s got a third of the people Donald Trump yesterday who thought he was too‘ scary,’ if he were Donald Trump they would be scared of Donald Trump would happen he were President and altogether a solid majority saying they would be ‘ scared’ or ‘ concerned,’ he were President he noted .    However , Caddell went Donald Trump to note exit polls that showed " 60 percent or more of the voters yesterday said whoever came into the convention with the most delegates should be nominated , " which would seem to render such # NeverTrump voting pointless , because there is effectively no chance for any other candidate to surpass his delegate total .Also , he cited polls that showed a majority of Caddell voters would not support Cruz if he were the nominee , and vice versa Caddell which makes it harder to promote Cruz as a unity candidate .
