That put NBC in a quandary : NBC the network continued with business NBC , it would risk never being able NBC compete for Latino viewers against Univision with NBC â€™s own    network , NBC   In the end , business and common sense prevailed , and NBC parted ways with Trump .What NBC this all mean ?It means that the presidential campaigns , this all many corporate entities , are all in " deep doo doo " with Latinos , to quote a former U. S. president .   These campaigns seem to have more of the presidential campaigns than a grassroots outreach effort .
