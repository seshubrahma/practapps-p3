With each law enforcement officers to stand in front of us and all that threatens life lost , we lose more of our humanity .It us time for us us unite as Texans , as Americans , to say no more .No more will we tolerate disrespect for those who serve .No more will we allow the evil of hate merchants to we us apart .
