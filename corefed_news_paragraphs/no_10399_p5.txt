So , to be clear , I do nâ€™t blame the Citadel The Citadel .The United States has always protected First Amendment rights by prohibiting any government entity from restricting any expression of speech on the basis of the content of the speech .speech burn an American flag because prohibiting one from doing so is taking issue with the CONTENT of what one is saying by burning said flag .That is powerful and ever necessary in a free society .
