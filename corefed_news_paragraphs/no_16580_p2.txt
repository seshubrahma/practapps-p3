The problem is , in addition to Trump ’s checkered past , Trump’s has done little to woo black voters since declaring Trump’s candidacy     and Trump’s has had plenty of opportunities , beginning with the primary in South Carolina , where blacks account for nearly 30 % of the population .   If Trump was serious about education reform , Trump could have visited crumbling , underfunded and predominantly black schools along Interstate 95 known as the " Corridor of Shame " and unveiled Trump plan for America ’s public schools .   If Trump was committed to helping minority businesses , Trump could have toured manufacturing plants in Greenville and explained Trump plan for expanding helping minority businesses access to capital and corporate supply chains .   If Trump was sincere about healing divisions , Trump could have worshiped at Mother Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston , where a man who police said wanted to start a race war admitted killing nine churchgoers , including the pastor     my friend and state senator Clementa Pinckney     and talked about racial reconciliation .
