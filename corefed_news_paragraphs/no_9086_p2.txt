Cruz explained that Cruz objective was to allow taxes to be filed on a postcard , which Cruz has a picture of on Cruz website : " When Cruz we get rid of all the corporate welfare , all the subsidies , all the    in the IRS code , it dramatically simplifies it .And under Obama , the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together , " Cruz explained ."Now , at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler .
