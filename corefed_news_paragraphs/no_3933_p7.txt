There are now 350 people on a wait list for an    class in Phoenix , and the citizenship efforts there have more than doubled between December and February , climbing from 30 to 80 participants at each session .The Koch ’s LIBRE Initiative is also continuing to push for amnesty for the more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the U. S. with immigration hawks citing that there are most likely about 30 million illegal immigrants .Despite coalitions like the ‘ Gang of Eight,’ which included Democrats and establishment Republicans like Sen. John McCain ( ) and Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) to push amnesty , the efforts routinely are shot down as the efforts prove to be unpopular with American voters .Nonetheless , the Koch Brothers still see a route to work with the open borders lobby and get an amnesty through Congress .
