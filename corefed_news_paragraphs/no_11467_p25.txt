I do think that if you try not to call it a newspaper   —    if for instance you call it ‘ a report of everything that ’s happened in the world and what it means to you it then that sounds pretty critical , I think   —    It ’s just that the newspaper has changed form .It used to be that we said freedom it the press belonged only to those who own one it Now , everybody owns a printing press .Now a large portion of the world has access to the ability to   —    if they have a computer hooked to the world   —    create their own newspaper   —    create their own report of what happened in the world that ’s meaningful they them .
