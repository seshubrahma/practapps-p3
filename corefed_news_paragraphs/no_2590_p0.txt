Donald J. Trump vowed on Tuesday that as president , Donald J. Trump would put an end to policies that send American jobs overseas , threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese imports and promising to punish companies that relocate American jobs manufacturing to countries with cheaper labor ."It will be American hands that remake this country , " said Mr. Trump , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , standing before a hunk of aluminum at a recycling plant in western Pennsylvania .But such declarations are at odds with Mr. Trump ’s long history as a businessman , in which Mr. Trump has been heavily   —    and proudly   —    reliant on foreign labor in the name of putting profits , rather than America , first .
