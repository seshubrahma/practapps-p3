It is now in this spirit that I make an appeal to all in Hollywood Hollywood the media for us to use the Oscars to take a stand for the entire world to see and hear .It is time for Hollywood Hollywood lead the way .I propose that Meryl Steep , Chelsea Handler , Richard Gere , Robert DeNiro , Christoph Waltz and others lead an Oscar first : let ’s do away with the rules , barriers , and tickets to the Oscars and    such as the swanky Vanity Fair party or the Weinsteins’    affair .I ask all migrants , all illegal immigrant criminals and all    refugees to converge on Hollywood to come to the Oscars and all the    even those held at the mansions or the Chateau Marmont or anywhere else .
