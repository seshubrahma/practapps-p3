Iraqis also say fighting for the dense , urban spaces of western Mosul requires more airpower , even if that means more civilians will die .When those decisions turn tragic , it looks like this : a panorama of destruction in the neighborhood of Mosul Jidideh so vast one resident compared the destruction to that of Hiroshima , Japan , where the United States dropped an atomic bomb in World War II .There was a charred arm , wrapped in a piece of red fabric , poking from the rubble rescue workers in red jump suits who wore face masks to avoid the stench , some with rifles slung over some with rifles shoulders , searched the wreckage for bodies .One of the survivors , Omar Adnan , stood near Omar Adnan destroyed home on Sunday and held up a white sheet of paper with 27 names of Omar Adnan extended family members , either dead or missing , written in blue ink .
