Last night ’s Golden Globe Awards placed a spotlight on the films La La Land and Moonlight —   and on Meryl Streep , who used her lifetime achievement speech to make a political statement against the bullying behavior of    Donald Trump .her also rose to the defense of Hollywood , whose " outsiders and foreigners , " her implied , are in a position to model empathy for all of America .But the full picture is more complicated : Mixed martial arts , which Streep invoked as a symbol of provincialism , is in fact a highly multicultural sport .And even the dreamers of Hollywood —   portrayed in last night ’s big winner , La La Land —   can be guilty of a regressive degree of nostalgia .
