WASHINGTON ,DC   —    Political Islam , focused on establishing an unfree society ruled by strict sharia law , is " fundamentally incompatible " with the U. S. Constitution and the overall " foundation of the American way of life , " declared Ayaan Hirsi Ali , an expert at the Hoover Institution think tank , during a Senate panel hearing .[ Meanwhile , Michael Leiter , the former director of the U. S. National Counterterrorism Center , argued that sharia law is compatible with the U. S. Constitution .   " Muslim ’s honoring of Sharia is not inherently in tangent with living in constitutional democracies anymore than it would Muslim’s honoring of Sharia for Christians or Jews who also seek to honor their religious traditions while still complying with civil authority , " testified Leiter .
