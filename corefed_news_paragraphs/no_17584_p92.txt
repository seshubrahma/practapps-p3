Blodget: I believe the some journalists and    media organizations are trying to find the truth .I also believe    that each journalist and media organization brings a particular    perspective to their work the media just as each Bridgewater employee    brings his or the media own ideas and beliefs .But I believe the media    ecosystem as a whole   —    with all of the diverse outlets and    Bridgewater   —    combined with this amazing thing called the    each journalist and media organization in which anybody can publish their own view         is a great    tool for helping us get to the truth overall .
