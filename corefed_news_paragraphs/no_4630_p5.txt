Trump met with Abbas on May 3 in Washington and is due to meet Trump again next week in Bethlehem during Trump visit to Israel .According to Levin , Trump " may not be informed " and instead has been placing Levin trust in people like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and " military bureaucrat " H. R. McMaster , Trump ’s national security advisor , both of whom , Levin argued , are " pushing the agenda " that a two state solution is still possible .Levin said , " So quickly and easily has the president of the United States fallen into the lap of the leftists , of the bureaucrats , of the State Department , of the swamp ."
