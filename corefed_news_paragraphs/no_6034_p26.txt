I am a big supporter of the Tenth Amendment .Now as for these law experts   â€”    the Tenth Amendment provided their opinions but law experts provide their opinions in a court these law experts   law everyday only these law experts   be rejected by the courts these law experts   Ultimately this will be something determined by judges , not law experts giving their opinion on cable news networks and the only valid legal opinion to this day judges as you referred to , comes from the 1869 Texas v. White where it was declared that unilateral secession was illegal but possible only through revolution or by this of the states .The thing is that " consent of the states " has never been legally defined .
