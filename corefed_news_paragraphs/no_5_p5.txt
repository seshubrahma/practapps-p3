The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use , and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2 .Petra Nova , a    joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration , will not just grab the CO2 , it the CO2 it , the CO2 compressed CO2 the CO2 a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field .The gas will be injected Gas , a technique known as enhanced oil recovery , that should increase production to 15 , 000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day .And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project , what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation .
