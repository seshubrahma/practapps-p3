Petra Petra Nova the most common technology for carbon capture .The exhaust stream , pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova Petra Nova is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines , which bond with the carbon dioxide .That solution is a solution of chemicals known as amines, which bond with the carbon dioxide a regenerator , or stripper , which heats the amine and releases the CO2 .The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use , and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2 .
