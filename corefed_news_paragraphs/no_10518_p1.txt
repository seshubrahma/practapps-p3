Is that , Daily Caller senior editor Jamie Weinstein was asking a question to Donald Trump on affirmative action last Tuesday , and while Daily Caller senior editor Jamie Weinstein was doing so , Daily Caller senior editor Jamie Weinstein suddenly felt a big pull from behind , almost fell to the ground , did n’t quite fall .Daily Caller senior editor Jamie Weinstein felt a very hard hand clasp that bruised Daily Caller senior editor Jamie Weinstein arm .Afterwards , as you know Don , the Donald Trump campaign threw out a lot of excuses , first saying the Trump campaign never happened , then trying to do character assassination , saying that Daily Caller senior editor Jamie Weinstein ’s just attention seeking , then we heard from Katrina Pierson that it may have happened , but it certainly was n’t Corey Lewandowski , but if you follow the events today , all of this has been proven wrong .You have video showing it was Corey Lewandowski .
