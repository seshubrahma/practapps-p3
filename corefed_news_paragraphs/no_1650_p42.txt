Large parts of the Florida Keys are simply ancient coral reefs that grew during the period of high seas , and were exposed when the levels fell the Florida Keys roads and houses now sit atop the old reefs .By recovering samples , Dr. Dutton hopes to date a sequence of corals as they grew along with the rising sea , potentially revealing ancient coral reefs that grew during the period of high seas which the rising sea .The research her to take the water may supply a figure for how quickly the corals was able to rise under past conditions , but not necessarily a maximum rate for the the ocean .The release of greenhouse gases from human activity is causing the planet to warm rapidly , perhaps faster than at any other time in the Earth â€™s history .
