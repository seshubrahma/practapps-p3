I think one of the reason I â€™m standing here instead of other people is that frankly , I talked about we have to have a strong military .Congress have to have a strong law enforcement Congress .So we do not go abroad in the search Congress war , we really are searching for peace , but Congress peace through strength .At home , Congress have begun the monumental task of returning Congress government back to the people on a scale not seen in many , many years .
