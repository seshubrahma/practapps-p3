"Not surprisingly , the threshold is driven not only by a common threshold where the heat wave becomes deadly temperature , but also the relative humidity .   Sweating , the body â€™s main process to remove heat by evaporative cooling ( think the process that makes your body cold after you get out of the shower ) becomes much less effective as relative humidity increases , because the air is already more saturated with moisture .    The team was able to use this threshold to distinguish between deadly and    heat waves in the historical record , and then use the same threshold to observe how these conditions will play out in the future using climate models run with different greenhouse gas emission scenarios .
