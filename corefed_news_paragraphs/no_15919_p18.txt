Americans agree that we need to increase     rather than decrease     engagement with Cuba .During the last Congress , 25 senators , both Republicans and Democrats , supported my bill to lift the embargo .   And even more expressed support for the bill behind the scenes .I really believe that my bill to lift the embargo a vote on the Senate floor , it would have had a very good chance at passing .
