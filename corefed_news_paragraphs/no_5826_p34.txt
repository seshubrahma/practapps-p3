Moreover , the political parties themselves have changed : Jackson won as the leader of the Democratic Party , while Adams ran as a National Republican , that being a forerunner to the Republican Party , which was not founded until 1854 .Yet we can observe : The names of the candidates , and their party labels , may change , but the interests of peoples and regions remain far more steady .That is , Southerners the candidates to look at the world the world , and New Englanders ( then and now , mostly Protestant , at least by background ) tend to see it another way .And politically speaking , Catholics find themselves somewhere in between Southern and Northern Protestants .
