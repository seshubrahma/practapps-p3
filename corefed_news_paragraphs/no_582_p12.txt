For the exporters , the disadvantages caused by a    in the dollar would just cancel out the advantage received from changes in the tax system .But businesses that are not exporting anything across the border would suffer from the damage of a more expensive dollar without receiving advantages from border adjustment .As Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute has noted , that applies to any organization that serves a large number of foreign customers within the United Statesâ€™ borders .Think of , say , a Trump international hotel , or amusement parks like Disney World , or any American university that bolsters its finances with foreign enrollment at    tuition .
