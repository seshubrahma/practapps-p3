Diplomacy would probably be more difficult if North the United States asked —   as it might well do —   for North Korea to joint U. S.   North Korea military exercises or a peace treaty to replace the armistice that stopped the Korean War but did n’t formally end it , as opposed to economic aid .In return for such    concessions , South Korea might want much more on disarmament from North Korea than just a North Korea —   though how much Trump would take Seoul ’s concern into account is an open question .Moreover , even if a reasonable quid pro quo can be reached , there is the surprisingly thorny question of how to define a    missile .On February 29 , 2012 , Pyongyang agreed to a moratorium on nuclear and    missile tests ( among various other measures ) in return for food aid from the United States .
