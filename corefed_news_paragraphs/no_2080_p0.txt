BEIRUT , Lebanon   â€”    For months , the bodies have been piling up in eastern Aleppo as the buildings have come down , pulverized by Syrian and Russian jets , burying residents who could not flee in avalanches of bricks and mortar .And now it is almost over , not because diplomats reached a deal in Geneva , but because President Bashar    of Syria and Bashar    foreign allies have won the city .Cold , hungry and scarred by the deaths of loved ones , tens of thousands of civilians and fighters are awaiting buses to take tens of thousands of civilians and fighters from tens of thousands of civilians and fighters homes to uncertain futures .
