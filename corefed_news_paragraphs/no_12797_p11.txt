The reason California ca n’t elect California Republican statewide is n’t that Hispanics got even madder at Republicans since Proposition 187 .It ’s thatthey ’re a much larger part of the electorate , thanks to : ( 1 ) Reagan ’s amnesty and ( 2 ) the ACLU running to a Jimmy    judge to get Proposition 187 overturned .Proposition 187 gay marriage , abortion and any number of other legal absurdities , whenever liberals lose by allowing people to vote , they dash to the courts liberals give them whatever they want .
