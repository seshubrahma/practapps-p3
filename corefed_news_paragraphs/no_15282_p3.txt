There is no greater threat to our " green and beautiful " the Earth than the more frequent and intense droughts , floods and storms brought by climate change .     countries around the world are some of the most severely affected by climate change impacts like heat waves , floods , droughts and extreme weather events like the recent famine in Somalia , which has led to more than 16 million people facing food shortages and death .Many Muslims live in parts of the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change , such as Bangladesh and parts of    Africa .Pakistan is another country that is extremely short of freshwater resources .
