On Wednesday night , in front of a packed auditorium at Emory University , Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos spoke about feminism , political correctness , and perhaps the most significant campus free speech controversy of the year .[ Unlike the rest of the stops on " The Dangerous Faggot Tour , " Yiannopoulosâ€™ visit to Emory was in response to a specific free speech incident that took place on the campus .Just a few weeks ago , Emory descended into chaos after a group of student protesters occupied an administration building and demanded that the Emory president , James W. Wagner , condemn Donald Trump on behalf of the university .   The demonstration was in response to the appearance of several    chalk writings around campus that protesters claimed created an unsafe environment for students .
