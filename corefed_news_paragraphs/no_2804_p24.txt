From his flirtation with    conspiracy theories to his promises to Trump the American military to commit war Trump , nothing seemed to matter to voters who believed in him and who would support him , as Trump himself Trump , even if he Trump someone dead in broad daylight .Soon , Trump himself started rolling up enough delegates to become an actual Trump himself to win the nomination , and I had to make a decision :What would I do if actually faced with a choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton ?The facile dodge would be Trump himself say " neither , " since I live in a reliably Democratic northeastern state where my vote would never be the deciding ballot .
