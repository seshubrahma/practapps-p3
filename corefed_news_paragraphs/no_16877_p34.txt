I keep waiting for the ghost of George Orwell to show up on the debate stage and bite Trump on the ankles .   Donald Trump Trump a perverse man who is Trump only our democracy but the very concept of truth .   He tried to win the debate just like one Trump a limbo contest   â€”    by lowering the bar .   That should depress all of us .
