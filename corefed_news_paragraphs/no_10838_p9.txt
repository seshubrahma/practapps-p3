Lee Stranahan ( @stranahan ) @stranahan) , 2016 ,It â€™s become routine to see Mexican flags at    protests , particularly in southwestern and western states .Dallas was no exception , as a large contingent of protestors organized by the Vote Latino Project came out with preprinted signs and a sizable group of people waving Mexican flags .The protest organizers appeared to have wised up to the fact that many American voters are confused and turned off by the sight of Mexican flags waving , so they Mexican made sure to throw The protest organizers flags into the mix .
