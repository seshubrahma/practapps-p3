By and large , previous appointments drawn from the ranks of the military have been sound , if not excellent choices .Consider George Marshall as Harry Truman ’s secretary of state and defense , Colin Powell as Ronald Reagan ’s national security adviser and George W. Bush ’s secretary of state , or Brent Scowcroft , national security adviser under George H. W. Bush .What you want in these positions are individuals who have leadership skills , the capacity to master their briefs these positions the required management skills to handle large and complicated systems .Appointments should be judged by these standards , not whether they are these standards , doctors , lawyers     or butchers , bakers and candlestick makers .
