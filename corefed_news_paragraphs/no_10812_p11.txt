Trump Walker , Ohio ’s Kasich as his vice president .He walked that Trump somewhat shortly thereafter Trump and it certainly would end up being difficult for Trump to bring aboard Rubio after a Trump primary where the two attacked each other on the debate stage with allusions to the other ’s manhood .But that does n’t mean that an alliance could n’t be formed , and although that alliance might not mean having Rubio as vice president —   an alliance the opening ask of many of these Rubio supporters —   it could mean having Rubio involved in the campaign in some significant way—
