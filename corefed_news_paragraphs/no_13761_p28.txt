If you â€™re an ideological conservative , would you prefer a chief executive who goes Medieval on his political opponents to achieve 75 percent of what you believe , or an unaccomplished    who agrees with you 100 percent of the time , but lacks the    to implement any of it ?Like many conservatives , my personal ideology overlapped with Cruz more than Trump .   But it did the    me that Cruz completely lacked any executive experience and was almost entirely lacking business experience .   the    Cruz , capitalism was Cruz philosophy , not a    application .
