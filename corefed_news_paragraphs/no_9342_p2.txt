Washington is broken , and the only way Republicans can hope to win back the White House and put our nation on a better path is to support a nominee who can articulate how conservative policies will help people rise up and reach their full potential .For the sake of our party and country , we must move to overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity Donald Trump has brought into people political arena , or we will certainly lose our chance to defeat our Democratic nominee and reverse President Obama â€™s failed policies .To win , Republicans need to make this our about proposing solutions our the many challenges we face , and I believe that we should vote for Ted as he will do just that .The Republican establishment has been running hard against GOP frontrunner Donald Trump , who is Republicans    his campaign .
