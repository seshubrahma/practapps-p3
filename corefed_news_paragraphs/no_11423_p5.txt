The same goes for Trump ’s Trump major corporations such as Ford for setting up factories in places like Mexico .Trump has major Trump operations around the world and could be criticized for the same thing .As Economics Professor Donald Boudreaux of George Mason University says , " Trump is either Trump hypocritical or inexcusably ignorant of economics .There is zero economic difference between , say , a U. S. car company ’s investments abroad in factories and Mr. Trump ’s Trump abroad in hotels : both are meant to improve the bottom line of companies headquartered in the U. S. by taking advantage of profitable economic opportunities outside of the U. S. "
