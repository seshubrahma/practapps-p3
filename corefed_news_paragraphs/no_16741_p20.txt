The good news for Clinton is that    like her have usually done well in debates and have Clinton on to claim the presidency     think Reagan in 1984 , George H. W. Bush in 1988 , Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 , George W. Bush in 2004 , and Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012 .   That ’s 7 out of the past 8 elections .   That should give her team some reassurance .     History , then Clinton does n’t hold the ultimate answer .
