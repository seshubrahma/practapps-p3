If a Democrat were to win the seat   —    once held by Newt Gingrich , and recently vacated by Tom Price , who joined Mr. Trump ’s cabinet as secretary of health and human services   —    it would not be because of the $ 4 million that has come into the Ossoff campaign , much of it from national donors .Rather , it would be thanks to volunteer brigades roused by Mr. Trump’s election , who are knocking on doors , making phone calls and writing personalized post cards to turn out voters .
