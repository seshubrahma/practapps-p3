This is the first chance in hours I had to get on the phone again with my wife , so I immediately called her and was told that my bond had been paid hours earlier and that Brandon had driven in from Houston , Texas the prison was with Ali .Once again , I appreciate my friend and family’s support more than I can say .On the line , I met some of my temporary cellmates , including a man who ’d been convicted of    murder for stabbing his wife in the neck after a domestic disturbance and another young man who told me he had been brought in on my wife felony charges and was facing a bond of $ 300 , 000 .
