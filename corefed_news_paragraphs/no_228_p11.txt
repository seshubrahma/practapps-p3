This concert ended up being as notable for the concertâ€™s not show up as for who did .The only featured nonwhite performers were Sam Moore ( of the 1960s soul duo Sam   Dave ) who sang a restrained " America the Beautiful " backed by an    choir America and DJ Ravidrums , who delivered his dim , caffeinated percussive interstitials from inside a spherical    drum kit .But both of those acts got just a couple of minutes .The United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps got much more time for their     songs .
