The conservatives who are with Trump see an unprecedented way to accomplish conservative goals , meaning to actually " conserve " what made America great in the first place , even without an ideologically pure standard bearer .The key to this pragmatic position , and the reason it ’s so effective , is the uncomfortable yet true realization that in order to actually get one ’s agenda accomplished legislatively in America , one must actually win elections on a national scale .In order to do that , conservatives must abandon the " conservatism " that in effect " majors on the minors " by focusing on peripheral issues that , while conservatives may be important morally , do n’t personally affect the average American voter , and instead embrace issues that do .For the average American voter own survival , it ’s time for conservatives to become populists .
