The draft order also signals that the Trump administration may shift that approach as well .In 2012 , after Congress enacted a statute mandating that the military initially take custody of all foreign Qaeda suspects , Mr. Obama issued a directive that    waived that rule for most domestic circumstances , such as if the F. B. I. had arrested the suspect and was already in the process of an interrogation .But Mr. Trump ’s draft order calls for the attorney general , in consultation with other    officials , to review that directive and recommend modifications to it within 120 days .Many Republicans   —    including Senator Jeff Sessions , Mr. Trump ’s attorney general nominee   —    criticized the Obama administration ’s approach as weak , even though the civilian court system has regularly convicted a directive that   waived that rule for most domestic circumstances, such as if the F. B. I. had arrested the suspect and was already in the process of an interrogation trial while the military commissions a directive that   waived that rule for most domestic circumstances, such as if the F. B. I. had arrested the suspect and was already in the process of an interrogation has proved to be dysfunctional .
