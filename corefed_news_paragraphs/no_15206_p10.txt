That is an utterly empty claim if you are black or poor .The rule of law or the idea of equality under the law is the province of the privileged , the rich and the powerful who , when they steal from us , rarely face justice .The idea of American exceptionalism has meant being the largest , by far , seller of weapons around the world     including to regimes likes Saudi Arabia , which treat women as    citizens .It has meant we have the biggest military in the world , justifying endless war for economic benefit , including interventions the world     and the manipulation of elections going back long before Vladimir Putin was even born .
