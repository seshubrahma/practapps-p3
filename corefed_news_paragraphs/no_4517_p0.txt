In 1969 , Governor Ronald Reagan of California was met with a problem that will sound familiar to those who were following my college tour last week : batshit crazy leftists rioting at UC Berkeley .[ Governor Ronald Reagan of California answer was to send in the National Guard , armed with buckshot and batons .Contrast this with Berkeley UC Berkeley more recent approach , which was to give professor and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich a platform to spew a hysterical conspiracy theory in which Breitbart and I hired domestic terrorists to beat up my own fans and the residents of Berkeley UC Berkeley smash up Bank of America ATMs , Starbucks and trashcans .   But back to Reagan .
