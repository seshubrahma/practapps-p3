Owned " is borrowed from hacker slang .If you got owned , that meant some hacker jimmied the lock on a virtual back door , snooped around your property and rifled through your stuff .The word speaks of a literal possession : annexing another person â€™s virtual space and stealing private information .But " you got owned " also animates a simple theft with a violent spark .
