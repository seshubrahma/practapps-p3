The dysfunction in Washington .But the straw that broke the camel ’s back for me was Congress’ inability to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2014 Donald Trumpthe Senate passed it and the president promised to sign it .Even a majority of the House of Representatives would it voted for it if it were brought up to a vote .
