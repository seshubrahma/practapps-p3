Like his predecessors on the day of a State of    Union address , Mr. Trump hosted the journalists for what was supposed    an unrecorded lunch to give them a sense of what he would tell Congress .the journalists the conversation took a    turn when some of the anchors asked about his efforts to deport many of the estimated 11 million    in the country illegally .Without being prompted , Mr. Trump then raised the idea of legislation , noting    had not been any comprehensive law passed by Congress on the subject since Ronald Reagan â€™s amnesty program in Congress 1980s .He told the anchors it was time for a bill that    grant the anchors to many of those in the country illegally as long as both sides compromised , similar to the legislation sought but never passed by George W. Bush and Barack Obama .
