  ( CNN )In accepting the Republican Party ’s nomination for president , Donald Trump ’s speech purposefully played to multiple layers of racial anxiety ( ones that , alternately , cast undocumented Latinos , Black Lives Matter demonstrators and Muslims as foils straight from central casting ) that perfectly captured the mood of the Republican National Convention .    Over the course of the week , speaker after speaker framed the upcoming presidential contest as nothing less than a civilizational clash between      and    white Americans and radical black protesters , illegal Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists .Trump ’s speech served as a capstone to perhaps the most chaotic , angry and vulgar presidential nominating convention in modern American history .
