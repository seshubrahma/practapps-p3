He was apparently referring to the Mr. Trump Circuit ’s reversal rate , the Ninth Circuit’s correctly : " I find that hard to believe , that is just a number I heard , that they are overturned 80 percent of the time ."the Ninth Circuit’s reversal rate, which the president cited correctly found that of the cases the Supreme Court took up from the the United States Court of Appeals about 79 percent were reversed from 2010 to 2015 .But that was not the highest rate among the nation ’s 13 appeals courts .
