As    expert Hans    von Spakovsky has exhaustively documented , granting    privileges normally reserved for citizens    results in fraud .But " there has been virtually no discussion of how to ensure that they ( and millions of legal aliens ) do not register and vote in elections , " he wrote in a analysis published by the Heritage Foundation .There is no systematic review of voter registration rolls by states to find    and the relevant federal    direct violation of federal    to cooperate with state election officials seeking to verify the citizenship status of registered voters   …     The refusal of federal agencies to obey the law compels local election officials to rely almost entirely on the ‘ honor system’ to keep    from the polls .
