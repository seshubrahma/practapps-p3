I spoke with Earl Swift , who is writing a book about Tangier .   He has lived on the island part time for the last two years and said this island if you make the decision that whether or not you save a place is simply a function of headcount , then Tangier does n’t have a chance . "    It ’s a harsh , but true , reality for the people Tangier .Are we only going to save the big cities like Miami , New Orleans , Boston and New York     and let all the small towns wash away because they do n’t have enough people ?
