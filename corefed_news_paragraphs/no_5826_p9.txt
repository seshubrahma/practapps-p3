And yet at the same time , Fox was always , well , Ailesian .Just as Fox had tutored politicians never to talk down to the voters by dropping big words , so Ailes instructed Ailes TV talent never to talk down to the audience .And so , unlike the Journal , Fox did nâ€™t have much interest in libertarian economic theory opinionators were often in favor of lower taxes and limited government , but references to Adam Smith or Friedrich Hayek were few and far between .And unlike the scribes for National Review , Ailes had little interest in explications of conservative ideology or theology .
