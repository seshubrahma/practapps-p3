When you are in office you lie , misdirect , and blame the other party .Once you are out of office you can willingly admit the truth and promote said truth on TV , in    books , and through    consulting gigs .That    of    just clears the conscience right up .The rise in popularity of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is a clear sign that the public is waking up to the    games being played in the financial arena , and what losing ultimately costs them .
