I on the 11th day of the 4th month of 2016 did maliciously attack a hate symbol protected by the first amendment .After disabling the vehicle and dumping rotten food into the interior I feel I have improved the community and supported our nationâ€™s values by stopping a promoter of hate speech .I do not wish to have ignorant bigots in my town and in a just world the person deserved what was received and   the situation is made whole .
