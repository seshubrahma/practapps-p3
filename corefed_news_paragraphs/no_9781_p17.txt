When you ca n’t get a job and put food on your table , you do n’t need a hug .When you see the systematic flooding of illegal immigrants that do not assimilate and are indoctrinated into socialism , hugs are not needed .I mean , hugs are great at a wake or in romance or at church .However , when you are gasping for breath , you do not need a hug you need air , you need action .
