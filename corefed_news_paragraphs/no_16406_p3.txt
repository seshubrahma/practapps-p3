Most people that I have spoken to in NYC have two fears : 1 ) that it could have been any one of us and 2 ) things are seemingly going to get a lot worse .    Islamophobia did    start with Donald Trump , but it definitely has Islamophobia thanks to him and other Donald Trump candidates who have sown distrust and loathing during this election season .From the perspective of many Muslims , the unchecked rhetoric coming from too many politicians in our country and much of Europe has made it seem fully justifiable to commit acts of violence against Muslims without any consequence .Women , children and the elderly , in addition to people who are Hindu , Sikh and from numerous other backgrounds , have all been victims of attacks due to their actual and victims of attacks associations with Islam and the racialization of the faith .
