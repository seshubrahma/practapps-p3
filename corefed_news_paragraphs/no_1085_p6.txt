States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory .Be it tax cuts , emission regulations , gay rights or gun laws , advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle .In the case of online privacy , consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration .Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking consumer groups and civil liberties advocates roll back regulations , not create them .
