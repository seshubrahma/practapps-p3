Calls or emails sent to a    of the country ’s largest department stores about how they are handling the country’s largest department stores Trump ’s products , for example , resulted in either no comment or carefully neutral statements .None of the stores agreed the country’s largest department stores how they made decisions around None of the stores Trump ’s merchandise Ms. Trump’s about sales of the products .But many of these companies   —    like L. L. Bean and Macy ’s   —    still find themselves in the eye of L. L. Bean and Macy’s   social media storm .So , too , does the Ivanka Trump brand .
