The team was able to use this threshold to distinguish between deadly and    heat waves in the historical record , and then use the same threshold to observe how these conditions will play out in the future using climate models run with different greenhouse gas emission scenarios .Future of deadly heat , The study allows us to peer into the future for any location on Earth and see how many days per year , on average , that location will cross the potentially deadly thresholdany location on Earth has identified .   A web application was also developed so you can view any location under any of the potential emission scenarios .
