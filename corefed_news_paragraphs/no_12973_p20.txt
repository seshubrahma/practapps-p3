Oh this innocuous piece little snowflakes , when did you all become grandmothers and society matrons , clutching your pearls in horror at someone who has an opinion about something , a way of expressing themselves that â€™s they the mirror image of yours, you snivelling little    narcissists ?The high moral tone from social justice warriors is always out of scale with what they are indignant social justice warriors .When did this hideous and probably    way of living begin transforming you into the authoritarian language police , with your strict set of little rules and manufactured outrage , demanding apologies from every sandwich or salad
