In the    words of Peggy Noonan , the voting was reflective of the distinction between the " protected " and the " unprotected " :   The unprotected people of America , who have to live with Washington â€™s policies , rebelled against the protected , who make and defend those policies and who care little if at all about the unprotected .   That broke bonds of loyalty and allegiance .   Tuesday was in effect an uprising of the unprotected .   It was part of the    against detached elites that is sweeping the West and was seen most recently in the Brexit vote .
