Obama’s has barely done anything to help the city where he built he political persona .Not that he did much as a state senator , either .he had no achievements in Springfield until Senate Majority Leader Emil Jones decided to " make me a U. S. Senator " and gave Obama’s credit for others’ legislation .What Obama’s had on Obama’s was usually negative .
