Friday on his HBO program , host Bill Maher followed up on a tweet in which host Bill Maher called San Francisco 49ers    quarterback Colin Kaepernick an " idiot ."   # colinkapernick is an idiot .I support #colinkapernick protest , but stick to what u know : kneeling and interceptions , and then look up " false equivalency "   â€”    Bill Maher ( @billmaher ) September 28 , 2016 ,
