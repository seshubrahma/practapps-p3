The comments of President Obama ’s former senior adviser , David Axelrod that Jon Stewart had " forceful arguments " on issues that " deserved to be answered " added to the speculation .    This got me thinking .One : Why would n’t President Obama consult with Jon Stewart , a man who is truly the Walter Cronkite ( with more laughs ) of our generation ?   And two : Would Jon Stewart consider running for president ?
