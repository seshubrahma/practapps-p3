In the realm of international trade , it is a truism seemingly as consistent as gravity : Jobs and investment flow from north to south , while manufactured goods travel the other way around .Factories in the United States and Canada shutter as work shifts to Mexico and Central America , where human hands do it more cheaply .So the established order of trade was by all appearances turned upside down on Tuesday , as General Motors agreed to cease manufacturing an automobile engine at a factory in Mexico while moving jobs to a plant in Canada .One might reflexively assume that this turn effectively validates a central promise made repeatedly by Mr. Trump .
