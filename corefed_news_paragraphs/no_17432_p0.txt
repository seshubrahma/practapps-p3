Washington ( CNN )Senate Democrats said Friday Senate Democrats will scrutinize the health industry stock trades of    Donald Trump ’s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services , saying Senate Democrats want to ensure that Rep. Tom Price did n’t break insider trading laws while sitting on a major health care subcommittee .   The Georgia Republican ’s trades over the past four years will be front and center in his confirmation battle , according to a senior Democratic aide , who told CNN his party will try to determine if Price violated the Stock Act , a 2013 law designed to ensure lawmakers do n’t profit on private data lawmakers get through lawmakers official work .While there is no evidence that Price , who is an orthopedic surgeon , used inside information when he made multiple trades on health insurance , pharmaceutical and biotech stocks , Democrats and some outside ethics experts think multiple trades on health insurance, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks raise serious questions .
