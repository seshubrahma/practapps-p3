[ Apparently I ’m just too dangerous of a faggot , even for a city that pumps AZT directly into the water .Alas ,    will not become the new San San Francisco any time soon .Okay , so in truth I was n’t banned from the entire city   —    though that ’s surely only a matter of time .Just The Chapel restaurant and event space in Mission District , which cancelled a planned Breitbart meetup after learning of my attendance .
