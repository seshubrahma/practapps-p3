When a poll comes out , I start by looking at the topline results   —    Hillary Clinton is plus 3 percentage points , or Donald J. Trump is plus 1 , for example .But this election ’s also worth looking at vote share   —    whether Hillary Clinton has 47 percent or 40 percent , for instance .In particular , I care about how close the leading candidate is to 50 percent .
