That ruling and a second    decision on Friday , in Wisconsin , continued a string of recent court opinions against restrictive voting laws that critics say were created solely to keep minority and other traditionally Democratic voters away from the polls .The North Carolina ruling tossed out North Carolina ’s requirement that voters present photo identification at the polls and restored voters’ ability to register on Election Day , to register before reaching the     voting age , and to cast early ballots , provisions the law had fully or partly eliminated .The court also held that the ballots of people who had mistakenly voted at the wrong polling stations should be deemed valid .In the Wisconsin decision , Judge James D. Peterson of Federal District Court ruled that parts of Wisconsin ’s Wisconsin voter ID law are unconstitutional .
