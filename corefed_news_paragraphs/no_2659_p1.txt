The congressional measure , an amendment to an appropriations bill , originally introduced in July by Representative Bill Posey , a Florida Republican , has been picked up in the Senate version of the legislation .Because the bill is tied up in a partisan debate over spending , there is no certainty the amendment will pass .But at a time when many Republicans dispute the very notion of climate change , the bill has focused the debate over whether it is the bill   —    or even possible   —    to expect companies to put a price tag on the environmental impact of climate change .Donald J. Trump , the Republican presidential candidate , has called climate change " a hoax " and promises to slash environmental regulations to bolster economic growth .
