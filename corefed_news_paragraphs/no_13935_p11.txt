Equally so , the implication from Trump that his Trump intelligence Trump leaders will dismiss such allegations and reports against him indicates a Trump to politicize the intelligence community to serve the interests of the next president .The conclusion that Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian influence operation on the US election is not the invention of leaders but the conclusion of the     analysts across the different agencies .    Yet Trump has singled out the leaders and said if the president does the next president with the intelligence , intelligence heads will roll .That is a recipe for disaster in terms of creating distrust between the intelligence community and the Trump administration .
