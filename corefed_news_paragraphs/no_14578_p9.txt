Many congregations offered direct sanctuary , housing the undocumented immigrants , while others offered food and legal assistance .   The Rapid Response Team mirrors that structure , but goes one step further by also incorporating private homes , which offer a higher level of constitutional protection than houses of worship and an ability to make it harder for federal agents to find undocumented immigrants .    Under federal law , locations like churches and synagogues are technically public spaces that authorities could enter to conduct law enforcement actions .In 2011 , the Department of Homeland Security instituted a policy limiting ICE action at religious locations .
