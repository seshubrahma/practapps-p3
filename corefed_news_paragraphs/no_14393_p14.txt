Judges do n’t like to be told what cases they can hear .The fact that the decision was " per curiam " means all the judges agreed Judges the result , but they wanted to avoid assigning any particular judge to write the opinion , probably so Trump could n’t single all the judges one of the judges for criticism .I ’m somewhat surprised the court took the time to breathe life into the constitutional arguments .It was n’t really necessary for the order , but it certainly helps the states .
