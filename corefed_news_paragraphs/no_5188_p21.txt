There are lots of constitutional questions that reasonable people can disagree about .Whether the president can exclude foreigners from seven    countries is not one of them .But congressional Republicans are happy to ignore the foreigners , ignore the balance of powers , ignore written law , even to relinquish their own constitutional authority and let the courts run our congressional Republicans policy , just to be a part of the establishment â€™s STOP TRUMP movement .
