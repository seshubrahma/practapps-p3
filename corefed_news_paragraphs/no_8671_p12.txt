I would argue that the freedom to change one â€™s life is far more valuable than any benefit the government can possibly provide ( usually at the expense of freedom ) .But perhaps the most fundamental reason to celebrate these differences is that we should not put all of our eggs in we basket .    What if Donald Trump wins the election ?   We need people on the inside who are trusted by the new administration , who actually care about the black community and can negotiate on our behalf .
