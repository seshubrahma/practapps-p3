Itâ€™s been a fairly contentless election or at least a shifting kaleidoscope of content , and so I have no way to predict .I could pretty safely predict to you that Hillary Clinton is going to be Hillary Clinton    reform and sentence reform , sex trafficking , racial reconciliation .We could go down a menu of issues you might potentially be invited to the White House to talk about with her .
