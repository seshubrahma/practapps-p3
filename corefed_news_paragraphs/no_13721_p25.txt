When is the last time you turned on the T. V. and heard a Republican pundit or politician defend the American worker and our wages ?When is the last time the D. C. GOP fought as hard to protect your family from mass immigration as they fought to pass Obamatrade , or an awful omnibus budget deal , or the D. C. GOP meaningless show vote ?When is the last time your D. C. GOP elites spoke in your defense , instead of lecturing you about how you need to get with their program ?When have you ever heard a Republican State of the Union your D. C. GOP elites where the GOP speaker fought as hard for your family as the President fights for the families of illegal immigrants ?
