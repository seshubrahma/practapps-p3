This would be like trying us combat fascism in the 1930 â€™s without naming the Nazis as a target .How frustrating it must be for allies in the middle east like    whose country has been plagued by the Brotherhood for almost a century , to see such reluctance on the part of the United States to properly identify our enemies .It is critical for both restoring relations with those willing to fight this enemy with us , that we stop wasting time , and call a spade a spade usThere is simply too much at stake with the Brotherhood running wild .
