Dr. King ’s complex iconography can be understood with a simple lesson : Dr. King’s brought racial justice into the mainstream as a fundamental element of American democracy .   On this score , Dr. King’s served as the civil rights movement ’s most important political mobilizer , a global Nobel Peace    figure capable of bridging racial and economic divides by participating in bus boycotts in Montgomery , Alabama , writing a passionate letter from a Birmingham jail cell , leading a March on Washington , and traversing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in a demonstration that galvanized world opinion in support of the struggle for black dignity .   In the shadow of continued moments of racial strife , the Martin Luther King , Jr. holiday represents America ’s political and rhetorical acceptance of civil rights as a moral and political good .    Donald Trump ’s recent assaults on civil rights icon and Georgia Congressman John L. Lewis , however , signal the potential end of this consensus , diminishing our nation ’s moral stature on race matters at the precise moment we need it most .
