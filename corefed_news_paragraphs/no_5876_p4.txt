Let ’s say that ’m Trump decides Trump’s time in the near future that he needs to deploy Trump’s , and so he does , and Trump’s a leftist activist goes to a court , shops and finds a judge , like the guy in Hawaii , and claims that Trump said during the Trump’s that he was gon na Trump’s X Y , or Z , whatever , and the deployment of troops is not really for the stated purpose , and the judge could shut a judge !This judge the stated purpose ruling has a judge    if the guy ’s not stopped , the guy in Hawaii Supreme Court does n’t overturn this , or if Trump does n’t just Trump’s it like Andrew Jackson did , then this ’re getting to the point where the president , because of the judiciary , will have totally lost constitutional authority to defend the country because of this little ruling in Hawaii that was This judge’s ruling idiotic notion that a presidential candidate on the campaign trial making statements is the equivalent of an inaugurated president stating policy .But even at that the judge does n’t have the right to do what he did !
