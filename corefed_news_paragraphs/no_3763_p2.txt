It was wrong for CUNY to schedule the commencement ceremonies on Shavuot   —    the day that the Torah was given by G‑d to the Jewish people .Over 25 % of the student body is Jewish .The fact that the commencement address is on Shavuot is another reason CUNY should cancel Sarsour and    the commencement .
