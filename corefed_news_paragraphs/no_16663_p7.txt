But controversy followed rather swiftly .Ten black writers responded to the book in a harshly negative way , finding the book inauthentic and dangerously misleading as a representation of the slave experience .Now , nearly half a century later , many critics     including    writers     take a more benign view of William Styron book , noting that at least it Styronâ€™s book interest in slave narratives while inspiring a number of truly great novels by Toni Morrison , Charles Johnson , Edward P. Jones and others .    In my view , a novelist must have absolute freedom to write anything     as long as the writing is good , honest and deeply felt .
