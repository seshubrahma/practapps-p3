But many politicians are backing business groupsâ€™ demand for more cheap workers and more    consumers .For example , Rep. Paul Ryan told National Journal in 2013 that dairy farmers should be allowed to hire unskilled migrant workers from Central America instead of investing in    robotic    machinery .   The goal of the new push by Nassif and other business leaders is to amnesty at least 11 million foreign migrants living in the United States , to bring in more    temporary workers and to raise the annual inflow of legal immigrants .Currently , the federal government invites 1 million new legal    and    immigrants each year , and admits almost 1 million temporary workers .
