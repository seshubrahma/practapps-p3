Polling indicates that even Senator John McCain of Arizona could be swept out by the encroaching Democratic tide .If Mr. McCain beats back a primary challenge from the even Senator John McCain of Arizona candidate Kelli Ward , he will face a Democratic challenger , Ann Kirkpatrick , even Senator John McCain of Arizona was within two points in a June poll .Our model gives Ms. Kirkpatrick a roughly     chance of taking the seat .To give themselves a cushion in retaking the Senate , Democrats would probably need to win six of these 11 races : the seven elections with    Republicans the elections in Indiana , Arizona and North Carolina and the contest for Mr. Reid â€™s seat in Nevada .
