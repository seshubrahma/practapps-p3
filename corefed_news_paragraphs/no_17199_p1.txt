The end is near .   The end â€™s the beginning of the end of the uprising against the regime of Bashar    that began March 15 , 2011 , in the opening phases of what once was optimistically called the Arab Spring .It is also , perhaps , the final death knell for that string of revolts or revolutions or uprisings in Tunisia , Egypt , Libya , Syria , Bahrain and Yemen , which have ended in catastrophe ( with the possible exception of Tunisia ) .   I reported from Aleppo in August 2012 , when it appeared the Syrian uprising had a chance to succeed .
