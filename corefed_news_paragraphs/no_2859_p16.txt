furnace production is the fan coil line to end until    to late 2018 , while the final line to close ,    furnaces , wo n’t he shuttered until early 2019 .That staggered schedule has given    some hope that if a compromise between the new administration and    company does emerge ,    may revolve around keeping the gas furnace production lines open , even if a smaller number of jobs are relocated to Mexico in the meantime .If a compromise between the new administration and the company deal was reached , it could also help set the tone for a Trump presidency in terms of corporate America , Mr. Dilenschneider said .Much as Ronald Reagan ’s decision to a deal striking air traffic controllers in 1981 signaled to organized labor that political momentum was no longer on their side , keeping Carrier in Indiana would show that a Republican president was willing to stand up to corporate America .
