They Those who were open to this Marxist Communist ideology in the shadows   â€¦      and when the light shone upon them Those who were open to this Marxist Communist ideology some were punished , and some had careers ruined .But instead of being snuffed out , they Those who were open to this Marxist Communist ideology underground , morphed , and were able to continue to affect media , culture , religion , politics and education .Needless to say , because of this development , Hollywood Hollywood the rest of the nation have become indoctrinated to such a degree that we are now a nation entirely at odds with each other .This still goes on today , with major filmmakers using their major filmmakers to pick projects that forward their major filmmakers as citizens of the world .
