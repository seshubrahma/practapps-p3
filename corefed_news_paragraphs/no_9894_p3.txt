I would have gone from the only U. S. Army General to have served a year as a combat advisor embedded in a Kurdish Peshmerga brigade to Retired Army Brigadier General Ernie Audino practically overnight .Saying , " Oops , I did nâ€™t meant to , " while perhaps interesting , would be less than meaningless .Public servants , and especially military leaders , are held to a high standard .The lives of brave Americans demand it .
