The optics were slightly awkward .Though the musical has become a rarer genre for Hollywood , La La Land is still La La Land about creativity in L. A. featuring two hugely recognizable stars , while the triumph of a    independent work like Moonlight is a genuinely rare phenomenon come awards season , especially as it focuses on themes of black and the musical identity .Still , the balance was somewhat redressed as Moonlight won Best Picture ( Drama ) with    Barry Jenkins shouting out the     campaign that has helped make the film an unlikely box office success .On the TV side , the Globes largely spread the love between various new shows of 2016 .
