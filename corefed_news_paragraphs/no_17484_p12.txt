The school was divided in two parts : the elementary and middle schools were in one block while the high school was within The school on the other side of Moscow .For important school events and    parties , we would all go to the US embassy where the cool big kids were .Stepping inside the American embassy was like exploring a the US embassy where the cool big kids were city , protected by a red brick wall with barbed wire .There were shops where I could buy my beloved Doritos chips and Oreo sandwich cookies .
