I take issue with Condon ’s statement , and with the whole premise of genderless acting categories as a step toward gender parity .First , women have always been a huge segment of moviegoing audiences and currently hold a slight majority , and yet , they women hold very few positions of power as top executives , directors and producers .Not that much has changed at the top of the Hollywood hierarchy since the days of the Bette    Crawford rivalry that was just dramatized in Ryan Murphy ’s FX show " Feud ."
