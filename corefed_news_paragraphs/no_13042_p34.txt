Conservatives , for far too long , have seen environmentalism as a fringe issue , of little concern to them because it does n’t impact too obviously on their key area of Conservatives , the economy .They could n’t be Conservatives wrong , as the American example shows :Conservatives the following ongoing policy battles : the Clean Power Plan , methane regulations , fracking bans , ozone regulations , pipeline blocking , new pipeline regulations , new train regulations , renewable fuel standards , wind production tax credit , solar subsidies , CAFE standards , green building standards , energy efficiency mandates , " green jobs " schemes .All of these policy initiatives were initiated by Democrats , and Democrats are winning on most of them .
