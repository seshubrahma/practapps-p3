I can not support a nominee who refuses to answer important questions .Gorsuch Gorsuch the bench , I am deeply concerned that dark money will continue to drown out the voices and votes of citizens , the court will stand between women and their doctors , and the government Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio)     the private lives of    Americans Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio)     These are not Neil Gorsuch values , which is why I can not support this nomination ."
