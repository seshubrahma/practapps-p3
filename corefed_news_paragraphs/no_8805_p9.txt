We are now becoming the group in the shadows , ignored by local politicians , shunned by mainstream media and standing on the sidelines watching illegal criminals getting more benefits and protection then our loved ones ever got .This insanity and the powerWe politicians using these issues for votes ( from illegal aliens ) to stay in office sickens me .Americans matter , Americans need protection and Americans should come first , after all , we do live in America , right ?
