Chasing    political gains , the GOP missed a lot of chances to fight the hateful a candidate spewing     authoritarian rhetoric that now threaten to overwhelm it .The talking point that the Tea Party    or hostile to immigrants is the typical slander employed by the proponents of mass migration    Hillary Clinton , George Soros , and Paul Ryan , who believe there should be no pause or cessation in record migration even if it means more crime , overcrowded schools , and depressed wages .The editors do not seem to consider the possibility that Trump â€™s popularity stems from the fact that the Republican electorate is tired of its leaders taking marching orders from cosmopolitan commentariats like The Boston Globe , who see no problem with the social , economic , and the Republican electorate effects of mass migration .
