I am thinking about my mother tonight , the child of immigrants , born in 1919 just when women were given the right to vote .I am remembering all the times my mother dragged me into the voting booth to show me what a privilege it was to be an American and to live in this country .I ca nâ€™t talk to my mother about this historic night , but I can talk to my daughter who can see that my mother future is limitless .Almost 100 years in the making .
