The vote may be more favorable to Mr. Trump than the     prognosticators suggest for a very simple reason : Landslides do not really happen in presidential elections anymore .It has been 32 years since a president won the popular vote by a    percentage .That was when Mr. Mondale suffered an    defeat to Ronald Reagan in 1984 .It was also the last time there was a landslide among states , with Mr. Mondale winning only Minnesota and the District of Columbia .
