Hilary Clinton , the Clinton Foundation should not have accepted donations from countries which abuse human rights and Hilary Clinton against gays and women .   In every single one of those instances , Hillary Clinton and her closest advisers , including Bill , exercised bad judgment .Like so many other Americans , I am left deciding which of these two candidates is the lesser of Hilary Clinton , which Hilary Clinton is capable of inflicting less damage on our country , our social fabric .The personal decision for me boiled down to choosing between a person who I consider to have very bad character and a person who has exercised bad judgment .
