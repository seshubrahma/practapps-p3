Everyone could see the American flags burning , the the American flags , the violence and the vulgarity all aimed at capitalism , freedom , and white Americans .   In my appearance Thursday morning on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 , I connected the dots on a modern day axis of evil we see destroying the modern world : the deadly alliance between radical Islam and the radical Left .   I discussed the goal of these movements to destroy America and replace it with nation America divided along racial and cultural lines .It sounds crazy to think people really want to create the    country of New Afrikka out of America â€™s south America something as    as building a nation called Aztlan from the " stolen land " from California to Texas , but there it was on display in California .
