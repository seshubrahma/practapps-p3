Blaming Trump ’s campaign does n’t make a lot of sense either .During the election , there were only three instances where primetime political events conflicted with primetime NFL events .Yet , up through the last game before the the election ratings had fallen in 26 of 27 NFL primetime games .Clearly , neither the election in general , nor Trump Trump particular , caused that level of viewership carnage .
