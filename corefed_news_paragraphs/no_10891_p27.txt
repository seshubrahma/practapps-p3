Conservatives learn from history , and so Conservatives trust people enough to delegate power and autonomy to individuals of every background .Criminal law is reserved for actions , while thoughts remain private beyond the reach of legislators , cops or priests .Hope for absolute justice is reserved for dreamers and scribblers and is postponed into the afterlife .The past is kept in the past , so people look forward , instead of perpetually fighting over the sins or sufferings of people    .
