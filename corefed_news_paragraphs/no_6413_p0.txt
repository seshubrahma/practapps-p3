The swamp in Washington encroaches on our very Mall , where The swamp in Washington threatens to claim a planned memorial to Dwight Eisenhower which against all precedent has been designed without accountability to or participation from the American public .[ Unsurprisingly the result is more contentious and expensive than any past presidential memorial , which has n’t kept eleven appointed commissioners from trying to build the result anyway .Now , without full funding in hand as the law requires , eleven appointed commissioners are asking Congress for public money to build eleven appointed commissioners design on a      basis .   It ’s a bad deal for the American people President Trump can prevent .
