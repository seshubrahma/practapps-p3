Apparent Cruz , It is because both conservative and liberal views of the Constitution —   both originalism and the " Living Constitution " —   seem to point in the same direction here , that top constitutional lawyers and legal scholars on both sides of the spectrum ( liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans ) agree .Conservative Paul Clement ( former U. S. solicitor general and possibly the greatest Supreme Court lawyer practicing today ) and liberal Neal Katyal ( law professor and former deputy solicitor general ) wrote an analysis in the Harvard Law Review last March making the case that a person born to an American mother in Canada is a natural born citizen .Libertarian Ted Olson ( former U. S. solicitor general ) and liberal Laurence Tribe ( professor at Harvard Law School and perhaps the most prolific constitutional scholar of this generation ) hold a similar opinion .The only    lawyer thus far objecting to Cruz appears to be Ann Coulter , who is well known as a lawyer because she is a bestselling author and media commentator , but not an accomplished constitutional litigator , Cruz a constitutional scholar .
