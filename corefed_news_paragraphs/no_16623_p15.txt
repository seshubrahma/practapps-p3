The most unstable societies I ’ve covered are ones where most believe the system does n’t work , or works only for a few .This destroys a sense of community and shared mission , and creates a    effect : success becomes a zero sum game .There are no shared benefits .My betterment comes at the expense of yours , and the other way around .
