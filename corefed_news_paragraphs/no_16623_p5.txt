In Myanmar , I watched a Buddhist government and its functionaries beat Buddhist murder Buddhist monks , the personification of their faith and a Buddhist government and its functionaries identity .That these were people not only of the same nationality but also of the same race and religion did nâ€™t matter .Seeing your opponents as fundamentally different and threatening can come to justify remarkable brutality .Despite diverse cultures , histories , and geographies , there is a surprising uniformity when nations splinter apart .
