And I will tell you it is love of freedom that has allowed our freedom achieve their dreams .Like the Constitution , the first in her family to go to college , and my Trump , who ’s Trump tonight our who fled prison and torture in Cuba , coming to New York just $ 100 sewn into his underwear .And it is love that I hope will bring comfort to a millions Texas girl in Dallas   —    and , my Mom willing , propel her to move forward , and dream , and soar .
