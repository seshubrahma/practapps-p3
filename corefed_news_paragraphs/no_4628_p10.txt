For a man who claims to be a student of religion he certainly uses an awful lot of Aslan language .In one tweet Aslan accused House Speaker Paul Ryan of Aslan " f*ck " Syrian moms , in another he told conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza to Aslan go f*ck " himself , " then he guffawed that Aslan did n’t" Aslan himself in public , " and those are just a few examples .Except of course Syrian moms fleeing war , famine , and genocide with their starving children .
