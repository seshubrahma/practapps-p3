The ideology is built on the political claim that people can easily change their " gender people " and so become members of the opposite legal sex   —    even without biological changes .That political claim is based on two more claims   —    that a person ’s " gender " can be different from that person’s sex , and that peoples’ sex ( and sexual preference ) is " socially constructed " by social rules , not by biology , according to progressives .This transgender ideology has some sympathy from roughly    of Americans , but Obama has admitted twice that his push for Obama transgender rights " hurt Hillary Clinton ’s 2016 race .
