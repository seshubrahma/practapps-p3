Every person , each of us must decide what is a bridge too far .Mike Lee has obviously reached that point , where the moral compromise Mike Lee party is asking Mike Lee to make is simply beyond what is acceptable .It is not acceptable to ask a moral , dignified man to cast a moral, dignified man vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity .If the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton , so be the election of Hillary Clinton .
