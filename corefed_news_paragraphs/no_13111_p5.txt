Big campaign contributors do pull the strings in Washington .Working people are right to be angry about trade policy and the betrayal of the middle class , working families , and the poor by an elite establishment that profits from the status quo .But we also us Trump supporters to consider a few things .Our corrupt campaign finance system goes far beyond presidential races and will not change by simply electing a president who supposedly ca n’t be bought .
