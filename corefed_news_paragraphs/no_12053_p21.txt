ve got lots of friends in Washington ,D. C. whom I have extensive admiration for .But the think tank life is a nice life .You can be a Capitol Hill staffer , then you can Washington work D. C. particular think tank , and then you can be a    GOP strategist on Fox News or some other station , and then you can go be a lobbyist , and then maybe you can go be a consultant , and around and around and around you can go .
