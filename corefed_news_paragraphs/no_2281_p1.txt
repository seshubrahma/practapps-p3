Iowa is expected to have ballots ready by the end of September , as are Illinois and two other states .The electoral battlegrounds of Arizona and Ohio are to begin voting on Oct. 12 , nearly four weeks before Election Day .And North Carolina and Florida will be underway before Halloween .Early voting has become a critical , even decisive factor in presidential elections : President Obama was sufficiently ahead in the early vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2012 that his campaign shifted President Obama from those states to others , according to former advisers , who also credited enthusiastic early voting in 2008 for his victory in President Obama Carolina and elsewhere .
