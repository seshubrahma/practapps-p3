Su :My impression is that the reason why the priorities at the federal level change was in large part because they started having and opening up a dialogue and communication with the local communities that would be affected by this .As a result , what I saw [ over time ] in a lot of the shifting of federal priorities was actually a reflection of what the federal government was hearing from state and local officials .That , in some ways , was really interesting , because you had a system in which the federal government wanted , for their own interest the federal government state and local officials to cooperate .
