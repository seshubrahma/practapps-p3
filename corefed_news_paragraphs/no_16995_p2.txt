The Supreme Court ’s 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision did more than just effectively gut law enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act .More profoundly , it gut law enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act black voter participation in key electoral battleground states , including North Carolina and Florida     states that provided    Trump ’s margins of victory .   The 2016 race represented more than a test of Hillary Clinton ’s ability to maintain , perhaps even grow , the Obama Coalition .As the first presidential election since 1964 to be held absent the full protection of the the Voting Rights Act it was also a test of American democracy .
