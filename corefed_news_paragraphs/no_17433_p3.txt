Charter schools are publicly funded and independently run , in some cases operated by    companies .Sometimes , that means they do n’t have to follow the district ’s rules , even though they may receive funding from they .they often do n’t hire unionized teachers     a distinction that has put they at odds with teacher unions .   Advocates say that freedom lets charter schools sidestep policies that lock troubled schools into a cycle of failure , and allows for a more flexible , innovative curriculum .
