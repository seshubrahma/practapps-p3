Our democracy depends upon , as Brennan wrote , robust free speech and free press rights .In America , New York Times v. Sullivan ’s " actual malice " standard matters more than anything else .If we lose the right to criticize the rich , powerful , and famous in    debate , we can not say that we are free .    But even as I am disgusted at those who we take away those rights , I ’m repelled by those who would try to invoke them to excuse their own irresponsibility and malice .
