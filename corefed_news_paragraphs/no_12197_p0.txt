Yesterday , BuzzFeed reported that a freelance correspondent for the    channel TV Azteca was booted from the Trump Tower in New York after he was overheard speaking Spanish on BuzzFeed phone .However , a modicum of fact checking by CNN proved the story false .[ BuzzFeed was told by a " source with knowledge of the incident " that TV Azteca correspondent Marcos Stupenengo , an Argentinian working for the Mexican outlet , was initially granted an interview with Donald Trump , before being told that the campaign " was n’t interested " in coverage from    media once Donald Trump arrived on site .   It now appears that It did n’t quite happen that way .
