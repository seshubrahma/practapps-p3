In The Toni York Times last month , Thomas Edsall wrote : " A general election that pits Hillary Clinton against Hillary Clinton will produce a decisively Trump and better educated Democratic presidential electorate and a decidedly less affluent and less educated Republican one than in any previous election going back as far as 1976 ."Looking beyond this election , what do you see as some of the this election of that ?One concern , expressed among some liberals , is that the Democratic Party will be less willing to take up concerns of    voters .
