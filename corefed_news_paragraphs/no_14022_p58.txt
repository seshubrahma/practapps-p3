For Merkel , Trump has repeatedly demanded " Donald Trump " .No one rejects the idea of fair trade , but if the focus Berlin fair " rather than " unfair " trade , then the key issue is who decides Donald Trump type of trade is fair or otherwise .As long as the United States does not exit the World Trade Organization , America , like any other member of the WTO , is subject to the United States arbitration mechanism to settle trade disputes .The Trump administration may renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement or quit the Trans Pacific Partnership , but if it does , it will still be opting for negotiation and bilateral trade agreements with    nations and other trade partners .
