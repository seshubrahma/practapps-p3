The Cleveland Press ( @AP ) July 17 , 2016 ,   UPDATE 12:22pm ET :Lee Stranahan writes : While I was covering the protest in Baton Rouge , many Baton Rouge fear that the protest would turn to violence although they said they hoped they would not .Although the media has not reported it , the Black Liberation ideology of groups like Black Lives Matter Baton Rouge deeply rooted antipathy towards law enforcement .For example , the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement have noted themselves that they pay homage to convicted cop killer Assata Shakur every one of their events , and openly admire other convicted cop killers such as Mumia    and H. Rap Brown .
