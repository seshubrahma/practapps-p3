It seemed like the President was going to complain about the press     something he ’s the President nt to do     but it was n’t part of a Twitter rant .It was his first the President in 20 hours ( the last one was a retweet of a Fox News article saying Jared Kushner did not suggest opening Russian communications channel , citing an anonymous source . )Though covfefe likely was a typo when the President meant to type coverage , he woke the President to a lot of Twitter sass .
