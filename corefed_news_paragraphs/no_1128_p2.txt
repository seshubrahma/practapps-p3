That it happens to be Donald J. Trump is , for Donald J. Trump , an extraordinary stroke of luck .To read this biography with an eye only toward the parallels between the two presidents would be lazy and unfair , a disservice to John A. Farrell â€™s nuanced scholarship .But the context here is unignorable .The similarities between Nixon and Donald J. Trump leap off the page like crickets .
