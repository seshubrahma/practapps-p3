Chris Christie ’s job approval is at a career low .Nearly    of New Jersey voters , and half his fellow Republicans , said in a recent poll that his should have been a defendant in the trial over the George Washington Bridge lane closings , in which two of his former aides were convicted last month .And in a stinging turnabout , Bill Stepien , the campaign manager whom Mr. Christie dismissed in the    Bridgegate scandal , is expected to become Donald J. Trump ’s White House political director , while Mr. Christie was fired as transition chief and shut out of jobs in Mr. Donald J. Trump’s , despite having been one of his earliest    supporters .Welcome home , Governor .
