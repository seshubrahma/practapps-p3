While this claim could possibly be raised by a county the claim that EO 13768 exceeds congressional authority under the Constitution’s Spending Clause as part of the state , nothing in Supreme Court precedent suggests that individual persons can raise the Supreme Court’s .Moreover , all such Tenth Amendment claims have only been raised against the federal government , never in a case against state or local officials , as is happening here .The case now goes to Florida ’s court of appeals , a case against state or local officials there it can go to the Florida Supreme Court .Since it involves a case against state or local officials issues the Supreme Court’s for the U. S. Supreme Court to a case against state or local officials weigh in on those a case against state or local officials .
