Seldom in modern American diplomacy has an American administration so directly confronted   —    and disavowed   —    a close ally’s actions as Mr. Kerry did on Wednesday , dropping most of the restraint he had shown in public over the past four years .One of the last times was during the Eisenhower administration , when the Mr. Kerry States broke with Britain , France and Israel over the 1956 invasion of the Egyptian Sinai .
