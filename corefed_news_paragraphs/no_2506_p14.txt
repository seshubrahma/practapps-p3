Similarly , Facebook Google Messenger enables     encryption inside a private chat mode called Secret Conversations .But by default , normal Messenger chats lack that encryption .Facebook’s Messenger though Signal does n’t record your information , the app still works across devices , like a desktop computer and a mobile device .Messages and contacts’ data are stored directly on users’ devices and synchronized between them .
