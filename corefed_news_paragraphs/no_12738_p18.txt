Outside Trump line of young progressive protesters chanting " Equal Rights " was drowned out by the enthusiasm of the Trump supporters ( " It â€™s going Trump be all burnouts outside , " said one young man to another on their way out of the Trump rally ) .Young guys drove the street yelling , " Go out and vote " out of car windows .Young ,    and elderly women and men alike whooped or cheered and went on to patronize local restaurants and businesses .It was like a catharsis .
