Arthur , a    emblem of the    culture of the day , was never even elected to the highest office .His ascent was made possible by Charles J. Guiteau , the man who gunned down President James Garfield in a railroad station , thus promoting Arthur from the vice presidency .To contemporaries , the situation seemed dire .Arthur â€™s administration surely would be defined by unprecedented greed and corruption , full of woefully underqualified appointees lacking any experience in government .
