Perhaps the lesson in all of this is that we should stop expecting our presidents to be great and allow them to be good .we in the sense that they are our presidents morally , respect the law and the Constitution , our presidents are competent and qualified to lead .Indeed , given the fact that demand for greatness in the presidency is always likely to exceed the supply , we may have no other choice .
