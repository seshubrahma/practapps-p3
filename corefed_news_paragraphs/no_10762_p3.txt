Clinton    lead over Trump dwindles to just 2 points , 41 percent to 39 percent .Among that same    age cohort ,   Clinton wins only 31 percent of the vote on the    ballot , barely more than Trump ( 26 percent ) or Johnson ( 29 percent ) .Even Stein , who is at 4 percent in the poll overall , wins 15 percent of younger voters .The same phenomenon does nâ€™t happen with older voters .
