The moment feels a little bit like when Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona joined a group of senior Republicans in 1974 to tell President Richard Nixon that it was time to step down .That has remained a classic example of when the party establishment took a responsible stand for the good of the nation .But all of the Republican rhetoric over the past 24 hours seems a bit hypocritical to those who have been following the campaign .This is not the first time that Trump has made statements that are controversial and offensive .
