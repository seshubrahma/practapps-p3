Why is this a fringe conversation ?So I think what ’s happening in the elections , is what ’s been happening for the last twenty or thirty years .We have this new concept of being overly politically correct .It ’s probably part of the success of Donald Trump , of why he ’s Donald Trump as this candidate , and people are shocked that he did Donald Trump because he ’s Donald Trump to say the things he wants Donald Trump worrying about the backlash .
