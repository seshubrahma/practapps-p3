McWay Falls is among the most photographed of Big Sur ’s vistas .For obvious reason   —    the falls tumble 80 feet off a granite cliff into an almost impossibly beautiful cove .Hajer Dlame , 26 , a reader from the Bay Area , shared a photo she snapped at sunset while visiting with her mother last month .Alas , the beach itself , part of a state park , is strictly off limits .
