Speaking of    we can return to that DHS document DHS the one on Maddow ’s Maddow Maddow’s that dangerous radicalism often emerges only after an immigrant had lived here for a while , thus " limiting " the value of vetting , extreme or otherwise .   So we must ask : If we are n’t sure who we precisely , could be we , does n’t that suggest a general strategy of caution ?   Might n’twe look , for example , at the fate of Europe —   where there have been tens of thousands of murders , and other serious crimes , at the hands of    terrorists —   and start drawing some obvious conclusions ?
