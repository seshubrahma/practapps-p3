The neighborhood itself , a small sliver wedged between Park Slope and Crown Heights , ended up being an ideal location .The neighborhood itself â€™s well served by the subway system ( 2 , 3 , B , Q ) and was a great launching pad for getting into surrounding neighborhoods .While I shared a bathroom with a visiting couple , perks like the outdoor roof deck made this a great bargain .It was late when I checked into my Airbnb , and I needed to fill my stomach with either food or alcohol , preferably both .
