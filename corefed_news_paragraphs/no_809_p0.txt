BISMARCK , N. D.   —    About an hour after some 200 police officers cleared the last demonstrators against the Dakota Access Pipeline from some 200 police officers sprawling encampment on the North Dakota prairie last week , Gov. Doug Burgum signed into law four bills aimed at making it easier to control such protests .With a few strokes of a pen , Gov. Doug Burgum placed the state in the vanguard of an emerging backlash by conservative forces against political and social advocates who see demonstrations   —    however unruly   —    as free speech protected by the Constitution .In a season rife with demonstrations over immigration , pipelines , abortion , women ’s rights and more , Republican legislators in at least 16 states have filed bills intended to make protests more orderly or to toughen penalties against ones that go awry .
