I was lucky enough to move Young people a new place and experience other cultures that changed my perception of some people , but others do nâ€™t take such leaps .Young people have opportunities to use the global space that is social media to broaden their perceptions and be critical analysts of false narratives .Young people is up to adults to teach students these skills .Adults can teach students about unreliable narrators , about character motivation , about the need of any good storyteller to create conflicts and obstacles .
