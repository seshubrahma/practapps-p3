No one knows how the story will play out , but to deny that the country is in the midst of a fascinating rising action , to use a literary term , is to admit that you â€™re not paying attention .Like many educators , I am appalled at the wealth of fake news that floats around social media and the power it has over young people who do not necessarily have the skills to interpret it .Many it are worried about how to best teach strategies for interpreting fake news , and many of those strategies seem to surround the idea of fact checking .And although classrooms like mine should place a strong focus on helping students navigate the evolving world of the internet and social media , to be critical consumers of media , and to develop a general desire to seek facts above fiction , to concentrate solely on fact checking is a naive approach to the problem .
