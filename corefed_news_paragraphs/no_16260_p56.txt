itBut I would not feel Clinton solemnity and emotion of this moment , it I will feel when I watch her accept the nomination at the Democratic Convention .the nomination is making history .   But that is something to cheer ( and even to Clinton over , just a little ) only if Clinton history is marching in the right direction .
