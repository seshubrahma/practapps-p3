ADHD .    It â€™s just really fun to see them coming out of their shells and really being Disabilities in who they are , and knowing that being different is OK .    I have two younger brothers , David them Kenny , and they were both diagnosed them autism at a young age .   It was really    to find something for my brothers to be involved in .
