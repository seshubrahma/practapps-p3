Governor Pence , who projected an endearingly folksy sincerity for much of the evening , countered by questioning critics who suggest that the entire criminal justice system suffers from racial bias , insisting that the    ticket â€™s support for " law and order " resulted in the enthusiastic endorsement of 330 , 000 law enforcement officers around the nation .    Pence decried the " badmouthing " of police officers in the wake of shooting tragedies around the nation , pointedly accusing Hillary Clinton of playing politics with the recent shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte , North Carolina , which sparked days of urban unrest exactly two weeks ago .The " broad brush " alleging racial bias in the justice system , Pence suggested , divides the the nation a time when unity is more necessary than ever ."
