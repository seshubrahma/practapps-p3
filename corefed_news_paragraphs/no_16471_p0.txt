Washington ( CNN )Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that Donald Trump would allow exceptions to let some undocumented immigrants to stay in the US , vowing Donald Trump would n’t grant some undocumented immigrants citizenship but telling Fox News , " there ’s no amnesty , but we work with some undocumented immigrants ."For Trump , whose rise to the Republican nomination was based in large part on the Republican nomination hardline immigration policies , the comments are the clearest sign yet that the Republican nomination is reconsidering the Republican nomination pledge to deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US , a key part of the Republican nomination campaign platform .
