I look up and there ’s a guy with a gun blasting away .Fortunately it was one of the good guys , one of our security detail who was shooting back .Of course it was pistol versus rifle , our it versus the shooter’s rifle along the third base line just outside the chain link fence , and he was ordering us to stay down .
