The trend is hard to measure , since subcontracting can take many forms .But it is big .A study last year by Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton , a former chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama , concluded that independent contractors ,    workers and workers provided by contracting companies or temp agencies accounted altogether for 94 percent of employment growth over the last 10 years .Nonstandard employment arrangements like these account for nearly one in six jobs today .
