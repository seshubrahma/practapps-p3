Reno : I never took the Reno thing seriously .I took it as a dramatic symbol for the wall thing control of our immigration .If we have open borders , who wins and who loses ?It seems obvious to me that a     person like myself gets cheaper labor to clean me house and cut my lawn , and my neighbor down the street with a    education is the one who loses .
