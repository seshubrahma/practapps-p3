The N. F. L. has tried hard over the years to turn Thursday night games into an attraction that would bolster NFL Network and rival the older Sunday and Monday night franchises .The league has increased the number of Monday night over the years , but it has found its biggest success in selling some of the The league , first The league CBS , and now to CBS and NBC , because broadcast networks reach larger audiences than CBS    channel like NFL Network .But Thursday night games have been less attractive to players , who dislike the short week of preparation time after Sunday , and to fans who see that the mostly divisional matchups do nâ€™t generally rival those of other    packages .The Thursday broadcasts have also become part of a discussion about whether the N. F. L. is overwhelming fans with too many games .
