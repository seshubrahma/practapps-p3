Indeed , Donald Trump’s ’s    legal adviser , Michael Cohen , has recently repeated the fallacies , claiming it would be " malpractice " to advise Donald Trump’s to release Donald Trump’s returns while legal adviser, Michael Cohen are being audited .Yet the truth is that Clinton ’s    2015 return is fully open to being audited .For the next three years , the IRS could challenge Clinton on anything that anyone     an eager press , an active "   conspiracy "     might find in those returns .Maybe it would be malpractice for a lawyer to advise a candidate to release tax returns , whether under audit or open to audit , because of the financial risk to a candidate .
