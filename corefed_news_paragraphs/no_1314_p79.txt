â€™s Barnum road called Hard Bargain Signorelli von Braunhut gates decorated with prancing      open to a number of No Trespassing signs .About a mile down the road , it turned into farmland , with a barn and a scalloped wood bridge decorated with large festive red bows crossing a pond gleaming with bright chartreuse scum .From the trees , like a visual illusion , a large brick house emerges .Nearby , a small array of propane generators thrums .
