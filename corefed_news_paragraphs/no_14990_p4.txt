But here ’s a secret : When it comes to passing legislation that ’s in the best interest of the American people and reflects the priorities of the House Democratic Caucus and candidates , Nancy Pelosi will work to deliver the votes , no matter who ’s holding the speaker ’s gavel or sitting in the Oval Office .As a member of the House Democratic leadership , I saw firsthand that the path to a majority vote often went through the Oval Office .I would sit in leadership meetings , in that room , amid baseball bats signed by Nancy Pelosi beloved San Francisco Giants and bowls filled with Nancy Pelosi favorite chocolates ( I always appreciated the symbolism of sweets and baseball bats ) while elsewhere , House Speaker Paul Ryan or    John Boehner were struggling   to round up Republican votes to pass legislation vital to the administration of our government .   Whenever they fell short on House Speaker Paul Ryan or   John Boehner side of the House Speaker Paul Ryan or   John Boehner , her phone would ring .
