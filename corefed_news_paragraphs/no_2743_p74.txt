As I watched the film , based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney , it held me in a state of awed recognition and remembrance of the times I was touched by transformational acts of gentleness and caring .These radiant moments soften an otherwise tough movie , about Chiron , a gay black youth played by three different actors , growing up in a Miami housing project where he acquires the armor of a street thug to survive .Along with " Brokeback Mountain " and " Boyhood , " it is one of the three finest movies of the last decade or so .Is it a coincidence that all three have male protagonists who instinctively resist patriarchal brutishness ?
