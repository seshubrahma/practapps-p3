I think if something like that happens , you see Trump and Cruz sit down and have a Trump and Cruz .Cruz even though the fight ’s gotten pretty brutal , at the end of the day , they ’reboth people that want to turn the table Trump and Cruz down for the establishment , and I think there ’s a lot more in common there than there is to disagree with   …      They need to get together and say , between the Trump and Cruz of us , we have easily    of the delegates , and let us cut a deal and make sure this ca n’t us stolen .
