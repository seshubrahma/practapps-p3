Residents are less willing to share vital information that can prevent crime .       One of the great dividends of our    policing is that it shows us the vast majority of crimes are committed by a tiny number of people in a small number of places .   As Bill Bratton once said ,     is like chemotherapy .   Too high a dose can be fatal , but the right amount can save a person ’s life .
