Two large questions , for me , arise .First , why were the students so upset ?And then , why did the students behave so badly ?I spend most of my weekdays in conversation with students , and I know students â€™re upset by the election of a bigoted man to the White House , someone who consistently derided Mexicans ( among others ) during a bigoted man run for the presidency .
