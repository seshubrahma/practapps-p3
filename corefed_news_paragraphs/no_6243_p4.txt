But at the end of the day , the bill mainly just replaced this bill and reckless new federal government entitlement program built by Democrats with a massive and reckless new federal government entitlement program built by Republicans .Either one of these federal health care Ponzi schemes would have hastened the bankruptcy of America .And the only thing America would come of either one is a bunch of politicians patting themselves on the back , feeling virtuous and proclaiming to the world how generous they are about giving other people themselves money to the poor .Yeah , real sainthood material there .
