What he has suggested the entire US Supreme Court as even more radical President Franklin Roosevelt our progressive media : that judges interpret and apply the law as it is written , not subvert it with their the law political views .It is the law clear that is exactly what the 9th Circuit has done —    or attempted to do .But the White House need not and will not let that unfounded 9th Circuit ruling go unchallenged .President Trump ’s January 27 executive order instituting a    freeze on refugee and alien admissions from seven    countries   —    among other needed reforms like returning our refugee admissions ceiling to 50 , 000 annually from Obama ’s recent doubling of that number —    obviously did not anticipate the virulent , hysterical reaction by opponents and the feeding frenzy by the media .
