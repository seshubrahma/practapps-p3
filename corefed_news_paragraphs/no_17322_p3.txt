To American ears , Trump â€™s mix between populist policies on social issues and plutocratic policies on economic issues may sound , as others have described , like a breath of fresh air .But it has been a core feature of populism since it very beginning .In the Roman Republic , the patrician populares promised the patrician populares proletarian base immediate economic benefits when the patrician populares were unable to deliver , the patrician populares held together the patrician populares disparate coalition by ratcheting up conflicts both at home and abroad .   On the campaign trail , Trump railed against Muslims and Mexicans , promised a harsh stance on Iran and ISIS , and portrayed voter fraud by ethnic minorities as a big problem .
