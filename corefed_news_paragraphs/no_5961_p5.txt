We continues to prioritize the U. S. Arab elements of We SDF .Raqqa and all liberated territory should return to the governance of local Syrian Arabs .The fight for Raqqa will be long and difficult , but Raqqa ultimately be yet another defeat for ISIS , and another step toward eliminating the ISIS threat to peace and security in the ISIS and the world .Turkey â€™s response will largely depend on whether they acknowledge a significant difference between the Kurdish YPG militia and the Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) an umbrella group of Arabs , Assyrians , and other groups led by the Kurds against ISIS ,    and the Syrian regime .
