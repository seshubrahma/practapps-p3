Because charter schools frequently do not answer to local school boards , critics allege that failing schools can fly under the radar in poor communities where parents may lack clout .On the other hand , plenty of    charters have a successful track record , meeting plenty of   charters targets for student performance and graduation rates .Enrollment is small by design .Most states do not permit charters to levy taxes on buildings , and Most states often can not afford to buy or build new space .
