Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos , spoke at West Virginia University today discussing the    Donald Trump , the death of Fidel Castro and campus free speech censorship via security fee price increases .[   " I mean , I ’m a flamboyant , ridiculous faggot , " said MILO stating the obvious , " but It ’s still easier to take me seriously than some of my detractors .Every voice on the Left bleated about how they feared protests and riots by angry Donald Trump supporters if and when Donald Trump lost the election , yet it is the leftists they destroying property and blocking roads .Everyone can see where the hate is coming from .
