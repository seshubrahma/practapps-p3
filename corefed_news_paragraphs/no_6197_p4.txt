Kamala Harris ( @KamalaHarris )March 24 , 2017 , It is not clear what Harris meant by " real lives , " but the idea that any judge would reject " narrow legalism "   —    i. e. the law   —    in favor of deciding cases on the basis of social or other considerations is antithetical to the Western ,    tradition tradition of justice   —    and fundamental to the radical ideology of today ’s Democratic Party .In addition to banking money for the 2026 governor ’s race , Harris is currently raising money off a campaign against Breitbart News   —    a successful startup in her home state .
