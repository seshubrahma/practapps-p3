Chalk up another tradition broken in the Trump era : the practice of cabinet picks going mum once they are named , shunning the news media until confirmed by the Senate .Steven Mnuchin , the newly named choice for Treasury secretary , made that break most evident on Wednesday , appearing on CNBC and before reporters at Trump Tower , musing at length on tax policy .Others including Wilbur L. Ross , tapped for commerce secretary , have been similarly voluble .This has surprised people in both parties familiar with the tortuous Senate confirmation process   â€”    and with what they see as the good reasons to stay silent .
