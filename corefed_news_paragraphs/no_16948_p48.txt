In 2014 , the Chicago    analyzed Cook County Chicago illegal gun possession and found that most defendants received the minimum sentence the city year .That time did n’t even count early releases of prisoners under good behavior laws .Trump is arguing that regulations like bans on assault rifles wo Chicago Chicago violence , because Chicago ’s tough laws Trump n’t stopped its gun violence .But using Chicago as an example does n’t work : its regulations have been scaled back , its gun violence is affected by more lenient laws in other states and its punishments are not always tough on gun crime , potentially Chicago repeat offenders .
