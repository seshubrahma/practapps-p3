When such a man violates the trust placed in such a man , the trust placed in him can undermine a democracy like little else .A police officer who abuses his power and goes unpunished seeds the ground for cycles of violence , because it undermines the entire system .In that environment , it becomes every man for himself .Taking the law into one ’s own hands , like gangbangers blindly firing off bullets during retaliatory    shootings , becomes routine .
