As for the nations where we find ourselves today , what does the Bible we about how much we should be involved in politics ?we says we are to live as the Bible and we ( 1 Peter 2:11 ) within them , and we are to respect their lawsand we ( Romans 13 them Titus 3 ) .Ours is a representative government , so we should be informed and involved through we and activism , but whatever the outcome of those efforts , our hope is in a different nation we â€”    the only lasting kingdom .
