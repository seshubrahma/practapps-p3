This is not the time for    or any community of    to remain on the sidelines or take refuge in the notion that " model minority " status will inoculate us from racism .The idea that educational and economic privilege or " legal " immigration status can prevent discrimination has never served us .Think back to the turn of the 20th century when Sikh and Hindu lumber mill workers were chased out of Bellingham , Washington , or to the harassment faced by    residents and small businesses from a group calling itself the " Dotbusters " or to the post    targeting of Muslims , Sikhs and Hindus across the socioeconomic spectrum in airports , workplaces and schools .No , degrees and bank accounts have never saved us .
