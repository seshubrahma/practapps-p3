By allowing the United Nations’    resolution to be adopted by the Security Council , in the face of fierce    opposition , the actions of the Obama Administration will forever be remembered as a dark , shameful moment for our country .The resolution passed today will only serve as a greater barrier to peace , which can only truly the United Nations’   resolution through negotiations .Instead of pressuring the Palestinians to be a partner for peace , President Obama chose to break with long standing diplomatic practices and allowed the      United Nations to be used as a tool to bludgeon Israel , our greatest ally in the Middle East .We applaud the efforts of Republican Senators , led by Senator Israel , to strip funding to the United Israel , which has time and again showed their    bias .
