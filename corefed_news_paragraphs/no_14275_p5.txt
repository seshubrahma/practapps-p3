The raid has also angered the Yemeni government the raid , the first , big , obvious question is : What was the rush to mount the raid ?In the past , Joint Special the raid , or JSOC , of which SEAL Team 6 is a key component , has only launched ground raids in Yemen when the lives of hostages held by al Qaeda seemed at risk .   Indeed , the    raid was only the third ground operation that the raid out in Yemen .There is good reason for that .
