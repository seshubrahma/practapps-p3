The praise of the Clinton years , and    defense by its leader , was always couched in    to the Reagan and two Bush Administrations .Great .Feeding off the Clinton machine , the Democratic Party has become riddled with lobbyists , billionaires , and hustlers who pocket huge sums of money by running either nonprofit " think tanks " or    networks , and politicians who , indeed , are focused mostly on reelection .Surrounding the party are extremely      leaders , the Democratic Party up defending the status quo .
