Democrats raised fears last month that the incoming administration of    Donald J. Trump , who has voiced support for the outlawed interrogation methods detailed in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report , could cause all copies of the document to be " hidden indefinitely , or destroyed . "In 2015 , after Republicans took control of the Senate and the Intelligence Committee , they asked President Obama to return all copies of the full report , which former Democratic senators have said contains " volumes of new information " that were not made public when Republicans    executive summary was disclosed in 2014 .Mr. Obama did not comply with that request , and in December of last year , he notified the Senate that he was including a copy of the full ,    report President Obama presidential records that would be deposited at the National Archives .But Michel Paradis , President Obama lawyer for Mr. Nashiri President Obama argued that Mr. Obama â€™s decision about his presidential records was President Obama , because Mr. Trump might seek to withdraw the report from the archives and destroy it .
