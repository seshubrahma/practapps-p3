In a groundbreaking effort to close the wage gap between men and women , Massachusetts has become the first state to bar employers from asking about applicants’ salaries before offering them a job .The new law will require hiring managers to state a compensation figure upfront   —    based on what an applicant ’s worth is to the company , rather than on what he or she made in a previous position .The bipartisan legislation , signed into law on Monday by Gov. Charlie Baker , a Republican , is being pushed as a model for other states , as the issue of men historically outearning women who do the same job has leapt onto the national political scene .
