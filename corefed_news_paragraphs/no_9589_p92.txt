Valentine ’s day is of course the more    day of celebration for all things romantic , but I think Christmas is Christmas more fun .It ’s the season of christmas office parties and mistletoe balls , when everyone gets hammered and makes out with that one cutie they ’ve been eyeing all year    …      or has a train run on them by six drug dealers on the way home , in my case .   Everyone ’s idea of romance is different !
