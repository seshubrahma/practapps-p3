it really is like to be Muslim at this time .The headlines wo n’t reference them by name their family members provide other humanizing factors .Most wo n’t even have stories written about them at all their family members The only thing that will continue to be covered are the voices and comments made that lead towards this kind of violence existing in the first place .     The disparaging comments that Donald Trump has made over the campaign against minorities of all kinds     Muslims , Latinos , African Americans , women and those with special needs     are but symptoms of a deeper and    bigotry that our nation must confront .
