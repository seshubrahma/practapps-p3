Kompromat is a Russian squishing together of two words : " compromising material , " which Americans refer to as " blackmail ."But kompromat is different in that it is often coupled with what is called " black PR kompromat —   for example , Dorenko showing the video on his popular television show , artfully stringing it out , and Dorenko his viewers over the head with his popular television show like , " Is Dorenko something inherent to prosecutors or is it something unusual ?" Or using Wikileaks and    news sites to pound Hillary Clinton using the hacked contents of the DNC servers or John Podesta ’s emails .
