Sen. Rubio under current law , the U. S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina .The CBO [ Congressional Budget Office ] says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green card holders by another 10 million over 10 years .Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work ?Under current law , the U. S. will issue around 10 million green cards over the course of ten years .
