Today â€™s films , television and music further split us apart under the guise of leading us toward an enlightened civilization , while in fact it is all about an agenda that erases God and Country from our discourse and replaces them with a teardown God and Country the American experience , erases institutions and replaces them with a     God and Country .Take the current rioters : while some are subversive anarchists , bought and paid for by George Soros , there are others who are absolutely sincere in their protest .But some are subversive anarchists sincere souls I believe are protesting because of a failure ,or should I say deliberate attempt , by    educators to not fairly teach but to propagandize and preach to students .
