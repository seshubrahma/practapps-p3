As a reporter for Newsday , I watched the euphoric , rapturous crowds , mostly women and girls who showed up with " To Gerry with Love " signs , even in the campaign â€™s last days , when it was going down to a decisive defeat to President Reagan and George Bush .Some campaign bands could make you wince , playing " Five Foot Two , Eyes of Blue " or " Hello , Dolly !"There were the strange male missteps : the mayor of Los Angeles saying he wanted " a vice president I can hug , " the Mississippi official who called Ms. Ferraro " young lady " and asked whether she could bake a blueberry muffin .
