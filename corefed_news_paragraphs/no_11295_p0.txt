Economic growth :What a great idea !   Now , if only we could get the Democrats to agree that growth is a good idea , and if only we could get the Republicans to be more persuasive in making the case for growth .[ the Democrats do nâ€™t want to talk about the    economy they the Democrats rather talk about " fairness " and " the one percent .
