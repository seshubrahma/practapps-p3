"I think when the U. S. decides to have diplomatic relations with a country , it ’s between the U. S. and that the U. S. alone to the U. S. are going to conduct relations .I view this the U. S. and that country alone an analog to dealing with Taiwan , where the mainland Chinese are constantly trying to tell the United States how to behave , and unfortunately , we respond .We do n’t allow Taiwanese diplomats into the State Department we if you can believe it , because we do n’t want to offend Beijing .
