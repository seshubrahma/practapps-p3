Increasing the economy is monopolized .For example , prices for medical procedures and insurance are much higher in locales where the Affordable Care Act has permitted hospitals and insurance companies to enjoy limited competition .Germans pay about a third less for health care —   and Britain nearly half —   than Americans .   Obamacare did n’t make it cheaper but instead imposes terrible bureaucratic burdens and requires too many young people to purchase coverage with huge deductibles they can not afford .
