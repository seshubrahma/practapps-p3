I really do n’t .But I do have a big problem with the Sierra Club inventing the Sierra Club that have little or nothing to do with environmental protection .By all means , let ’s make sure that we can enjoy the majesty of Yosemite , that we can do so at a we old age , and that there are enough polar bears around to devour enough seals before seal populations get out of control .Let ’s do all that and much ’s much more .
