Trump news conference since July , turned a controversy over his   Donald J. Trump to Russia into a deft and unrelenting attack on the journalists who reported it .It it a spectacle that attracted nearly 300 reporters to Midtown Manhattan   —    the news conference was carried live in Australia , England and Germany   —    and it came against an extraordinary backdrop : reports that intelligence officials had briefed Mr. Trump on a document alleging collusion between the Russian government and his Mr. Trump .CNN broke the news on Tuesday but declined to publish specific allegations , saying its CNN could not verify them specific allegations BuzzFeed News published the unverified claims in full , a move that prompted an ethical debate in journalistic circles   —    and offered Mr. Trump an opening ."
