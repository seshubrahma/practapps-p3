Anyone younger than 35 has never lived in a world where more than one in five jobs were in factories .Some of that is surely because of more open trade with places where wages are lower .But it is also because of remarkable advances in technology that mean a huge , gleaming factory making airplane parts or industrial fasteners might need only a dozen workers to keep it running rather than a hundred .America â€™s economy has kept growing because factory output has risen even as manufacturing employment has fallen .
