" I was saddened to learn this morning that the vandalism of St. David ’s Church in Bean Blossom was committed by the church ’s organist , Nathan Stang St. David’s Church in Bean Blossom admitted to police that he spray painted hateful graffiti on the church last November in the wake of the St. David’s Church in Bean Blossom .This was a hurtful , dishonest , and profoundly misguided action that stands against the values of the people of this diocese and the Episcopal Church , and we will continue to cooperate with the authorities who are pursuing this case .
