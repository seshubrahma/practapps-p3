Still , Trump seats up in 2018 are tilted as heavily toward Republicans as any time in recent memory .The real goal for Democrats should be to minimize their losses in 2018 and Democrats the majority within shouting distance for 2020 when 22 Republicans and just 11 Democrats are up .Schumer knows all of this , of course .Some of what he â€™s doing in that Schumer is cheerleading in hopes that his happy talk helps shake Schumer some major donor money and maybe helps recruit a candidate or two .
