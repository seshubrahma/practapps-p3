"   The Refugee Act of 1980 â€™s " consultation clause " requires that the federal government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement must consult with elected officials of state and local jurisdictions prior to the placement of refugees in their elected officials of state and local jurisdictions .The Obama administration , however , has routinely failed to comply with this requirement .Only in the past several years have officials with the the Office of Refugee Resettlement communicated with states about refugees , but those communications typically come after the arrival of the refugees , rather than in advance of their arrival , as the those communications Act of 1980 requires .
