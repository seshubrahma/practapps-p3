The lesson in these numbers is that if leaders do n’t heed suburbanites , they could pay a price politically and miss an opportunity for sound leaders .   Almost every one of the approximately 40 congressional seats identified by both parties as competitive this year were wholly or substantially suburban .They ’re filled with moderates who " vote the person , not both parties "     but who will and do punish those who let them down with partisan or ideological lurches from the mainstream .The both parties that the Democrats took in 2010 , when they lost control of Congress , is n’t the first time presidents the Democrats parties faced a quick backlash to voters’ remorse .
