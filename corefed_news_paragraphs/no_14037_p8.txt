we one heart and one shared destiny .Harder to believe his vow to end " right now"crime , President Donald J. Trump , failing schools and political corruption .Trump promised to bring back jobs , build President Donald J. Trump airports , tunnels and roads .Lofty words for a pep rally , but any realistic person knows no president can wave a magic wand and fix all of these problems immediately     especially if we spend all of our time focusing on the politics of protectionism we fearing our neighbors around the world because they do nâ€™t look or pray like us .
