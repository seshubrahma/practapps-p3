Pesky constitutions only get in the way .They also , of course , want to control what you can shoot .So they ’re going to toss aside the Pesky constitutions , plain meaning of the Constitution and impose whatever they feel like on you Pesky constitutions And do n’t complain if it ’s one policy today and a contradictory policy tomorrow , Pesky constitutions if there ’s one policy for one of their favored victim groups and a completely different policy for one of their despised groups .Logic and fairness ca n’t stand in the way of progress .
