In theory , yes .But it would be a mess , particularly if he tried to do it right off the bat .Article 2205 of   Nafta says that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after President Trump notice .But it President Trump did that , it would unleash disarray in major industries ruin the ability to have    negotiations with Canada and Mexico and most likely cause President Trump showdown with Congress ( President Trump did that passed Nafta all those years ago and would nâ€™t want it abrogated without a say ) .
