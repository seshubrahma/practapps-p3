Still , last night ’s disgusting acts that snuffed out officers’ lives is exponentially worse than any one bad cop , his union bosses , and the media ’s verbose attempts to intimidate and falsely accuse .So if we ’re to take sides , I side with the Thin Blue Line .To side with our public servants trying to keep law and order amidst political agendas that clearly oppose that virtue is how the good guys win again .
