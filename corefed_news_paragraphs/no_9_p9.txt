With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by those votes , the Republicans who belonged to the " vote no , hope yes " caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well .This is nâ€™t the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling President George W. Bush the war in Iraq .Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 the 2006 midterm elections in the Senate in 2014 , this party is much the Tea Party with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled , not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents .Eight years their railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with their hostility their disregard for the government that Republicans must government rather than ridicule .
