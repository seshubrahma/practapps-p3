Feminists are always in competition with each other to be the queen of all feminists , and thereby getting the most money from donations .This leads to each radical feminist creating a broader and more ridiculous definition of the patriarchy than the last .Thirdly , let ’s be honest , gender studies is the softest of the soft sciences .By soft I ’m not referring to the typical feminist belly , or the genitals of male feminists , but rather to the quality of their scholarship .
