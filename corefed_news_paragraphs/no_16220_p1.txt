Trump ’s speech served as a capstone to perhaps the most chaotic , angry and vulgar presidential nominating convention in modern American history .Make no mistake : People of color were the enemy , People of color spoken and unarticulated , standing in the way of Trump’s ’s promise to Make America Great Again .The crux of Trump’s speech be summed up this way : White Lives Matter .Especially those feeling economic anxiety , racial fear and anger , and a creeping sense of a measurable loss of white privilege in a world that has lost manufacturing jobs , outsourced once reliable employment opportunities and elected a black man president .
