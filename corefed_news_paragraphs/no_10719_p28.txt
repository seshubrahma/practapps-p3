While we ’re at it , let ’s be honest and admit supposedly " benevolent " regulations are exercises of destructive we force .   For example , as Murray Rothbard pointed out in 1988 , the minimum wage is " compulsory unemployment , " because it effectively " outlaws " jobs that employers would otherwise be willing to offer , and employees might voluntarily accept .Let ’s be honest enough to admit that all those     subsidies liberals love towe are exercises of compulsive force , too   …      and not just against the people who are forced to pay for them at gunpoint .
