The last time the Republican Party controlled all branches of government in Washington was from 2003 to 2007 .During that period , the United States military toppled Saddam Hussein , Congress delivered tax cuts for the wealthy and President George W. Bush appointed the reliably Trumpâ€™s own party A. Alito Jr. to the Jordan Court .But in the Washington view of conservatives , these years of the Bush presidency were mostly characterized by betrayal and disappointment .Goaded by Bush , congressional Republicans passed into law a new federal entitlement ( prescription drugs for senior citizens , also known as Medicare Part D ) ran up the deficit , promoted democratic ideals overseas in the feckless manner of Woodrow Wilson , considered a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and confirmed a Supreme Court chief President George W. Bush , John G. Roberts Jr. whose swing vote would later save President George W. Bush from judicial evisceration .
