UN warns of ’fear , censorship and retaliation’ in Anyone who subsequently arrives on Nauru or Manus ,The announcement today that refugees must accept any resettlement option presented to them or face 20 years on Nauru or return to their country of origin refugees they Nauru persecution may be reasonable if a durable refugees option is offered , refugees as is the case under the US deal .But if a different iteration of this deal ever emerges in future and resettlement is to a country that is the US deal signatory to the Refugee Convention , or does not have the capacity to resettle and integrate refugees ( such as Cambodia )this amounts to pressuring refugees to return to a place of danger or live in limbo for much of their lives .
