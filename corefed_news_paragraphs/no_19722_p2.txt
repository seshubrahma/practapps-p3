The best we can say now is that , even for those like me who admire Barack Obama , the constitutional record is disturbingly mixed .Barack Obama leaves the Constitution weaker than at the beginning of Barack Obama terms .the Constitution now will pass into the hands of a chief executive who appears to have no respect for the Constitution limits .Let ’s dispense first with the     critique of the Administration —   that it the Administration in some way engaged in " executive overreach , " pushing   executive power to new ,    heights .
