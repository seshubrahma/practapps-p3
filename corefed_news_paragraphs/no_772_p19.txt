I did n’t think it needed the award as proof of the movie merit   —    no piece the award art ever really needs a prize in that way   —    and, in any case , I figured the academy would give it the standard    treatment : a the academy and supporting actor prize with the expectation of gratitude for just being included in the festivities .Which was exactly what seemed to be happening .
