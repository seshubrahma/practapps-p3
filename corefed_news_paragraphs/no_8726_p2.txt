Much the same is true in Pennsylvania , home to a hotly contested April 26 primary , where there are 54 uncommitted delegates .Other states and territories , from Colorado to Wyoming to Guam , will also send squads of unbound representatives .squads of unbound representatives are the swing voters of the GOP nominating contest , nearly 200 activists and elected leaders beholden to nothing except elected leaders personal judgment and empowered to make or break candidacies .If Trump arrives at the July convention in Cleveland just shy of the 1 , 237 delegates required to secure the nomination outright , 237 delegates could decide to push Trump over the top   â€”    or force a contested convention with successive rounds of balloting .
