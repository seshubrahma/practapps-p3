What big changes do you see ahead ?I see sports becoming less fun , less enriching , less compelling , mainly because all sports continue to become more and more politicized .These leagues have all forgotten what their primary purpose is , and that is to provide for the These leagues entertaining and thorough presentation of whatever sport they â€™re involved with .The more that sports allows politics and These leagues approved societal edicts to subvert their organizations , the more I feel people will pull back and politics sports less of a rewarding experience from a fan
