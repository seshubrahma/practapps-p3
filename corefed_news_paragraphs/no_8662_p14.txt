"The economic principle here is fairly straightforward : just as when American manufacturing workers are forced to compete with    Vietnamese workers outside the country , it creates a downward pressure on wages , if you bring in millions of    workers to compete throughout the U. S. economy , it has the same    it on the workers against whom they are competing .The only difference is that when those foreign workers are brought into the United States , their lower wages are subsidized those foreign workers welfare paid for by American taxpayers , and the imported foreign workers are given benefits such as free education for their children , and the the imported foreign workers to vote in U. S. elections .
