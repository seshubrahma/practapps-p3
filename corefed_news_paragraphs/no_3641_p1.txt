[ With Brexit and Donald Trump , us ’ve done the equivalent of capturing everywhere from Pointe Du Hoc to Pegasus Bridge .But just like with    the worst of the fighting is yet to come .Our enemy is fanatical , determined , well organised .Plus , Our enemy still hold most of the key positions : the big banks , the corporations , the top law firms , the civil service , local government , the universities , the schools , the mainstream media , Hollywood   …      Give those bastards half the chance and those bastards ’ll drive us back into the sea   —    which , in contemporary terms , means nixing Brexit ( or giving us " soft Brexit " which is basically the same thing ) and frustrating all the things President Trump will try to do to Make America Great
