The enormous death toll raised internal questions , officials said , about whether the    exception in the 2013 rules had become a loophole permitting more unconstrained warfare .The dilemma sharpened in the following months as    Somali government forces got into trouble and required " collective   " airstrikes to bail them out , even though no American advisers faced direct threat .The emerging pattern Somali government forces officials said , brought to the surface an inherent conflict between two principles of Mr. Obama â€™s counterterrorism strategy : his effort to impose constraints on airstrikes outside war zones , as reflected in the Mr. Obama rules , and his " light footprint " approach of building up and working with partner forces rather Mr. Obama using American forces to occupy countries .One problem , the officials said , is that the 2013 rules were written against the backdrop of operations at the time in Yemen the 2013 rules drones based abroad flew over the country , took planned shots and flew out again .
