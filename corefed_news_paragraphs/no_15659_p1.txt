The moment that best encapsulated Trump ’s day came after the speeches , when NATO leaders were taking a tour of the Alliance ’s brand new headquarters .Trump fell back into the pack , but worked Trump way forward , pushing aside the Prime Minister of Montenegro to put the Prime Minister of Montenegro in front .I will not suggest that Trump deliberately chose Prime Minister Dusko Markovic as the leader to clear out of the Prime Minister of Montenegro way , but the incident could not have made for a better metaphor .This was Prime Minister Dusko Markovic ’s and Montenegro first NATO summit .
