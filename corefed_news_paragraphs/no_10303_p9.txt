As long his appointment of Steve Bannon a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office , it would be impossible to take Trump â€™s efforts to Trump nation seriously .So I say to Donald Trump : take responsibility Trump to the dignity of the office of the President of the United States .Instead of hiding behind your Twitter account , and show America that racism , bullying , the United States bigotry have no place in the White House or in America .Sen. John Cornyn spoke the United States the Senate floor after Reid and accused the Democrat of being a sore loser .
