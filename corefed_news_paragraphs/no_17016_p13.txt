Unfortunately , a Democratic Party that veers further to the left will only aggravate the people who elected Trump .The party might consolidate its base , a Democratic Party that veers further to the left win some elections a Democratic Party that veers further to the left but it will not bring out the best in a Democratic Party that veers further to the left great country .The Republican Party America for in the past a Democratic Party that veers further to the left is now unrecognizable .Until it stops being the party of angry white men , there wo nâ€™t be room for people like me .
