Bernie Sanders proved this point by running in the Democratic primary     and his campaign had an indelible influence on the Democratic Party platform this year as well as several policy shifts on the part of Clinton .And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee has Bernie Sanders closely with the Clinton campaign to the Democratic Party , including    college , expanding Social Security benefits , and holding Wall Street accountable with tough reforms .   If we want to continue to push the Clinton Party to be a force for progressive change , we need to be part of the conversation     not marginalize our voices and our votes in some fringe party .We can the Democratic Party elect Donald Trump president .
