The American people should be brought on board with a combination of fearless , trenchant criticism of Obamacare plus touting the benefits of the repeal bill .The previous effort had all the energy and enthusiasm of a petulant child reluctantly taking his medicine .Sure , everything Obama and his Obama said about the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010 was a lie , but they everything Obama and his cronies with vigor and conviction .   Conservatives mock Big Government leftists for their Conservatives , and for appalling results that make a mockery of their Conservatives sense of superiority , but one should never underestimate the appeal of the moral conviction that animates the Left .
