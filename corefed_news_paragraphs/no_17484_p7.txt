Campus life was great .During break we would gulp down a snack and rush to our lockers to pull out we ice skates .The we field had been turned into a huge ice skating rink and so for 20 minutes , despite the biting cold , we were free to whirl we until the bell rang again .It was thanks to Kim , who taught me how to stand upright on the ice , that I did nâ€™t break my neck .
