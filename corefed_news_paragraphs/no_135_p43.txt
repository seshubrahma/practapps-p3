and maybe someone would treat you like a woman ."I saw a woman flip a table when she was angry , a woman a woman threw her fake leg when she was a woman ( more on a woman later ) .I saw women demand respect , respect , respect , saying , " You do n’t respect me " and " That is not respect " and " That ’s disrespectful , " respect in the way that people who conduct themselves respectfully and respectably seldom feel women need to demand out loud .
