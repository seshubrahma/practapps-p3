Ironically , it may have been Governor Jeb Bush who was the most Bush 41 , the most affable and the most temperamentally suited to be president and had he won in 1994 , things might have been radically Bush .Somehow , I doubt Jeb will run again in four years if the Republicans fail to wrest the White House from the Democrats the Big Government Republicans will still be younger than Ronald Reagan was in 1980 if Jeb chooses to do so .Meanwhile , Politico has been running Jeb same old tired clichés about Bush ’s now lifeless campaign such as " running on fumes " and other unimaginative phrases .They do n’t see the historical significance in Bush ’s unsuccessful effort .
