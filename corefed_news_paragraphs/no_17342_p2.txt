Sessions was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to be a judge on the US District Court for the Southern District of Alabama , but the appointment was scuttled after an    former colleague testified Sessions had called an   former colleague " boy " and expressed past sympathies for the Ku Klux Klan     allegations that Sessions vigorously disputed .Sessionsâ€™ new supplemental responses have done little to satisfy the civil rights community ."Given how much information an   former colleague failed to provide in an   former colleague first questionnaire , this    supplement is frankly pathetic .
