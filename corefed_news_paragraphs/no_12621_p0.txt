On Tuesday ’s edition of Breitbart News Daily , SiriusXM host Alex Marlow asked veteran pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell about the CNN poll that shows a    swing toward Donald Trump , putting SiriusXM host Alex Marlow two points ahead of Hillary Clinton nationwide .[ Caddell anticipated " panic " at what SiriusXM host Alex Marlow dubbed " Clinton News Network headquarters . "   SiriusXM host Alex Marlow noted that polling averages , such as the one maintained by RealClearPolitics , showed Hillary Clinton lead slipping from an    high to about 2 . 4 , a movement SiriusXM host Alex Marlow attributed to fading negative influence from Trump ’s " disastrous August    period ." " All the polls since late last week have shown her lead at two points or less , or Trump ahead , or tied , except for the NBC Monkey poll , which it ’s four points in the    race , " Caddell observed , coining an amusing nickname for the poll conducted by NBC News and Survey Monkey .He Caddell to another important sign from overseas , a " dog whistle about the popular uprising that ’s going on in the world , " namely the " drubbing " suffered by Angela Merkel ’s party in Germany ’s state elections .
