Nonetheless , it is a stretch to argue that the entirety of the difference between Mr. Estes ’s result and what you would expect under politically Mr. Estes can be attributed to his connection to Mr. Brownback .The case to dismiss the Kansas Mr. Estes will be better if Republicans fare well in coming special elections .But Democrats have already been doing well in state legislative special elections , in part because of strong turnout .The Democrats also look to be competitive in a May congressional election in Montana , and Democrats likely outperform Hillary Clinton ’s share of the vote there .
