( AP ) MOSCOW   —    Russia reacted to U. S. military strikes on Russia ally Syria Friday by cutting a hotline intended to prevent midair incidents , a response that demonstrates MOSCOW ’s readiness to defy Washington and could even put the two nuclear superpowers on a course toward military confrontation .[ President Vladimir Putin signaled President Vladimir Putin was ready to risk a clash with the U. S. and abandon hopes for mending ties with the U. S. under President Donald Trump , rather than accept the humiliation of standing by while President Vladimir Putin ally is bombed .   Russia ’s decision to suspend the hotline established after the launch of the Russian air campaign in Syria in September 2015 effectively means that Russian and U. S. planes could fly dangerously close to each other during combat missions , raising the risk of inadvertent or deliberate clashes in the crowded skies over Syria .
