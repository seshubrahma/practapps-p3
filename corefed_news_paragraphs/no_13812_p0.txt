Washington ( CNN )Donald Trump is poised to cement the conservative majority on the Supreme Court , but Donald Trump will also play a critical role in reshaping the look of the lower courts as Donald Trump moves to fill over 100 vacancies in the federal judiciary .   Experts say that the unusually high number of vacancies     due in part to judicial warfare between the Obama administration and the    Senate     could change the face of the courts .   " If    Trump can put a different face on the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals   Trump could substantially change the course of federal jurisprudence , " said Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution .
