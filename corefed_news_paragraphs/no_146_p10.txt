Mr. Friend ’s performance of    addiction may not convince every viewer , but it is , counterintuitively , fun to watch   —    he brings Mr. Friend same edge of sardonic humor to Quinn the junkie that he brought Mr. Friend Quinn the Quinn machine in past seasons .And Ms. Danes continues to deliver an interesting and sympathetic portrayal of a character whose trademark is her lack Ms. Danes humor .
