Just do n’t confuse " master " with " Old Master , " which is a " distinguished European artist from about 1500 to the early 1700s ." Think Michelangelo .At a gallery , you might enter a room with related sculptures .This is n’t an installation unless it encourages " active engagement " by the spectator .
