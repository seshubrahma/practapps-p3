Six years after a Supreme Court decision opened vast new channels for money to flow into national elections , Democrats have built the largest and    apparatus of outside groups operating in the 2016 presidential campaign , defying expectations that conservative and corporate wealth would dominate the race .A dozen different organizations raised over $ 200 million through the beginning of October and since May have spent more than $ 110 million on television , digital , and radio ads in support of Hillary Clinton , according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission through Thursday .The handful of organizations backing Donald J. Trump have raised less than half that amount , a steep dive from four years ago , when wealthy Republicans poured hundreds of millions of dollars into groups backing the Republican nominee Mitt Romney .The Democrats’ success this year reflects , in part , Mrs. Clinton ’s close personal ties to Mrs. Clinton party ’s elite donors and Mrs. Clinton allies’ willingness to exploit the 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case far more aggressively than President Obama did .
