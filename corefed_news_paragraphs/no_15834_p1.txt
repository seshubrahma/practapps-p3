For a President who seeks extensive counsel from outside the White House     in calls to old friends , business executives , and even despotic foreign leaders     President Donald Trump has largely forgone advice or guidance from any of the men who have held President Donald Trump job previously .   In the months after President Donald Trump and Obama carried out a peaceful hand off of power , the two have failed to develop any sort of working relationship , according to White House advisers and former administration officials .White House advisers and former administration officials have not spoken over the phone , at least to the knowledge of White House advisers and former administration officials aides .Neither has made any real attempt to reconcile after President Donald Trump accused Obama of ordering wiretaps at his skyscraper in New York .
