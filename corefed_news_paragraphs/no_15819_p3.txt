Maybe you have siblings and maybe you have saplings ( or grand saplings ) but at this moment you are perched on the highest branches of a bloodline Redwood .A lineage that somehow survived storms and disease , war and pestilence , love and hate , generation after generation .You are proud of your tree .You would fight for your tree .
