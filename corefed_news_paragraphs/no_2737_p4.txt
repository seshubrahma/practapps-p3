An improved " Better Call Saul " barely missed the cut , as did the best season of " Girls " since its first .There are series I could n’t quite justify putting on my list but were crazy entertaining , like " Stranger Things ."What remains is a sampler of TV as dizzying and agitated as the year we ’ve just lived through .
