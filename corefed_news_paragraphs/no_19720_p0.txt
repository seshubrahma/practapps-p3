I have rarely been more angry or dismayed at the conduct of Congress than I was Monday night with the unconscionable , deplorable , underhanded move by Representative Bob Goodlatte to eviscerate and undermine the Office of Congressional Ethics .When House Speaker Paul Ryan and Paul Ryan counterpart Nancy Pelosi indicated weeks ago that House Speaker Paul Ryan and his counterpart Nancy Pelosi would continue OCE , the reform community —   left and right —   breathed a sigh of relief .Paul Ryan , like Paul Ryan predecessor John Boehner , had seen the value to the integrity of the House of the office , which has been a stalwart of bipartisan and nonpartisan comity and independence .That makes this     action even more outrageous .
