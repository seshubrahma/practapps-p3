The immigration makeup the United States —   which the Washington Post posits is the reason the U. S. could perhaps be incapable of voting in The Washington Post its national sovereignty —   is the result of a Ted    1965 immigration rewrite , which opened up America ’s borders to the world .Kennedy ’s immigration law lifted the immigration caps that had been place and opened up U. S. visas to migrants all across the globe .While about nine in ten of the immigrants who came to the United States during the 19th and 20th century hailed from Europe , the 1965 law inverted that figure .Today about nine out of every ten new immigrants brought into the country on Kennedy’s immigration law from    countries in Latin America , Africa , Asia or the Middle East .
