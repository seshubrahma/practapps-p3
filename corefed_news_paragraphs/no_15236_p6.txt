Ties became part of the presidential uniform beginning in the late 1800s     Benjamin Harrison , the 23rd president , wore a long ,    tie for    official portrait rather than the black bowtie many of    immediate predecessors wore     and the look of the 20th century presidency is one largely decorated by neckties .The exception has been campaigns , where candidates from Obama and Mitt Romney , to George W. Bush and Al Gore have gone tieless , often with sleeves rolled up , to show a more casual , but still presidential look .The 2016 campaign featured a different style , with a man whose name was once used to sell a line of ties running against the    female nominee of a major party , The 2016 campaign choice of casual dress often was defined by a " Make America GreatAgain " hat or a colorful pantsuit .
