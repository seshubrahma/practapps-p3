European energy developers like Statoil and Dong Energy are making big investments to bring projects to American waters .Last year in Massachusetts , Gov. Charlie Baker , a Republican , signed into law a mandate that is pushing development forward .And in New York , after years of stymied progress , the Long Island Power Authority has reached an agreement with Deepwater Wind , which built the Rhode Island turbine array , to drop a much larger farm   —    15 turbines capable of running 50 , 000 average homes   —    into the ocean about 35 miles from Montauk .If approved by the utility board on Wednesday , the $ 1 billion installation could become the first of several in a     parcel , with room for as many as 200 turbines , that Deepwater is leasing from the federal government .
