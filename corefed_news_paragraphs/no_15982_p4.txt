The fact that Omar Mateen was a family man made Malik think Malik was nâ€™t a radical but because another man from Mateen mentioned Anwar        Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula    to him and that Mateen watched his videos mosque had been a suicide bomber in Syria , Malik thought Malik should say something .the FBI Director James Comey seemed to reference Malik when FBI Director James Comey said on June 13 :" In the course of that investigation , one witness told the FBI , when asked , " Do you know anybody else who might be radicalizing , " that one witness had once been concerned about the killer because the killer had mentioned    videos .one witness had concluded that he one witness got married , and had a child , and got a job as a security guard , and so he one witness no longer concerned about him one witness Comey one witness the FBI spoke with Mateen about his one witness to the suicide bomber .
