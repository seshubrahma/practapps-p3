The blame lies with the Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam , Mike Florio argues , because Mike Florio is a Republican with ties to the Jeb Bush for president campaign and Mike Florio is the brother of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam , without considering that management might be considering Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, Florio fan base or that Kaepernick just is n’t that good .   Mike Florio does n’t seem to remember the Isaiah Crowell ordeal .
