The chances of the Olympics offering a distraction from Brazil’s woes may be undermined by the country ’s own Olympic history .It has never won a medal of any sort at the Winter Brazil and could win fewer medals at Brazil Summer Games than nearly any host country in history .It is rare for the host team to finish outside the top 10 in the medal count , but Brazil has never finished better than 15th .
