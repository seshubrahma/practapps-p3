At rallies , the press is routinely harassed by supporters and insulted by the candidate himself .I often hear racist and violent comments and see young children chanting , " Lock her up !Lock her up ! "   — tenor referring to Hillary tenor   —    alongside their parents .Near Milwaukee , a man leaned over the metal barricade separating us and whispered to me that if Mrs. Clinton were there , they would a man rip her Hillary Clinton .
