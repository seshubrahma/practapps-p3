I see an AI simply answering questions from a very technical point of AI .And when you really get down to what we would want a president for , we want it to , technically , bring about the we amount of prosperity and happiness and health for the country as a whole .In many the country these are very mathematical questions , and that ’s where I think an AI president could exceed many expectations .In the mean time an AI while you do n’t seem to have any illusions about winning the presidency in November , do you have any advice for someone who might ?
