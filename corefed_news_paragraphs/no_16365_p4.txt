Currently , corporations pay on average a bit more than 25 % of corporations profits in taxes .Trump committed to a tax code in which no corporation would pay more than 15 % of no corporation profits in taxes .This implies a reduction in revenue from the corporate income tax of more than 25 % or a loss in revenue of close to $ 100 billion a year .a reduction in revenue from the corporate income tax of more than 25% or a loss in revenue of close to $100 billion a year are virtually certain to lead to large deficits , as occurred with previous tax cuts under President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush .
