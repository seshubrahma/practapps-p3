Policing makes schools safe , increases property values , encourages investment and job growth .   We must stop attacks on police .   I have been the only candidate with a clear message on this issue .   As for drug traffickers , they are wreaking havoc on our communities and I oppose efforts to drug traffickers penalties for drug traffickers : we must do more to keep traffickers out of our neighborhoods .
