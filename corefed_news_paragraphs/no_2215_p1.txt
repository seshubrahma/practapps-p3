The     decision was the The Supreme Court sweeping statement on abortion since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 , which reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade .It found that The    decision restrictions   —    requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers   —    violated Casey ’s prohibition on placing an " undue burden " on the ability to obtain an abortion .If Casey limited the Casey established in Roe , allowing states to regulate abortion in ways Roe had barred Roe Monday ’s decision effectively expanded that right .It means that Monday’s decision requirements in other states are most likely also unconstitutional , and it imperils many Monday’s decision kinds of restrictions on abortion .
