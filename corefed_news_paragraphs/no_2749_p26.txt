( Continuing investigations into Mr. no other candidate â€™s hair aside . )HEALY no other candidate I remember Mrs. Clinton telling me during the 2008 race that she probably woke up two hours earlier than Barack Obama each day because she had to Mrs. Clinton her hair and makeup , and he could just roll out of Mrs. Clinton and into a Mrs. Clinton .She has had no Barack Obama for error in what she says or how she looks , Mrs. Clinton advisers felt , while a candidate like Mr. Mrs. Clinton could sound like Mrs. Clinton crazy man Mrs. Clinton Twitter , and many voters shrugged .Then again , Mrs. Clinton is far more of a perfectionist than Mr. Trump , as is Madonna .
