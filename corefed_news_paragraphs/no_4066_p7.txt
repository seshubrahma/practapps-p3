The problem with this bill is that because it tweaks this bill and creates a new massive entitlement system through the budget reconciliation process , it can this bill have the statutory effect of mandating HHS and IRS work with Citizenship and Immigration Services to use the SAVE database because that issue is outside the jurisdiction of the reporting committees .And no subject matter from other committees can be included in reconciliation .Thus , to pass Obamacare 2 . 0 instead of plain repeal via budget reconciliation , Republicans must use weaker verification language .Allowing illegals access to health care through fraud is a disastrous move , Horowitz shows .
