For Public School , the designers    Chow and Maxwell Osborne took street motifs often associated with men   —    parkas , puffers , hoodies , anoraks   —    and toyed with how to dress women in them .The     women for women were a surprisingly sensual look for a normally unisex coat the men in the show wore the puffers short , The    puffers for women or baggy .As with the other runway shows , combining men and women allowed the designers to present one aesthetic and show how it applied to each gender .
