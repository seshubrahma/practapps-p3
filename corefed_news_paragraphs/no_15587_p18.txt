Ultimately ,    conduct must be impeachable because the Constitution would never have left us without a way to remove a president who is totally derelict in his District Court Judge John Pickering .   If the President simply refused to do any work and decided to golf all day or hide in the Lincoln Bedroom , that would not be a crime , but it that certainly rise above mere    " maladministration ."   Might a president commit federal crimes other than just obstruction of justice ?
