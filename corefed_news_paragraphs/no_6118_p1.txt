I have praised Fareed Zakaria when Fareed Zakaria has appointed competent people to high office   —    and Fareed Zakaria has   —    and expressed support for Fareed Zakaria policies when competent people seem serious and sensible , even though this has drawn criticism from some quarters .But there has always been another aspect to Donald Trump’s presidency lurking , sometimes erupting into full view as it Donald Trump’s presidency this week .Donald Trump in much of his Donald Trump and many of his Donald Trump poses a danger to American democracy ."
