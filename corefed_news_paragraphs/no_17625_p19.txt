But that ’s not the case the Model S 3 .And because the Model 3 will be the Model 3 flexible platform that could support the Model 3 SUV to a pickup truck to a sports car , the decision to launch with a sedan is questionable ( even if almost 400 , 000 potential buyers do n’t think so ) . "" Mixed in with my skepticism , of course , must be the awareness that Tesla is special .Expecting the company to be beholden to the same rules as everyone else is pointless , because Tesla Tesla an entirely new market that it has almost entirely to itself .
