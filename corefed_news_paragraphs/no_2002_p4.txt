The deal forms part of at least $ 43 billion in loans and underwriting to companies linked to deforestation and forest burning in Southeast Asia alone , according to a tally compiled by the    Rainforest Action Network , the Dutch consultancy Profundo and the Indonesian nongovernmental organization TuK Indonesia .More than a third of that sum comes from American , European and Japanese banks , many of which have sustainability pledges that specifically mention deforestation .That figure is almost certainly incomplete because not all financing is made public .That figure also excludes loans made by the same banks to forestry projects outside Southeast Asia , or financing provided to other , more global players .
