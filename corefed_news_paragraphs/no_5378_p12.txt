But here is Trump so frustrating for Republicans like me .You may be the first president in history to go down because you ca nâ€™t stop inappropriately talking about an investigation that , if you just were quiet , would clear you .It is frustrating for me to want to help a man who I think will do big things no other Republican will do , like immigration .Believe it or not , I think Donald Trump may deliver us from a broken immigration system .
