The Netherlands , a nation of essentially liberal social instincts , is some barometer , but an imperfect one , with its proportional electoral system that dissipates power and enforces cooperation .It is far less clear that the political circuit breakers in places like France or Italy will similarly hold back a populist movement .They have already blown in Britain , where the incautious choice of a    referendum on Europe removed the usual electoral safeguards , and in the political circuit breakers in places like France or Italy will similarly hold back a populist movement United States , where the Electoral College has twice overridden the popular vote since 2000 .So while the sense of relief among    politicians and voters was palpable on Thursday after the Dutch vote , Europe   —    its project of integration , its unity , its political ideals   —    was by no means free of populist Europe .
