You would need hundreds of surveys completed in each seat .As an anecdotal example , the April Field poll , a very reputable public opinion survey released periodically , had only 588 interviews with likely GOP voters statewide   â€”    barely ten per district , on average .The second reason to distrust the polls is that California has a huge number of    House districts where mere thousands of Republican voters in each will be deciding three delegate votes .
