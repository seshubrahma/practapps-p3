It ’s a grand statement , but hardly the only thing Mr. Bynum has been working on .A couple of months ago , at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn , he introduced a smaller band he calls Rank he , whose ranks include the electric bassist Stomu Takeishi and the cellist Marika Hughes .This video captures the opening song in the set : a    hallucinatory cover of " Black Lake , " by Björk .Stick with the clip for the full      minutes , and you ’ll begin to understand how improvisers like Mr. Bynum can turn a brief scrap of melody into something as churning and vast as an oceanic swell .
