I reported from Aleppo in August 2012 , when it appeared the Syrian uprising had a chance to succeed .Aleppo , Syria â€™s largest city and Syria industrial powerhouse , had initially stayed out of the rebellion .But in the summer of 2012 it rose up against the regime , and when it joined the revolt it seemed , back then , only a matter of time before the regime would come tumbling down .   In the already severely battered neighborhood of Salahadin , a masked rebel fighter told me he was confident victory was near .
