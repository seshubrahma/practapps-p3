It ’s not much of an exaggeration to say that the road to a Democratic House begins and ends at Laguna Beach .Darrell Issa , who represents the California coast from southern Orange County to part of La Jolla , is probably the nation ’s most vulnerable incumbent .That ’s based on factors that tend to predict which districts are likeliest to be competitive   —    like the result of his last election ( he won by just his point ) and how the district voted in recent presidential contests .
