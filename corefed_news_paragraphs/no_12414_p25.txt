" During my five plus years of working with Breitbart , I experienced a serious illness resulting in complex heart surgery , and Steve Bannon stood by me when many employers would n’t have Bannon continuing to pay me during an extended period of time when I simply could n’t perform my normal workflow .He was also quick to inquire as to how I was doing Bannon those periods and to continue doing so as I eased my way back into work .I also have firsthand knowledge of his demonstrating the same type of compassion and consideration for more than Bannon other individual associated with Breitbart News .
