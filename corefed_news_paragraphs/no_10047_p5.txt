The Obama Administration ’s hostility to coal also extends to the recent moratorium on federal coal leases .Under the guise of seeking a more equitable leasing program , the administration launched a review of the federal coal program that generated revenues of $ 1 billion for The Obama Administration in 2014 while also producing 40 percent of the total    electricity in the United States .Overall , this trifecta of regulations has grievously burdened the nation ’s coal producers while also driving up the cost of power generation in at least 13 states that rely principally on    power .At the same time , the president has happily subsidized measures to ramp up wind and solar power .
