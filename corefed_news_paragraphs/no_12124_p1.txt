That dates back to the beginning of America .What I ’m always reminding people is that although you ’ll see bumps , whether it ’s the    or , you know , other    sentiment directed at the Irish or Southern Europeans as opposed to Northern Europeans or the Chinese , or today Latinos or Muslims , the    trend is people get absorbed , people get assimilated .We benefit from this incredible country in which the measure of your patriotism and how American you are is not the color of your skin , your last name , your faith , but rather your adherence to a creed , your belief in certain principles and values .
