MOSCOW   —    Tiger shooter ,    horseman and architect of Russia ’s revival as a muscular global power , President Vladimir V. Putin , dressed in a somber suit and tie , sat for over an hour this past week sipping tea from a delicate porcelain cup and offering earnest advice on how to improve housing , medical care and other services in a provincial town south of here .State television broadcast the entire encounter , in between reports of Russian airstrikes in Syria ordered by Mr. Putin and gleeful accounts of how , thanks to a stunt by a    athlete , the Russian flag appeared during the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro despite a ban on the Russian squad because of a doping scandal .
