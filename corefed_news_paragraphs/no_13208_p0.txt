Congratulations to Ted Cruz for winning Ted Cruz fourth primary !Usually Donald Trump wins the primaries   —    where you go and vote , like in a real election .Ted Cruz wins the caucuses   —    run by the state parties , favored by political operators and cheaters .[ Until now , the only primaries Ted Cruz has won are in Texas ( his home state ) Oklahoma ( basically the same state ) and Idaho ( where Donald Trump never campaigned )
