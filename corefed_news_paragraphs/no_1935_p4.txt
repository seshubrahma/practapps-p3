the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they all thought I wanted to see .That meant I didn’t realize that most of my family members , who live in rural Virginia , were voicing my family members, who live in rural Virginia support for Trump online , and I did n’t see any of the    memes that were in heavy circulation before the election .I never saw a Trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds , and the only Election Day selfies I saw were of people declaring their support for Hillary Clinton .
