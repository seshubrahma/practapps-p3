The South African edition of left wing media site The Huffington Post has published an opinion piece accusing white men of being a retrograde force in politics and calling for the vote to be withdrawn from the racial gender group as a means to advance the " progressive cause " .[ Writing on the potential to run down the political and social influence of " toxic white males " by withdrawing their right to the ballot , The Huffington Post contributor Shelley Garland   —    who describes herself as an " activist and a feminist " student who is " working on ways to smash the patriarchy "   —   says the change only need be enacted for 20 to 30 years or so .This period would " go some way to seeing a decline in the influence of reactionary and    ideology in the world " .   Blaming white males for " Some of the biggest blows to the progressive cause in the past year " including Brexit and the election of President Donald Trump , Garland ’s apparently serious piece claimed just a couple of decades of white men being excluded from elections could see such progressive leaps forward as the collapse of Western law and capitalism , and a massive redistribution of wealth from " toxic white masculinity " through " expropriation of these various assets " .
