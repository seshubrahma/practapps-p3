Colorado ’s brief to the Supreme Court is so truculent , so full of Margaret    faux outrage Colorado that the state supreme court suspect the state has no case .In their first argument , the state ’s lawyers rewrite the petitioners’ claim , suggesting they are grifters trying to create out of thin air a    right to an " automatic money judgment " the state’s lawyers convictions are set aside .This is too clever by half .
