I did n’t go to business school , and for the longest time I could n’t really figure out accounting   —    until I finally had to figure out accounting , so I could figure out how much money I was losing .I grew to really love the elegance of accounting , but I still don’t think business is about making money .I think it ’s about moving civilization along , in all the things that you do with business products and services .
