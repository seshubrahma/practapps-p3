Not with guns and fists but with protests , with our thoughtful words and We arguments , with factchecking and canvassing for midterm candidates and our votes for the same , for defending and supporting those targeted by our president elect .We need to support the ACLU , we need to run We office , we need to oppose We that seeks to hurt and further marginalize , we need to join We groups , we need to not be silent .There are a lot of us—   roughly more than half the country to be exact —   who said Trump ’s vision of the future is not what we want our country us be .
