Mike Pence was tea party from the very beginning , a    congressman with close ties to big money libertarians like the Koch brothers .As governor of Indiana he governor of Indiana taxes    has done his governor of Indiana to restrict abortion access and took a stance on gay rights that makes the Pope look libertine .This is a man who is not only opposed to    marriage but also gay civil partnerships , and who backed a law that would ’ve permitted citizens to deny services to gay people on religious grounds .There ’s being a traditionalist , say his governor of Indiana , and then there ’s being spiteful .
