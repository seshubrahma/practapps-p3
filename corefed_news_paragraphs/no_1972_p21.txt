When Trump and Farage stood on that stage together in Mississippi , they spoke Trump and Farage though they were Trump and Farage reclaiming their great Trump and Farage from foreign interests .No doubt they regard Trump and Farage and the United States as exceptional nations .But their success Trump and Farage dismaying precisely because it goes against a particular idea of    exceptionalism .Not the traditional    of certain American and British jingoists who like to think of the United the United States City on the Hill or Britain as the sceptered isle splendidly aloof from the wicked Continent , but another kind of    exception : the one shaped by World War II .
