Whatever you think of Trump Trump ’s positions , including their various incarnations over the course of the Trump has taken perhaps the strongest Donald Trump’s positions in the originally    GOP field on immigration .Trump includes standing up against both illegal aliens pouring across the border as well as what sometimes appears to be Obama ’s    attempt to import Jihadis .If he decides to totally abandon those positions , he could n’t possibly be worse than Hillary Trump on border security .But if he Trump serious about anything , he appears to be most serious about this .
