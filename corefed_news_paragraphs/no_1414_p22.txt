Null infinity is where light rays go if they are not trapped in a black hole , " Dr. Strominger tried to explain over coffee in Harvard Square recently .From this point of view , you can think of light rays on the surface of a black hole as a bundle of straws all pointing outward , trying to fly away at the speed of , of course , light .Because of the black hole â€™s immense gravity , they are stuck .But the individual straws can slide inward or outward along their futile tracks , slightly advancing or falling back , under the influence of incoming material .
