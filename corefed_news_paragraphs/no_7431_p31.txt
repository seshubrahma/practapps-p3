The effort to make voting so easy , and insecure , that even people who do n’t give a damn   —    or should n’t be legally able to vote   —    can participate will take us nowhere good .But in a binary political system , there is a tough choice to be made .Sadly , voting for principled ,    third parties tends to empower the corrupt incumbents , because it bleeds away opposition they might otherwise have to worry the corrupt incumbents .
