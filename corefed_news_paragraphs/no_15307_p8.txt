Not exactly friendly territory .The history of midterm elections in a president â€™s first term is the lone bright spot for Democrats .Barack Obama watched as his party Barack Obama six Senate seats in the 2010 midterms .George W. Bush bucked the midterm trend due in large part to the cataclysm of Sept. 11 , 2001 , which rallied the country behind him and George W. Bush Republicans actually gain two seats in 2002 .
