The reason I got so interested in the first place was just that spending time with Danny Kahneman was so interesting .I wanted to go back for more , without ever thinking that this was going to be a book .[ The project ] immersed me in Danny Kahneman , and becoming immersed in Danny Kahneman meant becoming very familiar with Danny Kahneman relationship with Amos .Then I thought : I had this privileged access I had this combination of a relationship with Danny and a prior relationship with Amos â€™s son , who was my student at [ the University of California ] .
