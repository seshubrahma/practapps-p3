And you know , I have always wanted to learn French , so I figured that I would just go to France for 2016 and skip the election year , hang out , learn French .And French happen to love Eagles of Death Metal , so I totally would have been at that concert , except Trump ran so I could nâ€™t leave .Romney has come out against Trump .How Trump that fit for you ?
