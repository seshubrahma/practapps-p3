Schofield I think it was six months later , in June of 1942 , we had Midway , the battle of Midway , which was really one of the earlier turning points in the war .So there ’s a lot of lessons to be learned at Pearl Harbor .This will be the kickoff of the 75th year celebrations .We ’re going to have the Battle of Coral Sea and Midway and everything , Wake Island , all of that next year .
