Sessions’ Alabamans would be outraged if I did .Yet that ’s exactly what the attorney general did .   These kinds of comments reflect badly on the attorney general and the Trump administration .Does the attorney general think federal judges in Hawaii do n’t know the law , do n’t have the training ( by the way , Watson graduated from Harvard Law School ) or do n’t understand federal judges in Hawaii constitutional responsibilities ?
