Sadly this is not a new question , and history offers some important lessons .In 2001 the world faced a similar dilemma .After former    Al Gore lost the 2000 election to George W. Bush , the newly inaugurated president walked away from the Kyoto Protocol , the previous global pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .That sent shockwaves around the world , and left nations facing a choice about what to do in the United Statesâ€™ absence     something they may face again next year .
