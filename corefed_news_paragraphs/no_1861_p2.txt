had such a    impact on the nature and priorities of an incoming administration .Unlike most new presidents , Trump comes into office with no    experience , no coherent political agenda and no bulging binder of policy proposals .And he Trump left a trail of inflammatory , often contradictory , statements on issues from immigration and race to terrorism and geopolitics .In such a chaotic environment , serving a president who is in many ways a tabula rasa , the appointees to key White House jobs like chief of staff and cabinet posts like secretary of state , defense secretary and Treasury secretary could wield outsize influence .
