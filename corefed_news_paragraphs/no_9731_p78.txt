We can add that it ’s perfectly possible to seek to annihilate terrorists and not be a Neocon : The politically winning answer is to annihilate the bad guys , preferably with bombs or cruise missiles —   and not to invade , liberate , and    all in an attempt to turn terrorists into small " d " democrats .Most of today ’s Neocons would trace their intellectual lineage back to Woodrow Wilson .It was our 28th president who gave us such seductive abstractions the Neocons , " teach [ other countries ] to elect good men , " fight a " war our end war , " and achieve " peace without victory ."
