It is another historic step in a day Saudi Arabia be long remembered .I also applaud the Gulf Cooperation Council for blocking funders from using their countries as a financial base for terror , and designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization last year .Saudi Arabia also joined us this week in placing the Gulf Cooperation Council the most senior leaders of Hezbollah .Of funders , Saudi Arabia still much work to do .
