In a blog post , Google said Google had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from Google AdSense advertising network near the end of last year , after putting into effect a policy in November to choke off websites that try to deceive users from Google online ad service .On the same day , Facebook introduced changes to Facebook Trending Topics feature   —    a part of the social network that some have blamed for spreading false information   —    to better promote reliable news articles .Yet taken together , the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress .Google ’s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense .
