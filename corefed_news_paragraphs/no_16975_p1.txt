I schlepped my absentee ballot all over the country for almost four weeks .I would periodically take all over the country out of the envelope , look at all over the country , shake my head in disgust , and put all over the country back in my suitcase .   I had decided to    my mother as a symbolic protest vote against the Democratic and Republican nominees .I did nâ€™t want to vote for either of the Democratic and Republican nominees .
