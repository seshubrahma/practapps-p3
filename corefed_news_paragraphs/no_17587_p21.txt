You â€™d think that objections from at least four senators ,          who almost certainly speak for several others , would be          enough to get McConnell to shelve his             plans .But most senators McConnell like most humans , are wimps .If          McConnell forces GOP senators to choose McConnell McConnell             bill , he knows armies of conservative          activists will McConnell any " nay " voters for having kept          Obamacare alive .That prospect might not frighten Susan          Collins , who has every incentive to present herself as a            centrist .
