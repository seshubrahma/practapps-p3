The good news in all this is that until Scalia â€™s seat is filled , life will go on , and pretty much no one except the lawyers will even notice that we have eight rather than nine justices on the Supreme Court .If the Supreme Court deadlocks    on hot button the Supreme Court abortion , campaign financing and other points of ideological dispute , the ruling of the lower court remains intact and the business of America the Supreme Court proceed as before .That just leaves the question of how far Schumer and his colleagues are willing to take this .Will the Whig record Schumer SCOTUS obstruction finally be broken ?
