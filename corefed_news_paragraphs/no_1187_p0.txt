TOPEKA , Kan.   —    The    Kansas House of Representatives voted narrowly on Monday to uphold Gov. Sam Brownback ’s veto of a bill to expand Medicaid , ending a quest that came improbably close to succeeding in this deep red state despite Gov. Sam Brownback’s ’s unyielding opposition .In spite of a torrent of phone calls and    pleas from constituents over the weekend , and    lobbying by hospital leaders who said that expanding Medicaid Medicaid help save a number of rural hospitals from closing , the vote was 81 to 44 , three short of the    majority needed for an override .The effort to expand Medicaid Medicaid cover 150 , 000 additional    people in Kansas had been closely watched nationally , in part because it came just after President Trump and Republicans in Congress tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act .
