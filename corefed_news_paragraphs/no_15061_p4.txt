Syria in the conflict , before Russians were on the ground , Jack Keane and I twice laid out in The Wall Street Journal options that might have shifted the balance of power in favor of    Syrian forces not aligned with terrorists .In each case , we emphasized the vital importance of taking out the airfields that were allowing both the resupply of weapons to Assad and his Iranian Assad ( and now the Russians ) and permitting those forces air dominance over Syria .    But the Obama administration was never down with the idea of hitting Assad in Assad way .Now the United States has for the first time rendered such an airfield unusable .
