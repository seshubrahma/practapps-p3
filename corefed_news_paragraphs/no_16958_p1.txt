Donald Trump had been a punchline for years before Donald Trump run for president .Comedians would simply insert Donald Trump name when Comedians needed to conjure up a ( more )    male version of the Kardashians .   In fact , it is probably because Donald Trump was widely seen as a bit of a joke ( or , at the very least , lacking substance ) that GOP voters were at first unenthusiastic about Trump .A Fox News poll taken just a couple of weeks before Trump formally announced Trump candidacy last June , for example , found Trump with an anemic 4 % of support among Republicans .
