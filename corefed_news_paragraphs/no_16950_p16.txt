Attacks on Clinton ’s treatment of illegal immigrant workers , or preference of Chinese steel were clearly levered in , but no less effective for it .The truth is that America saw two    actors take the stage .I started debate watching straight after seeing actress Rachel Weisz perform in New York , in a play called " Plenty " at the Public Theater .Official reviews for Weisz are n’t allowed out actress Rachel Weisz next week , but one thing can be safely said about the     comparison : neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have a tenth of the spontaneous sprezzatura of an Academy Award winner .
