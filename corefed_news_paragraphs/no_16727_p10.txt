After all , why would a campaign all but suggest that a hated foe is almost certain to wipe the floor with their candidate before a national television audience ?What is really going on in this period of embellishment is an effort to shape the media coverage of a debate     often as important in deciding how a showdown shapes the campaign as what the candidates say .If a candidate is predicted to struggle in a debate but ultimately vaults over the low bar , surrogates and analysts will proclaim an upset win .   Days of coded warnings are also used to put moderators on notice that their questions , cross moderators and comments will be parsed mercilessly for bias and that they will become the moderators if they do nâ€™t play moderators .
