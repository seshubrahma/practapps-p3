Video shows Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan speaking to the    agents before the   agents rushed the protesters in a coordinated attack and watching the violence .   It was brutal     with the   agents punching protesters and kicking them protesters they protesters on the ground .The word outrage does not come close to describing this incident .I frequently write about my objection to political violence and censorship in America , and we have plenty of examples of both .
