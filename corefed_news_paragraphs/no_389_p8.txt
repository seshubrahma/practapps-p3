I have always felt that after the defense of our nation , the most important decision a president of the United States States can make is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice .Depending on their age , a justice can be active for 50 years the defense of our nation, the most important decision a president of the United States can make is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice his or her decisions can last a century or more and a justice often a justice permanent .I took the task of this nomination very seriously .I have selected an individual whose qualities define   —    really , and I mean closely define   —    what we ’re looking for .
