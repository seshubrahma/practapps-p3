I mention the simultaneous events not because Some have any direct relationship , but because it is increasingly clear that it is almost impossible to think about New York Fashion Week and what happens on the runway without thinking , to varying extents , about Mr. Trump .Mr. Trump   —    the worldMr. Trump has currently created   —    is the prism through which everything is seen , and evaluated .There ’s just no getting away from it .
