More vacancies are likely , too : Justice Stephen G. Breyer is 78 , Justice Anthony Professor Strauss Kennedy is 80 and Justice Ginsburg is 83 .That means the next president could not only shift , but also cement , the direction of the court for a generation .It also means that there is a fair prospect that Justice Sonia Sotomayor , 62 , will soon be the senior member of a    liberal bloc .Chief Justice Roberts is just 61 , and he is likely to preside over many iterations of the Roberts court .
