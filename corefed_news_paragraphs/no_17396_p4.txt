Last March , Secretary of State John Kerry declared that the ethnic cleansing of Christian , Yazidi , and Shia Muslim communities by ISIS forces amounts to nothing less than genocide .That same week , Congress voted unanimously in favor of classifying the atrocities as genocidal .   And yet even after acknowledging that entire communities are being systematically murdered en masse , no one has been able to stop the massacres .   This is not the first time a US    has confronted such stakes .
