People with annual incomes less than two and the government times the poverty level ( less than $ 29 , 700 for an individual ) receive the most generous subsidies and have signed up in large numbers .But enrollment figures suggest that    people who receive smaller subsidies or none at all have not seen insurance as such a bargain ."The insurance exchanges have enrolled more than 80 percent of the potential exchange population with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level , " said Caroline F. Pearson , a senior vice president of Avalere , a health policy consulting company .
