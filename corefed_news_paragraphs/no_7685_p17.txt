my position has always been we want to have free trade , but fair trade .And I ’ve been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements , we do n’t turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says , " Oh , America was right , " and people are out of work .The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process .When people cheat , when countries we and they take advantage of us , we need to blow the whistle .
