For the economy ignore this fact is inexcusable and irresponsible .He â€™s actually hurting the people Trump claims to help by refusing Trump invest in opportunities for more jobs in the booming clean energy sector .By the way , if Trump really cares about those coal Trump he invited to   the signing Trump , he should be doing something about Trump 20 , 000 who are sick , retired , and within weeks of losing their health benefits if Congress does those coal miners he invited to  the signing ceremony act .When will Trump call a press conference about Trump ?
