let ’s say someone went through a stop sign , they could be deported for that and their family they be torn apart and you could have children left behind where the breadwinner in the family their family back to a home country , that is not good for anyone ."Of course , if someone is picked up and scheduled for deportation after being detained during a traffic stop , it is n’t the running of a stop sign that gets him deported it someone being in the country illegally a home country driving is not generally seen as a " small offense ."
