New Yorkers live    lives , and tourists are the busiest people in town .Who else dashes in     time from the World Trade Center to Rockefeller Center , to Trump Tower to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , pausing for selfies at each stop ?And when you hit the Met with your meter running , what can you do ?The place is huge ridiculous .
