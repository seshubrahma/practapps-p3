Ted Cruz has almost the exact opposite of a campaign fundraising approach .Cruz had just Ted Cruz $ 14 million cash on hand at the end of January .His January raised Ted Cruz 7 . 5 million in January and spent January 12 million .Almost half of the amount he collected , Ted Cruz , were in donations of $ 200 or less .
