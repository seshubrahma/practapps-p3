And despite rampant speculation about the designer behind the dress , Melania Trump cannily managed to surprise the entire fashion world .The gown was , according to a statement from Melania Trump office , a " collaboration " between Mrs. Trump and the designer Herv√© Pierre , a Frenchman who moved to New York in the early 1990s and eventually became creative director of Carolina Herrera , where he and Mrs. Trump met and where he worked on clothes for Laura Bush and Michelle Obama , though largely behind the scenes .he left that post last February .This is he first major dress under he own name ( he does not yet have a    collection in that context ) .
