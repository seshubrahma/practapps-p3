Head on over to Facebook and watch Facebook cool little video about making a ricotta tart .See if you do n’t want to make that baby tonight or later this week . )If I were cooking , I ’d be pleased this evening to serve Pierre Franey ’s great old recipe for chicken breasts with lemon alongside some plain rice and a platter of green beans with shallots .It makes for a relatively fast meal , and It should leave you time to clean up ahead of the first    debate of this election season .
