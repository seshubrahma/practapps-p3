In 2005 , erstwhile talented rapper Kanye West made the following claim at the end of an otherwise incoherent rant during a live fundraiser for the victims of Hurricane Katrina : " George Bush does n’t care about black people " .[ Fast forward 11 years , when over three times as much rain has fallen on Louisiana , and you will see a news media doing a news media best to ignore the Obama administration ’s fecklessness during a similar time of strife , and a central government response that in and of the Obama administration’s fecklessness has been underwhelming and deleterious to public confidence .   Of course Hurricane Katrina was never about black or white people .
