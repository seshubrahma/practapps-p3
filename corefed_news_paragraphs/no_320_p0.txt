For the first time , biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos , shifting from science fiction to the realm of the possible the idea of developing human organs in animals for later transplant .The approach involves generating stem cells from a patient ’s skin , growing the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig , and then harvesting the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig for transplant into a patient’s body .Since the organ the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig made of a patient ’s own cells , there would be little risk of immune rejection .The     pigs would be examples of chimeras , animals composed of two different genomes .
