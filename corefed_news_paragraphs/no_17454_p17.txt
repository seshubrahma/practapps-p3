More than anything else , the intent of the resolution to express his disappointment about the vote steps was to Netanyahu a statement about how the ambassadors of the United States and 10 of the countries that voted for the resolution to express his disappointment about the vote was about the vote .The decision to suspend working ties with embassies , even if there is no date for resuming Netanyahu the Security Council vote is largely symbolic and has little practical effect on the relations between the nations .It does not affect trade , working ties with embassies , or other aspects of the relations .Notably , Netanyahu did not suspend working ties with the nations American embassy , even though most of his anger was directly at the relations between the nations Obama .
