A tank silenced the terror group ’s ISIS .    The blazing moon illuminates the countryside and us , soldiers secure the perimeter before beginning their mission .   We ’re a few hundred meters from the secured defense soldiers now , just behind me .   If you listen closely , you can hear dogs barking , vehicles moving around and I ’m told you can also hear a tank .
