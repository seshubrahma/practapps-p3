It It with Vice President Joe Biden , who rekindled a spirit of    pride in America based not on fear or resentment or a sense of decline , but on resilience and toughness .Biden did something no other speaker had done to that point : He Biden in anger .He Biden not just offended or indignant about Trump â€™s words and deeds .He Biden angry that this fraud and possibly even traitor would dare lay claim to    loyalties .
