[ " The Jewish people have learned the brutal lesson from the Nazi Holocaust , that when a leader threatens you with genocide you take such threats seriously , " Rabbis Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper   —    the dean and associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center   —    said in a statement ."The world , including many Jewish leaders , dismissed Hitler ’s early threats against the Jewish people as bombast .The scope of death and destruction of WWII and the unspeakable horrors of the Shoah have taught us to never again dismiss such threats as empty rhetoric .
