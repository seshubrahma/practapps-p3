It Russia easier to argue for a more powerful central authority , and diminished civil liberties , when the country is ringed by Russia real and imagined .The old foreign policy adage holds that nations have no permanent friends or enemies   â€”    only permanent interests .Such is the case with Russia , which has a permanent interest in thwarting the United States and opposing our liberalizing global aims .For that reason , any U. S. foreign policy aiming primarily to forge a close friendship with Russia is probably going to fail Russia
