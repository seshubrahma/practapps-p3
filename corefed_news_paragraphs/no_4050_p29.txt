Here Trump what I ca n’t understand : FBI Director James Comey testified on Monday that Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign is under investigation by the FBI over its potential ties to Russia .Let FBI clear about FBI this might mean : treason .Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is under investigation by the FBI over its potential ties to Russia do n’t yet know what the outcome of the investigation will be ( though subsequent press reports have certainly investigation by the FBI over its potential ties to Russia importance of seeing it through to the end ) .But the very possibility that a sitting president and his circle could end up credibly accused of having advanced the interests of a hostile foreign power and of having colluded with that power in an effort to undermine the campaign of the president a hostile foreign power opponent should be more than enough to persuade Republican officeholders and pundits to treat the investigation with utmost seriousness   —    and to distance themselves from the man at the center of the investigation until such time Republican officeholders and pundits he is cleared of any wrongdoing .
