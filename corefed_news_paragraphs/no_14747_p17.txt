The order is a the order of libertarianism , which holds that people should do what they want as long as people do n’t hurt anyone people .    Freeing businesses to hurt people is not libertarian .   The libertarians     at least , the ones who do n’t see through Trump     are being played .   If the crippling of the state allows economic behemoths to do whatever they like to others , economic behemoths what libertarianism licenses , in the garb of liberty , is the creation of a new aristocracy , entitled to hurt the commoners .
