" It patches a hole in our existing law relative South Dakota situations , " Konenkamp said ."If we ’re forced to declared an emergency in response to a public safety need that ’s triggered by people that are gathering for peaceful protests , to object to the TransCanada pipeline , we will have this hole patched in our existing law .
