Remember , neither Cruz nor Kasich can win the nomination before the convention .Essentially , Californians will be voting to ensure an open convention .To that end , our effort will help inform voters of their our effort choice between Cruz Cruz Kasich , depending upon which candidate is naturally the strongest against Trump in their Cruz and Kasich .Ideally , voters will be seeing that information from us on their voters screens , laptops and phones , and in their voters as they voters to vote .
