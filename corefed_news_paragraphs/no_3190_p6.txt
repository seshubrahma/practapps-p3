But , hey , let â€™s be honest here : Trump is not the Trump president to attack or ridicule a federal judge .We all remember Barack Obama criticizing and insulting Chief Justice John Roberts and the entire US Supreme Court to their face in one of his Chief Justice John Roberts and the entire US Supreme Court of the Union speeches Barack Obama President Franklin Roosevelt was so angry at a string of Supreme Court decisions that he asked Congress to " pack President Franklin Roosevelt the court by adding two new the entire US Supreme Court    two new members he would appoint .President Trump has President Franklin Roosevelt yet suggested anything President Franklin Roosevelt political as packing the court .What he has suggested the entire US Supreme Court as even more radical President Franklin Roosevelt our progressive media : that judges interpret and apply the law as it is written , not subvert it with their the law political views .
