That agreement , which this week was ratified by enough countries to become international law , calls for the world to become carbon neutral this century .Basically that means no fossil fuel pollution , or none we do n’t figure out how to slurp out of the atmosphere .That ’s a lofty and critical goal if we want cities like New York and New Orleans to survive the onslaught of rising seas , and if we want future generations to inherit a habitable planet .   A President Trump could try to throw all of that out of whack .
