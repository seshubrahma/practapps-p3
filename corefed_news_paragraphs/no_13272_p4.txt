The previous night ’s protesting had seen internal squabbles between two groups of protesters .On one hand , the group Democracy Spring   —    which grew out of the Occupy Wall Street movement   —    wanted to maintain a peaceful protest , largely involving a citizens arrest .On the other hand , more angry socialist and anarchists factions were urging for direct , violent action , and rebuked Democracy Spring , saying they more angry socialist and anarchists factions accomplishing nothing .Some of that tension also existed on Thursday night , but after a fence was breached Wednesday , Philadelphia police showed more force on the final day of the convention .
