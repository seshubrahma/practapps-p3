Blackness was a central thread of my experience as a child and as an adolescent , as it is now that I â€™m an adult .    It seemed like my father knew everybody in Seattle , where I was raised .When my father and I would walk down the street I remember people would regularly ask my father how my father was doing .my father would respond without missing a beat : " You know , just out here fighting this racism , man . "
