Tuesday wo n’t be the first time Obama has given Hillary Clinton a lift on Air Clinton .In 2013 , the pair flew to Nelson Mandela ’s funeral in South Africa together ( along with former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura ) .Before that Nelson Mandela’s Clinton flew with Obama occasionally as Secretary Clinton State , Obama to Myanmar in 2012 .While former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush largely Clinton the campaign trail in their final years in office , Obama is former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush to stump heavily in support Obama the presumptive Democratic nominee , meaning Democrats will be on the hook for at least some of his travel in the coming months .
