After Jackson , came Gina McCarthy another green zealot   â€”    chosen for her political Lisa Jackson who had previously had a disastrous stint as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and passionate belief in climate change rather than her scientific Lisa Jackson who had previously had a disastrous stint as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection .On her watch Lisa Jackson who had previously had a disastrous stint as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection the water at Flint , Michigan was contaminated with lead , an EPA senior official ( whom McCarthy had supervised ) was charged with stealing nearly $ 900 , 000 of government funds , and the disastrous , expensive , ineffective , pointless Clean Power Plan .As should be obvious by now ,    Donald Trump sorely needs a new broom capable of sweeping away the Augean mess at this misbegotten institution , which is funded by the US taxpayer to the tune of $ 8 . 2 billion a year , but has been estimated to cost the US economy another $ 350 billion a year in terms of regulatory burden .Don van der Vaart , currently Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality , is just the man to do it .
