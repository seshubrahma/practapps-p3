The disparaging comments that Donald Trump has made over the campaign against minorities of all kinds     Muslims , Latinos , African Americans , women and those with special needs     are but symptoms of a deeper and    bigotry that our nation must confront .   Every day seems to bring news of mass shootings , more hate displaced onto minorities and extreme voices from the Republican party     by turns bigoted and silent when it is strategic for their campaigns .more hate displaced onto minorities and extreme voices from the Republican party     should nâ€™t forget that it was Ben Carson who said that he would never Ben Carson a Muslim into his cabinet and Ben Carsona Muslim could a Muslim Muslim , Marco Rubio , who said he would be Ben Carson to shutting down mosques if they inspire radicalization , mosques Ted Cruz , who said only those refugees fleeing ISIS who could prove they are Christian should only those refugees taken into our country .
