I try to stay positive .I try to keep thinking maybe , maybe someday CONGRESS will remember the vision of our Founding Fathers    …      and that those our elect will represent us , not the special interests .[ But Washington politicians are so far gone that the Constitution is not even an afterthought , and Washington politicians master seems to be whatever industry funds Washington politicians .   the Constitution does n’t have to be this way .
