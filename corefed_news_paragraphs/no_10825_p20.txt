It ’s not a good look for a candidate when Jake Tapper accuses him of being in denial Jake Tapper   Nobody should drop out , because they ’reall doing a Nobody job of forcing that brokered convention .This argument holds that since some of the supporters from each of the other candidates would flow to Trump , the best strategy is for everyone to stay in , and hold a 60 to 65 percent    parachute open until the Republican Party floats into a brokered convention .
