The # NeverTrump forces fought all the way through the last day of the Republican convention .That was quickly followed by his lengthy battle with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan , which had some Republicans digging through the party ’s rules and state laws for options .Talk of replacing Trump ebbed when Talk of replacing Trump pulled even with Hillary Clinton in the polls last month , and with just 30 days left until the election , thousands of ballots already cast in states with early voting and the legal deadlines for changing names on the ballot already past , the GOP is stuck with the GOP .Trump says Trump ’s not going anywhere , but that wo n’t stop the conversation .
