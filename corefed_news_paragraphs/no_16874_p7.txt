I am not advocating a federal program here whatsoever .But if Chicago were to set up clinics that you , as a heroin addict , could come in and get your heroin tested without fear of criminal repercussion , we ’ll test it for youand we ’ll determine whether it we kill you or it .If you are genuinely concerned about reducing or eliminating death due to heroin , that is a program that would definitely do that .
