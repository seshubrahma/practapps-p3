Take I. M. Pei ’s Hyperboloid , a sleek hourglass office tower and transit hub proposed in the 1950s Mr. Pei would have entailed the demolition of Grand Central Terminal .Even as the rest of America took to the road in cars , and struggling railroads were liquidating assets , our city preserved the    building in Midtown .( Sorry about that , Mr. Pei , but we ’re glad it did n’t pan out . )Or imagine floating in a translucent bubble to Governors Island on a gondola designed by Santiago Calatrava .
