In March , Trump asked for $ 1 billion to Trump build an extra 48 miles of border fence during 2017 .But Democrats threatened to shut down funding until the budget request was rejected , GOP legislators refused to fight for any money to build a wall , and so the May budget supplemental included no funds for new wall construction .In    a White House official predicted the administration would ask for $ 2 Trump billion for " border protections " in the budget request for 2018 .Most    immigration reformers say border fences are better than new surveillance technology , which is expensive to buy and maintain and is also easily removed by future spending cuts .
