If you had asked me yesterday , I would have said he was on Donald Trump to favor an    solution that met his goal of Donald Trump ISIS , and nothing else .   But yesterday is no more .Can Trump explain to those supporters most outraged by his actions ( including Trump fringe loonies who labeled the sarin attack a " false flag operation " )why he did what he Trump ?
