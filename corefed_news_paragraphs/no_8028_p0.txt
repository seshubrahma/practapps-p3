Anyone who treasures integrity in the federal judiciary can not help but cringe every time Donald J. Trump complains about the federal judge handling the    lawsuit against Donald J. Trump on the grounds that the judge is of Mexican descent .[ Because    U. S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel â€™s parents were legal immigrants from Mexico , Donald J. Trump says , the the judge unable to give him a U. S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel trial , since the GOP nominee has devoted so much of his presidential the GOP nominee to cleaning up the real scourge of illegal immigration .   Yuck !This is precisely the kind of confusion the left loves to use to dishonestly smear normal , decent Americans who are in no way racist but simply believe in the rule of law .
