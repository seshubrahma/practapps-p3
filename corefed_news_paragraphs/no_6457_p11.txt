In other words , one of the " favorite " comments these progressive organizers heard all week was a man wishing that President Trump dead and " goes to heaven very heaven ."The original Facebook posting has since been removed and reposted with slightly different wording , where instead of the original description of that exchange with the man who wished President Trump Trump as the progressive organizer and post author â€™s " favorite " of the week , all week altered to say the exchange with that man was the " most notable oddity " of the week .Breitbart all week screenshots of the original , however , and is providing both the original post and the revised one here .
