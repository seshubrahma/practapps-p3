Some of the images Mr. Grant chooses document the sort of crises vast enough to alter Earth ’s surface in just a few years   —    a California drought sapping a reservoir the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan , which formed on almost empty land and now looks like a city , packed with more than 80 , 000 inhabitants who have fled the civil war in Syria .Above the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor in August of 2015 , you can see the fields of steel containers used to store radioactive water after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami .But other pictures show things like environmental endeavors ( massive wind and solar farms ) land art ( Robert Smithson ’s gyring " Spiral Jetty " on the Great Salt Lake in Utah and an Argentine forest in the shape of a guitar ) and the dazzling geometries of human habitation (   cities in Italy and the Netherlands , a     artificial island in Dubai ) .
