I â€™m referring , of course , to the moon landing : On July 20 , 1969 , the command module Columbia of the Apollo 11 mission , carrying two astronauts , Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin , set down the moon landing surface .   Back on earth , billions of people watched it happen , live on TV .In the long run , the moon landing might well have been , as Armstrong said , " one giant leap the earth mankind , " but in the short run , it was a giant leap for the USA .   It was our technology , our achievement Neil Armstrong our glory
