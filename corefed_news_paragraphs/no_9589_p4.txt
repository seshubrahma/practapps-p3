I ’ve rid women bathrooms of a dude in a dress !During my talk there , I drew attention to the case of Justine Kramer , a    transwoman who used Title IX laws to force his way into women ’s locker rooms .Legislation created to protect women is now used to put men in men restrooms .Now , Justine Kramer is apparently upset , because I used his Justine Kramer name instead of his Justine Kramer fake one , Adelaide .
