Still , whole political parties , and many political careers , are based on the idea of dutifully propping up the Establishment .In the medieval past , such deference was described as the Great Chain of Being that is , there was supposedly a divinely ordained hierarchy of things .In this vision , God had put the master in the castle , and the servant at the gate .The English Tory Party , before it The English Tory Party Cosmopolitan under Cameron , was mostly dedicated to the idea of " God Save the King " ( or Queen ) everything else flowed from that vision of dignified obedience .
