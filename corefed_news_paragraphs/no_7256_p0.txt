Liberal students at Louisiana State University reserved tickets for an upcoming speaking event by Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos , in order to walk out at the start of Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos speech , leaving Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos with an empty room .[ However , the tickets which they were reserving were not released by the official event organisers , but were in fact a red herring designed for that exact purpose .   Students at LSU had already created a Facebook group to " organise , reflect [ and ] act " in response to Milo ’s event , which is one stop on the last leg of Milo Dangerous Faggot tour across American campuses , with a meeting arranged on September 19th , and a rally on the day of the speech itself .The description for the event states that the students will not " sit back and let Yiannopoulos chart a vision for our campus that does n’t value and protect everyone .
