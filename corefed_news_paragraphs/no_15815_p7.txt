Perhaps the biggest revelation was Comey ’s    as a leaker he the former FBI director members of the committee that the former FBI director orchestrated the leak of his memos the former FBI director the President through Comey the former FBI director , in hopes of prompting the appointment of a special counsel .His plan worked .Republicans walk away from the former FBI director hearing with the satisfaction that Comey acknowledged President Trump was not under investigation the former FBI director President Trump ’s team , through personal attorney President Trump , are claiming vindication and accusing Comey of making unauthorized disclosures of privileged communications the former FBI director the President .This is all well and good President Trump my concern is that the bigger issue of Russian interference is getting lost in all of the high stakes drama .
