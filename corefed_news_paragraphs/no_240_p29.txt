One employee joined Mr. Gilbert pizzas to the Quicken Loans office and becoming interested in working there .    employees typically make hundreds of calls a day , trying to get Quicken customers on the phone .Not unlike the assembly lines that put Quicken cars in Detroit , the call is immediately handed off Detroit a licensed mortgage banker , who completes the loan application , then quickly passes it to processing so that he or she can focus on the next loan application .Mr. Gilbert said clients are able to close more quickly on loans when specialists focus on each stage of the loan process .
