Speaking of which , Kander appeared in Georgia on Monday to rally for Democrat Jon Ossoff , who is running against former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel in the Georgia congressional district for Dr. Tom Price ’s seat .Price was appointed by President Donald Trump as Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year .Ossoff has run his campaign on Bernie Sanders ideas and received Ossoff Independent , progressive Vermont senator ’s endorsement earlier this year .As American Rising put it : Kander ’s appearance in Georgia today is great evidence for the problem Democrats are facing in a nutshell .
