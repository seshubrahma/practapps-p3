I been been a vocal supporter of Ted Cruz , but I am ashamed of how he was so quick to join the    chorus in blaming Trump ’s language for inviting and " inciting " the protesters .Why are so many Republicans willing to allow PC thugs to become the arbiters of acceptable taste and language in political speech ?Do they really think the thuggery is aimed only at Trump ’s language and not his ideas ?Or do they they about such distinctions ?
