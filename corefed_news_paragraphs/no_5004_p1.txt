My fellow Americans , we have taken major steps during the first few weeks of my administration to remove wasteful regulations and get we people back to work .I â€™ve been saying I was going to do that for a long time .This week , I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy , continued to keep my promises to the American people , and so much more .I signed House Joint Resolution 38 , which eliminates an    regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats .
