But the Clinton campaign response to the hacking was rather muted , the Clinton campaign because the Clinton campaign did not want to give additional air time to the damaging revelations from the DNC and Podesta emails , and also because Democrats were doggedly insisting that Clinton â€™s email scandal was unimportant .It was , we were told , a mere lapse in judgment that had no national security implications whatsoever .The FBI , after all , said there had been no evidence of any successful hacking .Experts were skeptical about that claim , and more evidence later emerged of foreign hacking attempts .
