The question I still have is how is it possible that Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump could have been recorded saying such things and , for 11 years , NBC News took no action whatsoever against its reporter ?Does NBC News , owner NBC Newsthe Access Hollywood NBC News condone such behavior and comments from their " on air talent " ?And when Does NBC News, owner of the Access Hollywood program finally decided to take action , did company Does NBC News, owner of the Access Hollywood program actually discuss ways of releasing the tape of Mr. Trump ’s comments while covering up for Mr. Bush ?
