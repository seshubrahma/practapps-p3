former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates’s then claimed no court would enforce the order   —    which is contradicted by the fact that one actually did .The left thinks Yates won the exchange because former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates’s was    with a set of talking points , and offered a snappy response .That shows how desperate Democrats are to salvage something out of the hearing   —    which failed to produce any new evidence to back up Democrats Russian conspiracy theories   —    and also how urgently Democrats need to find new champions .It does not change the fact that Cruz was completely correct , and Yates was completely wrong .
