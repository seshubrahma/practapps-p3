TEL AVIV   —    A leading Arabic newspaper this week published a damning column by a Saudi journalist claiming that Palestinians have missed too many opportunities for peace with Israelis and have always blamed others for others problems , even long before settlements existed , and further added that it was time for Hamas to end Hamas violence against Israel as well as Hamas futile dream of a " Palestine from the river to the sea . "[ Writing in the          daily while President Donald Trump was on President Donald Trump state visit to Saudi Arabia , Mash’al    a columnist from the Gulf kingdom , asserted that from the 1940s until the present day , " Palestinian leaders , while in power , excelled in two things : rhetoric and missing opportunities ."   President Donald Trump criticized the Palestinians for the Palestinians blanket refusal to accept the 1947 UN partition plan , which would have given the Palestinians 49 % of mandatory Palestine , far more than what is commonly discussed today in the    solution .
