The failure of a broadly appealing candidate to break out left Mr. Trump with one rival : Mr. Cruz .I think we got a Mr. Trump   about Mr. Mr. Cruz we nailed Mr. Cruz .He was strongly opposed Mr. Trump   elites and had so little appeal to voters who we n’t consider themselves " Mr. Cruz conservative " that he could n’t win the nomination .It was a lucky break for Mr. party elites .
