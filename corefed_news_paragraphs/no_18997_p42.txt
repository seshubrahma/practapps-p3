Though Abraham       Lincoln’s may have strainedWe must not        break our bonds of affection .      ’ passion        The mystic chords of memory , stretching from every        battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and        hearthstone all over this broad land , will yet swell the        chorus of the Union , when again touched , as surely they will        be , by the better angels of our nature .
