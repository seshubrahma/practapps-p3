No matter where you live , there may be carpooling options .Get on your neighborhood social feed and see if you live near someone who works in the same part of town .That could also save a lot of money in gas .   When you do drive , make sure you â€™re not spending more than 30 seconds idling and go easy on the gas pedal and brakes .
