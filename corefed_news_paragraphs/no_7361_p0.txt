The Bernie Sanders insurgency ground to a halt on Super Tuesday , to the surprise of no one except Bernie Sanders voters , who do n’t understand how their guy can draw huge crowds of screaming fans , and    donations from an army of small donors , but still lose to a corrupt mediocrity that her own voters do n’t trust .[ One of the lingering questions of the 2016 election is whether Bernie ’s fans take his Bernie’s badly enough to do something about it .   The Democrat race has none of the    factional intrigues of the Republican contest , so it seems kind of sad for Sanders    to point at the little handful of delegates he Sanders    accumulated .
