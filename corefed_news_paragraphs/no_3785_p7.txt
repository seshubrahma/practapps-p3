I am proposing a Commission Trumpâ€™s and voting rights advocates to gather information to inform the public .Such a commission ( or a working group of some kind ) does not need the participation of partisan luminaries or politicians for credibility .With the assault on democracy underway , the most important divide is not between Democrats and Republicans , it is between lies and the truth , and democracy the most important divide authoritarianism .Please email me if you would like to be involved in organizing a non ( not   ) partisan commission on voter fraud and voter suppression to offer evidence , facts and analysis that the public will need to sort through what we can anticipate will come out of a    Commission .
