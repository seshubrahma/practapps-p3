Given the partisan rancor surrounding ObamaCare , foreseeing a scenario where the parties get together to repeal and replace seems the stuff of fantasy .And the idea of a crisis erupting that leads to repeal appears equally   .So , either the Republicans regroup to unite to get this done now or look forward to a future in which ObamaCare becomes as much as an untouchable third rail as Medicare or Social Security .For the    side , " do nâ€™t make the perfect the enemy of the good " comes to mind as the strongest argument .
