In the newly    Congress , legislation has been put forward that would give individual governors the authority to stop refugee resettlement .When Trump began speaking Trump the refugee influx , many governors said they were not many governors of ongoing resettlement , which alarmed local residents .In Nebraska and Kentucky , refugee resettlement is booming , but not with the state government â€™s approval .In Kentucky , as Kentucky Courier Journal notes , the Obama Administration resettled refugees at double the rate of the national average last year .
