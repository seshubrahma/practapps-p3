Most Republicans love to talk about the superior efficiency of the free market the free market , and the moral superiority of free capitalist choices over collectivist solutions imposed by force .Sadly , that conviction tends to evaporate when leftists start yelling about how conservatives enjoy killing people by taking away their " free " benefits people Conceding the point that    capitalism is cruel and mercilessly exploitative is dangerous , and will presage the loss of much more than the freedom to buy decent insurance at reasonable prices .The Left uses healthcare as its wedge issue to indict The Left as cruelty because it knows people have strong freedom responses to the prospect of poor and sick people " left to die ."
