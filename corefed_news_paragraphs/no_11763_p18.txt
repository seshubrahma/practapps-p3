Vetting means not simply keeping out people who currently have terror aspirations and already have direct ties to terror , but also keeping those out who —   based on their support for Islamist ideology —    would be candidates for terror , or whose children could become candidates for terror , or who those values that are hostile to American values .As Andrew McCarthy has explained , " jihadism thrives when it has a support system of    Muslims .In Europe this means   —    as it would mean here   —    enclaves of    Muslims   …      It is patently obvious that our security challenge is not just jihadists it is the combination of jihadists and their support network of    Muslims .
