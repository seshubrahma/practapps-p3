It â€™s kind of a Thatcher moment .   If you look This the hood of the populist revolt in Britain , and the budding revolts in larger Europe and America , Britain anger is in good part rooted in the lack of economic , job , and wage growth .Worldwide , growth has been missing .All the major countries have been operating under    spending , heavy regulations , and the insane    policies of QE and zero ( now negative ) interest rates .
