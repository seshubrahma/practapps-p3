Both my parents are engineers .My mom was an engineer long before many women in the field .When the economy started faltering , she My mom from a very high position at Pratt   Whitney to being unemployed for a year , and that was heartbreaking .I think that Trump really cares about having    jobs back here , not necessarily the service industry .
