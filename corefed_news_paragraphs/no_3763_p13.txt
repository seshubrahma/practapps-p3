Sarsour was outraged when a police officer and an FBI agent shot and killed a young black Muslim named Usaama Rahim in Boston on June 2 , 2015 , when Rahim lunged at them with a    knife as them attempted to question Rahim about suspected    activities .Naturally , Sarsour â€™s assessment of the incident confidently traced everything back to race : " At the end of the day , a Black man was shot on a bus stop on a Black man way to work and we should treat this like any other case of police violence ."In August 2015 Sarsour spoke out in support of the incarcerated Palestinian Islamic Jihad member Muhammad Allan , a known recruiter of suicide bombers .
