Trump the Iraq War British a student of the English political philosopher Hobbes , who wrote his masterwork " Leviathan " in the shadow of the English Civil War .But he seems to have grasped Hobbes’ main point : that an absolute " sovereign " ( i. e. dictator Trump was preferable to " the war of all against all " that characterized the civil war in    century England as well as much of the civil war that continues to wrack    century Iraq .   And Trump ’s claim that following the fall of Saddam , Iraq has emerged as the " Harvard " of terrorism is correct because Zarqawi in 2004 merged his terrorist Iraq with al Qaeda to create " Al Qaeda in Iraq , " which is the parent the "Harvard" of terrorism of today ’s ISIS .
