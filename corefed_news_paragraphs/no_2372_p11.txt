I had not talked to Clinton in person for more than a year .She was Clinton and animated , but her eyes Clinton heavy , and she appeared Clinton worn down , no doubt still feeling some lingering aftereffects of pneumonia .In the same way that presidents seem to age eight years for every four they spend presidents the White House , you can see the toll this campaign has taken   —    the surprising challenge of Bernie Sanders , the email story and F. B. I. investigation and Trump ’s     pelting .She sat Clinton next to me at a conference table , slumped back in a swiveling desk chair .
