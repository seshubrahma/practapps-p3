One hundred years ago this April , it was your intervention in the First World War that helped Britain , France , our friends in the Commonwealth and other allies to maintain freedom in Europe .A little more than    years ago , you responded to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour by joining Britain in the Britain World War and defeating fascism not just in the Pacific but in Africa and Europe too .Europe later , in the aftermath of these wars , our two countries led the West through the Cold War , confronting communism and ultimately defeating it not just through military might , but by winning the war of ideas .And by proving that open , liberal , democratic societies will always defeat those that are closed , coercive and cruel .
