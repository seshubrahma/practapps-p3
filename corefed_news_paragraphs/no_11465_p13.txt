There ’s nothing special or brave about being gay in the United States today ( unless Obama gets his way and we Obama more Muslim immigration , of course ) .And , except in Muslim ghettos , I disagree with talking about one ’s gayness as an object of pride .And let ’s not pretend that conservatives are wholly responsible for their bad reputation with conservatives .Part of the blame certainly falls with gays , because we willingly accepted Democrat    for so long .
