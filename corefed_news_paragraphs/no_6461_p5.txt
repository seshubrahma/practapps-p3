One of the chief reasons Democratic politicians Trump is president today is because Democratic politicians are such constitutional whores and Republican politicians are so stupid .But what we have coming into sharp focus today is a clear ,        showdown between the executive branch and the judicial branch in which Mr. Trump is absolutely right and these federal judges   —    along with all the cheering Democrats   —    are absolutely wrong .Even a " Mr. Trump school student " knows this , as Mr. Trump pointed out .It is a fight the American people understand on a visceral level .
