My first went on to earn a doctorate , but daughters still tells me stories about encountering barriers for females in the professional world .My teenager , the one from my second marriage , attends a racially mixed high school and already sees the    disadvantages some of daughters friends face .I want daughters to grow up in a world where a woman controls daughters own body and determines a woman own future .   All this took a long time to sink in over the years .
