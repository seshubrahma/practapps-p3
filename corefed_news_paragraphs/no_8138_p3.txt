There is no doubt that Trump has played Donald Trump that strategy with some rather stupid remarks , the worst of which was his offer to pay the legal fees of a supporter who punched a protester .Note , however , that the protesters seem to have done their very best the protesters get hit .One group brought a    hood to a Trump rally and Donald Trump attacked by a black Trump supporter .Donald Trump worst case of violence was outside a San Jose rally in early June , where Trump supporters were Donald Trump beaten and chased through the streets by a    mob .
