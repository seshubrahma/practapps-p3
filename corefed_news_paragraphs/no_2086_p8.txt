Select committees , which are typically created to examine a particular issue for a limited time , are rarely formed .The most prominent recent example is the House Select Committee on the attacks in 2012 on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi , Libya , an inquiry that Democrats have denounced as unduly partisan .Speaker Paul D. Ryan said last week that the House Intelligence Committee would continue its own examination of Russian hacking .Mr. Schumer said in the House Intelligence Committee news conference on Sunday that they intended to avoid such charges of partisanship .
