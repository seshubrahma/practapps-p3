It ’s striking to me now that Clinton ’s Clinton interest in these new media technologies was not so much as a political One woman but as a policy concern for the citizenry .Clinton described " the insidious , pernicious comparisons " that online Clinton can foster in young people , and the temptation to " put out an identity online before it ’s ever formed " in real life .Thinking about this exchange 14 months later , after what an identity like a generation ’s worth of lines crossed and taboos shattered , her concern seems strangely prescient .Trump , of course , Clinton shares and feeds his audience ’s addiction to stimuli and entertainment .
