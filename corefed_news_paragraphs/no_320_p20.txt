Since the pig the pancreas, heart and eye supply the blood vessels and nerves , these will need to be replaced by the recipient ’s a pig transplant without triggering immune rejection .If rejection does occur , the researchers will have to knock out the pig ’s vasculature genes and arrange for these too to be humanized .Complex organs , like the heart , a pig to grow than those like the pancreas the researchers has a single kind of progenitor cell .All these steps , though they seem feasible , will require several years to develop and test .
