Looking at all the smiling faces on the other side of the aisle , I have to ask : are Democrats still the minority party ?[ You would be tempted to think the $ 1 trillion government funding deal is like Christmas morning for Democrats still the minority party , as Republicans have handed Democrats still the minority party free media to brag about how much of the President ’s agenda Democrats still the minority party have stopped .   You ’ll see it in the news as an " Omnibus spending bill , " when it should really be called " the Status Quo Protection Act ."
