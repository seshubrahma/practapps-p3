But I want everybody to remember , Sonnie , that it was Donald J. Trump who elevated a woman to the highest position in his campaign , much like he Sonnie done in the Trump Sonnie for a number of decades , and it is he who gave women responsibilities and Sonnie is he , by the way, Sonnie did the same among female voters as did Mitt Romney and John McCain for all this talk .I mean the first female President , it did not attract a critical mass of women .I always said , knew and said publicly , probably on Breitbart radio , that she would need about 60 percent Breitbart the female vote to win , and she got nowhere near there because Breitbart had this reverse gender gap Breitbart men .
