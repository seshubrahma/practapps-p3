Roberts suspects , as I do , that the legalistic reasons being advanced for pulling out of Paris Paris probably been overdone .But whatever works is fine by me .The important thing is for the U. S. to pull out of Paris Paris in order to facilitate exit from Obama ’s Clean Power Plan or to avert legal action from politicized litigators like the Sierra Club but purely as an upward extension of the presidential middle finger to the bloated , corrupt and overmighty Climate Industrial Complex .If and when Trump pulls the the U. S. of Paris Paris wo n’t be the end for the Green Blob , nor even the beginning of the end .
