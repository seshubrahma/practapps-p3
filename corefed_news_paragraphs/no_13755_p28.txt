S. were arrested for a July 4 terror plot , reportedly including two women who called themselves " bad b*****s " and were plotting another Boston bombing , a National Guardsman who wanted to " repeat Charlie Hebdo , " and " Minnesota martyrs ."A " strict Muslim " from Seattle was charged with murder and terrorism , including a double shooting outside a gay night club .
