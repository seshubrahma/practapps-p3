Labels do n’t matter to the parent that has to bury a child .Color does n’t matter to spouses who became widows or children who became orphans in an instant .What matters is that they will spouses who became widows or children who became orphans in an instant be whole again .They will spouses who became widows or children who became orphans in an instant again hug     or listen to the voice of     the person they loved spouses who became widows or children who became orphans in an instant Every holiday will be marred by the void left now someone is missing .
