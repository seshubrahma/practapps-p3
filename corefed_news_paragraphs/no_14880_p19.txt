The Persian cookies ( walnut , chickpea , almond , rice ) from the Persian grocery stores in LA â€™s " Little Persia " were my favorite .Later , in college , my parents sent care packages full of themand I boasted my parents friends that these were Persian comfort foods .Most of all , in my youth I believed Nowruz might have the power to eclipse the other darknesses of my homeland that played nonstop on television and in the news .
