Now , you know the saying , " past performance is no guarantee of future results " but a peek into a record book is instructed here , especially if you feel that this bull is old and tired .    So , happy bull market .    At eight years old , this is the second longest bull market in history , behind the epic run from 1987 to 2000 .   That rally , the longest and strongest in history , up 583 percent .
