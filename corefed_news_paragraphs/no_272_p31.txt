Mr. TrumpIf the labor movement divides over Mr. Trump , it would not be the first time .An old saying holds Mr. Trump building trades would pave over their mothers’ graves if it created jobs .And before Mr. Trump ’s rise , unions like the Communications Workers of America and the Service Employees Mr. Trump had split with the building unions over the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines , with the former siding with liberal environmentalists and the latter seeing opportunities for work .
