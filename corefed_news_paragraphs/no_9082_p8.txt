Sasse reportedly went to Iowa to campaign against Trump , making appearances with both Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) .Trump then tweeted a message aimed at Trump 2016 rival , Cruz , calling Trump " Canada Ted ."Amazing that both Sen. Ted Cruz ca nâ€™t even get a Senator like @BenSasse , who is easy , to endorse Trump .
