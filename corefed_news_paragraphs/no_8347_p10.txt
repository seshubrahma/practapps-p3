My advice to investors is to ride out the    market volatility , which may last several months , and look instead at the    positives of political and economic freedom .   It will now be up to Boris Johnson , the likely new British prime minster , and the Tory party , perhaps with bipartisan help , to negotiate a good trade deal and move more aggressively on the    path of      policies .   There â€™s already talk about abolishing the 5 percent VAT on household energy .Good .
