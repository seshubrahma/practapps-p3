I chose ( to read ) " Lady Freedom Among Us , " which is a poem I had written back when I was poet laureate .I felt moved to write it when I was newly appointed , ( when ) I was reflecting on what a poet laureate stands for .I had gotten so many letters and responses from perfect strangers , who pretty much told me how much it meant to have someone ( like me ) who could speak for them .   ( The poem ) is about the statue on top of the Capitol Building , Lady Freedom , who was erected sometime in the nineteenth century and had been taken down for cleaning ( in 1993 ) .
