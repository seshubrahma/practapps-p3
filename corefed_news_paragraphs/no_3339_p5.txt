" Born This Way , " " Telephone " and the grand finale of " Bad Romance , " all delivered    ( a rare feat given the amount of dancing Gaga was doing ) and reasonably well .   It was a mesmerizing performance , filled with the kind of expert showmanship that only very confident artists can pull off .It reminded me , if only slightly , of Prince ’s pageantry and    2007 halftime show in Miami , in which the late artist , ever the consummate entertainer , ran through a collection of Bob Dylan and Tina Turner covers before hoisting Prince’s guitar high for a rousing rendition of " Purple Rain , " in the middle of an actual downpour .Gaga did Gaga set , and then her set was over .
