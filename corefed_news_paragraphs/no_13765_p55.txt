I never felt in danger one time , nor was I threatened in any way .I people from the National Lawyers Guildit very clear to everyone I met who I was , what I did people from the National Lawyers Guild living , people from the National Lawyers Guild what I believed .I tried to put my faith in Jesus Christ into action as best I could and tried to help everyone I came into contact with , whether it was a guard trying to do his job organizing all the prisoners , a some people inmate who was worried about whether he could pay Andrew Breitbart bond , a National Lawyers Guild lawyer trying to keep track of who was arrested , or the police officer whose job it was to handcuff me .
