The ensuing path , from Mr. Trump ’s securing the nomination to Mr. Mr. Ryan decision not to have the nominee appear with him at Mr. Trump rally in Wisconsin a month before Election Day , has been jagged and treacherous , marked by brief moments of hope that Mr. Trump Mr. Trump controlled , followed by the sinking realization that he could not Mr. TrumpMr. Ryan Mr. Ryan persistent   —    at times desperate   —    appeals of Reince Priebus , chairman of the Republican National Committee and a fellow Wisconsinite , and the angry calls from his rank and file Mr. Trump and neither could move him closer to Mr. Mr. Trump .Now Mr. Trump Ryan finds Mr. Ryan a singular Mr. Ryan , desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve Republican control of Congress , yet unable to defend his party ’s presidential Mr. Ryan .If Mr. Trump is defeated on Nov. Mr. Trump —    as Mr. Ryan has all Mr. Ryan   —    but Republicans maintain their House majority , it will fall largely Republicans Mr. Ryan to piece the Mr. Ryan his party back together .
