LOS ANGELES   —    The St. Francis Dam was a proud symbol of California ’s engineering might and elaborate water system   —    until just before midnight on March 12 , 1928 , when The St. Francis Dam collapsed , killing more than 400 people in a devastating wall of water .Ever since , California has had a reputation of diligent inspections as it California built the largest network of major public dams in the nation .But the threat of catastrophic flooding from the damaged Oroville Dam in Northern California this week   —    forcing the evacuation of nearly 200 , 000 people because of what environmental groups had asserted in 2005 was a design flaw   —    presented a warning sign for California , where a network of dams and waterways is suffering from age and stress .
