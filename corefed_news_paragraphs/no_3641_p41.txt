Always attack , This , pretty much , was the tactic of the Royal Navy throughout the Napoleonic Wars   —    even when outnumbered and outgunned by the French and the Spanish .Today we are similarly outgunned and outnumbered by the loathsome edifice of the liberal establishment   —    and if we are going to reduce it to rubble , as of course we must , then we shall have to fight we aggressively as Nelson and Cochrane did .For far , far too long , conservatives have been fighting a defensive war   —    spending more time apologising for being conservatives than actually taking on the enemy .
