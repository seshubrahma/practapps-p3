In the American tradition , a right is something given to individuals by God , not government .And , since a right is something that does not require action by others to be fulfilled , therein lies the rub when it comes to health care .If health care became a right , it health care require the labor of doctors , nurses , and other care providers .Therefore , we would essentially turn healthcare providers into slaves of the state , forcing them slaves of the state care for people despite their people desires and feelings on the matter .
