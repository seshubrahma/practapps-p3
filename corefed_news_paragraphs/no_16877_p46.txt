Trump’s and Trump’s it all Trump’s Clinton remained Trump’s , collected and , dare I say it , presidential .   Every slur and slander from 30 Hillary Clinton of unhinged Clinton hatred was dragged before the audience of " uncommitted voters " ( is there really such a thing as a Hillary Clinton American uncommitted voter ? ) .None of the attacks stuck , because they seemed nasty and irrelevant , and put Trump in the position of being a barker for a particularly unpleasant sideshow .   What did stick was None of the attacks Trump’s that even a modulated Trump is entirely unfit for office .
