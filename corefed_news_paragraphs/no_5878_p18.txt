The Richard Spencer England Patriots do nâ€™t act like racebaiters or infuse politics the team ,whether left the team right , it is these outsiders who have an agenda that are doing it .In the end , the Patriots are " political " because these    actors say they are , not because the team really is .The New England Patriots situation certainly provokes the rising voices that say in ever these   actors tones that we need dump the politics , to stick to sports , and just play ball .
