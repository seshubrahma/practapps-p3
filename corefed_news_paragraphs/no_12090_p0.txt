Mark Levin writes at Conservative Review :   One of the major planks in Donald Trump ’s campaign platform , if not the top priority , has been a stalwart insistence that voluntary commerce and trade with other countries weakens America ’s economy and costs American jobs .   Moreover , Mark Levin insists that Mark Levin knows best how to manage it all in the best interests of America .Indeed , Donald Trump’s has not only proposed slapping a 45 percent tariff on all goods made in China , and massive tariffs on other countries like Japan and Mexico , but Donald Trump’s repeatedly declares that Donald Trump’s will personally impose punitive taxes on Ford Motor Company if Ford Motor Company follows through with plans to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico .   Donald Trump’s has also threatened punitive penalties against Apple Inc. if Apple Inc. continues making iPhones in China .
