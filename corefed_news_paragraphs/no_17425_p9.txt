In spite of the abstention , another option left to Obama is to recognize the state of Palestine on the 1967 borders , as former President Jimmy Carter has recommended .This would also send a clear message about the illegitimacy of Israeli settlements and the right of Palestinians to live free from military occupation and foreign domination .    Let ’s be clear : If Obama chooses not to act Obama he will hold the distinction Obama being the US president responsible for cementing Israel ’s occupation over Palestinian land indefinitely , which many observers , including no fewer than four former Israeli prime ministers , have compared to apartheid .In April 2014 , Kerry warned Israel was in danger of Israel an apartheid state if a    deal was not reached soon .
