No , it was a split decision , with Quinnipiac showing a tight race and we showing a considerable Clinton lead .I ’m inclined to lean toward     considering that the Clinton campaign is n’t taking Pennsylvania especially seriously [ no ad spending ,although a    super PAC is Pennsylvania money there ] .But it ’d be nice to have more data there .
