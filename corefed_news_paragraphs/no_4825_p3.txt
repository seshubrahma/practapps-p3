This has to change .We need a government that spends on the right things   —    the safety , security , and    of our people   —    and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds , whether in America or in global projects overseas   —    of which , perhaps , there are too many .My administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American Greatness .The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers .
