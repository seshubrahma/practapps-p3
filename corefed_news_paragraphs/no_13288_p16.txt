That shows that the terrorist threat can appear anywhere , any time .   It can be a city in the middle of the United States , a small town as in France .It can be in a city well removed from Paris , where a monk is killed while giving mass in a church .That is the kind of terror attack that actually inspires more fear in people because it ’s so unexpected .
