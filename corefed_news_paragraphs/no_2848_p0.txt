Donald John Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States on Tuesday in a stunning culmination of an explosive , populist and polarizing campaign that took relentless aim at the institutions and    ideals of American democracy .The surprise outcome , defying late polls that showed Hillary Clinton with a modest but persistent edge , threatened convulsions throughout the country and the world , where skeptics had watched with alarm as Mr. Trump ’s unvarnished overtures to disillusioned voters took hold .The triumph for Mr. Trump , 70 , a real estate     television star with no government experience , was a powerful rejection of the establishment forces that had assembled against Mr. Trump , from the world of business to government , and the consensus they had forged on everything from trade to immigration .The results amounted to a repudiation , not only of Mrs. Clinton , but of President Obama , whose legacy is suddenly imperiled .
