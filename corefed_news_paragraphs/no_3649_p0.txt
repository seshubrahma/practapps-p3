To celebrate St. Patrick ’s Day weekend , I followed Ireland ’s and arguably the world ’s greatest golfer at the Bay Hill Classic .[ Rory started Friday one over par and far back of the leader , Charley Hoffman , who sat at 10 under .Consequently , it was an earlier than usual tee time .He played with Jim Herman , a     journeyman who had He first tour win at the Shell Houston Open last year .
