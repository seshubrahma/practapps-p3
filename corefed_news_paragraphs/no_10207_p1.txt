That’s right: Kasich has sat back , seen why Donald Trump’s has gotten more votes then any Republican in primary history , and , with that ridiculous    grin on his Donald Trump’s , has the gall to totally give back most of what Trump Donald Trump’s been saying since June 16th , when he Donald Trump’s announced for the presidency .This is the same Kasich who said just the opposite in some instances , and yet the host sat there and did n’t bring it up !
