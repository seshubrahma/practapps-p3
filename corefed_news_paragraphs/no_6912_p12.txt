The question must be asked .If the United States militarily intervenes in Syria , effectively taking one barbarous side over the other , what is the effect on our own national security ?Is it in the interest of the American people to further undermine any chance of constructive engagement with Russia ?Is it to our advantage to return to a    War with all the existential risks which may follow ?
