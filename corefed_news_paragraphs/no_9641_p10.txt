To be sure , the Four Freedoms , like all our freedoms , are constantly under threat .As we all know , freedom of speech is under insidious challenge here in the U. S. on college campuses , in particular , the    forces of political correctness seem to have gained the upper hand .And freedom of worship , too , is under fire , as Christians have learned to their dismay .In Christians , we all know that freedom from fear is bitter joke to many Americans , because of domestic crime and unrest , or because of foolish foreign wars , or because of the surging threat from domestic terrorism â€”   even as our own government insists on importing , at taxpayer expense , more possible terrorists .
