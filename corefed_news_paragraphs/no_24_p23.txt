some "liberal elites" , particularly on the progressive left .It was during Bill Clinton ’s presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published " The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy , " which mourned that "    liberals " had turned into " petulant ,    intolerant " scolds , thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America .Since then , the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers , including MSNBC ’s Chris Hayes , whose 2012 " Twilight of the Elites " called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal " meritocracy "   —    a system , he argued liberal "meritocracy"   that tends to fuel    and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom .So as 2017 begins , we find ourselves in we strange and uncertain political moment .
