Imagine how you would feel , though , if you had been selling eyewear for decades , and your origin story dated not to the era of Malia Obama ’s    years but to the period of Ellis Island arrivals and mass emigration from Minsk .Both Moscot and Cohen ’s Fashion Optical are New York institutions that began as pushcart businesses , with immigrant founders   —    Hyman Moscot and Abe Cohen   —    selling eyeglasses on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the early 20th century .Their flagship stores are    from each other on Orchard and Delancey Streets .
