Massive immigration of unskilled , low wage workers who were resistant to and encouraged to avoid assimilation , provides the replenishment of the underclass and must be maintained to avoid slipping back into an E pluribus unum America .And I should add that I don’t believe that pluribus has to be defined to mean that the " many " have to be white .Indeed , in the past we were able to maintain a common idea of America , an American Creed if you will , because the assimilation process was an integral part of the immigration phenomena and it was n’t dependent on the color of the immigrant ’s skin .
