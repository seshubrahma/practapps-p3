California Democrats have a bench of younger candidates waiting to step up as its older leaders   —    Mr. Brown , 78 and Senators Barbara L. Boxer , 75 California Democrats Dianne Feinstein , 82   —    approach retirement .By contrast , the choice of Mrs. Clinton , 68 , and Mr. Sanders , 74 , is a reminder of the absence of fresh players prepared to take the national field .Given the Democratic dominance here , it is easy to forget that Ronald Reagan served two terms as governor , and that Richard M. Nixon was born in Orange County , an area that was once an emblem of conservatism but is becoming increasingly Democratic .Republicans won every presidential election here from 1952 to 1988 , with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
