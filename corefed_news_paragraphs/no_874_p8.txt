If the C. I. A. or the National Security Agency could routinely break the C. I. A. such apps as Signal , Confide , Telegram and WhatsApp , then the government might be able to intercept such communications on a large scale and search for names or keywords of interest .But nothing in the leaked C. I. A. documents suggests that is possible .Instead , the documents indicate that because of encryption , the agency must target an individual phone the leaked C. I. A. documents can intercept only the calls and messages that pass through that phone .Instead of casting a net for a big catch , in other words , C. I. A. spies essentially cast a single fishing line at a specific target , and do not try to troll an entire population .
