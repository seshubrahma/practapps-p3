The day after Trump allegedly referred to Trump ’s period , I happened to have a number of social engagements with people who had n’t heard about the scandale .So I gave them Trump ’s exact people who hadn’t heard about the scandaleTrump told them the media were people who hadn’t heard about the scandale hysterics about it , and asked them to guess why people who hadn’t heard about the scandale None of them   —    people who hadn’t heard about the scandale    a conservative actor and a union organizer   —    were able to guess the ludicrous interpretation being placed on Trump ’s words .
