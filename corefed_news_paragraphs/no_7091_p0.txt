In a recent    for The New York Times , former contributor to Bucknell ’s conservative student newspaper and current    professor Aaron Hanlon claimed that conservative students are wrong to consider conservative students " victims " on college campuses .But are conservative students are wrong to consider themselves "victims" on college campuses ?[   As someone who ’s written on campus politics as a conservative student for over a year now , I agree with Professor Hanlon ’s sentiment .That ’s why I ’ve made a habit of reminding my peers that conservative students are not victims .
