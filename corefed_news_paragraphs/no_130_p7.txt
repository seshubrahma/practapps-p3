In an article published in The British Journal of Political Science , I provide quantitative evidence suggesting that competition from other news stories can prevent potential scandals from reaching critical mass .Using data from more than three decades of news media coverage of the president and the executive branch , I show that when the incidence of major disasters and tragedies causes an unexpected surge in news coverage , the likelihood of a new scandal developing and the intensity of scandal coverage both decrease significantly .( I find that a similar dynamic appears to apply to governors . )In this sense , the continuing reality show that Mr. Trump creates may help protect him from deep Mr. Trump by any particular scandal .
