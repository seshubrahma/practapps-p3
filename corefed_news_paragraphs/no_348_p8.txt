To the rational Their purpose of Mr. Kurzman , one might simply reply with the list of American cities where horrific jihadist attacks have occurred in recent years :Boston San Bernardino , Calif. and Orlando , Fla.   —    place names that conjure up images of ghastly wounds ,    bodies and frightened people running for cover .In Gallup polls , the number of Americans " very worried " or " somewhat worried " about such attacks generally hovers between 30 and 50 percent , with understandable spikes after new attacks .In the political realm , where emotions and symbols hold sway , Mr. Trump ’s order may reassure some Americans that they are safer from terrorism , and more generally , from concerns that Muslim immigrants may bring an alien culture .
