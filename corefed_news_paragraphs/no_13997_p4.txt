If I could say just one thing to those at the Women ’s March , it would be this : the constitutional right to abortion has only made men like Donald Trump worse .Contraception fails .Contraception just does .But constitutionalizing the right to abortion as Roe did in January 1973 has n’t relieved women of the consequences of sex or the vulnerabilities of pregnancy .
