I drove into town from the Salton Sea in my $    rental from Hertz as the last leg of a fun Southern California road trip .I headed to the Lafayette Hotel , on El Cajon Boulevard   â€”    a good location , right near the border of University Heights and North Park .My room on the second floor of the    1946 building was adequate , and a good deal for the $ 85 per night I paid through Hotels .
