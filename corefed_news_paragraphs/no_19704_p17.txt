have mass terrorism without people being fearful of Muslims .Responsible leadership tries to minimize that , because it ’s irrational .We ’re fortunate in the United States : We have a small Muslim We , and we also have a strong We of civil liberties .That combination makes me optimistic that we wo n’t have mass We or internment camps .
