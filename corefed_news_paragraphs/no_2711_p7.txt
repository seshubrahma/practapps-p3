Francis’ letter also noted that the church would celebrate a World Day of the Poor every November " to help communities and each of the baptized to reflect on how poverty is at the very heart of the Gospel ."He also called on the faithful to " promote Francis’ culture of mercy based on the rediscovery of encounter with others , a culture in which no one looks at another with indifference or turns away from the suffering of our brothers and sisters ."
