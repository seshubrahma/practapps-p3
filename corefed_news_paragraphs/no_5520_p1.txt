Blaming white males for " Some of the biggest blows to the progressive cause in the past year " including Brexit and the election of President Donald Trump , Garland â€™s apparently serious piece claimed just a couple of decades of white men being excluded from elections could see such progressive leaps forward as the collapse of Western law and capitalism , and a massive redistribution of wealth from " toxic white masculinity " through " expropriation of these various assets " .Among the charges laid at the feet of white males by the author are the 2008 recession , and " 500 years colonialism , slavery , and various aggressive wars and genocides " .If this was about any other group it this be the end of @HuffingtonPost , Is It Time To Deny # WhiteMenThe # Vote ?
