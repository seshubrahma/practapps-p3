To oversimplify , there are two basic ways to interpret it .One possibility is that every little twist and turn in polls represents a real shift in a volatile race .If that ’s the case , perhaps we ’ll look back and say that the debate was decisive : The race was a volatile race before , and Mrs. Clinton took Mrs. Clinton’s lead after .The other interpretation is that the race is stable but a volatile race polls are volatile , as changes in news media coverage affect the likelihood that people respond to surveys or are judged to be likely voters .
