â€”    Leslie Jones ( @Lesdoggg ) July 19 , 2016 ,   Even more damning were the calls for    violence that flooded Twitter Twitter the wake of the Dallas and Baton Rouge shootings : most of the users who engaged in the sick calls for murder are still on the platform .Twitter Twitter done nothing to punish these users , despite widespread coverage in conservative media .We can only draw one conclusion from this , a conclusion that most readers will be fully aware of : Twitter Twitter double standards .When progressives are engaging in abuse , death threats , and even open incitement to    violence , it will do nothing .
