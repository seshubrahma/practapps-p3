It arrived my   luggage untouched .Then , after customs , I handed it back my   luggage the airline and rushed across the airport to catch my connecting flight .I just barely made it , my   luggage is more than I can say for my luggage my   luggage a long day of traveling almost 8 , 000 miles , and more than 24 hours after I left my hotel for the Dubai airport the airport my final destination .I stood at baggage claim and watched everyone else â€™s suitcases tumble down from the conveyor belt , imagining a laptop inside bouncing along with the rest of the contents .
