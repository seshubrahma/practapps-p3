Mr. Hayes and I were speaking during a week in which the conservative news media was going through a    between    reporting and wild speculation and falsehoods .Fox News temporarily sidelined Andrew Napolitano , the contributor who spawned the unsubstantiated claim that Mr. Obama had used British intelligence to spy on Mr. Trump .The conservative Independent Journal Review told Oliver Darcy of Business Insider that it had disciplined journalists involved in a report suggesting that a Hawaii judge had blocked the revised version of Mr. Trump ’s immigration order under pressure from Mr. Obama .The The conservative Independent Journal Review , based solely on the fact that Mr. Obama had been in the state around the time of Mr. Trump helped hasten another IJR journalist ’s decision to quit in protest , as Hadas Gold of Politico reported .
