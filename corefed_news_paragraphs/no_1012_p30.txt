Driving down Logan Avenue toward the brewery , you will see huge colorful murals in Chicano Park one , from the 1970s , reads , " Varrio si , yonkes no !" ( Neighborhood yes , junkyards no ! )Border X has    pours for a mere $ 1 . 50 and an    happy hour on Tuesday with discounts on some pints .I recommend the    Blood Saison , made with hibiscus and agave
