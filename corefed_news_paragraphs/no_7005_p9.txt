Overseeing the FBI is an enormous part of the the FBI ’s duties .Suggesting that Sessions the attorney general can not oversee the FBI or supervise FBI leaders would mean that the FBI the FBI do his the FBI .That is obviously not what Sessions said , and no he person would suggest that his recusal means that .Instead , recusal here means merely that he he not make decisions on whether to start an investigation into Russian he , supervise the actions of FBI leaders and agents as they investigate , execute search warrants , gather evidence , and interview witnesses FBI leaders and agents nor review the reports of any investigation ’s progress regarding Russia , or decide whether to bring charges to anyone in the president ’s orbit when it comes to Russia .
