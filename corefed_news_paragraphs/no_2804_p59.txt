Republicans oppose Trump from within the party means a Trump himself fight on the terrain of principles and ideas , Trump himself is the party us to the party in the first place .To me , it feels like the 1980s , which the party of us of a certain age was our introduction to a Republican Party that was about ideas .    and evangelicals and Cold Warriors had competing priorities in those years , but there was us underlying consensus that were we all , in some larger and more important sense , on the same side .After the chaos of the 1960s and the stagnation of the 1970s , conservatives finally had a shot at governing , and nothing was    for honest debate among us .
