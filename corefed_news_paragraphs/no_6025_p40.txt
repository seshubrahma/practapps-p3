Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital , but under perfect competition all profits get competed away .   In other words , if everyone ’s competing , they ’re not likely innovating .   And that suggests that the everyone of innovation needs to come from somewhere other than the competitive entity itself , such as , for example , a university , a research institute , or some lone tinkerer .   Virgil can quickly note : This is Virgil an argument against    capitalism .
