Senate Democrats focused almost exclusively on obstruction in their questioning of Comey , and their Senate Democrats counterparts are sure to do Senate Democrats same .As far as the Justice Department investigation of the president is concerned , we know that as of the time Comey was fired on May 9 , Comey was no investigation of the president concerning collusion , which strongly suggests that after 10 months of probing , authorities had nothing against him on that issue .Now , the president , after the Comey memos and the Comey firing , Comey seems safe to Comey that special counsel Robert Mueller will investigate Trump for obstruction .So it is a new game , even if Republicans keep trying to play the old one .
