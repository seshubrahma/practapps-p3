  ( CNN )I have been adamantly opposed to Donald Trump ’s candidacy from the first time Donald Trump’s glided down the escalator at Trump Tower and descended into the pits of the worst parts of rhetoric against humankind by calling Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists .It is because of that moment     and so many thereafter     that I never believed this reality star had a legitimate chance or frankly that Donald Trump’s was serious about running for president .    But then came the deadline for candidates to file the Federal Election Commission ’s financial disclosure form
