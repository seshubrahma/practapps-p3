when there ’s such divisiveness in Washington , I was looking for someone that can win this election and this election was n’t a divider , and I think that ’s the problem I have with everybody else in the field .SCARBOROUGH :So Marco Rubio’s can win , but Marco Rubio’s ’s been in the Senate for four years .Can you name Marco Rubio’s top accomplishment in the Senate , actually working in the the Senate the Senate that tilted your decision to Marco Rubio ?
