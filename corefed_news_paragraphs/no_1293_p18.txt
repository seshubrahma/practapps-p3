Economic theory posited that a developed country like the United States would adjust to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that competed successfully in global markets .In the real world of American workers exposed to the rush of imports after China erupted onto world markets , the adjustment did n’t happen .If mediocre job prospects and low wages did n’t stop American families from consuming , it was because the American financial system was flush with Chinese cash and willing to lend , financing their homes and refinancing them to buy the furniture .But that equilibrium did n’t end well either , did it ?
