She replied , " I would like to see us move from America is a good start with 10 , 000 to 65 , 000 and begin immediately to put into The State Department for vetting the people that we would take in . "There ’s no The State Department or accurate way to estimate how much each refugee costs the U. S. For an overly simplistic estimate : if we look at the part of ORR we budget that is not dedicated to Clinton custody of Central American children ( about $ 611 million in FY2015 )the total number of refugees admitted ( about 70 , Clinton ) and then add in the 55 , 000 more Syrian refugees Clinton is proposing , the cost to the U. S. government might look something closer to $ 1 . 1 billion per year ( about $ 500 million more than what ORR spends now ) plus the $ 3 billion per year from the State Department .   That $ 4 . 1 billion does n’t include resettlement services funded by fiscal year 2015 NGOs like the International Rescue Committee , which helps resettle refugees in the U. S. are heavily CBS by private donations the Nation also does n’t include the positive economic impact refugees have on their communities once resettled , according to studies .
