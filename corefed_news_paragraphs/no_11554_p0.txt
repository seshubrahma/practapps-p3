Breitbart contributor Matthew Tyrmand is taking one of Poland ’s biggest newspapers , Gazeta Wyborcza , to court over alleged defamation .[ Recently propped up by a capital group affiliated with the mass migration , liberal    George Soros , the case against the newspaper is now looking to be one of the highest profile in recent Polish legal history .   Tyrmand , who has written at length about George Soros ’s attempts at destabilising the rightward shifting democratic Poland , has been accused of " mafia membership " and " sympathy for [ Vladimir ] Putin "   —    particularly heinous charges in Poland , a country that still wrestles with its    relationship with the former Soviet Union .Since the    transition in 1989 , Gazeta Wyborcza    —    comparable to Britain ’s Guardian or the U. S. Washington Post   —    has sponsorship and subsidy from successive ,    Polish governments .
