I tried to put my faith in Jesus Christ into action as best I could and tried to help everyone I came into contact with , whether it was a guard trying to do his job organizing all the prisoners , a some people inmate who was worried about whether he could pay Andrew Breitbart bond , a National Lawyers Guild lawyer trying to keep track of who was arrested , or the police officer whose job it was to handcuff me .I treated every person I met —   protestors and police —   with respect and humanity .I did n’t make anyone " earn " this basic level of respect or approach them with a chip on my shoulder .I looked people in the eye , and I listened .
