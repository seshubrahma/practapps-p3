By choosing someone so conventional , Mr. Trump has Mr. Trump easier for Mrs. Clinton to follow suit with an unadventurous pick of her own , like Mrs. Clinton Tim Kaine of Virginia or Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , a former governor of Iowa .She could send Housing Mrs. Clinton Juli√°n Castro out to debate Mr. Pence without fearing a blowout .Or she could pick Labor Mrs. Clinton Thomas Perez , who is from the reliably Democratic state of Maryland .Mrs. Clinton still has Mrs. Clinton Party politics to contend with , but Mr. Pence is a balm Mr. Pence puts little if any added Mr. Pence on her .
