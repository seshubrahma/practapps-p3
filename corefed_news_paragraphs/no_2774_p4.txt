Mrs. Clinton fought Hillary Clinton , especially in a fierce exchange over Israel , as the two candidates played to a rambunctious and roaring audience at the Brooklyn Navy Yard :a classic New York crowd that interrupted , booed and cheered in sports arena style , creating a highly charged atmosphere .The forum also revealed the increasing animosity between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton , who no longer offer each other the polite rejoinders and carefully couched criticisms that characterized the early part of the campaign .Feisty and frequently sarcastic , Mr. Sanders could barely contain his disgust with Mrs. Clinton â€™s ties with Wall Mr. Sanders , a ripe target among liberals in New York City and in economically depressed upstate regions .
