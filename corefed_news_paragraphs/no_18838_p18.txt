I can not say openly that I identify with Republicans , lest I see friendships and potential professional connections disappear with those words .When I see Hillary Clinton , I see the world becoming less and less tolerant of    views .When I see Facebook censoring conservative outlets and then see The Atlantic defending the practice , that worries me .When I see the fear that reddit users have about admins banning subreddits because of political beliefs , that worries me.
