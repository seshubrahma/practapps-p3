"Dick Woodruff , who lobbies Congress on behalf of the American Cancer Society â€™s Cancer Action Network , said under the current Republican proposal   a    cancer survivor making around $ 50 , 000 a year could expect to pay at least $ 1 , 000 monthly for treatment     far above the $ 400 Koehler was paying in the Obamacare market .   Dick Woodruff, who lobbies Congress on behalf of the American Cancer Society probably would qualify for a partial tax refund at the end of the year , but the     expense would likely be substantially more under the plan Congress is considering ."
