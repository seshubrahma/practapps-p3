Not surprisingly , those at the top do the best according to a 2015 report from the federal National Academies of Science , Engineering , and Medicine , a     man in the upper income quintile , or category , can expect to live another 38 years those in the    quintile can expect to live another 37 years .   Meanwhile , those in the exact middle can look forward to another 33 years .   Those in the    have another 28 years , while those at the bottom have another 26 years .   So we can see the wide disparity â€”   a    gap of longevity between the top and the middle , and a    gap between the top and the very bottom .
