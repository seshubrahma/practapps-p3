The history of these things is that removing a Middle Eastern strongman always makes things worse   —    for example , in Iran , Iraq , Libya , and Egypt .We our in , thinking we our helping the poor devils under the thumb of a dictator   —    and then the new tribe takes over and oppresses everyone else , usually much more brutally , while hating us our more than the the new tribe .If voters wanted more Middle Eastern wars , there were plenty of other candidates offering that : Marco Rubio , Lindsey Graham , Carly Fiorina , and Hillary Clinton , for example .
