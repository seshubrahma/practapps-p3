Lofty words for a pep rally , but any realistic person knows no president can wave a magic wand and fix all of these problems immediately     especially if we spend all of our time focusing on the politics of protectionism we fearing our neighbors around the world because they do nâ€™t look or pray like us .Politics aside, I want President we to make me proud .We all deserve this .
