Many of you have   better grasp on the civil war that that , but you ’re college students , so I have to assume it has n’t been covered in the same detail as important topics like microaggressions It manspreading .Slavery is horrific , but the only slavery you hear about is the American kind that ended in the 1860s .According to the UN and other groups , there are an estimated 30 million slaves in the world today , including 14 million in India , and 4 % of the population of Mauritania .No one even takes the time to find out where Mauritania is , let alone try to end slavery there .
