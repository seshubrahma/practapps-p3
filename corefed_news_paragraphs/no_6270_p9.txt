January 6 , 2017 ,   Note how Watts throws in the unsubstantiated claim that America has " the highest rate of gun violence of developed nations ."It is all part of a distraction meant to keep people from thinking about the basic fact that the Ft .    airport is a    zone —   that means 100 percent gun control , just like the Aurora movie theater , Sandy Hook Elementary , Umpqua Community College , Fort Hood , the Lafayette movie theater , and the Orlando Pulse , among other locations .When you understand this , you see that the January 6 attack just proved the impotency of gun control all over again .
