They so hate the Washington the Republican electorate insiders that most of the ire on talk radio and on the internet is directed at these turncoat Republicans .These same voters gave the Republicans mandates in 2010 these turncoat Republicans   â€”    and that mandate was to stop Obama .It was loud and clear , and the entire Democrat party nationally is almost hollowed out as a result .And yet , with Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McConnell   leading the    the Republicans caved time and again these turncoat Republicans .
