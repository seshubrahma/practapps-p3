I just do n’t think competitors American tax code should be a tool used by corporate titans to gain leverage or advantage over each other .Success should be determined by the quality and price of their products and services in the free market .Success importantly , if Congress eliminates these " green " energy tax credits , we pay down the debt and put badly needed funds into education , infrastructure , and other important priorities that help to improve the lives of regular people and allow them to pursue the American dream .Elon Musk regular people said multiple times in recent months that he does n’t want government subsidies .
