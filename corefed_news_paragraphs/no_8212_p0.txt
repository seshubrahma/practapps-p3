The signage outside the front of a West Texas plant and nursery store does not mince a West Texas plant and nursery store words when it comes to how the business owner feels about the presumptive presidential Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton .it reads : " Crooked Hillary Would Be a Fucking Disaster ! "[ No asterisks , no redacting , no euphemistic use of the pretend word " effing " to mask where Slide Plant Market owner Mark Lee stands on the possibility that " Crooked Hillary " could be elected as the next president of the United States .   Since the sign went up Thursday , residents of the small unincorporated community of Slide , located in South Lubbock County , reacted strongly but not because Mark Lee used the term " Crooked Hillary , " coined by the presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump .
