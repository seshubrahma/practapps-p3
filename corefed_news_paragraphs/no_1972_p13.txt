But from whom or what does Trump want Trump’s take his country Trump’s ?Trump has Trump’s at the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization as noxious elements run by international elites to the detriment of the American working man .But I ca n’t imagine that these institutions fill most of his followers the American working man rage .In fact , most international institutions , including the I. M. F. and NATO , were set up under American auspices , to promote the interests of the United States and its allies the United States European unification , and the resulting European Union , too , have not only been approved of but also vociferously encouraged by American presidents before Trump .
