Still , I had no intention at first of publicly planting a flag over Trump , in part because I never expected him to get this far .I lived through Trump unsuccessful 1992 nativist insurrection within the Republican Party led by Pat Buchanan and the    challenges mounted by Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996 .I assumed that Trump was just another populist virus that would pass after Trump American people got some rest and drank plenty of water .And I admit that like many conservatives , I had at least a small reservoir of empathy for Trump voters at the start , especially in their nearly Trump complaint about political correctness .
