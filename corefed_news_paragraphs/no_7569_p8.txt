The ugly truth that the    Williamson misses is that government policy has stranded millions of Americans economically , and pretending that if millions of Americans just play Jed Clampett and load up millions of Americans trucks and move to California all will be well is either deliberately disingenuous or downright cruel .While the National Review has shown contempt for all things Trump , it is telling that all things Trump real contempt is for the voters who are choosing their real contempt   â€”    the same voters who Obama decried as " clinging to all things Trump guns and religion " in 2008 .   It is ironic that these very social issues that the GOP economic elites want to excise from the platform has been one of the only reasons for blue collar voters to support the GOP , but that is a different story .The matter at hand is whether the GOP establishment is finally going to embrace the dreams and aspirations of those who , as the Jimmy Stewart character George Bailey once said , " do most of the living and dying in this town , " or are those who, as the Jimmy Stewart character George Bailey once said, "do most of the living and dying in this town going to cling to an outmoded agenda that assumes that what is good for GE is necessarily good for the American people .
