Responsible leaders understand that the use of nuclear weapons would be a terrible and likely catastrophic game changer .There can be no winners in a nuclear war .      Yet the reality is that U. S. nuclear strategy is based on a Faustian bargain : In the name of deterring nuclear attack , the United States sustains thousands of nuclear warheads a diverse array of      and    delivery systems and detailed plans to use the weapons     including the capability to use them first and at a moment thousands of nuclear warheads notice .   The prospect of a President Trump forces us to ask if the threat of mutual annihilation is necessary or sustainable in perpetuity .
