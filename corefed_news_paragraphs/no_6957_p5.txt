Romans 1 , Verse 28 says because judicial activists did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God , God gave judicial activists over to a depraved mind to do what ought not to be done .And there ’s a list of attitudes and deeds and it reads something like this —   this is off the top of my head , but this ’s pretty close —   this says this you give them over to do what should n’t be done , to a depraved mind , this said , them become filled with every kind of wickedness , evil , greed and depravity .
