The Archbishop of Canterbury is a decent ,    man with a very lofty position in the global hierarchy : but then , so are large numbers of many of the other Establishment types who fought so hard for Remain and so hard against Donald Trump .What they all have in common is that they they all trapped in a bubble , they they all held on to the reins of power for far too long , and their they all is now quite properly being overthrown by a demos who â€™ve had frankly quite enough of this shit .Justin Welby , you are part of the problem , not the solution .
