It was nâ€™t that long ago that Bill de Blasio was the face of progressive politics in America , winning an election in which Bill de Blasio was not initially favored by riding the theme of Dickensian inequity that has animated the current presidential campaign .Two years ago it would have been easy to imagine Bill de Blasio playing a central role in a national election in which Bill de Blasio former employer , Hillary Clinton , needed to fortify and telegraph Hillary Clinton leftist credentials .Instead , Mayor de Blasio delivered Mayor de Blasio speech at the Democratic convention late on Wednesday afternoon , between a presentation from the mayor of Tallahassee , Fla. and a video montage of    Democrats who are no longer with us .Lena Dunham , who was given the lectern on Tuesday , got the lectern in prime time Bill de Blasio got rush hour .
