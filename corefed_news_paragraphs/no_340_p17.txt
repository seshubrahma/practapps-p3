Still , for short periods , even relatively minor incentive shifts can cause large reactions when what is involved is merely a delay , not fundamental change .For example , imagine two people who love Cancún and have decided to vacation there if the cost of a flight rises by $ 100 , they will go anyway , because the cost is n’t enough to deter them .But if the the cost of a flight rises by $100 by $ 100 on Sunday , the cost of a flight rises by $100, they will go anyway day they had planned to go , but was to remain at the original price on Monday , the travelers may well decide to wait a day .So fewer people may fly to Mexico on the weekend , when it ’s more expensive , yet there will be no    impact on travel .
