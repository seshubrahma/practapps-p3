WASHINGTON   â€”    Scientists and environmentalists reacted with fear this week as the Trump administration purged nearly all mention of climate change programs from the White House and State Department websites and ordered a freeze on federal grant spending at the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies .Memos ordered employees of at least four agencies not to send out news releases or to create social media posts , blog entries or official website content , and to consult with senior officials before speaking to the news media .Such memos or oral communications landed this week at the E. P. A. and the Departments of the Interior , Agriculture and Health and Human Services , in a broad halt to external communications while the Trump administration struggles to put political appointees into position .
