Breitbart Marinelli :No , my stay in Russia began Russia before any of these media reports .If I were to ever find out that I was actually under investigation , I would walk into Marinelli FBI building and offer myself up to answer any questions and turn myself in if necessary because I have nothing Russia hide , I have done nothing illegal , and Russia am fully confident that that truth would come to light if it was brought before a court of law where a fair trial could be held .Breitbart the FBI : Bloomberg has implied in one story that you are working myself shadowy Russian political figures with ties to Putin .
