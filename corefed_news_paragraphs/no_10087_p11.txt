I mean , he goes Rubio portraying himself as Rubio purist , you know , Ted Cruz , the purist on immigration .But I was there two , three years ago ,when he was Rubio you know , passionately arguing at the committee that we needed to pass immigration reform , we needed we do bring people out of the shadows , we needed we find a compromise on people that were in this country illegally .And now he portrays Rubio as Rubio sort of purist who â€™s never changed his position
