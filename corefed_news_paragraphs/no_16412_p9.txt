As a point reference , 10 % of the Electoral College is akin to the entire state of California ( the largest prize in the Electoral College ) .the Electoral College an event were to occur , it would trigger a constitutional crisis of such an event proportions .    In my investigations , one elector noted that he believed he had a duty to one elector his one elector if he were to find one elector that his one elector â€™s nominee was a " one elector " in the time between the nation votes and the time the Electoral College votes .There is little to stop electors from asserting their independence .
