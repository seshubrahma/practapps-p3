( OSB ) was launched in 2013 after a previous relaxation of immigration policies resulted in a surge of the number of people arriving by boat from 161 in 2008 to 2 , 726 in 2009 .   Even that higher figure is a tiny percentage of overall immigration to Australia .During the    financial year , around 190 , 000 people were granted residency visas , while nearly 400 , 000 people were granted temporary student or skilled work visas .   The Coalition government , now led by Turnbull , campaigned in 2013 on a vow to " stop the boats , " and OSB included posters with slogans such as " No Way : You will not make Australia home .
