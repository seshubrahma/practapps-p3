The a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an   group that tracks extremism that California had more hate groups than any other state   —    followed by Florida , with 63 , and Texas , 55   —    a result presumably of its sheer size .But the data also revealed a notable cluster of activity in the corridor between the Los Angeles area and San Diego , where at least 40 of the groups operate .Mark Potok , a senior fellow at the center , suggested the presence of a heavy Latino population in Southern California played a part in fueling    sentiment .To earn a place in the hate index , an organization must publicly espouse the idea that a class of people is inferior by virtue of its characteristics .
