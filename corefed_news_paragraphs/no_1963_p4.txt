Utility companies have drastically reduced their Utility companies on coal , in part because of President Obama ’s aggressive regulations to cut emissions from power plants , but also because natural gas is cheaper .Nationally , about 300    power plants have closed since 2008 , according to the National Mining Association , a trade group .Many of those about 300   power plants    including one in nearby Louisa , Ky. where a giant cooling tower was recently demolished after the plant converted from coal to natural gas   —    are not coming back .Politicians and economists agree that what Appalachia really needs is a diversified economy , a goal that has eluded Mr. Obama and state and local politicians .
