But take a step back and think about just how outrageous such a thing is from a national news outlet , especially an outlet just 2 days from hosting a crucially important presidential debate that includes the target of this childishness .Now take another step back with the realization that not a single one of the Republican presidential candidates have come to Trump ’s defense , or even had the moral courage to criticize Fox ’s behavior .No one is their own man anymore .No one has the moxie to Rage Against The Machine .
