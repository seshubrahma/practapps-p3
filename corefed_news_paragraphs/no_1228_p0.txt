WASHINGTON   —    Senate Republicans on Thursday engineered a dramatic change in how the chamber confirms Supreme Court nominations , bypassing a Democratic blockade of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch in a move that will most likely reshape both the Senate and the court .After Democrats held together Thursday morning and filibustered President Trump ’s nominee , Republicans voted to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority .In deploying this    nuclear option , lawmakers are fundamentally altering the way the Senate handles one of its the Senate significant duties , further limiting the minority ’s power in a chamber that was designed to be a slower and more deliberative body than the House .
