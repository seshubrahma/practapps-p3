In our June 1972 issue , Elizabeth Janeway reviewed de Beauvoir ’s book The Coming of Age , on the experience of aging :In the interior world inside each graying head there is an equally unsettling confrontation .One ’s old identity is somehow no longer acceptable in public exchange .One may feel nineteen or    or no age at all , but those out there get up and offer a seat on the bus , listen for a moment , laugh and go on talking , or do n’t listen at all .
