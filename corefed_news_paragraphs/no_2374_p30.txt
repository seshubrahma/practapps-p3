Almost all pollsters adjust their sample to match demographics , like Almost all pollsters , race and gender .If a pollster is n’t weighting for something fundamental like that , it ’s a big warning sign : a pollster for yourself whether the poll is off by a wide margin on those measures ( sometimes , they ’re fine ) .It ’s the poll worth looking at education the poll party registration .Not every poll weights by those measures , and sometimes that ’s a mistake .
