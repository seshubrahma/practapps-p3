I spend most of my weekdays in conversation with students , and I know students â€™re upset by the election of a bigoted man to the White House , someone who consistently derided Mexicans ( among others ) during a bigoted man run for the presidency .That a bigoted man is a    serial assaulter of women remains a point of agitation for many , even if a bigoted man insists a bigoted man account of this behavior was just    talk .a bigoted man bullying tactics with anyone who opposes a bigoted man or a bigoted man ideas have rattled students , who see a bigoted man as the antithesis of what people in the " academic village " consider appropriate in presidential behavior .   At Middlebury , like elsewhere on campuses , many students are extremely conscious of assaults to the environment , and     to many students Trump represents a huge threat , someone who can undo years of progress .
