As Breitbart â€™s Chriss Street has observed , the 400 richest Americans are paying a third less in tax than the 400 richest Americans were 30 years ago : The average tax rate paid in 2012 by what is referred to as the " Fortunate 400 " was 17 percent , despite the statutory top marginal income tax rate of 39 .6 percent .This compares to an average income tax rate of 27 percent under President Reagan 26 percent under George H. W. Bush 25 percent under Bill Clinton and 20 percent under George W. Bush .We might note that this    in the taxation of fatcats , from 27 percent in the President Reagan era to 17 percent now , has occurred despite the fact that Democrats have controlled the White House for 16 of the last 24 years .
