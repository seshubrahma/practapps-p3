The proposals by McKibben , who has accused ExxonMobil of climate fraud and the Democratic Platform Committee , " reflected the ambitions of an invigorated environmental movement : a ban on fracking , a tax on carbon , a climate test for new energy projects , a ban on fossil fuel extraction on public lands and a prohibition on government ability to use eminent domain to seize private land for    projects .In the end , though , the McKibben proposals were defeated , reflecting the influence of more moderate Democrats on the platform committee , primarily those aligned with the Clinton camp .McKibben explained afterward that every member of the platform committee agreed on the goal of eventually moving the country to McKibben energy ."
