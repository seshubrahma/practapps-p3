Two highly respected members of the British House of Lords , Lady Caroline Cox and Lord Malcolm Pearson , had invited me to show my 2008 documentary Fitna to members of the House in a conference room of the parliament building in Westminster .Fitna is a movie , juxtaposing Koranic versed calling for violence with footage of terrorist attacks and other violent deeds these verses inspired .   Fitna , as well as my view that Islam , rather than a religion , is primarily a totalitarian political ideology aiming for world domination , has resulted in several death threats against my person .I am on the death list of    ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban .
