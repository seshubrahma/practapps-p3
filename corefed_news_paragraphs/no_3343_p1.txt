S. companies employ roughly 470 , 000 foreign professionals via the    O , L , J , OPT , and TN visas .The EPI study estimates a study released on March 7 by the    Economic Policy Institute population at a much lower level of only 460 , 000 employees , partly because EPI says many    workers quickly get permanent green cards , which converts them into legal residents , not many   workers workers .If Goldman ’s estimate of almost one million    is combined with the EPI ’s estimate of various other skilled    visa programs , then the government data shows that U.
