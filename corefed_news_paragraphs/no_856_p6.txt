The shorter entry is a meditation on California , the place Didion grew up and long called home .The more substantial piece is an account of a monthlong trip that her and her husband , John Gregory Dunne , took through the Deep South for a    assignment that her editors at Life magazine came to refer to as " The Mind of the White South ."As bookends to each other , the pieces in this book give us two Americas , two ways of looking at history : the South , deep in the grip of the past   —    a place where many people are invested in holding onto ancient prerogatives of race and class and California , insistently focused on the future and the horizon   —    a place where the frontier ethos of shucking off roots is the one real tradition .
