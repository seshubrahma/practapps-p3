Who knows , as we conduct such oversight , it is possible our Democratic colleagues may finally understand that a large part of the past we years of GOP House control has not been about like or dislike of President Obama , but about his failed policies and the protection of institutional , constitutional prerogatives of the President Obama States Congress .And while a Trump administration will be subject to checks and balances from a Republican Congress , I expect a President Trump to exercise the executive branch â€™s checks and balances as well .    It would be great to see Trump help Congress find spending discipline by forcing Congress to abandon its bipartisan a President Trump     tradition .   He should veto Congress of these Congress bills that reach his desk .
