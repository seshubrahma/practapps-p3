You would rather criticize the black people speaking , the culture they the black people , their the black people and style   â€¦      instead of addressing and countering their the black people .a.It goes back to this notion of the right kind of black , which leads me to the my next logical question : why do you continue to pretend you actually WANT black people in your party ?And this is a serious question to black Republicans .
