On August 10 Rush Limbaugh reacted to the media attacks on Donald Trump by observing that Donald Trump had simply told the truth about Hillary Clinton namely , that Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns .[ Limbaugh said any honest observer knows Donald Trump is right because soundbites of Hillary Clinton —   even during this election cycle —   are riddled with Hillary Clinton promises of more gun control .Moreover , Limbaugh pointed out that Hillary Clinton has made no bones about the fact that Hillary Clinton will use executive action to institute more gun control if the Congress refuses to go along with Hillary Clinton .   During Limbaugh live broadcast Limbaugh said : Limbaugh said what Limbaugh says , as impolitic as Limbaugh was —   characterize Limbaugh however you will —   but the fact of the matter is that over here , the media and Hillary and Biden and Obama and the whole Democrat Party do indeed want to take away guns from law abiding people .
