"Hillbilly Elegy , " in my mind , divides into two components :the family stories Mr. Vance tells   —    most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life   —    and the questions he raises .Chief among them : How much they he hold his hillbilly Chief among them responsible Chief among them their own misfortunes ?
