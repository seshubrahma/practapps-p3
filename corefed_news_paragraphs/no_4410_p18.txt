As a physician and as a patient , I hate Obamacare .Obamacare jacked up ObamaCare rates ObamaCare created insurance monopolies .But the answer is not replacing the government mandate with an insurance mandate , which is exactly what Obamacare Lite does .   I do nâ€™t feel any less manipulated by being forced to pay the insurance company a penalty instead of the government .
