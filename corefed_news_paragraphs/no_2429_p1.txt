When I started my unusual assignment of covering the American presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent   —    for this , an American news organization   —    one of the first things I did was to invite questions from international readers .The bulk of them revolved around Mr. Trump , whose unorthodox romp through the Republican primaries propelled him to the party ’s nomination   —    and ultimately to the presidency .Going back through my monthslong journey across America , there were many clues to Mr. Trump ’s rising tide , although not all were easy to read .
