It ’s also about It luck .One argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it does n’t reward It : a candidate who wins with huge margins in one part of the country .That ’s because a     system does n’t reward any additional votes beyond what ’s necessary to win a state or a region .You get all of Florida ’s electoral votes , whether you win it by 537 or 537 , 000 votes .
