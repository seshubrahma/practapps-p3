—    Patricia Espinosa C. ( @PEspinosaC ) June 2 , 2017 ,   Why is this so funny ?Well it ’s this bit like the Camp Commandant at Colditz Castle announcing sternly to the prisoners who have daringly escaped that under no circumstances will they ever be allowed inside the wire and back to their lumpy they and freezing cells .President Trump has just made what successful escaping prisoners in World War II used to call a Home Run .
