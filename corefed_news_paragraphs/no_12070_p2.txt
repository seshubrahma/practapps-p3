To disparage the Catholic Church as ‘ severely backwards’ is an insult to millions of people across the nation .If anything , America reveal the Clinton campaign ’s hostile attitude toward people of faith in general .This is the United States of America —   for centuries , people fled to our shores to find refuge from religious persecution .All Americans of faith should take a long , hard look at this and decide if these are the values we want to be represented in our next president .
