Despite the fact that Mr. Wang ’s show seemed conceived to put a     stiletto boot into the eye of the establishment ( see Bella Hadid in a vintage    sporting the words " Night of Treason " ) the whole felt less convincing than calculated .the whole did n’t help that , though Mr. Wang had Mr. Wang show in Harlem , there were less than a handful of black models on the runway .Mr. Wang has been down the   ’n’   route before , and while he Mr. Wang a knack for combining the trappings of punk with some neat men ’s wear tailoring and couture cuts , here the latter was unfortunately in short supply .Instead there was a lot of slicing and dicing sleight of hand .
