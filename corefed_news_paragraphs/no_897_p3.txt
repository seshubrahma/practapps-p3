We are preparing logistical and fire support to enable a successful assault on Raqqa , the    capital of ISIS , " said Col . John L. Dorrian , a spokesman for the    command that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ."The exact numbers and locations of these forces are sensitive in order to protect our forces , but there will be approximately an additional 400 enabling forces deployed for a temporary period to enable our Syrian partnered forces to defeat ISIS in Raqqa , " Colonel Dorrian added .The military strategy that is emerging in Syria parallels the approach that the United States has taken in Mosul , Iraq , and largely reflects the assumptions that guided the planning during the Obama administration .
