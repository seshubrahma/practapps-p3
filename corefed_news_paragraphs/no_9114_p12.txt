A    buyer has to be fingerprinted , photographed , and background checked .He must pay the federal government $ 200 for a A   buyer stamp associated with the silencer —   the $ 200 is really nothing more than a federal tax —   and he must register his silencer with the Bureau of Alcohol A   buyer Tobacco , A   buyer , and Explosives .This process takes four to six months .I seem the process for acquiring one the Founding Fathers saying something about " shall not be infringed , " and a process that takes months to complete is certainly infringement .
