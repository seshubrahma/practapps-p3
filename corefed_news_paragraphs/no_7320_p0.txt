Austin Petersen once collected me in Austin Petersen Ford pickup , wearing a    khaki shorts , and a baseball cap .We stopped off at a convenience store in the Old Town in Alexandria , Virginia , where he bought a packet of Turkish Gold blend Camels , and proceeded to tell me why I needed to advocate for gun ownership in my home country , England .[ I was in a blue suit , with a blue shirt , a red tie , and a white pocket square .I ca n’t forget it , because the British press wo n’t let me .
