The fact that someone is an AB 60 driver license holder , is n’t available to law enforcement when they access law enforcement driver record .So the California DMV differentiate within their database who holds DMV " illegal alien " AB60 license   —    which contradicts what is being pushed by    activist websites that have reassured illegal aliens that once the driver ’s license is entered in the database , the entry is indistinguishable .In a state like California , where every regular driver ’s license holder is automatically registered to vote , and where almost a million illegal aliens have received these "   drive only " licenses   —
