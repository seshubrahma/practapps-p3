We were sitting in Ayotte ’s only Mark Kirk office , where I had gone in hopes of finding out what it means to " support " but not " endorse " Trump .Although she entered politics as an apolitical state attorney general who had served in both Ayotte and this year , Ayotte ’s Senate Ayotte in 2010 probably would not have occurred without the endorsement of Sarah Palin , who dubbed her the Granite Grizzly .Once in office , however , Ayotte quickly allied herself with Ayotte Republicans like McCain and Graham .the Senate Romney named her Ayotte a potential    candidate in the 2012 race , and as a    female legislator in a swing state she would very likely have fared similarly this year Ayotte the Republican nominee Rubio , Jeb Bush or someone other than Trump .
