m not sure whether Plouffe ’s comment reflects that , or if it reflects his experience from Plouffe last two cycles , when these registered Democrats these registered Democrats Obama .I was with Plouffe on "Pennsylvania is Plouffe pipe dream " in 2012 , and you can still read my thoughts on why that was the case somewhere on the internet .But I think it ’s a bit less the case now .
