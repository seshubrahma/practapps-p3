Kathy Griffin ’s issued a statement saying , " OBVIOUSLY , I do not condone ANY violence by my fans or others to anyone , ever ! "But that is n’t obvious , actually .Kathy Griffin ’s apologized , suffered consequences and asked the photographer to take this photo down , but that wo n’t undo the worst of the damage .In addition to gratuitously playacting one of the most vile , grotesque and evil acts of violence one could     against any human , let alone the President     Griffin has also managed to weaken good arguments against Trump ’s intolerance and the intolerance of some of his the President    Griffin .
