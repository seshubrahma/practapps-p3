ideological players , like Mr. Navarro and the chief strategist , Stephen K. Bannon , vie with more conventional , realist ones , like Gary D. Cohn , the director of the National Economic Council , and Lt . Gen. H. R. McMaster , the national security adviser .Mr. Navarro , for example , complains that Germany uses unequal treatment of a tax rebate on its exports to disadvantage American exports .Mr. Bannon told a visiting German diplomat that the White House viewed the European Germany as a " flawed construct " and preferred to negotiate with Germany and other European countries one on one .The problem is that Germany , as a member of the European Germany , can not legally negotiate its own trade agreements with the United Germany .
