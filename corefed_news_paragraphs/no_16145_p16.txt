American Dominique Molina ,â€¢   watching from a balcony , said the fireworks had just ended and a crowd on the beach was disbanding ."People were flooding the streets , just walking away from the show , and I heard a lot of loud noises and people were screaming and so to the west , a big moving truck was driving on the promenade , just barreling over people and hitting     running people over .
