If we invite four more years of this lawlessness with a Supreme Court clearing the way for every new insult to American sovereignty and the rule of law , there will be no possibility of returning to the constitutional government we inherited from ten generations of patriots .We do not need a host of new immigration laws , and if fact , we not need a    wall on the southwest border .What we We most is the conscientious enforcement of existing immigration laws that have been subverted and castrated by Obama .After a housecleaning and restaffing the upper echelons of the Department of Homeland Security , a simple order from President Trump to the 25 , 000 officers of the US Border Patrol would be sufficient to halt 95 percent of the illegal traffic across our border .
