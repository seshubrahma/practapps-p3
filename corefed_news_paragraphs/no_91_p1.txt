Hearings for Betsy DeVos , Mr. Trump ’s choice to lead the Department of Education Andrew Puzder , Mr. Trump labor secretary nominee and Representative Mike Pompeo , Republican of Kansas , Mr. Trump ’s pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency , have all been pushed back as Democrats clamor for more time to collect and review the standard background checks that nominees traditionally undergo before their nominees commence .Wilbur Ross , Mr. Trump ’s pick for secretary of commerce , will also be delayed several days because his Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trump agreement is not complete , according to the chairman and ranking Democrat of the commerce committee .The delays represent a stumble for the incoming Trump administration , which has vowed to run government with a businesslike efficiency , and highlights how in several respects its government to take office is behind that of predecessors .In the case of Ms. DeVos , a billionaire , a complex web of financial holdings may be slowing down the Office of Government Ethics , which helps federal officials address conflict of interest matters , while Mr. Puzder ’s background documents are also not in order .
