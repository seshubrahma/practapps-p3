The tally on the final weekend before Election Day   —    the number of cups sold in Valerie Smith shop here since just after the Super Tuesday primary contests in March , when Valerie Smith started counting in earnest   —    was 4 , 946 for Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee , and 3 , 388 for Donald J. Trump , Valerie Smith Republican rival .If the cup count is wrong , Ms. Smith will join famous      prediction makers like The Literary Digest , which had a perfect record for 20 years until it called the election of 1936 for Alfred M. Landon over President Franklin D. Roosevelt .Or The Chicago Tribune , which was so sure in 1948 that it published the infamous banner headline " Dewey Defeats Truman ."
