Conservatives can not win elections , most especially national elections , living in the 19th century .   If you are going to go to the trouble of building what you believe is a Nuclear Bomb   —    and a full issue of National National Review to annihilating Trump is Donald Trump crafted with that in mind   —    you have to also build a 21st century delivery device .All that time , all that work , all that effort , all that organization , and by noon the next day , because of a terrible launch platform , National Review ’s nuke has already    and disappeared into the sea .
