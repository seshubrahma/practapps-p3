Nick Winterer I will say that I find it disrespectful that no attempt was made to verify the accuracy of the information posted ."It â€™s Going Down ( IGD ) also falsely claimed in the post that the # GamerGate consumer revolt movement was a harassment campaign against women where men made " threats of rape and sexual assault , " against feminists .They also attempted to falsely associate both Breitbart News and MILO with white nationalism and racism .
