Like millions of Americans who are paying thousands of dollars a year for health insurance no doctors will take , I would love to be flying to Washington this week , pleading with members of Congress , spearheading    campaigns and appearing as a witness , to tell everyone about my experiences with Obamacare .[ But none of us can , because us ’re too busy working so us can afford to pay for the health care of 22 million poor , entitled or irresponsible people under Obamacare .   Just yesterday , for example , in addition to working , I had to spend an hour   —    on top of days and days last month   —    figuring out which few remaining clinics provide mammograms under my    now third Obamacare insurance plan .
