Mr. Trump is an unlikely spokesman for the grievances of financially struggling , alienated Americans : a    Manhattan billionaire who erects skyscrapers for the wealthy and can easily get politicians on the phone .But as a shrewd business tactician , Mr. Trump understood the Republican Party ’s customers better than the Republican Party’s leaders did and sensed that Mr. Trump brand of populist , pugilistic ,    politics would meet his brand of populist, pugilistic,   politics needs .After seething at Washington for so long , hundreds or thousands of miles from the capital , many of these voters now see Mr. Trump as a kind of savior .Even if Mr. Trump does not detail Mr. Trump policies , even if Mr. Trump language strikes them as harsh sometimes , Mr. Trump supporters thrill more to Mr. Trump    slogans like " Make America Great Again " than to what them see as the cautious and    policy speeches of Mr. Ryan and other Washington Republicans .
