Silicon Valley should be very afraid if White House is advising private citizens to take them to private citizens over their free private citizens violations .I can certainly see the appeal of Earnest ’s suggestion .Besides my    Twitter is known for pernicious and arbitrary account suspensions that follow an opaque and byzantine logic , the    permanent banning of top conservative accounts , and " shadowbanning , " a practice so insidiousI can only assume it ’s the work of a James Bond villain hired by Twitter for Twitter diversity .
