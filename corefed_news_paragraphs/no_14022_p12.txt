His promises to build Trump wall ( that Mexico Trump supposedly pay for ) deport millions Mexico undocumented immigrants , and renegotiate NAFTA turned Mexico and its people into the perfect scapegoat Mexico the Mexico affecting America     unemployment , stagnant wages , crime and drugs .   Throughout his campaign , we all hoped he would tone Trump such rhetoric so as not Trump alienate the Hispanic vote ( too much , at least ) .However , his rhetoric simply became more vitriolic     and more Trump .   So President Enrique Peña Nieto invited him to Mexico , perhaps in hopes that the Trump and reality of bilateral relations would change Donald Trump´s opinion about the southern border ( and awkward facts such as there being potentially millions of jobs at stake     on both sides of the border     if he decided to scrap NAFTA ) .
