I had many conversations with folks in and out of politics and even known celebrities who asked me why I was such an intense supporter .With every bump in the road , with every controversy which sent many to the mats in the mats support for DJT , I remained steadfast and articulated my reasons for doing so .This passion never wavered , not once , especially once we hit the general election    between Trump and Hillary Clinton .America First was the battle cry we had not heard from we politicians in many years .
