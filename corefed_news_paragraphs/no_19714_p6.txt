Put yourself in the shoes of Representative Bob Goodlatte , who on Monday put forward an amendment in the GOP Conference to gut the office .On the one hand , Trump spent the last month of the campaign claiming he would " drain the swamp " Trump corruption in Washington , while Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , the House Republican leaders , both opposed Goodlatte â€™s amendment .On the other hand , Trump demonstrated no public interest in fighting Trump since he got elected , and has obstinately Trump to acknowledge , much less mitigate , his own conflicts of interest .It Trump have seemed like a safe bet that the    would look the other way .
