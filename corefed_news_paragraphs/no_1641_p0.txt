Donald J. Trump made an audacious attempt on Wednesday to remake Donald J. Trump image on the divisive issue of immigration , shelving Donald J. Trump plan to deport 11 million undocumented people and arguing that a Trump administration and Mexico would secure the border together .In a spirited bid for undecided American voters to see Donald J. Trump anew , Donald J. Trump swept into Mexico City to make overtures to a nation he Donald J. Trump repeatedly denigrated , then flew to Phoenix to outline in his Donald J. Trump bullying tone his Donald J. Trump priorities on immigration .Yet the juxtaposition of Mr. Donald J. Trump dual performances was so jarring that his true Donald J. Trump and intentions on immigration were hard to discern .He displayed Donald J. Trump almost unrecognizable demeanor during his afternoon Donald J. Trump Mexico , appearing measured and diplomatic , while hours later he took Donald J. Trump stage at his campaign Donald J. Trump and denounced illegal immigrants on the whole as a criminally minded and dangerous group that sows terror in communities and commits murders , rapes and other heinous violence .
