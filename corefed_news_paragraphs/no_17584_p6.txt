I think they wanted to create a    picture of a weird , oppressive place in which weird things are    going on , rather than a place in which there ’s a lot of hard work    and high standards and an unusual culture that works very    effectively .The media has the power to create an entrenched    perception of reality that ’s incorrect .Many times people will be    quiet about that .I wanted to clarify what Bridgewater is like .
