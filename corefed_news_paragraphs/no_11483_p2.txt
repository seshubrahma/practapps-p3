House Speaker Paul Ryan , facing a primary challenge from Republican businessman Paul Nehlen , hit the campaign trail in the final day before the voters who first sent House Speaker Paul Ryan to Washington 18 years ago decide whether the voters who first sent him to Washington 18 years ago want House Speaker Paul Ryan to stay there .After more than a week of refusing to do any events in the district open to press , Ryan —   on the final day before Tuesday ’s primary with Nehlen —   decided at the last minute to hold two open press events in the Racine area .One , in Racine , happened at AE Tools —   a    Wisconsin manufacturing plant that employs hundreds locally —   where Ryan took questions from workers in a town hall format .The second event , in Pleasant Prairie , was at Ocenco , another manufacturing plant .
