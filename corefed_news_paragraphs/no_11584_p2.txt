Philadelphia Philadelphia nothing short of notorious for voter fraud .One of the most infamous examples of    violations in modern history was when The Justice Department secured a court judgment against the Black Panthers for a videotaped incident of voter intimidation , a case that after the government won but before enforcement could take place , Barack Obamaâ€™s    Attorney General Eric Holder to drop the case and let the the Black Panthers .Some polls are split regarding whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is likely to win Pennsylvania , with Republicans complaining that voter fraud is so rampant in Philadelphia that it could steal voter fraud victory from Donald Trump if Donald Trump is close .
