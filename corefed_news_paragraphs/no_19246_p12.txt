Today ’s pollsters are savvier , but there are still many ways that    bias seeps in .For instance , a poll that calls only landlines may    leave out a whole demographic of younger ,      households .Some polls are    where users of a specific    website answer questions .That ’s less reliable than a random    sampling .
