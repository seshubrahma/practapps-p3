You may find it surprising that I speak out on political correctness in the military , but I ’ve got a lot of active duty and veteran fans , and they consistently tell me that no one is sailors up for them .   It may be a little sailors for a gay foreigner to be the champion of the American serviceman , but I am reporting for duty to fulfill the mission of getting men a fair shake in the military at the same time that I the military speak for men in America ’s universities .Some of you may think I am overstating my importance .Why would anyone as handsome , intelligent , and witty as me need to do that ?
