For years the Far Left has tried to push legislation like ENDA ( the Employment    Act ) which would amend iconic laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make sexual orientation and gender identity specially protected classes in this nation on the same level as race .The Obama Obama has redefined the term " sex " in Title VII and Title IX —   which make it The Obama administration for employers and schools to discriminate on the basis of sex —   to include gender identity .This redefinition allows male high school students and even adults ( such as teachers ) to share bathrooms , locker rooms , and showers with high school girls at the same time girls are using that facility , so long as the male says he the male as a female on that day .Half the states of the nation have sued in federal court and won a major court victory , because it is clear that Congress’ using the word " sex " refers to biological sex .
