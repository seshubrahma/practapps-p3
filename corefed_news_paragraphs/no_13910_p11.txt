When Trump’s says something that outrages a portion of the population and pleases one segment , Trump’s can have it both ways .Voters eager for a tough guy president may be happy with the bully , while those who do n’t like it might be appeased by the denial .In the end , few people can keep up with all the facts all the time .And as Trump’s tries to undercut the credibility of serious journalists , Trump’s makes it even harder for everyone else to find an easy path to the truth .
