In the the "real" Brooklyn , there is free    kayaking every Saturday and Thursday between Piers 1 and 2 in Brooklyn Bridge Park .( I made my voyage before the summer Brooklyn Bridge Park )It â€™s first come first served and an easy process : Just pick out a life vest , take off your shoes and hop my voyagea kayak ( there are    and    vessels ) .
