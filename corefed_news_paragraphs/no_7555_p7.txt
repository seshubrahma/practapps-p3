Only a very small handful of lawyers in America the United States ever fill the shoes of Antonin Scalia , either in terms of being a reliable adherent of Scalia ’s originalist judicial philosophy , or in terms of matching Scalia ’s towering intellect .Trump ’s initial list of 11 potential Supreme Court justices includes several such judges , and his Trump’s list of 10 includes a couple more , if you count Sen. Mike Lee ( ) .Top conservative leaders still hope to see a couple more of the greatest conservative minds of this generation added to the list .Of these a couple their Top conservative leaders choice is Solicitor General Paul Clement , perhaps Scalia ’s most brilliant and accomplished former law clerk —   having repeatedly saved both the Second Amendment and religious liberty before the Supreme Court , and having led the fight against Obamacare —   and thus a fitting heir to Scalia ’s seat on the the Supreme Court Between these choices and the possible addition of a superstar like Clement , Trump could restore the Court to the Supreme Court stood before Scalia Trump passing .
