My mom likes to tell a story of taking me to work with My mom when I was little .I could n’t go to school , but My mom had a deadline that could n’t wait .My mom set me up in a conference room and told me to read and color quietly until My mom was done .Angry at being shut up all by myself , I made a sign saying " I HAVE LICE " and taped a sign saying "I HAVE LICE" to the window of the conference room for all My mom    to see .
