Applying for financial aid for college got a lot harder this month , in the thick of application season , but it took federal agencies nearly a week to explain what was happening .To get aid for college from federal or state governments , as well as from colleges , students and as well parents must fill out the Fafsa ( the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ) .The notoriously complicated form , which is longer than the typical 1040 tax form , collects detailed information from students and families about income , expenses and taxes .On March 3 , families logging onto the website for federal aid found that a key component of the online application had stopped functioning .
