The magic doors give the story a mythical sweep , as the refugee couple , Nadia and Saeed , escape to Mykonos , then London , then finally the Bay Area , encountering angry nationalist mobs but also benefiting from the unexpected generosity of strangers .Mr. Chabon said that the surreal elements of the novel allowed Mr. Hamid to write about the refugee experience in ways that " few writers would have the courage or chutzpah to get to ." "What makes this book special is that it takes on a subject that a lot of readers are going to wish they could avert a lot of readers eyes from a lot of readers " he said .
