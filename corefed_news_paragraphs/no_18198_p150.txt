I was falling asleep three times one day , and every time when the multitask workers , the assistants of the line manager , would walk out and would spot me sleeping , they would say , " No , no , no , " and wake me up .The third time he caught me sleeping , he said , " You , stand up ."the multitask workers, the assistants of the line manager so I was standing next to the assembly line , not even allowed to sit.
