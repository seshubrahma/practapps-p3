Somehow none of that ever really gets cut , even though virtually every Democrat and Republican declares himself dedicated to slashing waste , fraud , and abuse at the first opportunity , year after year .Cruz maintained that unlike Trump , he has a detailed plan for Cruz what he wants to cut , saving Cruz 500 billion over 10 years .
