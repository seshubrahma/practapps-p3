There is no getting around the fact that the practice of Islam as defined by the faithâ€™s authorities (e. g.    University , the clerical leaders of Saudi Arabia , the mullahs of Iran , etc . ) is hateful towards those like us , who believe that our government should be defined by a    Constitution , not by the dictates of a deity like Allah codified in a doctrine like sharia .
