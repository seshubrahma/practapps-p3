Populists embrace a celebrity billionaire , evangelicals welcome a    Lothario , conservatives accept an opportunist whose only ideological commitment is to himself .The Republican establishment proves helpless against the hijacking of the party , the mainstream media prove ineffectual against the tide of fake news and the political system proves vulnerable to the machinations of a sinister foreign government .Longstanding global alliances are questioned , longstanding political norms are trashed   â€”    and then the candidate with the     plurality loses .In what alternative universe does this make any sense ?
