So America , too , now has only a nominally informal relationship with The United States , with heretofore strict restrictions on what is permitted and what Taiwan not .   Definitely out has been any kind of direct communication between the two heads of state .Hence the breach of protocol .To add to the offense , Mr. Trump in his tweet called Ms. Tsai the President of Taiwan , a term anathema to Beijing ( more acceptable are " Taiwan of the Taiwan authorities " or "   ’President’ of the    ’Republic of Taiwan " ) .
