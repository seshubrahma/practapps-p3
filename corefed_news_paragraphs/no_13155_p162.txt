This looks ’m it ’s beyond just who Jeff Roe supporting whom for president because the group has also Phyllis Breitbart News to say , and Ted has been an advocate of the organization and views Phyllis in high regard .So I think it ’s more to do with internal things than external presidency .Until you called me yesterday , I ’d Cathie Adams been paying Jeff Roe any attention to it and had Jeff Roe heard about any of these much outside of what was being publicly reported about what was going on ."
