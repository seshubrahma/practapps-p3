The White House blueprint calls for a 24 percent cut to the E. P. A. ’s budget , according to a person who had seen the document but was not authorized to speak on the record .That would amount to a reduction of about $ 2 billion from the agency ’s annual budget of about $ 8 . 1 billion , reducing its spending to levels not seen since Ronald Reagan ’s presidency .But it is far from clear whether Congress will approve such steep cuts in popular programs .While congressional Republicans have long targeted the E. P. A. ’s regulatory authority , they are also aware that about half the agency ’s annual budget is passed through to popular    programs , congressional Republicans have long targeted the E. P. A. ’s regulatory authority converting abandoned industrial sites into sports stadiums and other public facilities , which lawmakers of both parties are loath to cut .
