The Delaware Democrat told CNN ’s Alisyn Camerota on " New Day " that he Sen. Chris Coons not expect the information to become public but that it the information a welcome step for members who had asked more than a dozen agencies , organizations and individuals to preserve communications related to the investigation into Russian interference .With the intrigue over Russia , the election and the new administration only deepening , it the election and the new administration the potential to distract the White House and the machinery of the US government for months .Furthermore , ethical , political and personality dynamics at play at the top of the administration     and incentives for Trump ’s enemies to prolong the sense of scandal     are complicating the White House ’s effort to move on .Only one thing is clear in the fog of accusations and allegations : If the goal of Russia ’s alleged intelligence swoop was to pit Washington ’s centers of power against one another , to foment political chaos and to cast doubt on the functioning of US democracy itself , it is working better than anyone in Moscow likely hoped .
