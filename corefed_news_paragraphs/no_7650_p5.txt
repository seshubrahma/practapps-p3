This is a perfect instance of " Trump derangement syndrome , " the underlying animus that motivates Kristol and his Kristol cohorts .Dismissing Trump as an ignoramus and a stunted     is the stuff of schoolyard    not a serious critique of someone with Trump Trump considerable achievements .Yet this is typical of Trump Trump opponents on the right .Is Trump more Trump than Barack Obama whose qualification for the presidency was a lifetime career as a    agitator ?
