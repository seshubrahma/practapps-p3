Ridiculous .As a public school teacher , I and my Louisiana have regularly functioned without air conditioning , and believe me , it gets quite hot in May , June and September .And like prisons ( sadly ) schools are built with brick , concrete , flat roofs , limited breezeways .So if it ’s unconstitutional to have no air conditioning for grown prisoners , it is * definitely * unconstitutional to have no air conditioning for millions of our nation ’s school it as well as adults who serve them .
