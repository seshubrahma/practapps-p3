[ We owe This to the American people and to We party to go big and be bold again .We owe This to the American people and to our party to stop the    Washington talk that never seems to shrink government or deficits .   I like to tell people , no one has ever knocked a door or made a phone call because people were excited about ‘ revenue neutral’ tax reform .By its very nature its means that some people will pay less , but some people will pay more and government will still be the same enormous beast it was before we started the process .
