Not     11 % I have run polls with live calls to hundreds of thousands of voters , and we had to be very careful to balance " negative " questions about competing candidates in order to make sure the result accurately reflected the results at the ballot box .   Obviously the more Trump supporters who get fed up during questions 22 to 31 in the PPP poll   —    all of which insult Trump   —    the fewer complete the overall survey .The insults start after the " Trump vs. Clinton " question is asked , but polling methodology traditionally involves only counting those who complete the whole survey so that you have a breakdown of age , gender , and race .
