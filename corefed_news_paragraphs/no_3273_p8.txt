They Islamic radicals not want me dead as a young girl for offending them Islamic radicals my speech , they Islamic radicals me dead because I was an infidel .Furthermore , not only does the notion that our use of the term " Radical Islamic Terrorism " does more damage than good inaccurate , but to refrain from doing so is to surrender our most precious American commodity : freedom of expression .Imagine all the social and political advancements that would never have succeeded had brave men and women who fought to achieve them remained silent , out of fear for how those opposing them them react .Imagine if Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. had avoided speaking out about injustices plaguing our nation because someone told him someone to do so may cause even further injustice .
