On the campaign trail , Trump railed against Muslims and Mexicans , promised a harsh stance on Iran and ISIS , and portrayed voter fraud by ethnic minorities as a big problem .So it should not come as a surprise that he picked Steve Bannon ,a    of the racist sewer that goes by the name of Breitbart , as chief White House strategist Mike Flynn , a man who is impatient for global war with Islam , as national security adviser and Jeff Sessions , a man who tried   as Alabama â€™s attorney general to convict civil rights leaders who were registering black voters on charges of voter fraud ( civil rights leaders who were registering black voters on charges of voter fraud were acquitted and the presiding judge threw out more than half the charges for lack of evidence ) .At the same time , Trump also promised to " drain the swamp , " making the Republican Party the champion of ordinary working people rather than Wall Street or corporate special interests .
