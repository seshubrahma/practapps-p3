Within an unusual town , the scientific community that I became part of in my 20s is even more rarefied .And within that scientific community , the small group of international theoretical physicists with whom I have spent my working life might sometimes be tempted to regard themselves the small group of international theoretical physicists with whom I have spent my working life the pinnacle .In addition to this , with the celebrity that has come with my books , and the isolation imposed by my illness , I feel as though my ivory tower is getting taller .So the recent apparent rejection of the elites in both America and Britain is surely aimed at me , as much as anyone .
