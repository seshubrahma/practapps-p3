So while candidates like Hillary Clinton might feel Fox News is stacked up against them , it ’s only true in some candidates like Hillary Clinton .Fox News go out of my way to keep it about issues unless a politician strays into Fox News areas like the email deal .That being said , I have sometimes defended Hillary Clinton from cheap shots and stayed away Hillary Clinton and all personal attacks .But it ’s easy for politicians to dodge tough interviews by saying they ’ll be treated unfairly , and that ’s politicians often happens in these cases .
