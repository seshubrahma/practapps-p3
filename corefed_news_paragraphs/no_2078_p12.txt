M. Taylor Fravel , an associate professor of political science at M. I. T. who studies China â€™s territorial disputes and has written on the South China Sea , called the seizure of the drone " a big deal , as it represents the deliberate theft of the South China Sea and a clear violation " of maritime law ."By stealing a drone versus threatening the drone "a big deal safety of the ship , China may be trying to find a way to signal its opposition to U. S. activities without creating a larger incident , " Mr. Fravel said China " Nevertheless , it will be viewed by the China S. as a clear challenge ."
