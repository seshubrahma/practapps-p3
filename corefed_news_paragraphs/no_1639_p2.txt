Another way to see what is being called the Trump Tax is to look at polling ’s generic ballot question : It asks the Trump Tax whether they would people for the Democrat or the Republican , with no declaration of the identity of those people .This survey question often gets a different response than a question about specific candidates   —    especially if the candidates are not yet known .That ’s because respondents are typically thinking of their favorite respondents as the winner of the nomination , regardless of what the likely outcome of the nomination process will be .In the winter and spring of 2016 , Republicans who were fans of Ted Cruz or John Kasich might have conjured up thoughts of a general election in November with Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich on the ballot   —    not one in which Mr. Trump was the nominee .
