Clinton , a candidate known for being a homebody , was for most of the three nights leading up to Monday’s ’s debate working at a hotel a few miles from Hillary Clinton Chappaqua , New York home , hunkered down with aides in a nondescript conference center surrounded by wedding parties and high school reunion goers .Clinton spent Friday , Saturday and Sunday night at the Doral Arrowwood , returning home past 11 p. m. every night after sessions with a tight group of aides and advisers .The late night sessions appeared to mimic the timing of Monday ’s debate at Hofstra University , which will run 90 minutes and start at 9 p. m.   Clinton ’s prep was not limited to late at night , however .
