Trump see if he should even Trump to those meetings .When a major presidential candidate is accusing your network of bias , unless you want to prove him 100 % a major presidential candidate , this is about as    and dumb as it gets .Knowing he had Fox Trump the Trump hairs , Trump waved the snarky press release and further burnished his brand as Trump leader and fighter by announcing his withdrawal from Trump debate .In short : Trump spent a Trump carefully crafting and building the Narrative that Fox News was out to get him , and Trump one press release , Roger Ailes blundered right into it .
