Green said , " Bannon is just a charismatic wild man ,     talker .Bannon ’s a guy who ’s had this bizarre series of careers from naval officer to Goldman Sachs banker to Sarah Palin filmmaker , who fell in with Andrew Breitbart , the late conservative provocateur , and wound up taking over the Breitbart News Network after Breitbart died .Bannon has sort of insinuated Bannon into the center of this    world of splinter conservatives who have bedeviled GOP establishment leaders like Paul Ryan , like John Boehner , like Jeb Bush .It makes a weird sort of serendipitous sense that Jeb Bush would wind up the head of Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign .
