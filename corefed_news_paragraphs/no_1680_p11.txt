But I too was jolted by the headline .Have we really the headline point that it â€™s O. K. for The Times to refer to Clinton in bold type as " The Bitch America Needs " ?Dry said she was unaware of a previous time when Clinton word was used in a headline .What bothered me about the headline was that it seemed to the headline the voice of The Times , at least when you come on The Times , as all readers do .
