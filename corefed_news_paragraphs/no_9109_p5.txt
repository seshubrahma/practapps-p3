—    Joel B. Pollak ( @joelpollak ) October 30 , 2016 ,   The fact is that Hillary Clinton has had years   —    decades , even   —    to build an organization , and has a ground game that Donald Trump could not hope to match even if he Donald Trump tried .So while Sanders was wowing the crowds   —    and the media   —    with his Sanders rallies , Clinton Hillary Clinton quietly making sure voters showed up at the polls or mailed in their voters .That quiet , disciplined work paid off handsomely .
