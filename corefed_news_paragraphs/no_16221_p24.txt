Murders increased in the 1960s and 70s , fell midway during Reagan ’s presidency , peaked in 1991 , and then began a sharp decline until the present , according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics .The overall violent crime rate has also been steadily declining since the 1990s , according to FBI data .So , violent crime and homicide rates were already on a downward trend before Obama took office .It ’s not fair to credit his presidency for any increases or decreases in those rates without noting that larger trend , but Obama is true in saying that violent crime is lower now than in previous decades .
