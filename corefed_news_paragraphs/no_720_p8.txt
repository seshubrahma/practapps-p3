What I think people saw was an emotionally needy Ann Coulter wannabe , trying to make Milo off of the left ’s propensity for outrage .And by the end of the weekend , by dinnertime Monday , he ’s dropped as a speaker at CPAC .Then he ’s dropped by Breitbart , and his book deal falls Milo .As I say , sunlight is the best Milo .
