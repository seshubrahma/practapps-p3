Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, the Democratic challenger to Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who has opposed the legislation that bears Mr. Toomeyâ€™s name are locked in one of the tightest Senate races in the country .The split illustrates a new dimension in the gun control debate in Senate races after the Senate largely went underground over the past decade as candidates tried to avoid talking about it .Emboldened by the issue horrified reaction to recent mass shootings and growing support among suburban voters for modest gun control steps , groups that back new laws are inserting themselves into the 2016 groups that back new laws , with party politics at times taking a rare back seat .
