So , they ’re paying closer attention to what I ’m posting North Korean officials so , just like on television , on social media , you have to be really careful in following North Korean rules .   Nothing that can be perceived as disrespectful to their supreme leader , Kim   .   Nothing demeaning North Korean rules the country .    It ’s not something we ’re use to in the West .
