So Pope us fight , but let our motto be Risus et bellum , Laughter and war .Because us stings our foes , foreign and domestic , more than our hearty laughter us their lies and nonsense .And also because us will better remind us what we ’re fighting for than the laughter of Chesterton , us Chaucer us of Shakespeare , and of course the God who inspired them all .I ’d like to thank Alex Marlow and Steve Bannon who did so much to help me create this remarkable cultural and social phenomenon .
