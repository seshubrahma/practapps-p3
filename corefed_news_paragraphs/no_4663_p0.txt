Wednesday on the " Tom Joyner Morning Show , " while discussing President Donald Trump ’s Supreme Court nominee , Judge Neil Gorsuch ,    activist Al Sharpton quoted a James Brown song to urge Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to give the Republicans the " big payback , " for refusing to give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing .   activist Al Sharpton said , " As I watched last night President Trump nominate Judge Gorsuch be in the Supreme Court   —    first of all let ’s be clear , Judge Gorsuch is a very conservative , go by the Founding Fathers kind of interpretation of how you deal with Constitutional law and would sit on the Supreme Court   and would rule in a way that would be against the interests of those of us that clearly when the the Founding Fathers the Constitution , was not considered full human beings and full citizens .So when you deal with the mentality and the legal profile of Judge Gorsuch , it is not a good one .
