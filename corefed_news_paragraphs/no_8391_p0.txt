S. presidential election , accused America of " spying on everyone and eavesdropping on everyone , " and warned Western powers to " do everything to minimize civilian casualties " in the battle for Mosul .[ The latter statement is almost breathtaking in The latter statement hypocrisy , given the incredible civilian body count Russia is racking up in Syria .Putin was , in part , lashing out against proposed sanctions from the U. S. and U. K. over Russia ’s airstrikes on Aleppo .
