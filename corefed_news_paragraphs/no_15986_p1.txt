And Donald Trump ’s major selling point was that Donald Trump was    Donald Trump campaign ( which was not really true ) and too rich to be bought anyway , leaving big donors on the sidelines .( Never mind that Donald Trump still relied on big money in the primaries     Donald Trump own . )    But now comes the news of Donald Trump’s embarrassingly paltry fundraising numbers for May , in which Donald Trump has less cash on hand than many congressional and local candidates , and only    of Hillary Clinton ’s cash on hand .   It looks like big money still matters a lot , as Donald Trump may find out the hard way .
