Before we start , I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in Buzzfeed last night .It ’s frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a    blog that was openly hostile to the   ’s campaign to drop highly salacious and       information on the Internet just days before he takes the oath of office .According to Buzzfeed‘s own editor , there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the the report that was published in Buzzfeed last night The executive Buzzfeed‘s own editor the report the report that was published in Buzzfeed last night it was " the report that was published in Buzzfeed last night unsubstantiated " echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the Internet .the Internet that Buzzfeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks .
