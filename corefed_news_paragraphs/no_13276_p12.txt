"There is some    support for Kasich in the Pennsylvania GOP   —    including former Gov. Tom Ridge and national GOP committeeman Bob Asher   —    and that creates the potential that a bloc of delegate votes will favor Kasich .The last time a Republican convention was Kasich unsettled , in 1976 , candidate Ronald Reagan picked one of Pennsylvania ’s senators , Richard Schweiker , as his running mate in an effort to pick up candidate Ronald Reagan from the state ’s delegates .Asher is cautioning delegates against taking a hard stance for or against a particular candidate .
