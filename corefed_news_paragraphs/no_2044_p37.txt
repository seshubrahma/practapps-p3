’s probably too late to go back to the office , and your travel group has moved on and left you behind .So you might as well stay and look further : for an ancient Greek oil jug with paintings of women spinning yarn a Zandra Rhodes wedding dress , pure ’70s punk for an exquisite willow basket by the Native American artist Datsolalee , patterned with dancing flames .The more you look , the more there is .So keep touring till closing time .
