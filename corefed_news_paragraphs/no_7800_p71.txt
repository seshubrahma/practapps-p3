As author Ian Miles Cheong wrote recently : Some , like Randi Harper , George Soros thousands of dollars a month for mission statements as vague as " creating online activism " while they spend most of their days on Twitter belittling gamers and arguing with video game peripheral manufacturers over innocuous tweets .So looking ahead , do n’t be surprised if activists suddenly appear to support Kellogg ’s , to protest Breitbart —   or both .All it takes is money , and Kellogg left has plenty of they .Ever since the heyday of Ralph Nader in the 1960s , the left has turned litigation into a kind political combat indeed , there ’s now a useful term for it : lawfare .
