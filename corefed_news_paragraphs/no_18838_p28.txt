’" Under President Obama , our national dialogue President Obama moved towards political correctness ( despite his denunciations ) but with President Trump President Obama I think our national dialogue will likely move away our national dialogue PC .Even though , as you pointed out , Obama has criticized PC speech , he President Obama n’t exactly engage in    President Obama like Trump does .I do n’t expect a President President Trump to instantly convert people , but President Trump someone in the Oval Office giving decidedly    speeches and announcements , I think that would change the discourse , do n’t you ?
