When I met Petersen in downtown Washington , D. C. this week , he was the politico , and I was the sloppy journalist .he ruddy grey suit , crisp white shirt , and blue tie all said : " That me [ in cargo shorts ] was me when I was nâ€™t [ running for office ] ."In fact that is what he literally said as I quizzed he on he sharp new look at the famous Old Ebbitt Grill just a few minutes walk from the same White House that Petersen wants to occupy in 2017 .
