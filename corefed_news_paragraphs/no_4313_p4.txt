Musk is the 87th richest man in the world and someone worth admiring for his financial Musk that have created thousands of jobs .However , I am not supportive of tax policies like the ITC that put more money in the pockets of billionaires .Another government incentive that Elon Musk Musk is the Zero Emissions Vehicle ( ZEV ) tax credit .This policy allows people who purchase    in vehicles to deduct $ 7 , 500 from their federal taxes .
