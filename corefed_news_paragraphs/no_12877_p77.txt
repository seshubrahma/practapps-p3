We can say , with admiration , that Silicon Valley is the latest Manchester as such , it ’s a powerful magnet for the best and the brightest from overseas , and from a purely     point of view , there ’s a lot to be said for welcoming them .So yes , it would be nice if we could retain this international mobility that benefits the U. S. —   but only if the economic benefits can be broadly shared , and Silicon Valley of immigrants can be truly achieved , such Silicon Valley all Americans can feel good about welcoming newcomers .The further enrichment of Silicon Valley wo n’t do much good for the country unless those riches are somehow widely shared .   In fact , amidst the ongoing outsourcing of    jobs , total employment in such boomtowns as San Francisco and San Jose has barely budged .
