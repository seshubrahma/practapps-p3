It ’s not quite as simple or dramatic as the populist appeal of tariffs and the federal government taxation against outsourcing , offshoring , and corporate inversion , but the working man and woman would be    to listen to what Cruz is suggesting .A level playing field achieved by getting the boot of Cruz , incompetent Big Government off the necks of Big Government is vastly preferable to giving the government more boots to stomp on foreign competitors with , until everyone is equally handicapped   …      and the Ruling Class is rich and powerful beyond the dreams of ancient kings , because no one can invest a dollar without paying them five dollars in graft .Our current political culture would think nothing of doubling the size of the tax code   …      but would scream like banshees at the notion of cutting it in half .There are a lot of powerful political and private interests who do n’t want that system simplified .
