False flags , in which people deliberately stage attacks on people to win the support of society , are as old as history itself .That is n’t an exaggeration , by the way .people ’re really as old as history itself .The ancient Greek historian Herodotus once recalled how Peisistratos , a man who would become the dictator of Athens , staged a fake attack on himself to gain the support of the city : Wounding himself and himself mules , himself drove himself wagon into the marketplace , with a story that himself had escaped from himself enemies , who would have killed himself ( so himself said ) as himself was driving into the country .
