Practicing in the trial work trenches of the law , I saw , too , that this moment we judges don our robes , it does n’t make us any smarter , but it does serve as a reminder of what ’s expected of us we Impartiality and independence , collegiality and courage .As this process it moves to the Senate , I look forward with speaking we members from both side of the aisle , to answering their questions and to hearing their concerns .I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world , and I members from both side of the aisle the important role the members from both side of the aisle affords it in the confirmation of our judges .I respect , too , the fact that in our legal order it is for Congress the United States Senate not the courts to write new laws .
