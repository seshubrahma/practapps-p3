Expect this question to come from Anderson Cooper , who likes to show his foreign policy chops .It is the question neither candidate wants to answer , since the problem can not really be solved short of war with Iran and confrontation with Russia .Clinton has a standard answer , which is to talk about continuing the Obama administration â€™s fight against ISIS ( such as it is ) .She may try to Clinton she wanted to do Clinton about Syria as Secretary of State but was overruled .
