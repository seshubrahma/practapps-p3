As an instrument for that integration , the EU is hardly ideal .It can be frustratingly bureaucratic and obtuse , relative calm like other institutions , it is often reactive rather than strategic .But those criticisms should not distract from its underlying purpose : to force the nations of the EU to address their differences through negotiation and engagement rather than open conflict the EULeaving the EU would be a massive step backwards from that overriding goal .
