The Savion Glover I started dancing in the first place was my dad took me to see " Bring In ’da Noise , Bring In ’da Funk" when I was 9 .I was so enamored with his style and his Savion Glover and the Savion Glover of his tap choreography that Savion Glover started training .Is the tap the reason you cast yourself in the dance ?
