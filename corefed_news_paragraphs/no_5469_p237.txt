American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream .Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect .And streets where mothers are safe from fear America our Nation where children America in peace   —    and jobs where Americans prosper and grow   —    are not too much to ask .When we have all builders and artists and inventors this , we will have made Alexander Graham Bell greater than ever before .
