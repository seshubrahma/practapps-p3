Speaking of his love and appreciation for first lady Michelle Obama , President Obama was moved to tears .   And , surprised by President Obama decision to award him the President Obama Medal of Freedom , Vice President Joe Biden cried , too .Might it be that we are finally , blessedly , moving beyond a world in which " big boys do nâ€™t cry " ?To be sure , there are resisters and naysayers .
