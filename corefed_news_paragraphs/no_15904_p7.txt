While I love KU basketball and our head coach , the fact that he paid no KU tax on $ 2 .75 million in compensation shows he is as KU with his taxes as KU is on KU sidelines , but that is n’t fair to Kansas families scraping to get by .Putting more money into the pockets of those who need it the least more money n’t create jobs .It just weakens more money fundamentals that keep our economy and communities strong .
