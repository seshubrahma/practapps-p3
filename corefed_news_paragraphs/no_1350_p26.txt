It is this disconnect that haunts Obama .Obama has Obama by his own Obama , managed the recovery as well as any president ever could , with results that in many cases exceeded his own Obama hopes .But despite the gains of the past seven years , many Americans have been left behind .Something has changed , and as he prepares Obama leave office , Obama seems Obama understand that his economic Obama might be judged not just by what he has Obama , but by how the results compare to a bygone era of    opportunity , one that perhaps no president , faced with the sweeping changes transforming the global economy , could ever bring back .
