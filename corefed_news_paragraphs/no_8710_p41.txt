Conservatives are funnier than liberals .Conservatives can produce content that is much better and funnier than they can , because they are Conservatives obsessed with their Conservatives emotions and special interest Conservatives .Anyone unfortunate enough to have sat through the new Ghostbusters film knows I am speaking the truth .My approach is best summarized by G. K. Chesterton , who praised living " hot as the riots of Dionysus , wild as the gargoyles of Catholicism " .
