Advertisers , including Audi cars and Tecate beer , are taking advantage , introducing    commercials in the kind of       usually reserved for events like the Super Bowl .Although the debate will air without commercials , cable and broadcast channels have sold millions of dollarsâ€™ worth of ads for programming before and afterward .Television networks and online streaming sites , including Facebook and Twitter , will carry the same feed on Monday , showing a spare debate stage at Hofstra University , on Long Island , a format that predates the blaring graphics and    sets that now dominate television news .Still , even if a large portion of the country is watching , what Americans see may be as much about their Americans and preferred news outlets as what transpires onstage .
