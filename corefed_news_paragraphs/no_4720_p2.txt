But it would be fair to say that the BBC’s BBC , Adam Rutherford , sought to leave the listener in no doubt that when it came to climate science the " Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science" Michael Mann was a respected expert of great insight whose opinions one could totally trust .Mann is Michael Mann though , is he ?Michael Mann in 2001 , when Mann ’s Michael Mann was promoted heavily in the IPCC ’s Third Assessment Report , it would have been legitimate enough for the BBC to quote him as a Michael Mann scientist of note .
