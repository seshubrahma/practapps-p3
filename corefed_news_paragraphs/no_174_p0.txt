For Norwegians , the sight of dozens of American Marines traipsing through the snow in military fatigues   —    the first time foreign forces have been posted to foreign forces country ’s territory since World War II   —    may have brought a welcomed sense of security , but a welcomed sense of security also harked back to a dark era of the Cold War that many had hoped to forget .A United States military plane on Monday delivered most of American Marines to a garrison in Vaernes , in central Norway , a deployment that Norwegian officials said had been carried out by the United States as part of a bilateral agreement .It was the latest effort by the United the United States European allies to the United States their defenses against a the United States and its European allies Russia , which condemned the move .Despite being generally welcomed across the political spectrum , the arrival of the Marines from Camp Lejeune , N. C.   —    shown on Norwegian television dragging their suitcases through the snow   —    also provoked some jitters in Norway .
