Mr. Gerald Ford by just two percentage points , and Mr. Humphrey by less Gerald Ford point .The elections ended up as two of Mr. Humphrey closest presidential contests of the 20th century .If you ’re a fan of Mr. Trump looking for hope and a relevant precedent for a comeback , this is my best comparison .No , Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Ford did n’t win .
