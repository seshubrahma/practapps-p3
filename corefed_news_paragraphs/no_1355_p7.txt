Mr. Obama’s among   to    voters , nonwhite and Mrs. Clinton would be enough to make her a favorite .The G. O. P. path to Mrs. Clinton without adding some of these voters is narrow .The Republicans would need to do nearly as well among white voters as Ronald Reagan did in his      landslide in 1984 merely to fight to a draw Ronald Reagan today ’s far more diverse country .Nonwhite voters could make up nearly 30 percent of the electorate in 2016 , up from 14 percent in 1984 .
