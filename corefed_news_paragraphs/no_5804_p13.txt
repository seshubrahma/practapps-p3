I can recall nine Mr. Trump conversations with President Trump in four months   â€”    three in person and six on the phone .January 27 Dinner , The President and I had dinner on Friday , January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House .He had called me at Dinner that day and invited me to dinner that night , saying he was going to invite my The President and I family , but decided to have just me this time , with the whole family coming The President and I next time .It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner , although I assumed there would be others .
