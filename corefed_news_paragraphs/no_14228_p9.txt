Identifying Washington with Putin ’s the United States for Putin policies of the Assad regime will only further blacken America ’s name , create the United States jihadi recruits , alienate Sunni Arab regimes , and identify America with the    alliance of the United States , Assad and Hezbollah .   In Assad , in view of recent Russian hacking , there is good reason to worry about sharing intelligence with the Russians .With all this in mind , it is not at all clear that the military benefits of    cooperation are worth these downsides .Clearly , Putin will seek to dangle Russian cooperation against ISIS in front Russian Trump in hopes of getting Washington to ease sanctions .
