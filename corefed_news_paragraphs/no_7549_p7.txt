Interesting speech for a comedian who once said that Bernie Sanders was a candidate who was " not for sale ."The whole thing was enough to make one silently cheer for Bernie Sanders holdout Susan Sarandon , who was spotted holding up an    sign on the convention floor and who vowed earlier in the day that the Bernie " army " would march on .But while the first day of the convention was amusing , the second day was practically insufferable .
