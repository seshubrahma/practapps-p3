â€”    Cassandra Fairbanks ( @CassandraRules )July 29 , 2016 ,   The demonstrations continued until about 1:30 in the morning , with groups marching back and forth between the fenced area outside the Wells Fargo Center and to a nearby park .Given the recent information revealed by the WikiLeaks dump of internal emails showing how the Democratic National Committee conspired against Bernie Sanders , the leftist activists actually had a legitimate grievance in this case .
