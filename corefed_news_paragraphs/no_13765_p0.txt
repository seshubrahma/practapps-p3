In the course of making my film The Bloody Road to Cleveland about the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement , I have been teargassed in Seattle , assaulted in Denver , kicked out of the Board of Supervisors meeting in San Francisco , and , as Breitbart News reported this weekend , arrested in Baton Rouge .This is my story of that arrest .[ When I cover protests , especially shooting footage for my film The Bloody Road to Cleveland , I do nâ€™t do it my film The Bloody Road to Cleveland a distance .I want to be where the action is , but I always balance this with obeying place orders .
