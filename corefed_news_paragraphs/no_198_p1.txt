I ’m afraid the election is going to be rigged , I have to be honest , " the Republican nominee told a    crowd in Columbus , Ohio .the Republican nominee was hearing " more and more " about evidence of rigging , the Republican nominee added , leaving the details to the Republican nominee supporters’ imagination .A few weeks later , Mr. Harris , sat down at the kitchen table in the Republican nominee apartment to fill in the details Mr. Trump had left out .In a dubious art just coming into its prime , this bogus story would be his masterpiece .
