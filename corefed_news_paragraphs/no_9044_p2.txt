I respect a lot of conservatives are still skeptical about Donald Trump as the Republican nominee skepticism when it is attached to reasonable arguments , since no candidate is perfect and no one can know the future .I am put in mind of the wit who said that Republicans are always looking for the perfect candidate while Democrats are looking for the perfect lie .But the primaries are over and Donald Trump as the Republican nominee is now the the Republican nominee That means he Donald Trump as the Republican nominee the only obstacle to the party of Obama and Hillary and Huma Abedin , of the Iran deal and the appeasement of Islamic    beginning with the Hamas terrorists of Gaza and the Fatah terrorists of the West Bank .In mounting a    run which would split the Republican vote and elect Hillary , Bill Kristol seems to be forgetting that the Iranians and their    Iranians are openly preparing a second Holocaust in the Middle East ( and then for the rest of us ) .
