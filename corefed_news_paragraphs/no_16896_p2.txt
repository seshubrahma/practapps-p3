I â€™msaying a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women , " First lady Michelle Obama said .   The speech was an uncharacteristically direct attack from the first lady , who said she eschewed she " normal campaign speech " because The speech would have been " dishonest and disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream ."
