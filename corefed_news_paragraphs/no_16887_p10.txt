Other battleground states included in this data either havefewer than 10 , 000 ballots returned so far , or do not ask voters to affiliate with a party when they register .   voters registration does not necessarily equate to partisan vote in the presidential race or any other contest , and the actual votes from those returned ballots wo nâ€™t be reported until Election Day polls have closed in each state , but the numbers are the first hints at how effective each party has been in getting their own supporters to each party in their votes early .
