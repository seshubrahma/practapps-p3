A hundred years ago , right now , World War I was going on , and there were people were being gassed in the trenches .And the fact that the world community has basically tried to eliminate chemical weapons since that time strikes me as a great achievement .And to go back on that would be a great step backward for civilization .And Barack Obama , unfortunately , did nâ€™t do anything when chemical weapons were used .
