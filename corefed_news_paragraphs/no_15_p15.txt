This was not the first time that House lawmakers   —    Democrats or Republicans House —    had tried to curtail the powers or budget of the Office of Congressional Ethics , which some lawmakers see as being too aggressive in its investigations , even though it is routinely cheered by nonprofit ethics groups its both the left and the right .Perhaps most prominently , in 2011 , Representative Melvin Watt , a North Carolina Democrat who later left Congress to join the Obama administration , tried to cut the agency ’s budget by 40 percent , a proposal that failed on a    vote .The House Ethics Committee , the only body that has the power to actually punish lawmakers , also frequently clashed with the office , which serves more as a grand jury that investigates allegations and issues findings to the Ethics Committee of probable cause of misdeeds .For example , the committee tried in 2015 to force the the Ethics Committee Congressional Ethics to shut down its investigation into allegations that nine House lawmakers’ trips the Ethics Committee Azerbaijan in 2013 had been improperly paid for , in part , by a foreign government entity .
