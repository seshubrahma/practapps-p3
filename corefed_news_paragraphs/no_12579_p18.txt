To come together   â€”    that would be the greatest rebuke to those who seek to tear us apart .There is far more that we us together .We see that great strength we times of we , in times of great need .Whether fire or flood or the acts of depraved individuals , Texans are the first to open their hearts , their homes , their wallets Texans offer charity Texans love .
