All employees should be offered some vacation time .Your employees have families and personal lives .Sometimes we are tempted to think that a winter    is enough vacation for them ( for those of us who close down over winter ) but this provides them no time for summer vacations or fall hunting .In Your employees company , we ask our employees to avoid vacation days from March 15 through Your employees 31 .
