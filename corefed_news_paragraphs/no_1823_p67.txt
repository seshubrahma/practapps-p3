$ 50 to $ 150 per night .The New York Moore hostel , in a     Williamsburg loft , offers    and    dorm rooms , as well as    private rooms with baths .Most visitors can expect to pay $ 40 to $ 60 per night , but pricing is annoyingly dynamic depending on demand ( the highest rate I    seen was $ 104 , lowest    $ 33 ) .Traditional hotels are n’t really Brooklyn ’s strong suit , but I had a decent experience at the Red Lion Inn   Suites , close to Boerum Hill in Gowanus .
