Hillary Clinton has worked for the black vote Hillary Colin Kaepernick , I want to tell you something : I am a black man who lives in a black and predominately immigrant neighborhood .I , my friends , my family and my neighbors can not afford a Trump presidency .Our very being would be at risk     on issues from health care to immigration , to the right to marry to the makeup of the Supreme Court and all that would portend .Although Kaepernick is a person of color and has experienced Colin Kaepernick , he sits in a space of economic privilege     Colin Kaepernick man who signed a multimillion dollar contract in 2014 .
