Again , Trump ’s gains are across Trump , but he ’s doing much better with Trump group of voters that seems less likely to vote .He could certainly win Iowa by Trump    margin , but that depends on his people turning out   — Trump and on his having an operation to encourage Trump to do so ( which his people New York Timesreports he does n’t ) .In Trump words , if the election were held tomorrow , the actual results would probably be somewhere in between these two polls , with Trump not doing as well against Cruz as it may appear .
