But voter fraud , in which someone deliberately casts an invalid ballot or a ballot under someone else ’s name , is exceedingly rare .Its prevalence is at the heart of the debate on restrictions like voter ID .Critics say that cracking down on abuses that barely exist can cost hundreds of thousands of people or more   —    often the poor and minorities   —    their ability to vote .For example , a federal court in 2014 found that in Wisconsin an estimated 300 , 000 voters who had already registered did not have any of the required IDs .
