" In the Old Testament , the " cedars of Lebanon " are a recurring theme     "The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree , "The righteous man will grow like a cedar in Lebanon , " for example , is from Psalm 92:12     and , indeed , today the Lebanese national flag bears the palm tree ."So these people , the settlers , would see a forest and think : ’Those are cedar trees,’ even though the "cedars of Lebanon" did n’t Lebanon in the New World .
