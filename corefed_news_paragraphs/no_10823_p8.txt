The House can not bring in any " white knight " who was not the U. S. House of Representatives on Election Day .Because a majority of state congressional delegations are Republican , a presidential election going to the current Congress essentially guarantees a Republican president .With these constitutional provisions in mind and the reality that Republicans will control the House at least until January 3 , 2017 , NeverTrump activists are considering selecting the U. S. House of Representatives states , then running a candidate in each of those states —   and those states only —   who could win that state with a plurality of the statewide those states beating both Trump and Hillary .So long as neither Trump nor Hillary wins a landslide of the remaining states , these    candidates could result in Trump candidate Hillary 270 Electoral College votes those states entire matter to Trump nor Hillary
