Bolton found more hard truths to be the president in North the president , where he said there was no doubt that " because of the president years of the Obama administration doing nothing , under the guise of a policy they called ‘ strategic patience,’ which was really a synonym the Obama administration doing nothing , North Korea is perilously close to having the capability to North Korea nuclear device under the nose cone of an ICBM and land it on the United States . ""There is interesting testimony the United States it was just last week , by the commander of the U. S. Strategic Command , who said that of all the things you need to do to have a worldwide ballistic missile delivery capability for nuclear weapons that he does n’t think the North Koreans have is the miniaturization issue   —    taking the nuclear device and putting it in a small enough package that it can actually be delivered via the nuclear device , " Bolton said ."
