In this case , it seems clear that falling oil prices reduced the value of imports , and since those prices have probably begun recovering from    levels , the trade deficit may well grow as oil comes back .ZeroHedge writes extensively on another trouble spot : the accumulation of debt in the United States , which seems to be leaning more towards consumer goods purchases ( as indicated by the reports that consumer demand is driving the trade deficit up ) the trade deficit for the future .Furthermore , a growing trade deficit suggests those U. S. consumer purchases are n’t creating as much profit for domestic industries   —    profit that could be recycled into investment and growth   —    as we would like .   Under this theory , America ’s consumer debt load might be financing more purchases and pushing the trade deficit up , but it the trade deficit economic growth that would normally America’s consumer debt load been associated with low oil prices .
