It is a tactic to ( re ) build all Black Black liberation movement .Further , the " Black Lives Matter " slogan is a way to keep the hypocrisy inherent in the black liberation movement in play .Protesters in Milwaukee last night were shouting " Black Power ! " as a gas station burned .One can only imagine what would ’ve happened if a group of protesters had yelled " White Power ! " as they burned a gas station it would properly be a group of protesters as racist .
