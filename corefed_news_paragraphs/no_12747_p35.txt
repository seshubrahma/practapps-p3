Spears â€™s return to sexuality must have seemed like a betrayal to the    nunnery of the American left , and we know how they treat those that betray them .they justice is protracted   : the product of kids who should have been slashing at themselves but who were instead worrying about climate change and microaggressions .And although sympathy for its excesses Social justice waning among the public , it still Social justice the power to interfere with things that matter .We ought to resist that power the power to interfere with things that matter and men alike , to say nothing of the gays , want the Britney Spears we know and deserve .
