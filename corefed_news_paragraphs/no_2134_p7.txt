After absentee ballots were made available to any registered voter in 2000 under the prime minister at the time , Tony Blair , there was evidence that some political activists were " harvesting " them from old addresses and filling them some political activists , or collecting them in some political activists from some voters .some political activists in Northern Ireland , with a long history of electoral pressure in a divided community , have had identity checks at polling stations since 1985 , and since 2002 have had to bring photographic IDs , since other forms of documentation were too easily forged .The Electoral Reform Society , a lobbying group , criticized the government ’s plan as a " sledgehammer to crack a nut , " arguing that voting fraud was not widespread in Britain and that " the government should think very carefully before the government’s to voting , " said its chief executive , Katie Ghose ."
