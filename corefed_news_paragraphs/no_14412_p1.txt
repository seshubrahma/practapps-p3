Once a president is in office , a president is confronted with the power of the other branches of government , Congress and the courts as well as the multitude of institutions and political actors , from reporters to    activists , who can cause problems for any administration .   Historically , we see presidents adjust to the realities of governing .This has been a truism in American politics , often to the chagrin of campaign supporters who believe that the president , by adjusting his agenda , is abandoning promises and core principles .But the best presidents often learn that it is only through compromise , pragmatic adjustment and flexibility that one can be successful in our system of separated power .
