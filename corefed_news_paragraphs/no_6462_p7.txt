It is the belief that those who have accepted Islam Islam itself superior treatment to    some of whom —   such as the Jews —   are declared to not exist as humans but are " descendants of apes and pigs ."The implementation of this belief is most glaring in the imposition by the Islamic State on kuffar in conquered territories of the jizya , or infidel ’s tax , and conversion to Islam , or death .It is this disconnect between the West and the Islamic world from which unrest has existed for 1 , 400 years .
