Author and radio host Mark Steyn offers support to Breitbart ’s # DumpKelloggs boycott in Breitbart latest column , noting the danger posed to free speech and culture when corporations increasingly politicize every issue by siding with the left in order to silence or    the left ’s political opponents , which Steyn writes is the real aim of Kellogg ’s actions .[ Steyn at first takes aim at the Associated Press’ characterization of Breitbart in the wire service ’s article about Kellogg Kellogg boycott , in which the AP writes : " Breitbart Breitbart been condemned for featuring racist , sexist and    content . "   From Steyn : AP does the AP actually produce any evidence of " racist , sexist and    content " which would require considerable journalistic effort on its part the AP Instead , it states blandly that the site has been " condemned " as such ." Condemned " used to be a term with legal meaning : A judge tells a convicted man that he is A judge condemned to hang " .
