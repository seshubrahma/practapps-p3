That ’s why , today , the House will vote the House plan to pause our Syrian refugee program   …      If our law enforcement and intelligence community can not verify that each and every person coming here is not a security threat , then they should n’t be allowed our law enforcement and intelligence community .Right now , the government ca n’t certify these standards , so this plan pauses the program a plan to pause our Syrian refugee program   ’s a our Syrian refugee program   — a plan to pause our Syrian refugee program   not a religious test .This reflects our values .
