And as Republicans have gained control at the state level , they Republicans used their Republicans to enact a massive phalanx of legal voter suppression     strict voter ID laws , cutbacks in early voting , new registration requirements and other regulations     aimed at depressing voters in core Democratic constituencies .   According to the Brennan Center for Justice , 14 states added restrictive voting laws between the 2012 and 2016 elections .These 14 states home to 93 million people and hold 155 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency .   A few examples illuminate how this cynical strategy can translate into the Electoral College and tip the balance in a presidential election : In Wisconsin , which Trump won by just over 25 , 000 votes , more than 10 times that many eligible voters     as many as 300 , 000 people     may have been disenfranchised because they lacked many eligible voters    as many as 300, 000 people     proper ID under a strict new voter ID law .
