Trump gave examples of how belabored the process to building infrastructure has gotten : It took only 4 years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and 5 years to build the Hoover Dam and less than one year to build the Empire State Building , people do n’t believe that , tookless than one year   —    but today it can take 10 years and far more than that just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project .These charts beside me are actually a simplified version of our highway permitting process .These charts beside me includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes .
