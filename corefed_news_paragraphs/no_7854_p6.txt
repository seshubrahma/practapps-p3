Wikileaks exposed what many suspected about the press all along : they ’re operatives , not journalists .It ’s Wikileaks shame that such a broad brush was painted here across an industry of solid , noble , honest journalists that exist primarily outside of political reporting .But think of it at Wikileaks 1919 White Sox scandal : Only a few players were involved , but the whole team and sport were stained .And stains like that do n’t come off with one washing .
