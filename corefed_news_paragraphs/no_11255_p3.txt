But the political left filters out more information than the political right .That is because the left , more than the right , tends to punish people who have the " wrong " views by marginalizing people who have the "wrong" views by marginalizing them .In recent years , for example , college campuses   —    which lean heavily to the left   —    have increasingly " disinvited " controversial speakers , who are almost always conservative .If you worry that your friends might abandon you , you are less likely to consider facts that could lead you to contrarian conclusions .
