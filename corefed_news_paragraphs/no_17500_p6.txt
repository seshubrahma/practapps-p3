I also hope it goes without saying how deeply offensive such comments are not only to    but Latino Americans in general .   And frankly , it it offend every American whose own ancestors once came to this country as immigrants , immigrants who were almost all at one point denigrated and demeaned by the majority .Immigration and integration are among the best parts of America ’s story .   Xenophobia and racial bias run through our ugliest chapters .
