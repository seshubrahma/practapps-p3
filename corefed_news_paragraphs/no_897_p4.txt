The military strategy that is emerging in Syria parallels the approach that the United States has taken in Mosul , Iraq , and largely reflects the assumptions that guided the planning during the Obama administration .In Mosul , the Americans and Americans allies have provided the air power , rocket fire , artillery and advisers , enabling Iraqi forces to move forward in Iraqi forces push to take the city â€™s western half .Similarly , in the case of Raqqa , the idea is that Syrian forces will do most of the ground fighting but that Americans will assist Americans with advisers and firepower .The United States is already carrying out airstrikes in Syria and has deployed Himars     rockets in the northern part of The United States .
