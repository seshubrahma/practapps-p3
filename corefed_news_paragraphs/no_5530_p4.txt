an Orthodox Jew creates Jewish holidays that do n’t even exist .an Orthodox Jew     is not only Jewish but an Orthodox Jew ’s Orthodox .And an Orthodox Jew daughter became even more Orthodox than the husband .So , an Orthodox Jew ca n’t even go with even more Orthodox than the husband to a restaurant because as soon as even more Orthodox than the husband sit down even more Orthodox than the husband complain that it is not Kosher enough .
