I hope that we can get bipartisan support for this bill because some Democrats have shown the same concerns but a targeted bill n’t have a plan to introduce some giant comprehensive immigration reform bill and try to do everything at once .I ’m certainly willing to work with the White House to the extent they need legal authorities to implement their various security and enforcement measures the White House move my legislation as part the White House a broader package .That includes those security and enforcement measures , but we do expect to have support from the executive branch on this bill ."
