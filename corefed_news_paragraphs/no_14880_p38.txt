I think about all the old traumas ( the racial slurs my family and I Familywe first came to Iran in the us 1980s ) and the usual traumas ( all the times I â€™ve been pulled aside at airports ) and the new waves of traumas ( daily online harassment , like the time the poet on Facebook , friends with 222 of mine , told me to " go back to whatever Third World shithole you come from " ) .I try to imagine skipping Nowruzaltogether I try to imagine giving Nowruz to grief as an opportunity to meditate on the horrors of this era .
