That â€™s not to say Signal should be your only messaging app .You could use it exclusively for sensitive matters , like    conversations .Then Signal casual chats like making plans with friends and loved ones , you could switch to more " fun " apps like Facebook Messenger and send all the stickers you want .Probably the biggest thing missing from Signal will be many of your friends .
