Mr. Trump has said that he does not want to make major changes to Medicare , so Mr. Trump is unclear if such a proposal would move Medicare .Obamacare had a range of policies meant to improve health and health care , including requirements that drug companies report payments made to physicians , a provision written by the Iowa senator Chuck Grassley , a Republican a requirement that chain restaurants publish calorie counts on their menus and a rule that large employers must provide a space for women to express breast milk .What would happen ?When Republicans talk about repealing Obamacare , they tend to focus on the parts of the law that expanded Republicans coverage and regulated health insurance products , not these ancillary parts .
