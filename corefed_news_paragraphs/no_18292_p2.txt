For example , Rep. Billy Long of Missouri   —    not a moderate    by any measure   —     he can’’t vote for the latest    version of the American Health Care Act because it " strips away the latest   version of the American Health Care Act any guarantee that preexisting conditions would be covered and    affordable ." ’ ’    But some Republicans are claiming that the Republican bill is    good enough on preexisting conditions , already    meeting Trump’ ’s promise to be " every bit as good " as    Obamacare on this measure .
