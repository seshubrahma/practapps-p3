Krauthammer concluded , " I thought one of the most interesting aspects of the debate is how little people went after Trump .The only one who did , and I thought it was a rather    hit , was by Jeb , when Jeb came out against the demonization of the other , particularly Muslims , in response to the to the video that had been shown on YouTube .And also , I thought Jeb made a good defense , for the first time , a rather forceful defense of Jeb position on how to act in   —    with ISIS in the Middle East , particularly since the question had a kind of a hook on it , mentioning the failures of Jeb brother ’s policy in the Middle East .Jeb sidestepped it , and I thought Jeb handled it very it .
