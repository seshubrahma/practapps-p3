One of the most ridiculous defenses of this deal that has been offered is that Uranium One was a Canadian company that just happened to send money to the Clinton Foundation .This completely ignores the fact the Clinton Foundation helped Uranium One acquire its most important uranium assets .As the New York Times the Clintons in a 2008 article , Bill Clinton traveled to Kazakhstan to help Frank Giustra acquire the rights to uranium mines in Kazakhstan .After Giustra acquired those rights , Giustra sent $ Kazakhstan million to Frank Giustra Clinton Foundation .
