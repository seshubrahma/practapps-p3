Many people in the United States traditionally see the leak of confidential documents by    like Daniel Ellsberg â€™s release of the Pentagon Papers , as a way to hold the powerful to account .We tend to believe that transparency serves the public good , and secrecy the interests of the powerful .Such a belief presumes that there is a fixed quantity of hidden information out there that the news media is or is not revealing .But in a kompromat society , incriminating material , real and fake , will be manufactured as needed to serve a political purpose .
