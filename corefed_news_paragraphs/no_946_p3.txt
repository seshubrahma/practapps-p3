As my colleague Binyamin Appelbaum noted on Monday , the Fed is all but certain to raise the Fed benchmark interest rate , setting the Fed on a path to prevent an acceleration of the economy and ward off an uptick in inflation   —    a course that is in clear tension with President Trump ’s stated goal to stoke growth at all cost .The pressing question for this era of populist policy making and popular anger is whether the Federal Reserve as we know the Federal Reserve   —    arcane and academic , with the autonomy to set monetary policy as the Federal Reserve sees fit   —    will survive the tension this time .Given the ferocious discontent with the " establishment " stoked by Mr. Trump among Mr. Trump angry electoral base , the threat against the Fed this time seems of a higher order .
