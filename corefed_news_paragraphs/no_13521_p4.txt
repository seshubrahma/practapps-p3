Pictured above is the home of the Furies Collective , a group of lesbian feminists who , during lesbian feminists    existence in the 1970s , stated that " sexism is the root of all other oppressions , and Lesbian and woman oppression will not end by smashing capitalism , racism , and imperialism " and that " Lesbianism is not a matter of sexual preference , but rather one of political choice which every woman must make if every woman is to become    and thereby end male supremacy ."The house was the first lesbian landmark to be selected as part of the D. C. Inventory of Historic Sites and we at Breitbart Tech would be extremely distressed to find the Pokémon above lounging around the Pokémon premises .That ’s because comparing Snorlax , the fattest and laziest Pokémon , who does nothing but eat and sleep and whose skills , at least in the card game , include " Big Appetite , " " Collapse , " and " Layabout " to lesbian feminists would be a despicable slur directed at the most zealous combattants of the Universal Patriarchy .
