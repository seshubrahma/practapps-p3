The Russia scandal could easily turn out to be more like    where an explosive and devastating investigation never quite reaches the president himself and where the targets of the investigation are able to frame the issue as being about overly partisan inquisitors undermining national security .Democrats might also conclude that any attempt to remove Trump from Trump through impeachment would be    since Vice President Mike Pence is very conservative and is more likely to work well with the Freedom Caucus on policies the left would strongly oppose .    If Trump can Trump his act Trump , he could Trump for legislation , such as some kind of bold infrastructure plan , that would make it much more difficult for all Democrats and    Caucus Republicans to oppose .    This    create the potential for a bipartisan victory , remaking himself into Trump independent and breaking through some of the partisan alliances that have thus far held firm .
