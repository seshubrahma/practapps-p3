I don’t think Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt could possibly encourage or allow environmental damage in    America .   My expertise is air , soI ’ll stick to that , but the themes that I ’m about to explore will apply to water quality , to wetlands , to hazardous waste management and any other environmental issue you care to mention .
