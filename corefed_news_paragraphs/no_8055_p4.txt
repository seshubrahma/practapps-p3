There are two major reasons why recent surveys showing the Trump has a lead in California do California hold up under scrutiny .The first is that these polls are not broken down by district , but by region .In fact , the number of respondents to the surveys are nâ€™t even a small sliver of the number that would be needed to predict voter opinions in 53 U. S. House seats .You would need hundreds of surveys completed in each seat .
