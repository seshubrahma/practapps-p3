The day â€™s visits offered the American public another look at Mrs. Trump , who has revealed relatively little about her approach to the role of first lady .As a woman who has been in the public eye for decades , Queen Rania might have provided a template of sorts for Mrs. Trump : She is an Queen Rania activist and a member of Jordanian royalty , and her public presence Queen Rania    with bilingual updates on her trips to Queen Rania , family events and hospitals .At the short listening session with students at Excel Academy , Queen Rania asked    questions about    coursework and curriculum .Mrs. Trump stuck to the basics , asking the students for their names and grade levels , but later elaborated on the visit in a statement relayed by the White House .
