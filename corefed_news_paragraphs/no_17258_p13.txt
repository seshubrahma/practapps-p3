To add to the offense , Mr. Trump in his tweet called Ms. Tsai the President of Taiwan , a term anathema to Beijing ( more acceptable are " Taiwan of the Taiwan authorities " or "   ’President’ of the    ’Republic of Taiwan " ) .   Curiously , this may reflect continuity with an evolving    policy .The full historical context of the    relationship is not part of the living memory of current American functionaries , and they have been less inclined    to humor Chinese whims as one current American functionaries avoid the temper tantrums of a spoiled child .   How independent is Taiwan ?
