His words contradicted Booker of other Democrats , including Sen. Chris Coons ( ) who said that Lynch should not have met with Clinton .Former San Francisco mayor and fellow Democrat Willie Brown also panned the meeting : If Clinton wanted to Clinton on a warm word to the attorney general , then he should have Clinton up with her at some Clinton function .That way there would have been plenty of witnesses to swear that nothing even close to a conflict of interest ever came up .As mayor , I made a point of never meeting privately with anyone on any issue pending before the Public Utilities Commission , the Planning Department , Muni , the port , the airport or any other area where there might be a conflict of interest .
