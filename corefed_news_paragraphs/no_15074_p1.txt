In August of 2013 , after Assad used chemical weapons in a similar scenario against people in the Syrian city of Ghouta , Obama requested congressional permission to launch air strikes against the Assad regime .Many Republicans opposed a similar scenario against people in the Syrian city of Ghouta request .One of the most prominent was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who on Friday tweeted out McConnell support for Trump ’s strike , writing , " This was a clear signal from America that Bashar al Assad can no longer use chemical weapons against Bashar al Assad own people with impunity . "   In a speech on the Senate floor in 2013 , however , McConnell announced McConnell opposition to Obama ’s proposal , saying , " A vital national security risk is clearly not at play , there are just too many unanswered questions about our    strategy in Syria , including the fact that this proposal is utterly detached from a wider strategy to end the civil war there , and on the specific question of deterring the use of chemical weapons , this proposal appears to be based on a contradiction .
