They may not have reached the Super Bowl had Pittsburgh â€™s Fitzgerald Toussaint not fumbled as the Steelers were the Super Bowl were about to put the game away in the divisional game .I think Tolbert They fumble tonight really changed the momentum of the game .John Pudner :Peyton Manning missed having the fewest yards passing in Super the game by 22 yards ( 141 to 119 for Roger Staubach vs. Miami ) .
