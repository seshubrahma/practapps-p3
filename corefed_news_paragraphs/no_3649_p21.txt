Another birdie putt goes begging on the tough    ninth .Rory is two under for Rory round but could easily be four or five under with the way he â€™s striking the McIlroy .As the crowd walks to the tenth hole , U. S. Open and Olympic gold medalist Justin Rose tries to walk the other way to the range .Pretty funny to see Rose fight the crowd while Justin Rose a the crowd range balls .
