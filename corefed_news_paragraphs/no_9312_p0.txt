Thanks to Breitbart News’ # DumpKelloggs petition , over 380 , 000 Americans , many of whom voted for    Donald Trump , have vowed to boycott Kellogg ’s after the cereal company’s decision to pull the cereal company’s advertising .[ After    advocacy groups launched a social media campaign to coerce companies away from advertising on Breitbart , Kellogg ’s publicly announced companies would comply with companies demands   —    and made the vague claim that Breitbart and Kellogg tens of millions of readers " are n’t aligned with " the cereal maker ’s " values as a company . "    Indeed , our research has shown Kellogg ’s values would not " align " with most Americans .
