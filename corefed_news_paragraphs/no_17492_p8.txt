That effort will kick off Thursday as Santorum heads to Davenport , Iowa for his first    event where Santorum ’ll meet employees of Santorum    grocery store , an    company .He will then swing to Santorum Carolina this weekend , where two of his sons attend The Citadel Santorum college , giving Santorum an opportunity to pitch Santorum next focus of his 2016 campaign : a Santorum foreign policy , which could appeal to many Republicans at a time of global turmoil .Driven in part by the ISIS threat and turmoil in the Middle East and by likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ’s tenure as secretary of state , the 2016 campaign is shaping up to have a heavy foreign policy bend .That ’s a challenge for many Republicans who are light on foreign policy experience and Santorum is hoping voters see him as the most prepared Santorum take on the job of commander in chief , having earned his foreign policy chops in Santorum years on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
