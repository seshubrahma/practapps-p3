I am a Christian , albeit admittedly not a great Christian .I do nâ€™t always do what the Good Book says I should .However , despite my occasional lapses , I try not to be a hypocrite .And I fear that some Republicans and conservatives are drifting toward the sort of gross hypocrisy that is usually associated with the liberal left .
