I ’m under no illusions that the left will abandon what have become some of its core operating principles .the Left up does the left care about the environment or the Left up the working class as such —   occupy Wall St and the Bernie bots were some of the last gasps of that .What motivates the left now is    hatred , particularly of straight men .Just like Nazis the Left up behind all their problems , behind every statistical disparity between men and women , between whites and blacks , the left sees a sinister white man .
