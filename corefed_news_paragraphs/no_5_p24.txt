In a $ 140 million , 50 megawatt demonstration project , the company , Net Power , will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines .This system , invented by a British engineer , Rodney Allam , eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again .The power plant produces a stream of very pure , pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for This system, invented by a British engineer, Rodney Allam without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require .The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to    power plants , the efficient    plants that The creators gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine .
