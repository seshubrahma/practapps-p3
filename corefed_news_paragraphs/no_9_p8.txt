As a result , Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative Republicans but that they knew Republicans not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or Republicans the president would veto them .Republicans , if they can Republicans the votes , their ideas Republicans become law   â€”    with all the attendant consequences .Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit , approve annual budgets , endorse spending bills and back other    measures that they formerly Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government to the Democrats and some of their more Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government colleagues .With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by those votes , the Republicans who belonged to the " vote no , hope yes " caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well .
