You could predict , given this last election myself how the imagination works and how the undoing was going to get harder and the first thing I noticed .As Danny points out Danny people a tragedy just happens , it ’s easy to undo it .You start from the event , and the first thing that you can undo moving backwards in a tragedy and change the result a tragedy you change : So the FBI director ’s email , or the ground ball that goes through the first baseman ’s legs in the bottom of the ninth inning , or the    kicker missing at the end of the game .This is all the same stuff .
