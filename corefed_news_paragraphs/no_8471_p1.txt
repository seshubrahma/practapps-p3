Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity , given the emergence of " Strange New Respect " for Mitt Romney this year .Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism   —    and do n’t be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate is n’t as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016 .We should practice a little political opportunism of We own , and put the Left ’s revised opinion of Mitt Romney to good use .What they said about Mitt Romney was absurd in almost every respect .
