For the first 11 months of last year , the average wholesale price of avocados crossing the border was 50 cents apiece .So a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border would only add a dime to the cost of each avocado the border takes four or five years for a newly planted avocado tree to bear a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border .If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados , American farmers could not increase production quickly .That means many Americans might have to pay for taxed avocados imported from Mexico and elsewhere for a few years , or potentially do without .
