FOXBOROUGH , Mass.   â€”    The N. F. L. likes portraying itself as one big family of owners , players and fans who , despite players and fans differences , come together on game days .Yet at the Super Bowl in Houston in two weeks , the N. F. L. may have no choice but to air a public and profound grudge on national television .If the New England Patriots defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday as the New England Patriots are favored to do and go on to beat either the Atlanta Falcons or the Green Bay Packers for the title , the league commissioner , Roger Goodell , will have to present the Lombardi Trophy to Robert K. Kraft , the owner of the New England Patriots .
