Immigrants are people who arrive legally after a long process that takes many years .Proposing that there be no restrictions on who enters our country   —    and that we must take in all migrants who appear on our borders   —    is not we " humanitarian " policy , it is an unforgivably destructive and dangerous one .The ongoing debate over how many and what kind of immigrants America needs should be a policy debate , not a    brawl , but that is what the globalists are doing —   dragging everyone into a brawl .We have seen it over and over again , this orchestrated orgy or character assassination aimed at silencing all dissent from the globalist , multicultural agenda .
