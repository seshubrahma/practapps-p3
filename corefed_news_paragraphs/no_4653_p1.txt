The U. S. airstrikes signaled to Assad and Assad Russian and Iranian backers that Trump will act in Syria and the administration strongly supports the removal of the Syrian president   —    an important strategic ally of Moscow and Tehran .The U. S. military move demonstrates to Israel and the Sunni Arab bloc cast aside by Obama ’s nuclear deal with the mullahs that American leadership has officially returned to the region .Assad himself is unlikely to retaliate since the last thing he wants Assad himself a    insurgency attempting to topple his regime Assad himself to go to war with Trump or expand the battlefield to U. S. ally Israel .Trump ’s Trump authority in Syria directly threatens Russian interests since it was Moscow that largely filled the security vacuum in that country Syria repeatedly failed to take any meaningful action against Assad .
