In a speech at Youngstown State University in Ohio , a critical swing state where polls show Donald J. Trump trailing Hillary Clinton , Mr. Trump combined old vows to seize Middle Eastern oil fields with the announcement of a series of new , if still vague , proposals to change America â€™s battlefield tactics ."Just as we won the Cold War , in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets , so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam , " he said .he again tried to change he politically inflammatory approach to immigration , replacing he 2015 vow to bar Muslims from entering the United States with a new commitment to bar anyone from parts of the world where terrorism breeds .
