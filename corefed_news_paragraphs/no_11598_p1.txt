So when you have a president that in his campaign who ran saying things that not are n’t just contrary to fact but literally threatening to use presidential power in a way that would erode the rights and privileges and equality of large sections of Americans , God bless the protesters .But I will tell you this .i caution anyone who in their protest becomes the very thing that their ’re protesting against .Meaning , turning to hateful speech , violating principles and ideals that are sacred in this country .
