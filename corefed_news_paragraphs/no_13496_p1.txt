Students holding signs reading " End white supremacy " originally gathered on the steps of the Lee Circle monument before the demonstrations turned destructive .Lee Circle was fully covered in graffiti with phrases like " Black Power " and " Dismantle White Supremacy " .Later , an effigy of Trump was burned while glass windows at a nearby bank were shattered .   Other phrases like " No Trump , no KKK " were used to vandalize surrounding areas , as well as the threatening phrase " Die whites die " and " F*ck Trump " .
