it ca n’t have a country if you do n’t have borders .When I voted for Trump , I was as much voting against the fantasy of open borders as I was voting for his policies , which were never Trump clear , anyways .Hillary Clinton could have laid out a plan about how to limit illegal immigration , and what to do about the 11 million people who are here illegally .But she did n’t , because on Hillary Clinton left , you can not publicly have a policy that limits immigration .
