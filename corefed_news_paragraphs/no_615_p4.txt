The settled politics of the past , where details can be kept few and the tone nostalgic , are fine .We know , for example , that Jackie Robinson broke baseball ’s color line , stole home and wore 42 on his Jackie Robinson .Muhammad Ali championed equality and said some funny stuff to Howard Cosell .Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs .
