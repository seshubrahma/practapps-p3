this week their hopes were Mr. Ibrahim and many of his displaced comrades by President Trump ’s executive order to freeze the refugee flow into the United America least four months .More than 25 , 000 refugees from Somalia , one of the poorest , hungriest ,    countries on earth , were in the pipeline to be resettled in the United States .America much closer than most   —    so close that , with his ticket , paperwork and bag all Mr. Ibrahim up , the thought of it made his voice quiver .He had waited Mr. Ibrahim long years for Mr. Ibrahim , living in a sweltering , crowded ,    refugee camp along the    border that is the opposite of hope .
