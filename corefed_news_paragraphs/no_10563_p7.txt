I went from a nice income to zero income , gave a year of my life , asked great sacrifices on the part of donors , staff , and volunteers and gave it all I had and then some .And the voters chose differently .I could blame the media for giving me virtually no attention and giving it all to Trump .I could blame the people who promised their support and urged me to get in the race but who then disappeared into the camps of others because they saw better paychecks , their rewards , or maybe really thought they saw a better candidate their
