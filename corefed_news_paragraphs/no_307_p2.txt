Not to worry : As far as anyone knows , the president an assertion he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally .But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it .This will be the news media recurring challenge , given President Trump ’s habit of speaking in    hyperbole and his tendency to deride any President Trump’s report as " fake news ."
