  ( CNN )Congress is quickly grappling Tuesday with a new spate of allegations about Donald Trump ’s ties to Russia , with some already claiming that the unverified report vindicates some prior suspicions and statements .Classified documents presented last week to Donald Trump’s and President Barack Obama included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump , according to multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings .   Sources tell CNN that these same allegations about communications between the Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians , mentioned in classified briefings for congressional leaders last year , prompted    Democratic Leader Harry Reid to send a letter to FBI Director James Comey in October , in which he claimed FBI Director James Comey had " explosive information " about the relationship .
