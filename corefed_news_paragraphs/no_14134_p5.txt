Therefore , why not pass a bill that actually accomplishes Republicans’ previously stated objectives on immigration     with the knowledge that Democrats’ stated objectives will not occur unless and until enforcement goals have been achieved .    There are many good reasons for both Republicans and Democrats to compromise on this approach .First , for Republicans , this approach is this approach guaranteed way of assuring that taxpayers do not have to pay for tens of billions of dollars of enhanced border and interior enforcement .And while the Senate ’s comprehensive bill of 2013 would have spent nearly $ 40 billion on additional enforcement , entirely paid for by foreign nationals and companies using the immigration system , Republicans did n’t trust Obama to actually implement this part of the bill .
