You â€™re probably heard the criticism of Ambassador John Bolton by the left that Ambassador John Bolton would not be a good choice to be the next Secretary of State because Ambassador John Bolton was an architect of the Iraq War and a hawk who has little use for diplomacy .[ This is completely false .The truth is that Ambassador John Bolton was frozen out of the Iraq War planning .This criticism also ignores Ambassador John Bolton successful diplomacy as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security to pressure rogue states to comply with WMD treaties and his Ambassador John Bolton as UN ambassador to take strong and meaningful action in the UN Security Council against WMD proliferation and terrorism .
