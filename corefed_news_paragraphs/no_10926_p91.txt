—    Alex Swoyer ( @ASwoyer ) July 19 , 2016 ,   Monday’s GOP convention MSNBC , Dan RNC , a " Never Trump " establishment Republican , claims a generic Republican would be leading Clinton MSNBC 15 points right now .More proof Clinton how clueless people like Senor and Bill Kristol are .A generic Republican like Romney who got trounced by Obama even after GOP establishment figures insisted he was the best chance to beat Obama would never be able to get their message out and combat the mainstream media like Trump is doing .They would also probably fold over like a cheap Romney to Clinton just like Romney Obama over GOP 2012 .
