Climate confusion is back into the American zeitgeist .   In addition to the website changes , which the Trump administration acknowledged and will be fully apparent only after the EPA posts replacements for the former climate change websites , a US House committee held a March 29 hearing giving voice to climate skeptics who say it ’s unclear to what degree humans are causing global warming .While it is true that no science is absolutely certain ( it ’s no science , so it ’s no science asking new questions of itself and no science )the overwhelming majority of climate scientists     at least 97 % according to    studies     say humans are causing warming by polluting the atmosphere with    gases , primarily by burning fuels like coal , oil and natural gas .
