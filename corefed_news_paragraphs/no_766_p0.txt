WASHINGTON   —    President Trump ’s proposal to add $ 54 billion to the Pentagon budget next year sounds huge at first   —    a 10 percent increase for a department that already receives more of taxpayers’ money than any other part of government .But the outgoing Obama administration had forecast a $ 35 billion increase for the Defense Department in fiscal year 2018 , so President Trump ’s share of the proposed increase over and above that figure is $ 19 billion , according to budget analysts .Even so , the a $35 billion increase for the Defense Department in fiscal year 2018 been greeted with criticism from military spending hawks , in part because White House officials say Mr. President Trump call for a significant cut in foreign aid , including programs that military officials say contribute to global stability and are seen as important in helping avoid future conflicts .
