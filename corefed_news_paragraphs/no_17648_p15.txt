In closing , I hope that once you take office that you will make    the continuance of Treasury market structure reform one of your    top priorities .The departures of Mary Jo White from the SEC and    Antonio Weiss from the Treasury leave much unfinished work Treasury    fiscal plans of the Trump Administration and the end of    extraordinary monetary policy during your tenure    present    great challenges to the Treasury market    top of the existing    structural issues .The more robust the secondary market for    Treasuries , the easier it will be to navigate the challenges that    lie ahead .These issues are not partisan .
