I ’d probably say 4 or 5 points , but that ’s not very   .The newest data does provide reason to pause and wonder whether the race has gotten even the race even if the preponderance of evidence does n’t point that way quite yet .The only other thing I ’d say , though , is that we know Clinton has had a rough week or two .The polls are going to bump around , and I think there ’s reason to think this is a relatively low point .
