I ’m not gon na go through this and give you what the real news of these hearings is today and what the backdrop of all this is .Because there ’s a really salient factor that ’s driving this from the Democrat side that is never going to be reported or commented on , which I ’m going to touch on myself today .But , as I say , the purpose of this is to further the the whole point of this today  —    that Trump is illegitimate , that he should not be president , that his election was the result of tampering by the Russians TrumpSo the objective is that Trump Trump stops this reform business he ’s got , stops this     stuff , and starts Trump the Washington Republicans run the Trump again , or they ’re gon na impeach him .
