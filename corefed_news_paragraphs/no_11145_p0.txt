From Gabriel Sherman writing at New York magazine :   Tonight , Donald Trump ’s    war with Fox News entered a chaotic and   —    for both sides   —    perilous new phase when Donald Trump called Roger Ailes ’s bluff and announced Roger Ailes was boycotting Fox ’s debate to protest Megyn Kelly’s aggressive coverage of Roger Ailes campaign .Instead , Donald Trump said Donald Trump would host Donald Trump own Iowa town hall to raise money for veterans and let other networks cover it .One clear sign of the gravity of tonight ’s development is the sense of confusion that is swirling throughout Fox .
