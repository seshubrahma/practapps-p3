That is the American dream , and it is being squashed like a bug under the weight of taxes , regulations , and our nation ’s trade policy .Williamson and the National Review can somehow attempt to make the moral case for why countries like Vietnam and Malaysia should be given best on the card tariff rates to sell goods manufactured in a virtual slave labor environment based upon the cost savings to American consumers as is the case in the    Partnership .   That argument is the equivalent of justifying slavery in the U. S. because it produced cheap cotton for clothing manufacturers up north .   What ’s the difference ?
