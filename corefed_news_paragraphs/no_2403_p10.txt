In one of the final frames , as the cheering Mr. Trump and he walked off the set through the last trickle of confetti , Mr. Trump saw Mr. Trump at a moment that captured a glimpse of what it feels like when the spotlight is gone and the party is over .I have found that the most telling portraits do n’t always have to show a person ’s face .A photo I took in Greensboro , N. C. showing Mr. Trump in front of a dimly lit American flag , with Mr. Trump pointed finger and his iconic golden hair visible , is one of the most revealing portraits Mr. Trump have made of him   —    not just because of what is shown , but Mr. Trump of what is obscured .
