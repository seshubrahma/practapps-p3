Growing up in Mississippi shaped my life in all sorts of ways , including seeing a Bible Belt , cultural Christianity that was often very tolerant of racism and bigotry .Much of the New Testament has to do with breaking down divisions .As time has gone on , the more I see my identity within the global church and the global body of Christ , so what hurts my    brother or sister hurts me .Do you endorse the concept that black lives matter ?
