I bought a container of hummus , some spanakopita , grape leaves , freshly baked pita chips , and tangy flatbread covered in thyme and sumac , all for about $ 20 .Walking into the park , we heard music and followed it Brooklyn Bridge Park festival grounds , a grassy area in a container of hummus, some spanakopita, grape leaves, freshly baked pita chips, and tangy flatbread covered in thyme and sumac shadow of a temporary Martin Creed sculpture that reads " Understanding " in letters so red and intimidating that it seems more of an imperative than a suggestion .We sat on the grass , enjoying the festival as we as our food .The American music festival ( which was we ) was a music festival other cultural offerings have a price , but are well we it .
