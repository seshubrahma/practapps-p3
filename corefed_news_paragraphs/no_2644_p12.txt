Mr. Lauer prefaced one question by saying that " nobody Mr. Lauer you " to have read deeply into foreign policy before running for president .He asked Mr. Trump if he would be " prepared on Mr. Lauer 1 , " a Mr. Trump question that will elicit only one answer from any candidate not about to drop out .Most egregiously , Mr. Lauer allowed Mr. Trump to repeat , unchallenged , the Mr. Lauer that he Mr. Trump the war in Iraq when , as reported by Mr. Lauer , he supported the invasion on record in 2002 .Any minimally prepared Mr. Lauer would have been ready for that claim , even if Mrs. Clinton had not earlier rebutted it in the false claim that he had opposed the war in Iraq Mr. Lauer â€™s face .
