" Or in Lebanon , Virginia , it was people who used to work in coal , who had been out of a job for years ."So even though Trump promised them things he ’ll never be people who used to work in coal, who had been out of a job for years to Trump     coal is n’t coming back     he was the only one who Trump them anything .
