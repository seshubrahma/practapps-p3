We as lawyers , " Coulter said , " would print out copies of [ Scalia ’s decisions ] and   …      we ’d   …      be reading aloud from Scalia dissents because Scalia dissents were so hilariously funny .And that has a lot to do with Scalia influence .As I ’ve always said , you ’re not going to influence anyone if anyone ’re not reading what you wrote .
