Another review identifies the film as outright racist the film on " the buffoonery of Afghans " for many of its jokes .While Whiskey Tango the film at least boasted the endorsement of the book ’s author and , one could argue , was an attempt at a heartfelt statement on the absurdities of war , Amy Schumer ’s recent FARC parody Snatched clearly makes no attempt to identify with the hundreds of thousands of victims of South America ’s most formidable terrorist organization , the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia   —    guilty of innumerable kidnappings , rapes , forced abortions , and murders .In the film , Schumer convinces her worrywart mother , Amy Schumer’s by Goldie Hawn , to travel to Ecuador , where they are soon abducted by a her worrywart mother, played by Goldie Hawn and whisked into the jungles of Colombia .Despite the liberal hero status Schumer brings to the film , Amy Schumer’s pilloried it the film , milking the outrageous the film Colombians have been striving to shake off for the past 30 years for laughs .
