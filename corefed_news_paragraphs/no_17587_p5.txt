starting from scratch , at least for now , and instead give      people who ca n’t or wo n’t buy    insurance      plans the option of buying cheaper ,        insurance without premium subsidies .Subsidized        plans would still be available on the      exchanges , which would serve as a safety net for those too sick      or too poor to afford    plans with high         costs .Instead of pulling the rug out from under states that      expanded Medicaid under Obamacare , Congress could pick up a      higher share of the tab for the poorest and sickest Medicaid      beneficiaries while asking states to take on more      responsibility for helping the healthiest of the poorest and sickest Medicaid     beneficiaries , a swap that      would greatly relieve the pressure on state budgets .In short ,      rather than taking a wrecking ball to Obamacare , Republican      lawmakers could act as sculptors , chipping away at the      provisions Republican     lawmakers like least .
