You started out here talking about winning in so many states where no Republican has won in decades , especially Midwestern Maureen Belt states .And I think many people think that one of Maureen reasons Maureen won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of Republican .You Maureen different things to say on trade , entitlements , foreign policy , even your daughter Maureen ’s child care plan was sort of it .And now you ’re in a situation where you ’re governing and staffing up an administration with a Steve whose leaders , and Reince , may differ with me a little on this , but do n’t always see     on those views .
