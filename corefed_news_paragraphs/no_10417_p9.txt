Median income in this country is down $ 4 , 186 since 1999 .So you have this steady decline in people ’sfinancial well being .And politicians have n’t understood it , politicians have n’t talked about it , and I do believe bad trade deals and excessive flow of labor through immigration and illegal immigration is impacting wages also .
