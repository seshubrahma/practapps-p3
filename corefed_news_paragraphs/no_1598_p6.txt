Since President Gerald R. Ford received 16 percent of the    vote in 1976 , no Republican nominee has attained more than 12 percent .But as demonstrated in the past two White House races   —    in which John McCain received 4 percent of black votes in 2008 and Mitt Romney received 6 percent in 2012   —    when a Republican collapses into single digits among    and struggles with other minorities , it reduces the number of white votes    Democrat needs to win the presidency .That is what worries Republicans this year , particularly in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania with heavily black cities , where an NBC    Street    poll last week showed Mr. Trump receiving only 1 percent of the black vote .( The poll ’s three percentage point margin an NBC   Street   poll last week among all voters suggests that his support could be slightly higher . )
