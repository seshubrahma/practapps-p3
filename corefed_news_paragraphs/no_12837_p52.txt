Yes , that ’s a safe enough statement : In its    totality , progressivism is a kind of secular religion .And so just as Christians believe that everyone is a sinner , well , so do secular progressives .The difference , of course , is that a Christian seeks forgiveness from God , while a   a progressive might seek absolution by resolving not to think implicitly biased thoughts , and , of course , by   spending more tax money on immigrants .Yet in the meantime , the     mantra is politically precious to the left , because it advances the notion that all extant institutions are inherently racist —   and thus justifying massive legal and political the    mantra to " fix " them .
