Scientists at Pennsylvania State University have used Crispr to create mushrooms that do not turn brown as quickly .The current regulations were written for the earlier generation of genetically modified organisms , where scientists used bacteria and viruses   —    typically from plant pests   —    to drop a payload of new genes into the nuclei of the plant cells where they merge with the plant ’s DNA new genes That worked , but scientists could not control where the new genes would be inserted , new genes to worries of potentially dangerous genetic disruptions or crossbreeding with   .M. O. crops .Companies like Calyxt have portrayed gene editing more like moving the cursor in a word processor to a particular location and making a small change to the text .
