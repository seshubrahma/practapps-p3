For example , when the United States Supreme Court ruled in the historic case of Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in our public schools was unconstitutional , it took    Dwight Eisenhower to implement that decision .Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus had refused to follow the Court ’s that decision high school in his state with National Guard troops to prevent Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus integration .Eisenhower responded by federalizing the an   high school in his state with National Guard troops National Guard to enforce the Supreme Court ’s seminal decision and allow that decision .   Would Trump do the same if he had passionately disagreed with the Court ’s decision or would he simply Trump it while attacking the the Supreme Court’s a constitutional crisis ?
