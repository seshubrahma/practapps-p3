The " entire landscape of Trump’ ’s behavior " is what would prompt    an obstruction of justice charge , said Jens David Ohlin , an    associate dean at Cornell Law School and an expert on criminal    law .That includes " telling Comey to back off on the Flynn    investigation , firing Comey when Comey would n’t , and then admitting on    national television that Comey dismissed Comey because of the Flynn   investigation ." ’ ’    Trump’ ’s statement about Comey to the Russians is significant    because it    is    evidence of Comey corrupt intent when Comey    fired Comey , " Ohlin added .
