We need a $ 50 million dollar train station as much as we need We people like Lou Ciminelli , 80 % of the school board and the dizziness of socialistic progressive politicians who never signed the front of a paycheck .At best 400 people a day take a train .They are best 400 people a day complaining about exchange or Depew .We are already the laughingstock of America for having the dumbest elected leaders ever .
