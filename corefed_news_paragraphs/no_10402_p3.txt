[ Title 8 , Section 1182 of the U. S. Code , the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 ] gives the President legal authority to suspend   —    by a simple proclamation , and without any action by Congress   —    the entry of " any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States [ who ] would be detrimental to the interests of the United States , " and to do so indefinitely .   President Obama has in fact already used this power .This existing statutory grant of authority to President Obama , and to those to whom he President Obama delegate this this power is very broad , and a very recent Supreme Court decision held that he President Obama withhold visas on national security grounds without providing any reason at all .   Thus , even without any action by Congress to give him President Obama authority , it is likely that the President Obama at least temporarily ban immigrants who are Muslim .
