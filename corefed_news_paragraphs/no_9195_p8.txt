So he is going Donald Trump not have a mandate .The majority of our fellow Americans do not want him in the Donald Trump House .But because of an arcane law from the 1700s that was set up to placate the slave states so they would join the slave states union , so they gave them the slave states little the slave states power , because they had a the slave states population .So in the irony of a man who said so many things that were racist during the campaign , that he would benefit a man who said so many things that were racist during the campaign a law from the 1700s to placate the slave states the slave states , the irony of it is unbearable , unbearable .
