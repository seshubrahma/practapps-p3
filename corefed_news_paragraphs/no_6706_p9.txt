Because we never attempted to write a political we , we were surprised by the book ’s we among certain crusaders on both the left and the right .When " The Fourth Turning " came out , our biggest partisan fans were Democrats , we saw in our description of an emerging " Millennial we " ( a term we coined ) the sort of    optimists who would pull America toward progressive ideals .Yet we ’ve also had conservative fans , we were drawn to another lesson : that the new era would probably see the successful joining of    economics with    social values .Beyond ideology , I think there ’s another reason for the rising interest in our book .
