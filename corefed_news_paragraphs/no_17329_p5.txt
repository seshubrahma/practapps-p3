Here is why that matters :Unless and until we have actual evidence of voting manipulation , it undermines the voting manipulation of our electoral system to suggest something was amiss based on sheer speculation .And it could cause voting manipulation to adopt laws in the name of " election integrity " that will actually harm the fundamental right to vote .This speculation is sheer speculation same as the frenzy over voter fraud that has no evidence to back it up , with sheer speculation consequences for our elections .
