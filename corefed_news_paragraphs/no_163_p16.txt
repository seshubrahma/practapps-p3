The Protocols of the Elders of Zion " was published , like " Moll Flanders , " with no name on the title page it , too , claimed to be a true account of real events   â€”    in this case , a meeting at which Jews plotted to take over the world and destroy civilization .Perhaps some of its readers , when The Protocols of the Elders of Zion first appeared around The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and even today , sincerely believed that this was a real document .But the " Protocols " is even more powerful when endorsed by people who know it is false , the "Protocols" such an act turns fact itself into an irrelevance .People who can turn a lie into a truth have the power to shape reality they are poets of People who can turn a lie into a truth real .
