How can so many people believe things that are demonstrably false ?The question has taken on new urgency as the Trump administration propagates falsehoods about voter fraud , climate change and crime statistics that large swaths of the population have bought into .But collective delusion is not new , nor is it the sole province of the political right .Plenty of liberals believe , counter to scientific consensus , that G. M. O.s are poisonous , and that vaccines cause autism .
