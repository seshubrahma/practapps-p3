As the term of choice for the emerging    coalition , " resistance " signals urgency , the desire to stand up and say no before it ’s too late .At the same time , it concedes some ground : With Republicans controlling all three branches of government , " no " may be the only position available to Democrats , leftists and liberals .To resist is to do something negative   —    to push back against someone else ’s agenda when your own back is up against the wall .It is a desperate word for desperate times , filled with limits as well as possibilities .
