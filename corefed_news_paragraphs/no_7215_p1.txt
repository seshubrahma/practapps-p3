Vicente Fox Quezada claimed that Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump would take America over the edge and that Hillary Clinton would be the one person who could shut Vicente Fox Quezada up .Despite Vicente Fox Quezada tough talk against Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump , Vicente Fox Quezada seems to forget that Vicente Fox Quezada is at least partially responsible for the unending wave of violence that has taken over Mexico .   Fox , a member of the National Action    PAN , served as Mexico â€™s president from 2000 to 2006 when Vicente Fox Quezada made history for being the first president who was not part of the historically corrupt Institutional Revolutionary    PRI .   According various excerpts from " Mexico : Narco Violence and a Failed State ? " by the late author and prestigious university professor George Grayson , the historically corrupt Institutional Revolutionary   PRI had ruled over Mexico like a monarchy for more than 70 years turning a blind eye to smuggling activities unless they smuggling activities out of line .
