   Donald Trump spoke with President Tsai    of Taiwan on Friday , who offered   Donald Trump congratulations on   Donald Trump victory and discussed the close economic , political , and security ties between the two countries .[ That might seem like an innocent courtesy , but apparently it is a topic of controversy between the United States and China , as any formal recognition of Taiwan severely angers the Chinese .   China views Taiwan as a province , as foreign policy experts were quick to point out , and the United States has severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan since 1979 .The Financial Times reports : Although it is not clear if the Trump transition team intended the conversation to signal a broader change in US policy towards Taiwan , the call is likely to infuriate Beijing which regards Taiwan as a renegade province .
