Lewandowski , bashed the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) for stacking the debate audience here with    consultant class party donor figures .[ Lewandowski told Breitbart News in the spin room after the debate :   I think the RNC does a terrible job in allocating the tickets , to be honest with you ,There ’s RNC —   there’s 2 , 000 seats out there , there ’s six candidates on stage , they should just divide them evenly so everyone has them , but instead they just give them to the donor six candidates on stage , they give six candidates on stage to the lobbyists and six candidates on stage all the special six candidates on stage .
