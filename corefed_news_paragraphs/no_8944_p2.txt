I was disheartened to learn that you recently joined   progressives and Republican establishment elitists by attacking millions of activists like me that support Donald Trump by calling us low information voters .I would encourage you to climb down out of your Ivy League tower and find out just who us are and why us decided to support Donald Trump .You would find among Trump Donald Trump freedom loving activists that share a deep love for our country   â€”    the same deep love Donald Donald Trump articulated in a very persuasive manner .You see , we believe us American exceptionalism and we believe when it comes to trade agreements , the interests of American workers American hold a higher priority than the profits of giant corporations and big banks .
