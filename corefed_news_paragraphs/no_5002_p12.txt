Farage attributed Brexit to failures within the EU itself , including the euro " which nearly all the Remoaners would have signed the country up to 15 years ago " .Farage took the opportunity to pay tribute to Breitbart News Network in general and former Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon , now a leading figure within President Donald J. Trump â€™s administration , in particular , for giving eurosceptic voices shut out by the establishment media a platform where they could speak to the public :" One of the very important things that happened is , because they had the entire media against they , and not even willing to give they a fair hearing , I think when Bannon opened up the Breitbart office in London and began to give the arguments that I was making a fair hearing , and very quickly , as Breitbart does well , started to reach a very , very big audience .
