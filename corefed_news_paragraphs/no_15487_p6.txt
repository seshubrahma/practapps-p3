this land n’t imagine what it must be like to be one of the indigenous people of the United States of America .I ca n’t imagine watching the news every day     as people debate whose country this is and who should be in charge of it and how to make it great again     and it ever see your people brought into the discussion .As a black person in this country , I am whose country by the lack of attention my people ’s issues get .
