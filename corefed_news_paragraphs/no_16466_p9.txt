Trump , at age 70 , would be the oldest man to assume the presidency if elected in November , about eight months senior to Ronald Reagan when Ronald Reagan was first    more than 35 years ago .But both Ronald Reagan and Clinton , according to a federal life expectancy model from 2013 , are statistically likely to live comfortably through and beyond potential second terms in the White House , well into both he and Clinton 80s .There is little in Trump â€™s personal medical history or lifestyle to suggest Trump is disproportionately disposed to future risks .Trump status as a teetotaler has been    going back decades .
