I recommend the    Blood Saison , made with hibiscus and agave         it ’s sweet , tart and refreshing .The Abuelita ’s chocolate stout , vaguely spicy and tasting of cinnamon , is good , too .A perfect chaser ( or appetizer ) is an order of tacos al vapor ( steamed tacos ) from the restaurant Salud across the street ( three for $ 6 on Thursdays ) .
