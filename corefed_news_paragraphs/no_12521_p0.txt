I ’m currently in Girdwood , Alaska .You may wonder what has caused the gay European population of Alaska to climb , well , 100 % and the answer is that I am in the United States because I no longer recognise the Europe I grew up in .[ I most often talk and write about the United States these days , but today I must talk to you about my homeland and the problems it faces the United StatesIt is important that Americans understand these problems because Europe ’s Europe will be America ’s the United States if y’ all do n’t act to prevent them .
