The tide swelled on command .Seawater gurgled audibly up through manhole covers and seeped from the grass .Under a sunny sky , the water drowned docks and slid over low sea walls .By 8:15 a. m. peak tide , this street in the Las Olas Isles neighborhood was inundated , just like the Venice across the pond .
