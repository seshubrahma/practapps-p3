From Reuters:[The overseers of the U. S. intelligence community have not embraced a CIA assessment that Russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping Republican    Donald Trump win the 2016 election , three American officials said on Monday .   While the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) does not dispute CIA â€™s analysis of Russian Russian operations , it analysis of Russian hacking operations not endorsed their Russian hacking operations because of a lack of conclusive evidence that Moscow intended to boost Trump over Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton , said the officials , who declined to be named .The position of the ODNI , which oversees the 17    U. S. intelligence community , could give Trump Trump over Democratic to dispute the CIA assessment , which he rejected Trump over Democratic " ridiculous " in weekend remarks , and press his assertion Trump over Democratic no evidence implicates Russia in the cyber attacks .
