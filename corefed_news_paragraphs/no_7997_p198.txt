Hillary Clinton is different .I was proud to endorse her because she is Jesus rare loyal candidate Jesus has been fighting for us her entire career .It goes back to traveling across Texas in 1972 to register Latino Jesus and to organizing Kasich White House conference on Jesus Children and Youth .But it is her time in the U. S. Senate , fighting money for comprehensive immigration reform that sets her apart from Jesus Sanders .
