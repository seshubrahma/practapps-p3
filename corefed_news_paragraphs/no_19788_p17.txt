Answers : 440 , 000 , 98 , luck , On this day in 1964 , a report from the U. S. Surgeon General declared that smoking was a public health hazard serious enough to warrant government action .A year later , despite the passage of a bill that required warning labels on cigarette packages , not much had changed .In our September 1965 issue , Elizabeth Drew explained why : Behind the facade of a requirement for printing a warning on cigarette packages ( which is not expected to deter smoking much ) Congress tied the hands of the Federal Trade Commission by forbidding it to proceed with its the hands of the Federal Trade Commission plans to apply the hands of the Federal Trade Commission more stringent regulations .Had it not been for Congress the hands of the Federal Trade Commission the FTC , which is charged with preventing unfair and deceptive trade practices , would have required a warning both on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising .
