Working class whites were largely synonymous with union members , who are traditionally staunchly Democratic .As the service economy has grown and manufacturing declined , the profile of union members has changed .In 1980 , 70 % of all voters who came from union households were whites without college degrees in 2012 , the white working class made upjust were 39 % of voters from union households .    and white college graduates were each about 30 % of the union vote in 2012 , almost double their share of the 1980 vote , and those two groups are increasingly Democratic .
