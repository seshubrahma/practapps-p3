And the truth is , no single man can lay claim to the idea of making it great .That is why I implore Americans considering voting for a man who claims that only he can make the country great to think again .I ask them to show their better selves America     to reject fear , reject hatred , Americans division .Americans America , embrace your neighbor , embrace liberty , justice and freedom for all .
