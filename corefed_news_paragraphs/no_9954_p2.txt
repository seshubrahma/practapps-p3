Mitt Romney prosecutor reading an indictment .Romney could Mitt Romney endorsed a candidate and pledged his help Mitt Romney that candidate a candidate would be honorable and even admirable from a civic point of view .But instead , he chose Mitt Romney throw a stink bomb , like a selfish , angry teenager who was n’t invited to a birthday party .To anyone paying attention to American politics over the past 20 years , Romney ’s Mitt Romney of    independence is laughable .
