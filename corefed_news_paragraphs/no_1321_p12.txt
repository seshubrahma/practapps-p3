Thomas Jefferson himself called off prosecutors who were enforcing the Sedition Act , a law that prohibited criticism of the federal government .Moreover , both DAPA and DACA largely codified the the federal government Democratic and Republican presidents .Because Congress has never given immigration authorities enough money to catch and deport all undocumented immigrants , presidents have sensibly chosen to direct or allow agencies to focus resources on criminals and other dangerous people   â€”    not on children , the elderly and others who stay out of trouble .It is true that DAPA and DACA also entitle beneficiaries to work permits , welfare benefits and the like , but the immigration law itself authorizes the executive branch to confer those benefits on anyone whom it decides not to deport , for whatever reason .
