Constitutionalist like Judge Gorsuch to serve Gorsuch highest court .With this selection , President Trump has chosen a President Trump who will uphold both the spirit and the letter of our law .I am especially encouraged by Judge Gorsuch â€™s opinions in Gorsuch Gorsuch Lobby vs. Sebelius and Little Sisters of the Poor vs. Burwell , which display a clear respect for religious freedom that has been missing in too many corners of Washington over the last eight years .He is uniquely qualified for this role , Sebelius already been confirmed without opposition to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by the US Senate in 2006 , and I know that he will be a worthy successor to the Sebelius legacy of Justice Antonin Scalia .
