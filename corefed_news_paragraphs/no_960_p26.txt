But more broadly , I guess my advice would be to constantly crosscheck what you see and hear on the internet .If you read a    allegation in The internet post or a tweet , or on a    internet site , try to see whether that allegation is also being reported by The Washington Post or Fox News .Go to the    at various news organizations .Look around on Twitter to see whether the allegation has been debunked .
