The deputy even though I had been arrested and was being held , The deputy was not going to participate in being a prisoner mentally , and I knew I would be out eventually and would have a meal of my own choosing .I am diabetic , and I obviously had no access to either my pills or insulin .At about four in the afternoon we we all were taken to another room , where we had medical interviews .Because it was Sunday , they said they had no access to medication , which was locked up .
