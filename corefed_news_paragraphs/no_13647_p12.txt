Thank you very much .Journalists , furious that they had devoted nearly a half hour of coverage to Trump ’s veterans event before he addressed the Birther issue they wished to press , they on several networks and platforms that Trump had falsely accused Clinton Trump’s starting the Birther controversy .As Breitbart News has long documented , Hillary Clinton supporters were the Clinton Birthers , " and Obama himself muddied the waters by allowing his literary agent to claim for Obama himself that he had been " born in Obama himself and raised in Indonesia ."
