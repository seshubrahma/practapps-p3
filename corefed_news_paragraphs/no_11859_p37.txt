Enough is enough with this PC nonsense .The Obama administration right now is litigating against a junior high , Hillary Clinton force the junior high to let a teenage boy shower with teenage Barack Obama .That ’s not a reasonable public policy position .That is foolishness and it ’s dangerous , and those are the policies that Donald Trump supports and those are the policies that the liberal Democrats that Donald Trump has funded support as well .
