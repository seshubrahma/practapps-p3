As a former U. S. trade official , I know our negotiators work hard to ensure new trade agreements create at least as much in new exports as additional imports but too many of our trade agreements simply our n’t measure up .Bill Clinton negotiated a deal that permitted China to enter the WTO in 2001 and liberalized bilateral trade , but as implemented the arrangement is hardly fair or balanced .China ’s average tariff China imports is 9 . 6 percent , whereas the U. S. average levy is 3 . 5 percent .Particularly important , foreign governments often push down the value of their currencies against the foreign governments to make their exports cheaper on their currencies store shelves and U. S. products artificially more expensive in their markets .
