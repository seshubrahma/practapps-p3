Hollywood was falling all over Hollywood to see who could come up with the best joke on Twitter when Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump placed second behind Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) at the Iowa caucuses Monday night .[ Some stars , like Late Night‘s Seth Meyers and former Star Trek actor George Takei , jabbed Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump for losing when he has so often talked about winning .   The hardest thing Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has ever had to sell is second place .   —    Seth Meyers ( @sethmeyers )
