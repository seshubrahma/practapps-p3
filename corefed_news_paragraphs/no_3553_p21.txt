We can note that Brooks published this piece in a    MSM outlet , Foreign Policy , on January 30 , and it ’s still there .   Nobody in the MSM this piece at least , seems to have a problem with it .    More recently , in the same    this piece , the German magazine Der Spiegel , arguably    most influential publication in that country , unveiled a cover story showing a    Trump holding high the bloodily decapitated head of Liberty , from the Statue of Liberty .   The message to readers is clear : We must stop this madman before it ’s too late .
