I tend to judge based on my personal observations and tend to shun the magic of statistics .Having said that , I see far more evidence of Trump support here in the " liberal " and " educated " Northeast than perhaps for any other candidate in my lifetime .And I tend to think the " white working class " story line is more media mythology .Trump has tapped into a vein of anger .
