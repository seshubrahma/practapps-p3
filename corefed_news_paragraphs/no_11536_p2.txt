So I think the concern for many of these women is not what Amy Walter past was butwhat Amy Walter ’s going to be when Amy Walter ’s president of the United States .I think that that ’s what you ’re going to hear much more about from whether it ’s the Clinton campaign or Democrats focusing on what is it going to mean if Amy Walter is commander in chief and the president of the United States .WALLACE :
