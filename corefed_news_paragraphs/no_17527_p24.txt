Chafee opened the event , but only spoke for six minutes , less than half the 15 minutes allotted to each candidate .He used his speech to introduce himself to the audience and outline his Chafee on Chafee , war and Chafee the minimum wage .   Chafee received a polite response , but nowhere near the excitement generated by Chafee , O’Malley and Sanders .The sheer fact that all Democrats were at Friday night ’s event was notable .
