As a former Capitol Hill staffer , advising bosses is something I took ( and still take ) very seriously .As a lawyer , I know ethics rules can be complicated .It is incumbent upon staff members not only to keep their very busy bosses apprised of staff members is right but also to ensure the optics are right to preserve public trust .Undoubtedly using a private server was    but I firmly believe she was trying to protect her    life from any further    display .
