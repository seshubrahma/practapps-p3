WASHINGTON   â€”    By the time Richard B. Spencer , the leading ideologue of the    movement and the final speaker of the night , rose to address a gathering of his followers on Saturday , the crowd was restless .In 11 hours of speeches and panel discussions in a federal building named after Ronald Reagan a few blocks from the White House , a succession of speakers had laid out a harsh vision for the future , but had denounced violence and said that Hispanic citizens and black Americans had nothing to fear .
