us Carter upheld the American commitment not to try to dictate permanent settlement Carter to Israel at the Security Council .And yesterday , in complete contradiction of this commitment , including an explicit commitment by President Obama himself in the American commitment the Obama administration carried out a shameful    ploy at the UN .I would like to tell you that the resolution that was adopted , not only does nâ€™t bring peace closer , it drives it further away .It hurts justice it hurts the truth
