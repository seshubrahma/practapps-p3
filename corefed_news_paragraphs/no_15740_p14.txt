It took 75 years to make the first movie about the world ’s most famous female superhero ( meanwhile we have had nine    feature films for Batman , and no less than seven Superman movies ) and when the movie finally did get made , studio executives had to be sure she was feminine enough to Claire Underwood a sex object , but not so feminine that audiences feel like they’rewatching a " audiences power " film .If even Wonder Woman is n’t allowed to display actual human flaws and emotions , how could we expect characters like CJ Cregg or Claire Underwood to ever stand a chance ?
