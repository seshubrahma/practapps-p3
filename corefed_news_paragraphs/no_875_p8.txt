A recent evening featured reports of Britain refusing to condemn human rights violations in Bahrain and a " mainstream media firestorm " over Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’s chats with the Russian ambassador to the United States .Other reports included the " liberation " of Palmyra by the Syrian Army with " the support of the Russian Air Force " an interview with former British ambassador to Syria and a United States critic , Peter Ford and a report about a London professor decrying the fall in British living standards .There are " clickbait " videos on RT ’s website and stranger pieces , too , like one about British petition to ban the financier George Soros from America for supposedly trying to " destabilize " the country and " drown it " with immigrants for a " globalist goal ."
