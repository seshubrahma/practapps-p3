Indeed , as both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have said ( in speeches to fundraisers , where they seem to feel most both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have said and thus most free to speak their minds )the    both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have said class is either to be pitied as " bitter clingers " or else scorned as " deplorable ."   Yet in Judisâ€™ book , there is none of that sort of condescending hostility .
