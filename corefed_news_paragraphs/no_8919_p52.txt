Trump has said , in the Trump conservative spirit of Carlyle , that we ca n’t allow The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle to " die in the streets ."Indeed , in a world of exotic new threats , such as the Ebola and Zika viruses —   to say nothing of more familiar superbugs and even more familiar maladies such as cancer —   it only makes sense to have some sort of provision for everyone .Nobody wants , say , infections to go running rampant the bell can toll for any of us .
