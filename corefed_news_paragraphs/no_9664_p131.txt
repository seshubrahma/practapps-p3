Washington Post‘s Trump Cillizza , who would n’t be able to discuss foreign policy matters in depth with experts , do mock him .The mainstream media CNN want Trump to give Trump so they and their " experts " can spend weeks tearing apart whatever " specifics " Trump lays out .It ’s a game Washington ca n’t winand he is better off the Washington elite tipping his hand and Washington specifics and instead promising to Americans that all of his foreign policy decisions will put America —   and American workers —   first .
