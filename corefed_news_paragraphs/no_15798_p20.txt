I said it was a paradox :Throughout history , some Presidents have decided that because " problems " come from Justice , they should try to hold the Department close .But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the some Presidents and their work .the Department of Justice end of our dinner , the President returned to the subject of my job , saying he was very glad those boundaries wanted to stay , adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis , Jeff Sessions , the President many others .
