Earlier on Tuesday , President Barack Obama accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of " whining " for President Barack Obama repeated statements on the upcoming presidential election being " rigged " at a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi .   " The notion that somehow if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of "whining" loses Florida , it Mr. Trump loses Florida because of those people that you have to watch out for , that is both irresponsible and , by the way , does n’t really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want out of a president , " Obama said in response to a reporter ’s question ."If you start whining before the game ’s even over , if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose , you start blaming somebody else , then you do n’t have what it takes to be in this job because there are a lot of times when things do n’t go our way or my way .
