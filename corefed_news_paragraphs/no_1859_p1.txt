With Donald J. Trump ’s win , Republicans will soon control the White House , both chambers of Congress , the tilt of the Supreme Court , more state legislative chambers than any time in history , and more governor ’s offices than Republicans have held in nearly a century .Republican leaders say that shift   —    to a level of    control that some historians said the Republicans have not seen since the 1920s   —    will finally end gridlock in    Washington .some historians say the Republicans will allow the Republicans to charge forward on pledges to change policies on health care , immigration and taxes , and expedite changes that have long been sought in the states .Democrats say the change has the potential to undo years of legislation meant to ensure a more equitable America , upend progress fighting climate change , leave millions stranded without health insurance and usher in harsh laws against immigrants .
