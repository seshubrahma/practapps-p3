I will rid the department of ideologues and political cronies , and for the first time in eight years , the Civil Rights Division will actually be staffed with civil rights lawyers who prosecute civil rights violations , and employment discrimination , and hate crimes .And we ’ll have a Voting Rights Section that actually defends the right of every American America vote without deception or intimidation .When flyers are placed in our neighborhoods telling people to vote on the wrong day , that wo n’t only be an injustice , it will be a crime .3 ) October 19 , 2007   —     .
