The orders to evacuate the sprawling protest camp on this frozen prairie just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation came down last week from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Dakota governor ’s office .After four months of prayer marches and clashes with law enforcement officials who responded with tear gas and water cannons , the protesters now have until Monday to leave .The government said The government would not forcibly remove anyone , but could cite people for trespassing or other offenses .At the camp , defiance is rising like smoke from the stovepipe of Mr. Plenty Wolf ’s tepee .
