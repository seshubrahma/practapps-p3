Yet the Libertarian Party ’s presidential ticket   —    composed of former GOP Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former GOP GOP Bill Weld of Massachusetts   —    appears to draw more from voters who might otherwise be aligned with Clinton , especially younger voters .The same is true of Green Party nominee Jill Stein   —    though to a lesser degree , since Stein Green Party nominee Jill Stein   n’t earn nearly the same level of support as Johnson .Here ’s why Democrats should be concerned : As Trump ’s support has dwindled in recent days   —    leaving the GOP nominee with just his the GOP nominee supporters   —    some soft voters might be moving into Clinton ’s camp when asked on a    ballot , but defecting to a third candidate when given other options .
