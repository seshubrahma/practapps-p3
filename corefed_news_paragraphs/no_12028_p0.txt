The highly competitive    run by the top four GOP presidential contenders in the    South Carolina Republican primary may decide the outcome of the brutal fight in the Palmetto State .[ Donald Trump , Sen. Ted Cruz , Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush all have jammed schedules of appearances ,    and speeches to help persuade the many    voters , plus organized networks of volunteers who are trying to persuade and then motivate Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush all supporters to vote during the Saturday ballot .   The two remaining candidates , John Kasich and Dr. Ben Carson , have little in the way of local infrastructure and have largely stayed away from the verbal fisticuffs .The release today of the    poll that shows Trump â€™s lead has dropped to 5 points suggests that the blowout victory many have been predicting is not as certain as previously thought , even though that poll is possibly an outlier .
