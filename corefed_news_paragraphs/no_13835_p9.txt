That ’s what Pence meant when he admonished Pence members that " Remind American people of what they already know about Obamacare GOP members the promises that Obamacare made were all broken , and I expect you ’ll see an effort in the days ahead to talk about the facts around Obamacare ."When    House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel argued forcefully to use the Democrats huge 2009 majorities to pass health care reform , he did so by predicting Rahm Emanuel once Americans have a benefit , they wo n’t want to Americans it .It is going to be a long 2017 as we watch and learn whether he was right .
