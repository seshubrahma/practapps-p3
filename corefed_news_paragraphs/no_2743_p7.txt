It turns out that after the acrimonious presidential election , people were coming together at the movies .Then again , packed theaters could also be chalked up to the number of solid mainstream releases , including " Arrival , " " Almost Christmas , " " Doctor Strange " and " Moana ."It ’s worth noting that even the most    popular movies   —    as I write , Pixar ’s " Finding Dory " tops the yearly box office   —    are unlikely to show up on many    lists or scoop up critics’ awards .
