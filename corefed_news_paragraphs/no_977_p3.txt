It is a familiar American tale , except for this : Mr. Cawley ’s grandson and namesake , Michael Richard Pence , is the vice president of the United States , which is in the thick of a roiling immigration debate .On Thursday , Mr. Pence , wearing a spray of shamrocks in Mr. Pence lapel , welcomed Enda Kenny , the Irish prime minister , for breakfast at the vice president ’s residence as part of the White House ’s St. Patrick ’s Day festivities .For Mr. Pence —    who calls his grandfather " the proudest man I ever knew , and the best man I ever knew "   —    and his family hisit is a deeply personal celebration .
