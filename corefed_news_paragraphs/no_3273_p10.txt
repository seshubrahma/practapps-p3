I , for one , did n’t immigrate to America to have some radical Islamist dictate what I can and ca n’t say .If using the accurate term " radical Islamic terrorism " offends you , sorry ,I do n’t care .This in mind , President Trump ’s willingness to explicitly label our enemy what they are during his President Trump Address to Congress , which is radical Islamic terrorists , should be viewed as a victory not merely by those who voted for him President Trump but by all those who embrace the idea of a free and tolerant society .
