To the extent that 60 , 000 additional refugees can be considered a class President Barack Obama , EO2 makes no findings to justify barring entry in excess of 50 , 000 as detrimental to the interests of the United States .EO2 gives no explanation for why the 50 , 001st to the 110 , 000th refugee would be harmful to the national interest , nor does it specify any further threat to national security .And there is not any rationale explaining why the previous the United States 110 , 000 EO2 this fiscal year was justified by humanitarian concerns or otherwise in the national interest , see 8 U. S. C. ยง 1157 ( a)(2 ) 000th refugee that the entry of more than 50 , 000 refugees this same fiscal year would be detrimental to the national interest .Here too , the President did not meet the statutory precondition of exercising his authority under ยง 1182 ( f ) to cap refugee admissions .
