"The message to the political and media elite was that peaceful gun owners would use every peaceful means necessary to resist laws and " interpretations " that infringe on constitutional rights .Just because Hillary Clinton decrees a limit on magazine capacity or which " scary looking guns " are banned does nâ€™t mean that otherwise    gun owners will comply .If Hillary and or her SCOTUS try to reinterpret the 2nd Amendment millions Hillary Clinton they have Hillary Clinton not to comply .
