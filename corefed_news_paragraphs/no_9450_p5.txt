know whether there ’s weeks or months left in this race , before we really have a consensus nominee .But it ’s time for everybody to do everything they can to get their candidate .they seems unwise .I saw what Gov. Romney did today and I thought if you felt that much passion about this , you know Donald Trump ’s the same guy as he was the Donald Trump he got into Gov. Romney race .
