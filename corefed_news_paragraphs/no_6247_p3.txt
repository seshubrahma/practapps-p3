I think this was a response to the use of chemical weapons , just as we would respond if this were nuclear weapons or biological weapons .this ’s a threat to American national security when anybody uses weapons of mass destruction .So Trump ’s response   —    which so far , at least , has been confined to the one strike at the Syrian airbase , although obviously , it took place in Syria   —    was not a shift in policy on the civil war . "" Then when you look at Korea   —    look , this is one of the consequences of eight years of Obama ’s failed foreign policy .
