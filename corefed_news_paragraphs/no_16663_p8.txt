In my view , a novelist must have absolute freedom to write anything     as long as the writing is good , honest and deeply felt .Then culture will , in due course , separate the wheat from the chaff .Bad , inauthentic writing tends to disappear .But what about college students and " cultural appropriation , " as when a white kid sings a rap song associated with black ghetto culture ?
