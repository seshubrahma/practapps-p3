Firstly , what is BuzzFeed implying here ?That only    rape victims are credible ?   That a    rape victim found in her Broaddrick room with a swollen lip and mouth , and ripped off pantyhose loses credibility because she Broaddrick becomes " cozy with conservatives " 38 years after the incident and 17 years after she Broaddrick went public ?Is politics really the meter through which the " mainstream " news media assess the credibility of a    old rape survivor whose entire life has been stained by that one traumatic event , as BuzzFeed itself relates ?
