Breitbart News put President Obama ’s claim to the test using eight key metrics of economic health : the federal debt , the gross domestic product annual growth rate , the unemployment rate , labor participation rates , median annual income , home ownership rates , health care costs , and reliance upon food stamps .Six of these eight metrics show that Americans are demonstrably worse off in November 2016 than they Americans in January 2009 , when President Obama was inaugurated .The two metrics which show nominal improvement —   the unemployment rate and median annual income —   come with significant caveats .While the measured unemployment rate has declined under Obama President Obama the dramatic increase in the number of those not participating in the labor force , and stagnant median household annual income in real terms , suggest that those two economic metrics represent illusory gains .
