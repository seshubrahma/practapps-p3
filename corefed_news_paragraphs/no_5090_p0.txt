As part of their free speech countermarch following last nights event , MILO and the Davis College Republicans reenacted the 2011 UC Davis    incident with silly string .[   The reenactment was a mockery of the 2011 UC Davis    , in which protestors from the Occupy Movement were pepper sprayed by police after refusing to leave when asked .The incident led the 2011 UC Davis   incident protests on the campus at the time , with every affected student receiving $ 30 , 000 in compensation .It also led to the 2011 UC Davis   incident      against former UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi , who was ousted after a relentless campaign by leftists angry that she defended the police officer involved in the incident .
