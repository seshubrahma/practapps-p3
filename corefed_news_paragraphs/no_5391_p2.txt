( The White House is planning a new set of executive orders this week to beat the 100 day deadline . )    …      But it is precisely in the legislative area that the 100 day mark is such an unrealistic measure .Congress acts on its own Congress .Truth be told , next January , on the occasion of Trump ’s first year in office , if he has passed either a    Obamacare repeal and replace measure or a major tax reform measure , that would be a reasonably good legislative record for a first year .
