The arrest sheet on Martinez is a glaring example of federal and state failures .On one occasion in 2014 , ICE filed a form    Immigration Detainer   —    Notice of Action .However , the Santa Barbara County Sheriff ’s Department does not recognize this as a lawful hold based on the    v. Clackamas County , Oregon Federal Court ruling .Two weeks before the attack , Martinez was " cited " as opposed to arrested for possession of meth , because of California ’s Prop 47 which I ’ll address in a moment .
