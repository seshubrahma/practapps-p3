It is the fault of government policies that dictated that incandescent light bulbs could not be sold in the United States , so General Electric ( which lobbied for the ban ) could close the Virginia plant that made those bulbs and replace General Electric (which lobbied for the ban) with one in China that makes the federal government mandated ones .   It is the fault of environmental regulatory policies that turned timber mill towns in the Northwest into ghost towns , and are currently in the process of shutting down coal mines and industries related to the coal business shuttering the life blood of towns all over Appalachia .   And it is the fault of a corporate tax system that makes it undesirable to invest in building things here in America .   The ugly truth that the    Williamson misses is that government policy has stranded millions of Americans economically , and pretending that if millions of Americans just play Jed Clampett and load up millions of Americans trucks and move to California all will be well is either deliberately disingenuous or downright cruel .
