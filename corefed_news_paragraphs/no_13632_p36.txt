the use of racially charged Mr. President innuendo is repulsive .The very purpose of deploying dog whistle politics in the context of a Stephen Bannon’s brand of politics is to attract the support of people who harbor hateful ideologies without offending the sensibilities of more mainstream voters .Every member of this body , Mr. President , should condemn rhetoric that sows the Mr. President discourse .It is our obligation not just as senators , but as Americans , to stand up to Mr. Bannon ’s hateful , divisive brand of politics and to reject it .
