This argument holds that since some of the supporters from each of the other candidates would flow to Trump , the best strategy is for everyone to stay in , and hold a 60 to 65 percent    parachute open until the Republican Party floats into a brokered convention .Trump has less than half Trump delegates awarded thus far , and only a little over a third of the popular vote .The idea is that upcoming     primaries could translate Trump â€™s polls into a Trump thrashing that ruins his    narrative .However Trump those     races could also help Trump build a string of Trump state leads into an overwhelming pile of delegates .
