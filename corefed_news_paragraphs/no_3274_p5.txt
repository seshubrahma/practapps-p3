The American public ’s contradictory emotions slide in various directions , depending on minor changes to questions .For example , when asked by Reuters’ pollster if the U. S. should " open our borders to refugees of foreign conflicts , " the percentage of respondents strongly supporting an apparently unlimited number of refugees jumped up to 19 percent , almost double the 10 percent in the prior " limit the number of refugees" question .   That question and answer suggests that Americans do not recognize the " open borders " term as a      for mass migration by 100 million people from Africa , Arabia and Asia .
