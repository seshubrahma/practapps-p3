I was particularly proud of the deal I scored on my lodging through Airbnb , which happened to be in Prospect Heights :$ 75 a night for a private room on the top floor of a gorgeous townhouse .The owners , who work in the visual arts , were generous and accommodating .The neighborhood itself , a small sliver wedged between Park Slope and Crown Heights , ended up being an ideal location .
