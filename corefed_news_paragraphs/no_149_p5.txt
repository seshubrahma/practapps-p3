My husband is a court officer and volunteers in the police force .[ President Obama ] did n’t support law enforcement the way President Obama] did the community that felt law enforcement were being unjustly treated .I think he could have done a better job instead of pointing blame .Instead of saying we need to educate people on how to behave when people ’re being pulled over by the police .
