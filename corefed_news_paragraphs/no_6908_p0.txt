Peter S. Goodman writes in the New York Times that the Davos elite are well aware of the " populist fury " fueled by    people around the world who have borne the brunt of globalist economic policies .[ Peter S. Goodman notes , " If the world is indeed in the throes of a populist insurrection , the pitchforks could do worse than to point here .The Davos elites have enjoyed outsize influence over economic policies in recent decades as a growing share of wealth has , perhaps not coincidentally , landed in the coffers of people with a need for bank accounts in the British Virgin Islands , while poor and    households have seen their poor and   households stagnate and decline . "   From the New York Times : You have perhaps noticed that in many countries ,    numbers of people have grown enraged at the economic elite and their tendency to hog the spoils of globalization .
