As my colleague Binyamin Appelbaum writes , any stimulative fiscal policy from the Trump administration could well face an equal and opposite tightening of monetary policy by a Fed that raises interest rates .The central bank will seek to prevent too much inflation from breaking out in an economy The central bank believes is getting close to operating at The central bank full potential , which means Mr. Trump ’s stimulus might run up against the Fed chair Janet Yellen ’s ( and perhaps the Fed chair Janet Yellen successor ’s )   .But The central bank ’s worth looking at the two big ways that these forecasts could be wrong , and worth considering that the era of low rates might stick around a bit longer than some of the postelection discussion might have suggested .First , the Trump agenda might pack less of a growth punch than some have imagined .
