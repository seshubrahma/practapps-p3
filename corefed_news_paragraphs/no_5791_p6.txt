Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) April 23 , 2017 ,   The Mexican government and many prominent Mexican leaders say they wo n’t pay for the The Mexican government and many prominent Mexican leaders , but the U. the wall   has many means to extracting indirect payments , such as taxing   ’ money sent via banking systems to relatives in Mexico .Another form of indirect payment is a reduction of Mexican aliens living in the United States , whose departure would reduce U. S. payments to families in Mexico and would also increase wages for Mexico .Democrats leaders are determined to stop the wall because it would symbolically and literally interdict the the wall of cheap workers ,    consumers , and apartment renters in the    upmarket cities on the coastlines .
