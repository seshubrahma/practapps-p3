S. government needs to lay down a vision , an actual " threat doctrine analysis " in a thorough document , just like George Kennan â€™s Long Telegram and    did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War .The new incoming Trump administration , therefore , must articulate a threat doctrine analysis and then shape it into a threat doctrine analysis    doctrine of offense .
