WASHINGTON   —    Gov. John Kasich of Ohio on Tuesday signed into law a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy , but vetoed a far more restrictive measure that would have barred abortions after a fetal heartbeat was detected , as early as six weeks into a pregnancy .In reaching the split decision on the two bans , adopted last week by the Ohio legislature , Mr. Kasich said a far more restrictive measure that would have barred abortions after a fetal heartbeat was detected was " clearly contrary to the Supreme Court ’s current rulings on abortion ."
