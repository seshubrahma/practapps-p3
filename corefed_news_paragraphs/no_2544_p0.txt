JERUSALEM   —    For years , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , a conservative , has played a double act , competing domestically with his    rivals in backing the settlement project all over the occupied West Bank while professing support for a    solution with the Palestinians .Now , with the stinging United Nations Security Council resolution on Friday condemning Israeli settlement construction as lacking any legal validity , Israeli politicians and analysts on the right , on the left and in the political center say Mr. Netanyahu ’s game may soon be up .The Israeli right , feeling empowered by the advent of the Trump administration , which is expected to be more sympathetic to Israel ’s current policies , is pushing Mr. Netanyahu’s to abandon the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel Israel long considered the only viable solution to the conflict .
