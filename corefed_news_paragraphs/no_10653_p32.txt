Mark Knoller ( @markknoller ) June 9 , 2016 ,   6:18 :RNC calls Warren a " sellout " for endorsing Clinton :By endorsing Hillary Clinton , Elizabeth Warren has shown herself to be a sellout .Whether it â€™s the Wall Street speech transcripts Warren to release , Warren ties to the fossil fuel industry , or coziness with big banks , Warren Clinton represents everything Elizabeth Warren supposedly stands against .
