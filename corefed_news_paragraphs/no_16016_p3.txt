Impersonal power structures have reduced our lives as citizens to passive spectatorship .Until now .Now we are seeing a Great Pushback against concentrated political and economic power     a sprawling , disorderly effort by people on the right , the left , and everywhere in between who have felt shut out of the public arena .From Bernie ’s revolutionaries to Trump ’s    to Black Lives Matter activists , from moms against gun violence to libertarians against Big Brother     citizens are no longer accepting being small pawns of big players .
