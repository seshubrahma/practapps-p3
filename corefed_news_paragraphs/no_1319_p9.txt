Their presence in some of the They ’s busiest transit hubs recalls a far grittier time in the city when violent crime was rampant and transportation stations were crowded with many more homeless people .Like many who live on the streets , the people in these hubs are what advocates describe as chronically resistant to offers of services , especially beds in shelters , which many homeless people say have too many rules and are rife with danger .Indeed , the city ’s shelter system has been rocked by several episodes of violence recently , including the murders of six residents this year .New York City officials say about 58 , 000 people are the city , and that an estimated 3 , 000 sleep on the streets or in the subways every night .
