Carl Azuz .   Thank you for taking the time to watch .It was the first time that President Trump met face to face since the American leader was inaugurated .   In a news conference Wednesday , President Trump said U. S. would encourage a great peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians , but that it would be the two sides themselves that would have to directly negotiate that agreement .
