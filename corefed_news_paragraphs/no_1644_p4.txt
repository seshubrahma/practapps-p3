In our country Jesus said that a house divided can not stand .Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a    society .In business , we hire , retain and award based on merit .In society , however , we have divisions that can Our be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and Our equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country .
