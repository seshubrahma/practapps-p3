I â€™m not voting for a new entitlement program .senators they want new entitlement programs and they want new government ,    senators can put that separately as senators replacement bill , but the repeal they want new entitlement programs and they want new government,    ought to be a repeal ."Other Republicans say a replacement bill still room to for lawmakers to make changes , but they warn lawmakers not to let perfect be the enemy of the good .
