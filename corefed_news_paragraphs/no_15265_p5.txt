It â€™s a losing argument to convince Americans that government programs which they perceive Americans providing benefits should be cut .So if the Republicans wanted to shrink government programs , their best the Republicans was to lower tax revenues , making less money available to Washington for spending .For decades , Republican presidents have made tax cuts a priority .President Reagan pushed through a historic tax cut in the summer of 1981 that lowered the top rate from 70 % to 50 % for individuals and lowered corporate income taxes by over $ 150 billion .
