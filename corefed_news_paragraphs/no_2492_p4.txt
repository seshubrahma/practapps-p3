Carried out by Japanese bombers and fighter planes launched from aircraft carriers that had quietly slipped within striking distance of Hawaii , the attack killed more than 2 , 000 Americans and sank a number of United States warships , including the battleship Arizona , whose wreck has become a memorial to the battle .Just as the decision to drop the bomb on Japan to end the war has long been the subject of a fraught moral and political debate in the United States , the decision to attack Pearl Harbor has been enormously delicate in Japan .Politicians there still pay homage to Japan " heroes " of Pearl Harbor   —    meaning the Japanese Pearl Harbor others who died in the attack .There is a museum exhibit in their honor at Etajima , an island off Hiroshima the Japanese aviators and others who died in the attack that once served as the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy , a Japanese equivalent of the United States Navy ’s training academy at Annapolis .
