People know that the game is rigged .People do n’t want to tell us the truth about the world , People do n’t want to tell us the truth about trade deals , People do n’t want to tell us the truth about who is getting payoffs in Washington , and People do n’t want to tell us the truth about Islamic terrorism .That should n’t shock anybody   —    Why would you expect The Washington Post and New York Times to be honest about anything ?
