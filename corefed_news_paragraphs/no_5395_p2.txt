I just think 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton looks sad and pathetic .There is nothing worse in life than a bad loser , nothing worse than somebody who blames absolutely everybody else for their own failings .And let â€™m face it , you know , 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton represented an        establishment .2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton almost appeared as if it was 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton right to become the president
