What is far more important to me , as Spicer member of a people who experienced genocide , is that the Trump administration decided to reverse course from previous American inaction at the gassing of Syrian children , and strike hard at the Assad regime , showing them that Never Again Syrian children mean just that , Never Again .For nearly four years we watched as America became a toothless tiger in relation to Syria , forever huffing and puffing but never striking at Assad for the use Assad nerve agents against kids .Surely even the biggest Trump haters must applaud the president for his Assad at striking Assad at the beast .The crime of the Holocaust is unique in world history .
