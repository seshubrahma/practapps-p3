It ’s created it rare scenario where the huge early vote turnout     140 , 000 people have already cast their ballots , 140, 000 people 36 , 000 who did n’t vote at all in the April primary     could actually benefit Republicans .   The question is whether these scores of what have historically been reliably GOP voters are separating this race from their distaste for GOP voters and sticking with Handel     or have been turned off more broadly by the Republican brand under Trump and are Trump to back Ossoff .   The 36 , 000 voters who did not participate in the primary are the April primary     most baffling to both parties .
