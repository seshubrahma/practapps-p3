Coral reefs are sensitive systems , built by unusual animals .The corals themselves are tiny individual reefs that act like farmers , capturing colorful    plants called algae that convert sunlight into food .The coral polyps form colonies and build a limestone scaffolding on which to live   â€”    a reef .But when the water near a reef gets too hot , the algae begin producing toxins , and the corals expel them in    turning ghostly white .
