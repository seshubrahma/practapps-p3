" he I mean , the distributor of this film told me that all of the work    we have done   —    the film festivals , all the press , the public    appearances , the theatrical release   —    it all has one goal , which    is to be No . 1 VOD on the first VOD weekend , because there is so    much product out there on demand that if you ’re not in the top    five it does n’t matter anymore because people ca n’t get through    it all .So you got to try to be No . 1 on VOD release .
