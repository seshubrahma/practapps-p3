Just as it is no coincidence that Trump is targeting Lewis as we prepare to mark a day remembering Martin Luther King , it is not accidental that Lynch will deliver Lynch final speech as attorney general in Birmingham , a major site not only in Martin Luther King life but also in the civil rights movement writ large     and located in a state that is home to her Lynch .   Trump and his nominee for attorney general , Jeff Sessions , represent the    face of American politics on racial justice .   By normalizing the demonization of predominantly black neighborhoods across the nation as unworthy of federal protection and resources , Trump signals to both ordinary citizens and political institutions the value that should be placed on the black folk who live there .   Sessions , meanwhile , has adopted less combative rhetoric but has called the Voting Rights Act " intrusive , " prosecuted civil rights activists for voter fraud and expressed support for voter ID laws .
