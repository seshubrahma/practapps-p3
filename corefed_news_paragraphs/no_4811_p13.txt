Juan Hernandez , as I said , is a dual citizen of Mexico and the United States , and he has been very Mexico in U. S. politics .In Señor Hernandez , working from his Texas home , he was named as presidential candidate John Señor Hernandez ’s chief of Señor Hernandez to Hispanic Americans .    You can make of that connection with John McCain what you will maybe the guy just needed a job .But as for myself Señor Hernandez would worry if my candidate were endorsed by the Señor Hernandez Hernandez characters of the world , and I am delighted that Señor Juan Hernandez is apoplectic over the plans announced by President Trump .
