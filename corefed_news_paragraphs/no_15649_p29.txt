Why ?   NOAA expects sea surface temperatures to be average or above average , and it does n’t expect a lot of NOAA wind shear which can weaken hurricanes .   Forecasting these storms is NOAA an exact science .   Experts at Colorado State University predicted a season with slightly below average activity .    The U. S. has n’t had a major hurricane make landfall since 2005 .
