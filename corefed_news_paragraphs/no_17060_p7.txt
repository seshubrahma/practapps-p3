And many people were fearful when Ronald Reagan     considered by many to be a loose cannon and known by all to have little experience in foreign relations     assumed the presidency .He turned it around Ronald Reagan becoming the presidency as " the Great Communicator , " skillfully , forcefully but eloquently demanding that the Soviets be true to human rights .The Cold War was grinding to a halt .My prayer of hope is that Trump experiences a similar transformation .
