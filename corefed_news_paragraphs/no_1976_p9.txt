The good news is that Indiana has been doing well economically , with an unemployment rate below the national average and steady gains in Indiana like food service , retail and logistics .But those service jobs pay well below the $ 20 to $ 25 an hour that veteran Carrier employees   —    with only a high school diploma   —    can earn building furnaces and fan coils in Indianapolis .The typical manufacturing worker in the state earns $ 59 , 000 a year , about $ 20 , 000 a year more than the typical service job .And for less credentialed workers , that margin is the difference between having a shot at a    life , including owning a home and sending children to college , and having to struggle to make ends meet .
