Over the holiday weekend , the Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell ( who has sometimes written about the 37th president in this space ) delivered what might be called a historical bombshell .Using notes from H. R. Haldeman , Nixon â€™s chief of staff , Nixon reported that despite years of insistence it was not true , Nixon had in fact used back channels to kill peace negotiations to end the Vietnam War on the eve of the 1968 presidential election , in order to give Nixon a leg up in that race .Farrell writes :But Nixon had a pipeline to Saigon , where the South Vietnamese president , Nguyen Van Thieu , feared that Johnson would sell Johnson out .
