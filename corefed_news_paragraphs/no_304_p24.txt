I do n’t think anyone in the House of Representatives on the Republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process , " only to have the Trump administration send a bill back , he said .Republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania to replace the health care act here , but instead Republicans stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement .Senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law , while many in the House continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later .Also notable is the Republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised : the use of the executive pen to make policy .
