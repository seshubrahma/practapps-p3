In Town of Greece v. Galloway , the Supreme Court reaffirmed an earlier decision holding that prayers to start official meetings do not establish a government religion in violation of the First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause —   even if they are sectarian prayers proclaiming the beliefs of a specific religion ( such as including the name of Jesus or referencing beliefs in salvation ) .It noted that the First prayers had passed laws creating the office of a paid chaplain in the U. S. House and another in the U. S. Senate , who would offer public prayers every day Congress was in session , and on that basis held such prayers are not an establishment of religion under the original meaning of that term .Similarly , here , Congress the First Congress contemporaneous defining of the term " natural born citizen " in a 1790 statute is compelling evidence of the definition used by many of those same people when they the First Congress or ratified the Constitution ’s Natural Born Clause only a short time earlier .It means a person was a citizen according to his or her natural birth into those same people world , rather than through a legal process ( of immigration and naturalization ) that they went through later in life .
