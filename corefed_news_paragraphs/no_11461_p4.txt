CLINTON :Well , first of all , people have voted for me overwhelmingly in CLINTON Democratic primary process .and that is absolutely clear , and very different from where we were in 2008 .I could make the case , which I did , that I was actually slightly ahead in the popular vote when we ended that we , but i was behind in the pledged delegates super delegates also fair to say that i have been vetted and tested , and I think that that puts me in a very strong position .
