m not sure what reaction Kathy Griffin wanted our to havewhen Kathy Griffin posed for a photo with a bloody , decapitated mask of Donald Trump .But there are no good ones to be had after looking at a picture like that .In the more forgiving ( but still unforgivable ) metaphorical version , I suppose Kathy Griffin â€™s suggesting that comedians like Kathy Griffin will symbolically take Donald Trump down with comedians like her wit and humor and moral superiority .
