Polling in primaries is always difficult , because voters are choosing between candidates when they may have genuinely divided feelings .Most voters the candidates , being of the same party , will have at least some appeal to voters .This difficulty is compounded in a state like New Hampshire , where voters have historically waited until the last possible moment to decide on a candidate .In 2008 and 2012 , around 20 percent of voters made their final decision on election day itself .
