This would be an unmitigated political disaster .The stories   —    of people with cancer , diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their diabetes and more and left out in the cold   —    would very likely dominate our discussion for months .That leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections .With no Democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame , I think this would be akin to what happened in the the 2018 midterm elections but in reverse .
