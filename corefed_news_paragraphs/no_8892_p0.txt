Nigel Farage , former leader of Great Britain ’s UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) and the figurehead of the " Brexit " movement ’s upset victory , appeared at a Donald Trump campaign rally in Jackson , Mississippi Wednesday night , encouraging the crowd to fight the American political establishment like the people of Britain did just months ago .    Farage framed the current political election as a fight between " ordinary , decent people " and powerful globalist institutions ."If the little people , if the real people , if the ordinary , decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what the ordinary, decent people believe in , we can overcome the big banks , we can overcome the multinationals , " he declared after an introduction from Trump .
