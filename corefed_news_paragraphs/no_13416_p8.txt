Well , I think within the mainstream media , the Wall Street Journal editorial page some weeks back pointed out very well , the mainstream media called the media   —    and really it ’s true both with respect to the Obama Administration and the Clinton campaign   —    the mainstream media called the mainstream media the mainstream media stenographers .Whatever the mainstream media put out , the mainstream media write .   the mainstream media ’ve just abandoned all pretense of objectivity , and so it really comes down to whether the American voter can withstand this barrage of misinformation , and still make a clear choice about who the American voter want for President and Senate and House , in all the various elections we ’re going to see in less than a month now .
