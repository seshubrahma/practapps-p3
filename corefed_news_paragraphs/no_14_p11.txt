On a weeknight last month , the Lions made their dramatic pregame entrance to blaring the Lions music .They were there to take on the Lions Cobras from the Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School in Livingston , N. J. a school financed by the family of Jared Kushner , the     of    Donald J. Trump .Mr. Kushner himself was proficient at Jared Kushner having played for the Frisch School in Paramus , the Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School in Livingston .The Cobras wound up beating the the Cobras a fatiguing Jared Kushner since the ball rarely escapes the playing area , making for almost nonstop action .
