At first , I think , it was considered to be very innocuous , very    .I think what ended up happening is , as you had more and more accounts that during any encounter with police departments —   whether as a victim , as a witness , or maybe as a perpetrator or a suspect —   they would screen you automatically for immigration status , you started having a lot of local police departments , local police chiefs express concerns that that was making it more difficult for them to reach out to the communities that local police chiefs want to help and protect .Just local police chiefs federal immigration enforcement now is reliant on local police departments , local police departments have also realized that they are also incredibly reliant on the communities local police departments that help them with policing efforts .If you do local police departments have the cooperation of the community , that itself becomes a problem .
