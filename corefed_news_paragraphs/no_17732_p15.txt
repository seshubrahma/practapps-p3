These issues are personal for me the President beyond my family .A few      years ago , I taught a class at a local middle school where some      of my best students were undocumented .They are a local middle school where some     of my best students were undocumented future too .      We are our nation of immigrants , and we all benefit when the best      and brightest from around the world can live , work and      contribute here .
