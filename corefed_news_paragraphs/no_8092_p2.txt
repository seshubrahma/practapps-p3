This , Mystal says , is reason enough to work against the legal system in all areas .Maybe it â€™s time for black people to use the same tool white people have been using to defy a system white people do not consent to : jury nullification .White juries regularly refuse to convict or indict cops for murder .White juries refuse to convict vigilantes who murder black children .
