It a pollster even indicate colossal failures in a pollster or sampling .The poll can be dismissed out of a poll this basis alone .Examples of what I mean : a poll showing that more than 45 percent of the electorate in Pennsylvania will be over age 65 ( that ’s too high ) or that 13 percent of the electorate will be black in North Carolina ( that ’s too low ) .■ I really do n’t look at party identification .
