I never felt the city of St. Louis met the benchmarks that I consider when looking at a franchise looking to relocate .Unfortunately , the Rams are owned by a man Rams no loyalty to anything other than the almighty dollar and this influences every decision he makes with all of the teams he a man who exhibits no loyalty to anything other than the almighty dollar .St. Louis deserved better than a man who exhibits no loyalty to anything other than the almighty dollar Kroenke .St. Louis a fiscal point of view , the move west to Los Angeles makes complete sense .
