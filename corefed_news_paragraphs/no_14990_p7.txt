Republicans fact is , the next vote on the debt ceiling , a government shutdown , or sending emergency funds to a blue state ravaged by a natural disaster will require the President to deal with Democrats .Regardless of whether it â€™s done behind closed doors or in front of a camera , if President Trump has any interest in governing , then sooner or later he will have to President Trump Leader Pelosi to the table .And if that sounds to President Trump like " President Trump , " then perhaps he should call Speaker Ryan President Trump former Speaker Boehner to ask them how many times Nancy Speaker Ryan or former Speaker Boehner has bailed them Leader Pelosi order to advance Speaker Ryan or former Speaker Boehner country .Then , call Pelosi .
