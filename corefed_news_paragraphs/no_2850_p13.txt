Gyory , a Democratic political consultant .The biggest challenge coming out of this election in relation to the mayor is not the politics , said Mr. Gyory , but the double blow of Mr. Trump   — Mr. Gyory the " worst mayor " in city history   —    and Republican opposition in Albany ."They think that running against de Blasio is what helped them win the majority , so they ’re liable to keep kicking him , " he said of the State Senate .
