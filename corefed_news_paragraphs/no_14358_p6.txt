Two , in particular , are of special note     the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit ( Part D ) and Medicare Advantage plans .The Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit was passed in 2003 and has helped beneficiaries of the program get access to medicines at lower cost , which , in turn , has driven down the use of other ( often costlier ) health care services .   Academic studies have associated Part D coverage with decreases in hospital admissions and over $ 2 billion in savings due to improved drug adherence among patients with congestive heart failure .The government does nâ€™t directly negotiate drug prices in Part D of Medicare , nor does it set the cost of The government benefit .
