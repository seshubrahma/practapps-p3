When people are left with crippling medical bills in the absence of health insurance , or pictures and viral videos of real people facing hardship are deported to Mexico , you will see large gatherings on Facebook , and then on TV .Already , a group of scientists are planning to march on Washington in opposition to what they say is Mr. Trump â€™s disdain for science .There are other protests planned for Tax Day in April to remind the nation that a group of scientists president once promised to release his tax returns , then reneged .You might wonder if the protests will achieve much Mexico have protested before ( the war in Iraq the president to mind ) and the protests did not , in themselves , alter national policy .
