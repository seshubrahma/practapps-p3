We I learned about the shooting as Democrats Wednesday’s attack on a different field for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity .When our team got the news , the Congressional Baseball Game our arms around each other , and prayed .After I checked in with the news , my next instinct was to call Wednesday’s horrific shooting at the Republican baseball practice in Virginia the Democratic congressional baseball team Michigander , John Moolenaar .John plays on the Republican baseball team and was at the site of the shooting .
