Take a moment to consider the 2 , 209 people who lost their lives in Johnstown , Pennsylvania , in 1889 when the South Fork Dam failed , and imagine a similar scenario of    levees or dams failing in other cities .   Dam failure can lead to cascading failures of critical infrastructure such as nuclear power stations .In terms of the potential for destruction , such scenarios would be not unlike the Fukushima disaster .Many of the large and more    dams in the United States     such as the Hoover Dam in Nevada and the Addicks and Barker dams near Houston , Texas ( which gained some notoriety last year during the Houston floods in spring of 2016 )     are owned and monitored by relatively    federal agencies such as the Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers .
