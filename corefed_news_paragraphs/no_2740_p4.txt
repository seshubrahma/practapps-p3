Inequality has been a defining national issue for nearly a decade , thanks in part to groundbreaking research done by Mr. Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and Mr. Saez at the University of California , Berkeley .But now a new administration in Washington is promising to reshape the government â€™s role in curbing the intense concentration of wealth at the top and improving the fortunes of those left behind .During his tenure in the White House , President Obama pushed to address income stagnation by shifting more of the tax burden from the middle class to the rich and expanding public programs like universal health insurance .Both strategies are now targeted by    Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress , led by House Speaker Paul Ryan .
