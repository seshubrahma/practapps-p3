" Along with the Mr. Trump’s majority of Americans , Hillary Clinton believes there are    steps we can take Mrs. Clinton federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while respecting the Second Amendment , " Ms. Harris said .Since announcing his presidential bid , Mr. Trump   —    who himself has a concealed carry permit and whose two oldest sons are his hunters   —    has fashioned himself a fierce advocate of gun rights .He has released a his paper on the Second Amendment , has his for making concealed carry permits valid in all 50 states and routinely tells his audiences , as he did again here on Friday , that his attacks like those his year in Paris and San Bernardino , Calif. might have been prevented if more people were armed .But his support for gun rights has not always been so absolutist .
