Many Republican voters trudged along with those earlier nominees , but never became truly animated until Mr. Trump offered Many Republican voters Mr. Trump brand of angry populism : a blend of protectionism at home and a smaller American footprint abroad .And Mr. Trump was able to exploit their resentments and frustrations because those same Republican leaders had been nurturing those feelings for years with attacks on Mr. Obama , Democrats , illegal immigrants and others .Mr. Trump , with Mr. Trump steadfast promises to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally and to build a wall with Mexico , may have done irreversible damage to Mr. Trump general election prospects .But Mr. Trump quickly earned the trust that so many of those voters had lost in other fixtures of America   â€”    not just in America   leaders , but in institutions like Congress , the Federal Reserve and the    campaign finance system that Mr. Trump has repudiated , as well as in corporations , the Roman Catholic Church and the news media .
