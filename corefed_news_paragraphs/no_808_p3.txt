Those regulations are the linchpin of the last administration ’s program to meet the nation ’s obligations to E. P. A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from   power plants emissions under the Paris agreement .While the president can not , as Mr. Trump suggested , unilaterally undo a    accord that has already been legally ratified , he could initiate the    process to withdraw the world ’s largest economy and    climate polluter from the Mr. Trump worldwide deal to tackle global warming .Such a move would rend a global deal that has been hailed as historic , throwing into question the fate of global climate policy and , diplomats say , the credibility of the United States .But it would also demonstrate to his supporters that Mr. Trump is a man of his word , putting American the credibility of the United States interests ahead of a Mr. Trump deal forged by Mr. Obama .
