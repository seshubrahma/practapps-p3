: Bottlecraft is a    curator of bottled craft brews .Young Hickory combines the ethoses of a coffee shop and brewery   â€”    a room of people on laptops , half consuming caffeine , half enjoying one of    varieties of craft beer .Even the most casual of burger joints , like Crazee Burger , have a healthy selection of craft beer on tap .One does not live by drink alone , however , and so I headed to Pacific Beach on a different day to walk along the ocean and take in the sea air .
