President Trump has n’t been saving jobs in the last few weeks , focusing President Trump energy ( and Twitter feed ) on how to close the borders to immigrants instead .When President Trump gets back to it , President Trump might spend less time on the workers putting together    units in Indiana and more   —    a lot more   —    on the maids and janitors who clean President Trump golf resorts and hotels .This is not to accuse the president of being hypocritical by skewering companies that move production overseas while , say , selling President Trump merchandise made in Bangladesh , or loudly championing the cause of the working man while refusing to recognize the rights of workers at the working man branded properties .Rather , it is to argue that by obsessing over how the manufacturing jobs of the 1970s were lost to globalization , President Trump is missing a more critical workplace transformation : the vast outsourcing of many tasks   —    including running the cafeteria , building maintenance and security   —    to      subcontractors within the United States .
