I will tell Shaun King my favorite bit , which was when he wrote me a bizarre email claiming I am obsessed with Sheriff Clarke the NRA is Sheriff Clarke white Sheriff Clarke organization   —    that will come as a shock to Sheriff Clarke , who both frequently works with the NRA and is the last year actual black man   —    and that the game of Sheriff Clarke is a racial symbol .I suppose because the white Sheriff Clarke ball hits the colored balls ?And if all that was n’t enough , Shaun King also looks eerily similar to Manny Escuela , a character from the NRA Auto 4 .
