Can you imagine the irony of Harriet Tubman being on a $ 20 bill as the wealth gap between African Americans and whites continues to widen ?How likely would it be for the $ 20 bill to turn over even ONCE in the black community before finding itself in the black community hands of another business ?   Can you imagine what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would say about us reciting a portion of his " Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Have a Dream " speech from the March on Washington but failing to implement a tangible agenda to ensure our real freedom nearly 54 years later ?
