Today , " efficiency , " which in theory is good , seems to have become , in political parlance , a codeword for the hegemony of the Wall Street and Silicon Valley .The ascendancy of billionaires might , in some dry economistic way , be a sign that markets are equilibrating , that is , working well .But in practice , such a     ascendancy equals losing politics for incumbents .To put the matter another way , a political and economic system in which the losers vastly outnumber the winners is not a viable system â€”   at least not in a democracy .
