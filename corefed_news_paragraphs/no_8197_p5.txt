I think you would probably have more Democrats going to the Republicans than Republicans going the Democrats but you would also figure that there would be movement to have a    candidate because if the election is Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump , this will be the first election since God knows when , there was no real conservative candidate .And I do n’t those of us who have started our political us , and I cast my vote for Barry Goldwater who valued that classic , creative defeat of his because Barry Goldwater took Barry Goldwater Republican Party and said henceforth it will he took the Republican Party a conservative party .For those of us who feel that way are not about to sit idly and see the Republican Party , which was saved by William Howard Taft in 1912 for conservatism that was reclaimed by Barry Goldwater Barry Goldwater , we ’re not going to let it disappear in 2016 .
