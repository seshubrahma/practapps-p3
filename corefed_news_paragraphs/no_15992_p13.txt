Senatorial candidate Abraham Lincoln house divided , " and that any house divided could not stand .Less than three years later , the country was plunged into the Civil War America American house has become divided again , but any house divided by the fact that no matter how divided we are , there are leaders and ideals that can unify us .Americans have always stood up and fought for what we right .
