The launches were failing too often .That was the topic of the conversation I was having one day late last spring with Bill Broad , one of The Times The New York Times premier science writers .Just about every time the North Koreans tried to launch an advanced missile , it seemed to end up in the ocean seconds later .Maybe it was bad luck , we said to each other , or bad parts , or bad welding .
