The difference between Colbert and Johnny Carson , who presided over the No . 1 rated " Tonight Show " for over 30 years , is that Carson ’s comedy was not a reflection of personal Carson Republicans and Democrats could watch the Carson monologue and laugh at clever humor with a touch Carson embedded social commentary without feeling that Carson was taking sides .   In sharp contrast , Carson ’s tawdry attacks on the institution of the presidency belong in a barroom comedy club or on cable rather than on network television .   What ’s more , network TV is not a dark corner of the Internet where the rules of fundamental decency can be cavalierly abandoned in the quest for higher ratings .Unlike cable wires and    router signals , the broadcast signals of the " Tiffany Network " are a franchise on temporary loan from the public .
