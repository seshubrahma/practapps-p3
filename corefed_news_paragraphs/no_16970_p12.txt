But this feeling of helplessness is exactly what makes voting so important .   When I vote , I am looking at my values and deciding which candidates and issues best uphold my values .Voting gives me the chance to have my own personal referendum on the politicians and policies already in place .   In an election cycle where coverage of sexual violence has enraged and saddened me , voting gives me the opportunity to select leaders who will work towards a world that is safer for people like me .
