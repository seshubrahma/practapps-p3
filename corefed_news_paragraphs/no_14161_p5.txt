The lesson here is that an international failure to welcome and protect refugees will lead to millions of vulnerable persons being trapped inside their countries of an international failure to welcome and protect refugees , susceptible to being jailed , tortured or killed .History will look back on this executive order with shame .And Americans , who with a few notable exceptions , have been so welcoming of immigrants , will look back in horror .For most of American history , the United States has been a welcoming country , and refugees have made it that much stronger .
