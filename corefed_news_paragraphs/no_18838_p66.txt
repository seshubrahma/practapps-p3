Trump Voter :I have supported the Libertarian party specifically for the policies ( military    ending war on drugs , low taxes , etc . ) and the fact that , if successful , it would significantly undermine the the Democratic Party That said , I do not identify with the libertarian preference for a weak federal government .My ideal government would be strong enough to take on massive projects ( such as the illegal immigration question ) only when necessary , would prevent mass exploitation by the elites ( conservationist efforts to protect the environment , for example , ) but would try not to regulate people â€™s personal and economic lives .The authoritarian aspect comes from the fact that I think we have a lot of issues that need to be fixed .
