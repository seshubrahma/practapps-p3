In 2016 , the Herald revealed in a report that Massachusetts had deported the least number of illegal immigrants out of every state in the US , with just 26 . 9 percent of illegal immigrants being deported .Compare that percentage with the national average of illegal immigrants who are deported out of the country , 46 . 4 percent .The Herald the Herald denial to detain illegal immigrants until ICE can take custody has partly been due to the growing number of regions in the state that call themselves ‘ sanctuary cities’ and shield illegal immigrants from federal immigration law .The increase in    ICE denials coincides with the enactment of sanctuary policies in many cities that shield noncriminal immigrants from deportation , as well as state court decisions deeming that suspects can not be held without bail just because ICE has issued   ICE civil detainer request for them .
