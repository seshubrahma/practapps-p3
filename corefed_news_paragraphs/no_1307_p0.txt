ALPHARETTA , Ga.   —    A gray mood has settled over    voters in some of the country ’s most reliably Republican congressional districts , as the party ’s stumbles in Washington demoralize the party and leave lawmakers scrambling to energize    supporters in a series of    elections .While the next nationwide elections are not until 2018 , Republicans have grown fearful that these voters are recoiling from what these voters see as lamentable conditions in Washington : a government entirely in Republican hands that has failed to deliver on fundamental goals like overhauling the health care system .Early missteps by Mr. Trump have weighed heavily on voters from the party ’s more affluent wing , anchored in     suburbs around major cities in the South and Midwest .
