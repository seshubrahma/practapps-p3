I like that ."Ms. Merkel also faces opposition within her own party as members of the CDU have begun to Ms. Merkel their opposition to her migrant policies ahead of the 2017 election members of the CDU after seeing Ms. Merkel electoral success of the    Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) .Along with grassroots groups , a collection of CDU politicians known as the Berlin Circle have been forthcoming with the CDU intentions to topple Merkel and return the CDU to its CDU politicians known as the Berlin Circle origins .
