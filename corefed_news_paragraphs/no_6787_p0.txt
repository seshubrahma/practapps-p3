On this weekend ’s broadcast of " Fox News Sunday , " host Chris Wallace questioned Sen. Chris Coons ( ) over comments he made during an MSNBC interview last Friday where he said that the intelligence community had transcripts of conversations between Russia and the Trump campaign .   After playing the video clip of Coons saying there are transcripts that provide"very critical insights " into whether Russia was " colluding with the Trump campaign , " he asked , " Senator , we ’re talking here about the President of the United States , is n’t there more than a whiff of McCarthyism for you as a U. S. Senator to say there are transcripts out there that provide insight into whether or not there was collusion , but you do n’tknow whether they exist collusion" After initially defending his comments as an attempt to encourage the Senate Intelligence Committee to be given access to the raw intelligence , Coons admitted there is no " hard evidence of collusion , " and apologized .
