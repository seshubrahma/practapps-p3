And the coffin of President Abraham Lincoln has been moved around the coffin of President Abraham Lincoln burial spot in Springfield , Ill. at least 17 times , by one count , including a bizarre thwarted effort in 1876 to steal the coffin of President Abraham Lincoln body and hold his body for ransom .Here , the prospect that the presidential remains could be moved yet again has prompted rare fits of passion on the topic of Polk , a man historians have called " priggish " and " colorless , " and one whose legacy is often overshadowed by his     mentor , Andrew Jackson , who is buried at the Hermitage , his family plantation , a major tourist draw here .Indeed , when President Trump , who often likens his to Jackson , visited Nashville this month , his laid a wreath on Jackson â€™s tomb , honoring Jackson in a speech as a president who " understood that real leadership means putting America first ."
