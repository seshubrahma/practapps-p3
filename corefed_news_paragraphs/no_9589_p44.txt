The same thing with a Chinese person !Half their dates celebrate Kwanzaa , obviously , but I ’d still tell them Merry Christmas .   This is how normal people operate in social sitations .   The only people who do n’t celebrate Christmas Christmas ca n’t mentally process " Merry Christmas " into Merry Christmas Kwanzaa Merry are people looking to be offended .
