My critics like to claim the Democratic Party because I got wealthy orbecause I the Democratic Party n’t want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature .No , the truth is the Democratic Party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing .One obvious example is the party ’s new attitude toward Israel .
