Which means , conservatives , the Republican Party is there for the taking .Will you take it ?So far , since 2008 , few conservatives have stepped up .Damn the Republican Party , had a conservative Republican in Arizona wanted to have become a precinct committeeman to be in a position to vote for the state convention delegates , all he needed to do was Arizona for one of the vacant positions in his precinct ( and , the odds were 50 percent that a vacancy existed ) .
