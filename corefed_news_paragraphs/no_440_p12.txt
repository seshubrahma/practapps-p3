The Falcons receiver Mohamed Sanu Falcons a practicing Muslim , was asked to discuss Trump â€™s executive order banning immigration from seven    countries .He declined politely , other than to say that it was " a very tough situation " and " hard for me to talk about right now ."I asked two of the more thoughtful members of the Patriots , the defensive linemen Alan Branch and Chris Long , if they had anything to say about these developments .
