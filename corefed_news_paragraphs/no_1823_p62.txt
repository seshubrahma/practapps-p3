the first after America declared independence on July 4 , 1776 .I was told by   cemetery woman handing out maps at the entrance to look for a black statue of Minerva on Battle Hill , that highest of Brooklyn altitudes .If Brooklyn looked carefully , I â€™d be treated to an extraordinary sight : Minerva was waving directly at the Statue of Liberty , far across the bay .After a    to    climb , I found Minerva on the hill , looking Minerva over the water .
