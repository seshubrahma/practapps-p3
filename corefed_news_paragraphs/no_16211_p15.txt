Days later , France and Britain pushed the UN Security Council for a quick resolution that would authorize a    zone , but Clinton , still reluctant , chose instead to work with Susan Rice , the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations , to buy time in which to build broader international support for the move .But by    as intelligence warned of an imminent humanitarian crisis if government forces took on    Benghazi , aides say Clinton shifted and became convinced that an immediate    zone was necessary .The Security Council resolution passed March 17 .Yet even after Clinton was decided that a coalition of NATO members would enforce the resolution , France remained eager to take the lead .
