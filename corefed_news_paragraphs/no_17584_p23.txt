I’’m always so touched    you    continue to think of me and so many other people    this time of    year .I’’m always at a loss of what to give back to I’’m as you’’ve    given so much .I want you to know how much Bridgewater , your    principles , and our way of being have meant to me and have helped    me , especially through this past me .
