At first , Medicaid helped states provide medical care only for single parents and children on welfare .Over the next 25 years Medicaid Democrats   —    sometimes working with Republicans   —    gradually pushed to expand benefits   —    to    families , to children with speech and development delays , to home treatment for people who would otherwise be institutionalized , to children up to age 5 , then to age 8 and later to age 18 , and to pregnant women .Ironically , some of the biggest expansions in Medicaid came in the 1980s under Reagan , the onetime A. M. A. mouthpiece .After Republicans failed to turn Medicaid into a block grant , Democrats , who still controlled Congress , worked on compromises with the president and Medicaid Republicans , sometimes allowing cuts in programs like Medicare in Ronald Reagan for expanding Medicaid , said Medicare Representative Henry Waxman , a Democrat who shepherded many of those expansions .
