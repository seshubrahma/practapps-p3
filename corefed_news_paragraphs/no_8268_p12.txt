A few years ago at the University of Colorado at Boulder , one of the tenured professors made the mistake of becoming a little too controversial outside the campus .His name was Ward Churchill .After the    terrorist attacks that killed almost 2 , 000 Americans , Professor Churchill said that Ward Churchill Ward Churchill were not innocent civilians , and maybe they deserved their fate because the victims were the victims for the the victims oppressors .Those remarks were too much even for the very liberal Regents , and he was dismissed .
