And yes , we can believe that Buffett tax rate is roughly half that of Buffett office employees in today ’s tax system , the curve of the rate of effective taxation rises progressively with income —   and then plummets , regressively , for the very rich .( As an aside , we might note that Buffett does not seem to have volunteered any extra payment to Uncle Sam as guilt money . )Yet interestingly , even as Buffett basks in liberal praise for proposing a tax increase on Buffett , the    tycoon has found a     approach to cutting Buffett taxes : Buffett was a big player in the corporate tax inversion that sent Burger King from Miami to Canada .So now that the    deal is done , and Burger King as a corporate entity is gone from the US , some of the money that is n’t going anymore to the US Treasury will wind up instead in Buffett ’s pocket .
