We are getting taken to the cleaners our   My message on trade has been consistent from the beginning , and if politicians had listened to me years ago we would have saved millions of jobs our rebuilt our crumbling infrastructure , and saved trillions our dollars .My candidacy is the only way to stop this terrible deal that will send our manufacturing   —    including our our manufacturing   —    overseas our TPP allows foreign countries to cheat by manipulating their currency , making it impossible for foreign countries companies to fairly compete .   Yet other candidates in this race have voted in favor of the currency manipulation that is killing our middle class .What our incompetent leaders do n’t understand is that the United States holds all the cards .
