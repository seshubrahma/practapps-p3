Working class ( white ) voters " are machinists , assemblers , machine operators , mechanics , nurse ’s aides , waitresses , small retail store managers , bus drivers , taxi drivers , truck drivers , and all the jobs that they would n’t dare do themselves , being so much smarter than the rest of us ( doubtful they knowwhich end of a wrench to use ) .Being a " working class white voter " does not make us inferior or intellectually stunted so much that we need to be ( they ) educated in liberally biased schools of doublespeak and thoughtlessness .All they want to do is work a good job that does present a modest challenge , that does feel rewarding , keeps the lights on and our bellies full and after all of that , we just want to come home , drink some beers , pet the dog and enjoy the sunset in our small suburban slice of heaven .
