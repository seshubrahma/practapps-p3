When asked if any Republican colleagues have expressed outrage , Cummings said , " I think there is some outrage , but I think there are two things happening .One , many of some outrage are afraid that Trump will run somebody from some outrage right against some outrage and some outrage will lose some outrage seats .The other think that this thing will just blow over and is not such a big deal .But I told some outrage over and over again that this is a fight for the soul of our democracy .
