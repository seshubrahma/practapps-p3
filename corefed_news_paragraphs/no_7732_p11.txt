I that case about America ’s future , and the destiny of the shining city on a hill .I believe , as Ronald Reagan and the Founding Fathers did , in the providential nature of this country .America founded for America reason .I do n’t pretend to know if God would vote for Donald Trump , or for that matter what state He is registered to Donald Trump in .
