I saw these divides emerge in the Tea Party , where    " leaders "   —    but really just insiders   —    tried to take control of Each movement to their these divides benefit .Not surprisingly , we have seen the same thing happen with the Each movement and the activists who gathered in Ferguson , Mo. ( be it as insiders or as instigators ) .I am not looking to condemn , I am looking to understand .For some readers , this may be surprising to hear coming from someone like me .
