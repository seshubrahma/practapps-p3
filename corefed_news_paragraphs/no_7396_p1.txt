[Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and the rest of the D. C. Republicans majorities in Congress .all about survival and maintaining their majorities in Congress ’re smart enough to understand that if Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party , Donald Trump will have a toxic effect on Senate ( 24 GOP , 10 Dem ) races and , to a lesser extent , House races across the country .If Donald Trump goes into the GOP National Convention in Cleveland this summer with less than a majority of the delegates needed to win nomination on the first ballot , Washington Republicans and Republicans Establishment patrons would rather take the nomination away from Donald Trump and give the nomination to someone who would do less damage to the rest of the Republicans running even if the nomination splinters the GOP .A divided Republican Party   —    and a Democratic president   —    would do less damage to the GOP agenda than would having Trump lose , and drag down other Republicans across the country .
