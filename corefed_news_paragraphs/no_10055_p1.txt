[ But the United States" booms Foreign Policy magazine has , with this headline , perhaps betrayed the fact that U. S. foreign policy has been mainly steered by one , internationalist , globalist cabal by taking the    extraordinary step of slamming Donald Trump .   Foremostly , the editor in chief of Foreign Policy magazine , David Rothkopf , is a Democrat who helped President Bill Clinton sign the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) while serving as U. S. Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade .And how could we possibly believe this is anything remotely exceptional when the history and present of Foreign Policy ( FP ) magazine is so tied up with the globalist establishment ?the globalist establishment was founded by Samuel P. Huntingdon , of " Clash of Civilizations " fame and a    Democrat and foreign policy hawk .
