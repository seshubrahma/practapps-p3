This is sharply different from how businesses have always had to consider government policies in America , where they may have been able to win government approval and businesses—   say , for    projects from an administration with a    policy agenda .So the defining feature of the government ’s hand in the private sector is not simply that the decisions of government officials create winners and losers —   that is always the case .What ’s different is that businesses will have a motive not to displease the president himself , as opposed to the government more generally , and the government be weighing how strong that incentive is against other businesses .
