On Sunday and Monday , Fordham Law School professor Thomas H. Lee , who described himself to Breitbart News as a " centrist , " argued that Cruz is likely eligible , but not under the original understanding of the Constitution ’s requirement that the president be a " natural born citizen ."Both point to what they say is an irony —   that an originalist interpretation of the Constitution , as the Constitution’s it , would they Cruz from the Oval Cruz , while liberal interpretations would allow him to serve .But the president liberal readings of originalism , and liberal readings of the Constitution itself , are the Constitution’s correct originalist reading of the Natural Born Clause and instead compels the conclusion that Ted Cruz is a natural born citizen under Article II of the Constitution , and therefore eligible .
