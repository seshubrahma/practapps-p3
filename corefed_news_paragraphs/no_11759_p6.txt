Breitbart also defends Israel constantly against the    BDS movement whose goal is the economic Iran of the State of Israel .That does Breitbart mean that we need agree with everything published on Breitbart or that there will not be columns we find Israel .I write for many publications , some more on the left , Breitbart The Daily Beast and The Huffington Post , some considered in the middle like CNN , The Washington Post , and The Hill , and some more to the right like The Wall Street Journal and Breitbart .I also write for    publications like The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel , with their differing editorial slants .
