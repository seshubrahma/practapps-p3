"   Be honest with the American people: We ought to be more focused on Americans affordable health care for patients with    conditions , instead of cramming them into the same market that sells bona fide " insurance " against the risk of illness and injury to healthy customers .Forcing insurance companies to cover the cost of care for customers with existing conditions , and allowing them the American people costs through a mixture of taxpayer subsidies and higher premiums for everyone else , is a far more serious " " problem than the American people one employed as a sales pitch for Obamacare .
