I view this as a personal decision because no votes are being taken and no policies will be enacted at this ceremony .While I do not dispute that   Donald Trump won the Electoral College , I can not normalize   Donald Trump behavior or the disparaging and    statements   Donald Trump has made ." " Trump —   who lost the popular vote —   has made a series of racist , sexist and bigoted statements .In addition ,   Donald Trump has attacked Gold Star parents , veterans such as John McCain and now civil rights icon John Lewis .
