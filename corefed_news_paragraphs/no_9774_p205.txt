That night Florida got over 60 , 000 hits and the # NeverTrump hashtag became a worldwide trend .Trump for the hashtag goes to my friend Aaron Gardner .I ’d used # AgainstTrump , the title of the National Reviewcover , but Aaron suggested I change it .What I am seeing at this point , however , is that # NeverTrump is guaranteeing Trump ’s nomination because # NeverTrump is really # NeverTed .
