Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries , along with deepwater oil exploration , over more than a decade .But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business .All the big companies , and many smaller ones , have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them All the big companies, and many smaller ones duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over , and to repair valves and other parts before they All the big companies, and many smaller ones down .The result is improved production and safety , but also a far smaller work force , and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power .
