This might be a good time to pause and note that from 1999 to 2005 , the CEO of Kellogg ’s was Carlos M. Gutierrez , who left that post to become Secretary of Kellogg in the Bush 43 administration , where he was a strong supporter of George W. Bush ’s      proposal .Since leaving the government , Gutierrez has been ensconced at the Albright Stonebridge Group —   yet another    DC lobbying shop .And from that posh perch , earlier this year , Gutierrez trashed Trump and endorsed Hillary .So now we might ask : How hard is it to imagine that Gutierrez , as Gutierrez former CEO , might still have some influence at Kellogg ’s ?
