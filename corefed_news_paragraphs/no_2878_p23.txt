I think I ’ll take a nap .After all , bots do n’t have feelings to hurt , professional reputations to uphold or conflicts of interest to manage .They can respond instantly and tweet tirelessly , but waste no time reading anybody bots ’s timeline .As inhuman as the bots are , their greatest promise may lie in their ability to cut through the artifice of the bots Twitter to reveal something real the bots Propaganda bots spew lines and lies that coat social media with impersonal rhetoric and    images .
