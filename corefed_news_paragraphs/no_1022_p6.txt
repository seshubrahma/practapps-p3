For those used to having broadband at their disposal , it is hard to those used to having broadband at their disposal not being able to Skype for a job interview , send messages on LinkedIn or Facebook , download an eTextbook , upload a homework project or    on Netflix .But about 12 . 6 million American households lack access to broadband , according to a study last year by the Federal Communications Commission , which has classified broadband as a type of utility , similar to telephones .The problem is worse in poorer and rural areas : At least 30 percent of people in Mississippi and Arkansas do not have access to broadband , and sparsely populated states like Montana have similar access rates .While President Trump ’s pledge to rebuild the nation ’s infrastructure has focused largely on roads , bridges and airports , the need to expand the broadband network is just as dire .
