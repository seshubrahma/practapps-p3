It would have been much easier for me to win the    popular vote than the the Electoral College that I would only campaign in 3 or 4—     —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) November 27 , 2016 ,   states instead of the 15 states that I visited .I would have won even more easily and convincingly ( but smaller states are forgotten ) !   —
