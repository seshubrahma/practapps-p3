And I ’m not saying the people protesting there in Chicago are Republican voters by any means , but there is a growing coalition of    Tea Party Ted    people and establishment folks that are rallying behind the candidacy of Ted Cruz to unify our party before the national convention so that our can have a positive message .our do n’t need Donald Trump to be the head of the ticket for this great country of our to be represented by a man with such a giant ego and with so few solutions to the problemswould be tragic .And it is not in the nature of a Reagan or a Jack Kemp or George Bush ,
