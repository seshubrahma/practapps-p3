—    Nate Silver ( @NateSilver538 ) November 8 , 2016 ,   One out of eight voters , or 12 .5 percent , are either undecided or declaring support for other candidates during the last few days of the election .That is up from one out of 32 voters in 2012 , one out of 27 voters in 2004 , and one out of 10 voters in 2000 , when Texas Gov. George W. Bush barely beat Vice President Al Gore .So Silver is cautioning people to be ready for a major failure by the pollsters in predicting Americans’    choices .
