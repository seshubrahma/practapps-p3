We @MuthokaTito ) February 17 , 2017 ,Although the    notification period for Congress before a foreign military sale can go forth ended Sunday , lawmakers can still halt the sale by passing a resolution of disapproval .Budd also introduced a joint resolution in the House earlier this month to halt the sale .If the resolution a foreign military sale , it would be the first time Congress has voted to block a foreign arms deal since 1986 .
