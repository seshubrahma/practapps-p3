Reporters are n’t supposed to be hackers themselves ( see the News of the World scandals in London five years ago ) but they ’re not capable of resisting juicy information that others have hacked , no matter how unsavory the purpose ( see the ubiquitous coverage of John Podesta ’s    private emails during the fall campaign ) .Journalists are quite comfortable with the idea of the news media uncovering government secrets that should not have been secret in the first place .This may be a role whose run is coming to an end .Information is too copious and flows too freely , and there are too many players in the revelation game   —    political activists , foreign governments , tricksters ,     —    for journalists to function as the arbiters of revelation .
