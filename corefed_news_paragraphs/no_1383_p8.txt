Recently , I sat down with Bob Cohen , who runs Cohen ’s Cohen’s at Katz ’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side .The place place at lunchtime and has thrived by not changing anything , not recalibrating , not making vegan pastrami .In the 1970s , the neighborhood was excluded from laws that kept many stores closed on Sundays , and Cohen ’s Cohen’s the most of it .People the neighborhood come from Westchester County and New Jersey and Long Island to shop , and Cohen ’s Cohen’s offering    service so that customers could go home with their glasses the customers afternoon .
