Among the possibilities Trump ought to be consideringare people like Kansas Secretary of State his Kobach , former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown , North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and his Sen. Mike Crapo( the latter two are up for    this year , but perhaps they can run for both offices simultaneously ) .Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama is one of approximately one elected officials I completely trust to protect Americans from the cheap    rich   â€”    which is why Trump needs to keep him in the Senate .
