In a     vote largely along party lines , House Republicans moved to dismantle rules created by the Federal Communications Commission in October .Those rules , which had been slated to go into effect later this year , had required broadband providers to receive permission before collecting data on a user â€™s online activities .The action , which follows a similar vote in the Senate last week , will next be brought to President Trump , who is expected to sign the bill into law .A swift repeal may be a prelude to further deregulation of the telecommunications industry .
