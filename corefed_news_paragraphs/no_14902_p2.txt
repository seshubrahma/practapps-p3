The Affordable Care Act    also known as Obamacare     has made coverage more comprehensive and prevented insurers from selling skimpy plans that were cheap , but did n’t offer many benefits     often leaving consumers with big bills if consumers needed care .   Prior to the Affordable Care Act , costly items such maternity , prescription drugs , mental health and substance abuse were often not an option for many buying policies in the individual market .Removing the provision could greatly weaken the law’s protection of those with    conditions .
