This year ’s campaign is of course not about electing a president or member of Congress or any politician , it is about deciding the future of America ’s health care system     something that affects all Americans , whether they all Americans or not .Just like in 2009 , when Obamacare was before Congress Congress Democrats spread out across America America try to sell the law to their Congress and Democrats , they Congress and Democrats hold events back home starting this weekend to try to fight Republican plans to dismantle it the law House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley ,    York , is leading the charge in the House , encouraging members to hold events in their members this Saturday , January 7 , in order to highlight what Democrats warn are the risks of repealing the Affordable Care Act .Next , Democrats are branding January 15 a " National Day of Action " among Democratic senators , House the House and    organizations .In his closed door pep rally with congressional Democrats , President Barack Obama even encouraged his President Barack Obama to use tea party tactics to galvanize Americans to urge Republicans not to dismantle the health care plan     which happens to be the cornerstone of his President Barack Obama .
