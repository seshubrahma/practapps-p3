Genuine intimacy is so rarely encountered in film that when you come upon it , your tendency is to suspect that somehow you ’re being played .But in Barry Jenkins ’s " Moonlight , " my pick Barry Jenkins’s movie of the year , there are moments of generosity and selflessness that take your breath away .This is an entirely human story in a medium enthralled by technology , violence and fantasy .As I watched the film , based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney , it held me in a state of awed recognition and remembrance of the times I was touched by transformational acts of gentleness and caring .
