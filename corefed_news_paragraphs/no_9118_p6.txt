Tens of thousands are being butchered in Sudan .The entire Middle East is going up in flames and the Obama administration and the Security Council choose to gang up on the only democracy in the Middle East   â€”    the State of Israel .What a disgrace .My friends , I would like to tell you on the first night of Chanukah that this will not avail them .
