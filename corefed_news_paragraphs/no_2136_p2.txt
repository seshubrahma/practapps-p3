His speech Mr. Kerry a powerful admonition after years of tension and frustration , with the Obama administration giving public voice to its    the Obama administration that Israel was headed off a cliff toward international isolation and was condemning itself to Israel future of    perpetual warfare with the Palestinians .Reaction was immediate and harsh , not only from Mr. Netanyahu , but also from Senators John McCain , Republican of Arizona , and Chuck Schumer , Democrat of New York .    Donald J. Trump did not even wait for Mr. Kerry to speak before condemning the secretary of state .The United States and Israel are in the middle of a breach rarely seen since President Harry S. Truman recognized the fragile Israeli state in May 1948 .
