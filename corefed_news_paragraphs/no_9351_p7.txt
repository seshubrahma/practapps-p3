Much of the data about early voting is too vague to show how the state ’s race is going , especially because early voters are only a small proportion of total votes in races where the two candidates may be only a few points apart .In Florida , for example , the state is releasing extensive Florida about the numbers of early voters   —    but that data does n’t show if early voters are leaning towards Trump or Clinton in the closely contested state .In Florida ’s population has been changed by the arrival of at least 50 , 000 people from Puerto Rico , and the pace of early voting has been accelerated by pressure from state election officials , as well as by GOP and Democratic      campaigns .Moreover , Trump may be winning over a small but critical Trump of support from African Americans in Florida .
