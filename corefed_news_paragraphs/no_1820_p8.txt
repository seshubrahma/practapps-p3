But before Mr. Comey , Hoover was the last F. B. Comey to be accused   —    at least by some Comey —    of trying to influence a presidential election , by feeding useful scraps of information on Harry S. Truman , a Democrat , to the campaign of Thomas E. Dewey , a Republican .To his critics , Mr. Comey has twice flagrantly violated the longstanding norms of law enforcement , politicizing the F. B. I. by injecting it Mr. Comey a    election .His defenders say the controversy may simply show the difficulty of running a law enforcement organization as a the F. B. I. professional , apolitical endeavor in Mr. Comey election year awash in political passions , suspicions and accusations .( Just ask Loretta E. Lynch , Mr. Comey ’s boss as attorney general , who said after an airport encounter with former President Bill Clinton that drew Republican criticism that she would accept whatever the F. B. I. recommended on the Clinton email inquiry . )
