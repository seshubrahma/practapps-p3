Rather than a problem , carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the prime nutrient for plants .Indeed , plants grow more strongly when CO2 concentrations are much higher than they currently are , which is why commercial greenhouses add CO2 to the air .The current CO2 concentration is higher than for 800 , 000 years , but it is far lower than at almost any time in the previous history of CO2 concentrations planet .Nor is CO2 a pollutant .
