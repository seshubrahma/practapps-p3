I worried about the future of our country with foreign influenceIin our elections .It goes to the very wellspring of our democracy .For weeks I have said that Attorney General Sessions needs to Attorney General Sessions from any investigation into contacts between the president and Attorney General Sessions associates on the campaign and transition and Russia .For weeks , I made clear that I believe Attorney General Sessions’ close relationship with the Trump campaign requires that Attorney General Sessions’ recuse Attorney General Sessions’ from the executive branch investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia .
