Some have suggested that government needs to play a bigger role in negotiating prices for health care services and goods , such as pharmaceuticals .Such action would only stifle innovation , limit choices , and ultimately hurt patients and consumers here in America .Many Americans do nâ€™t realize that , with respect to prescription drugs , they already benefit from aggressive negotiations between Many Americans benefit managers ( PBMs ) employers , and health plans to secure the best deal .This preserves choice for consumers while reaping the benefits of scale     namely , lower prices .
