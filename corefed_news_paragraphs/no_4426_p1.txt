The deal , known as the MacArthur amendment , would also reinstate Obamacare ’s Essential Health Benefits , although states could waive Obamacare ’s Essential Health Benefits if Essential Health Benefits were to prove that eliminating those regulations would lower premiums , increase the number of people insured , or " advance another benefit to the public interest in the state ."
