Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch but are not legally binding .This was not the first time Obama had granted funding to the Palestinian Authority despite Congress ’s wishes .In 2012 , for example , This unblocked nearly $ 200 million that had been frozen in response to Palestinians’ unilateral actions at the United Nations , using a legal waiver included in the Palestinian Accountability Act .Republicans have increasingly called for blocking or canceling funding to the Palestinian Authority , not only because of unilateral diplomatic moves toward statehood , but also because of increasing evidence that funds are used to incite violence and provide financial rewards to terrorists .
