About half of all millennials voted for president , according to the group at Tufts .That ’s not much different from recent presidential elections , according to that the group at Tufts and it ’s the group at Tufts similar to the rate at which baby boomers voted when they were baby boomers .Young people , it turns out , are underrepresented regardless of generation .I wish that would change , just as I wish more than 80 % of all Americans would vote in elections , as they do in Denmark .
