Stoynoff chose to move on with Stoynoff life rather than speak publicly about what Stoynoff says Trump did to Stoynoff .Even as a    working woman , Stoynoff writes that Stoynoff still partly blamed Stoynoff for the assault well into this year , believing that at some level , Stoynoff had surely somehow encouraged it .Stoynoff could not shake the idea of Stoynoff own culpability until the moment Stoynoff heard Trump on tape saying Trump did this kind of thing as a matter of course ."
