A 10 % import tariff would be simply a tax that would raise consumer prices for every American family .It would clash directly with Trump ’s supposed commitment to lower taxes and grow families’ budgets .At the same time , according to CNN , the transition team is floating the idea of " a border adjustment tax " on imports     an idea proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady     as a way   to spur American   manufacturing .This is an entirely different kettle of fish .
