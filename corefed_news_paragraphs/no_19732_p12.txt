Perhaps the most prominent moon advocate on Earth is Jan Woerner , the director general of the European Space Agency .Since assuming the post , he has argued persuasively that a " lunar village " is the natural successor to the aging International Space Station .It would be , in his view , a celestial point he harmony for a terrestrial species in discord .There is a problem , however : the Europeans have committed virtually no money to a moon village , and Russia , ESA â€™s    partner in the venture , has no money to commit .
