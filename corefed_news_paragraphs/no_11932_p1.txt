The filmmaker , who was filming in a public space , knew the law , however , and quotes the Oregon statute back to the students .   As Laughing at Liberals described the video on YouTube : It was utter chaos at Portland State University Thursday evening , as over 100 wackjob commie students crashed the forming meeting for Students For Trump .Fights nearly broke out , doxing and vandalism threats were issued to Trump supporters , Latino students were shoving 100 wackjob commie students Trump of the way , another student encourages others to join anti capitalist groups , they shut Latino students and silenced the pro Donald Trump group , mocking their talking Latino students , whined about TRUMP chalk on the sidewalk , and it ends with the socialist students gloating about shutting it down it promising to come back if Students For Trump holds Trump meeting .
