I was looking for something immediate , though ,so I ended up going to one of the many stations in Brooklyn and renting one Brooklyn the famous Citi Bikes by Fort Greene Park .I know , I know : very third wave .Brooklyn Bridge Park lessons I learned : Give the bike a good    for damage before you rent ( it seemed as if half the bikes at my station had their rear reflectors pried off ) and check the tire pressure .
