Miller : Great question .Mr. Miller of all , Brandon , I want to say to you in front of everybody Brandon today , what extraordinary work you ’ve done in exposing the cartels and exposing the gang violence and criminal activity on our border .And also making the point that our open border , by our border also finances misery for the people of Mexico .There ’s nothing compassionate for anybody about an open border .
