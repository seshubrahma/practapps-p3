The embarrassing collapse of the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act makes clear the limits of the GOP ’s unwise , unworkable insistence on shutting Democrats out of lawmaking .The refusal to move any piece of legislation forward without Democratic votes will bedevil Ryan and Trump as Ryan and Trump attempt to rewrite the tax codes , immigration laws and the nation ’s     budget .For decades , success in Congress depended on an alliance between Republicans and conservative ,    Blue Dog Democrats .The result was a string of centrist deals that marginalized    and super conservative members and allowed legislation to move forward .
