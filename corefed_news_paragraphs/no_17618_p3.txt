For my whole life my parents , my grandparents , me , for      most black people , this system has never worked for us .But we      us play ball , tried to do our best us live by the rules even      though we knew us would never work out in our favor us had to      live in neighborhoods that you would n’t drive through , send our      us to schools with books so beat upyou could n’t read them , our     kids work jobs that you would n’t consider in your nightmares .
