My critique of his Trump would be that he missed opportunities .For example , you mentioned the foreign policy section , Hillary Clinton they were asked about cyber warfare , Hillary Clinton the dangers to the United States of Hillary Clinton , and that gave Hillary Clinton a chance to give a little    lecture on Russia   —    by the way , omitting China , Iran , North Korea , and others   —    I thought at that Hillary Clinton Trump could have talked about her email homebrew server for his entire time , and just drilled that point home .But , you know , people at home are n’t sitting there grading on that basis .
