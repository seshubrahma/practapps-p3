It ’s the choreography less optimistic piece than it could the choreography been .But it ’s the choreography going back to the music .It ’s the choreography a cathartic piece , and I think the choreography and the arc of the whole ballet has that feeling of exhaustion and running in a way that does n’t need to be spelled out too much .I feel people are going to be able to interpret it in whatever way they want people .
