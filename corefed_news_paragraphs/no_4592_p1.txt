Unfortunately , the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as the legislation before the House today would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey .In addition to the loss of Medicaid coverage for so many people in New Jersey , the denial of essential health benefits in the individual market raise serious coverage and cost issues .I remain hopeful that the American Health Care Act will be further modified .We need to get this right for all Americans .
