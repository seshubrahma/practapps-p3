In so much of what I read , there was a tone of odious condescension , the idea that us no voters were perhaps too simpleminded or too uninformed to really grasp the situation .Some attributed Donald Trump ’s victory in last year’s presidential election to the left ’s inability to hear those on the other side .The condescension that coastal liberal elites tend to have towards those that live in flyover country , and in red states , has cultivated a sense that all Democrats do n’t need to take the concerns and struggles of Republican voters seriously .
