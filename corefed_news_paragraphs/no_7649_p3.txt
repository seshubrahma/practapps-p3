Andrew McCarthy writes in the National Review ( June 12 , 2016 ) that " wherever sharia is the law , homosexuals are persecuted and killed . "Andrew McCarthy cites in that article a 2014 Washington Post report listing ten Muslim countries where homosexuality may be punished by death ( Yemen , Iran , Mauritania , Nigeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Somalia , Sudan , United Arab Emirates , and Iraq ) .Sharia is not a religion .So , this is not about Islam nor all Muslims .
