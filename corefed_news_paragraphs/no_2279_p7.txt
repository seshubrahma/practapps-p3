Mr. Trump offered no criticism of Mr. Assad , but criticized the Obama administration for advocating the removal of the Syrian leader and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , who was deposed in the first blush of the Arab Spring , because doing so took out the strongmen who kept the lid on violence in the region .He pledged to Mr. Assad a new partnership with Israel , Egypt and Jordan to try to stop the spread of terrorism , including groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah .He also suggested Mr. Assad the United States would be well served by joining forces with Russia against the Islamic State .And though Mr. Trump made no reference to whether he would send Mr. Trump American troops back to the region , that appeared to be the clear implication .
