I shrieked when Mr. Horowitz announced that " Moonlight " had won ( did you hear me ? )but my heart also went out to the " La La Land " team .No matter how much I wanted " Moonlight " to win , I would nâ€™t wish that kind of public spectacle on anyone , especially a group as pleasant as that behind " La La Land ."
