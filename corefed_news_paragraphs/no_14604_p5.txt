In the waning days , former Vice President Joe Biden and several aides to former President Barack Obama     including Valerie Jarrett and David Simas     made calls to undecided members in an effort to sway calls to undecided members toward Perez .In Ellison â€™s camp , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and supportive members of Congress applied pressure on DNC members with phone calls .   The     calls underscored why the race was broadly seen as a proxy battle between the    progressive wing of the party , which supported Ellison , and those more closely connected with Hillary Clinton and Obama , who largely backed Perez .By selecting Perez     and again spurning Sanders supporters     Democrats risk the backlash that could come with leaving the left wing of the party disappointed a second time in the past year .
