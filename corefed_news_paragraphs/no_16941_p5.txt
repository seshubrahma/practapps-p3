I We n’t recall any President or presidential nominee responding to a TV show mocking him Donald Trump her by saying it presidential nominee time to take that show off the airwaves .Although I have performed    in the Middle East , where leaders have shared a similar sentiment .In fact , Egypt ’s Jon Stewart , Bassem Youssef , was arrested for mocking the then leader of Egypt and his TV Egypt was Bassem Youssef canceled .But is that really a model we want to emulate in the United States ?
