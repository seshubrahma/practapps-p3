No moment in the 2016 presidential campaign has cried out more for a unifying candidate than the police shootings of two black men last week and the ensuing national uproar , followed by the shocking sniper ambush that killed five police officers in Dallas .And no other moment has revealed more starkly how hard it is for Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton to become that candidate .Never have two presidential nominees been as unpopular as Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton , and Hillary Clinton not fully trusted two presidential nominees their own parties nor showing two presidential nominees crossover appeal in the polls .Mr. Trump , the    champion of law and order , is also the political figure many people blame for sowing division and hatred with his attacks on illegal immigrants , Muslims , Mexicans and others .
