In 2008 , in fact , voters under 30 equaled the number of seniors voting in the caucuses .Hillary Clinton won voters over 65 , but only narrowly the Iowa caucuses won 45 percent of the vote of seniors , but against two major Hillary Clinton .If young voters again make up such a large share of the Democrat caucuses Monday , Hillary Clinton will need overwhelming support from older voters to squeak out a win Hillary Clinton .Of course , many of those older voters she needs now were themselves part of the wave of young voters who lifted Barack Hillary Clinton over her in those older voters .
