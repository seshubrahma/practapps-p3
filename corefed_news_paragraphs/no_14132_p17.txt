The order declares that entities labeled " sanctuary jurisdictions " by the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security White House press secretary Sean Spicer be " not eligible " for federal grants , and sanctuary cities directs the Office of Trump’s "interior" security order Budget to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions .   The order appears to apply mostly to future federal grants , though after OMB ’s review Trump’s "interior" security order Spicer explained that the funding identified could be taken away .   While the administration likely ca n’t cut Trump’s "interior" security order federal funding , as much of it is disbursed through Congress , the President could put some pressure on cities this way .   Any attempts to enact this provision will almost certainly face a legal challenge     past court rulings have weighed the administration likely can’t cut off all federal funding on the government stripping funds from states and cities to enforce policies and have found the measures must relate to the policy in question , must promote the general welfare and can not be coercive .
