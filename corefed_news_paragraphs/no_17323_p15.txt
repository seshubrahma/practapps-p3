Nominees to be secretary of state have to go through hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , which then votes on whether to send the nominee to the full Senate for another vote .With Republicans in the majority , the committee is the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which then votes on whether to send the nominee to the full Senate for another vote up of 10 Republicans and nine Democrats , a ratio that could be altered in the new Congress .The starting point of any nomination process , said one congressional aide , is that " the president gets to decide who he or she thinks the president the people should surround them ."
