In a recent post on Medium , the former strategist for President George W. Bush made the case that the historically large size of the GOP primary was n’t a disadvantage , rebutting some conventional wisdom that a    field would be a net negative for the Grand Ole Party .There are so many candidates running that some have compared it to a clown car and not just because Donald Trump is thinking of running .Dan Pfeiffer joins CNN as contributor , While the Democratic primary does n’t resemble the clown car nature of the Republican field ( in part because the Democratic primary ’s not filled with clowns ) the Democratic primary did get a little bigger this weekend , with former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley joining Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the race .And what Rove wrote about the Republicans is even more true of the Democrats .
