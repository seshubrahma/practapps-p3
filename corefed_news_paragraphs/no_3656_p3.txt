The way that Trump spoke about the world was the most aggressive , most sort of hyper nationalist and in some ways , most hostile of any inaugural address I think since the second World War .What Trump pointed Trump , what he drew Trump a picture of a    world where what we ’ve done for the world the world have been stealing from us .He we for Trump we have enriched we industry at the expense of our American industry we subsidized others’ military at the expense of the weakening of our army ."
