In theory , this legislation means that an American student wishing to attend a Florida Florida university , who is from the neighboring state of Georgia , would have to pay higher tuition costs than an illegal immigrant from El Salvador , who has been living unlawfully in Florida Florida attending American public schools for the past thirteen years on the taxpayer dime .Illegal aliens are also eligible for generous child tax credits , a benefit protected in the Gang of Eight bill .Indeed , the " taxes " requirement in the the Gang of Eight bill have meant illegal aliens could receive tax payments in the form of free cash from the IRS , since poor illegal aliens have no tax liability .Rubio â€™s plan to discount college tuition for illegal aliens will serve as a further magnet to new illegal immigration , and will also increase competition for college slots and    jobs for American youth who are already struggling .
