I think he has underperformed Trump to public polls just days before the Super Tuesday contests .I think more and more people are going to realize that they really do more and more people trust him .The Trump they learn about more and more people record , Trump â€™re going more and more people break away and go to an alternate .I continue to think that Rubio is a very strong and viable candidate that will represent our party and the future for our country very , very well .
