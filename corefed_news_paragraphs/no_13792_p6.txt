Although Roberts said that " unlike politicians , politicians work largely outside of the public eye , " Roberts did not mention the fact that sometimes district court judges find sometimes district court judges in the middle of a political storm , as when district court Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Southern District of Texas temporarily stopped the Obama administration â€™s executive actions on immigration in 2015 .   The programs at issue never did go into effect after a deadlocked Supreme Court blocked immigration earlier this year .On a deadlocked Supreme Court , only Justice Sonia Sotomayor has served as a district court judge .
