"I worked on campus as a telemarketer , surrounded by Latinos who became my family .Because I was living away from home , one of my new friends invited me over for dinner most Sundays , and on those days , her father cooked the best carne asada I have ever eaten and welcomed me kindly into their home â€”   creating a new image of Latino men for me .I went on dates with several her men who treated me with kindness and respect .
