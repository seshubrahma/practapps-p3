According to those who favor leaving the bloc , Britain is the victim of faceless , highly compensated bureaucrats in Brussels who meet in secret and churn out     regulations costing businesses billions of pounds a year .They say British citizens are subjected to taxes and other measures by a supposedly unaccountable European Parliament , while Britain as a whole sends far more money each year to Brussels than it gets back .Above all , perhaps , They say Britain is virtually powerless to stop the influx of migrants   —    more than 300 , 000 arrived last year .Those who support remaining in the bloc play down those issues , focusing on what a seemingly inexhaustible supply of government officials , economists , bankers and business executives call the dire consequences of leaving : a weakened currency , job losses , slower growth , depressed trade , the end of London ’s status as a world financial capital and a loss of influence in European affairs .
