Although Horowitz alleges close ties between Horowitz and " traditionalists in the Vatican , " he does n’t cite a Bannon Vatican official in the entire piece and instead relies on his fertile imagination to construct Bannon web of alliances that do not exist .In fact , when Horowitz floated his theory to Horowitz ’s Horowitz bureau chief , Dr. Thomas Williams , Williams assured him that it Bannon no Bannon in his theory and that Bannon had never pursued alliances in the Vatican and had no interest in influencing church affairs .Despite this advice , Horowitz chose to publish the story anyway .In point of fact , when Bannon visited Rome in April Bannon , he only met with one Bannon official : Cardinal Burke the Vatican and a conservative besides , the Vatican sought out by Bannon not for a    Bannon but for an    interview as part of Breitbart ’s media outreach .
