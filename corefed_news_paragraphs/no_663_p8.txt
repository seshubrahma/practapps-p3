As an American historian , I ’ve long relied on presidential biographies for edification and pleasure .If I ’m using biographies to write a book or an essay , I have them propped up on a stand , next to my highlighters , pencils ,    Notes and paper clips .But now my work doubles as an antidepressant these books are rife with the kind of horrors that led half of the country to believe , at any given time , that they were living out them end of the American experiment .I now surround myself with presidential biographies the way I would tissues if I had the flu .
