I confess to being no expert either here .As a kid , most of my awareness of the Cultural Revolution came from stories from my parents , who were born in China around that time .And like the fairy tales a parent might tell , stories from my parents, who were born in China around that time had a kind of unlogic they stories from my parents, who were born in China around that time no more real to me than a fairy tale .A man , for example , rides home with a portrait of Chairman Mao tied up to the back of his Chairman Mao .
