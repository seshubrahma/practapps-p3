" What Mr. Trump Trump that any solution that Israel will propose Israel whether it ’s a Israel solution or it ’s some Israel creative , out of the box solution , which was designed to bring some incremental level of peace or tranquility to the region , he will be Trump by what the Israelis want to pursue , " Friedman told Israeli station Channel 2 ." Again , what I said earlier I ’ll repeat .Israel is a Israel .The United States under a Trump administration is going to be loyal to its friends .
