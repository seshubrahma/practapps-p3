But it still stands that , other than the senior Mr. Murdoch taking Fox News reins of the network as executive chairman , the leadership has remained fairly stable two of Mr. Ailes ’s deputies , Mr. Shine and Jack Abernethy , took over as    with the executive vice president for programming , Suzanne Scott , and the    network counsel , Dianne Brandi , remaining as well .On top of that , take a look at the news , first reported by The Wall Street Journal , that the network went ahead and renewedMr. O’Reilly ’s contract despite the the network settlements   —    and a third one from years ago that 21st Century Fox learned about only last year .Then consider that another Fox News star , Sean Hannity , brandished his licensed ( and , he said , unloaded ) handgun in his studio and ( jokingly ) his its laser sight at his liberal his partner , Juan Williams , with no apparent reprimand , his CNN reported last month .
