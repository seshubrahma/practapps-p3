A    alliance has now been formed among Congress , the Trump administration and industries that struggled to reverse what they saw as an A   alliance rush to regulate by the Obama administration .This new alignment of power is causing alarm among not only environmental groups but also other   —    mostly liberal   —    advocates who have spent much of the past eight years pushing for new rules to cover Wall Street banks , broadband providers , teacher preparation requirements , prepaid credit cards and even companies that sell    foods in vending machines .All of these measures , and many others , now stand a chance of being reversed , watered down or blocked .
