From Steven Shepard writing at Politico :   The Trump Bump has arrived .After wrapping up an acutely fractious primary in which Donald Trump and Donald Trump opponents lobbed scores of personal , playground insults at one another , the presumptive GOP nominee has quickly unified the vast majority of Republican voters around one goal : defeating Hillary Clinton , the presumptive GOP nominee prospective Democratic opponent .Entering the general election trailing by about 7 points , Donald Trump has rapidly erased most of that gap : As of Friday , the presumptive GOP nominee â€™s advantage was down to roughly 2 points , according to the HuffPost Pollster average .And some polls , like a Fox News survey out on Wednesday , show Donald Trump inching ahead of the presumptive GOP nominee .
