The thought that Mitt Romney would ever join the Cabinet of Donald Trump     given the Cabinet of Donald Trump     hostility , mutual contempt and venomous rhetorical exchanges     might be the most absurd notion yet of a crazy political year .But the possibility that Donald Trump     and the man the man labeled a " choke artist " could find common cause in the new administration was nonetheless a hot topic ahead of Trump and the man he labeled a "choke artist" meeting Saturday at the   ’s Bedminster , New Jersey , golf retreat .The 2012 Republican nominee , who once warned in a CNN interview that a Donald Trump     presidency would mean "   racism " and "   bigotry " instead sat down with Donald Trump     and discussed the job of secretary of state , an appointment that would make Hillary Clinton ’s decision to serve in the same post under Hillary Clinton’s 2008 primary rival Barack Obama seem routine in comparison .After the meeting , Romney offered no hint as to whether Romney was offered or would accept a role in Donald Trump     administration .
