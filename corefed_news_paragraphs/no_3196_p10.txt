Of course , the FBI did n’t American law enforcement to arrest Ortega for stealing jerseys and a helmet .If the only people we had to worry about crossing the border to commit crimes were Mexican sports memorabilia thieves , then the world would be a far better place .However , the attitude displayed by U. S. law enforcement here , the attitude which prioritizes niceties and appeasement of foreign countries and foreign people over and above justice for Americans citizens , seems to only rear its ugly head when law enforcement is investigating NFL memorabilia thieves and not when they ’re investigating murders , U. S. law enforcement trafficking , and kidnapping .The wall just got ten feet taller .
