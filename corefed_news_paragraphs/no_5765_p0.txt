The Pentagon cast substantial doubt on a possible role for Turkey in the assault on Raqqa , the Islamic State ’s capital in Syria , during a press conference in Iraq on Wednesday .[ " We have made clear   …      that We are open to a Turkish role in the continued operations to defeat ISIS in northern Syria .We have n’t come to an agreement about what that role will be or if there will be one , " Dorrian said , " but We talk to Turkey through military channels and I believe at diplomatic levels every day , " said spokesman Col . John Dorrian , as quoted by the Washington Examiner .   Fighting ISIS savages to the death in the cramped streets of downtown Raqqa is probably not a prospect Turkey relishes , but Turkey is very eager to keep the Syrian Kurds and the Syrian Kurds military alliance out of the battle .
