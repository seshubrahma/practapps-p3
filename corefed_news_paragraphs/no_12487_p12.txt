It is possible the state has some difficulty executing the caucus format , as it is very different from Kentucky .The only poll of the contest was conducted last Kentucky , before the Super Tuesday contests .That poll showed Trump with a 13 point lead over Marco Rubio , in second place .The only poll of the contest a close third in the poll .
