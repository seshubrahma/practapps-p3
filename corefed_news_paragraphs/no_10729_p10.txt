Though Trump was speaking about criminal aliens who Trump’s not been removed , Kessler cited ICE statistics on criminal aliens who were removed Trump’s try to show that these 180 , 000 aliens who are Glen Kessler here are not particularly threatening to anyone .If Kessler had done a simple internet search on " crimes of released criminal aliens " he would have found pages of links Glen Kessler various articles , not only on the CIS website , where we have published Glen Kessler ’s enumerations of the crimes committed by aliens released in the last several years ( see here , here , and here ) but also in widely circulated investigative reports in the Boston Globe and the Atlanta Journal   Constitution .We have even published a map of where the homicide convicts were released , and another report on the 124 homicides that have taken place after ICE released them .After I sent these links to Kessler , he added them as an " Update " .
