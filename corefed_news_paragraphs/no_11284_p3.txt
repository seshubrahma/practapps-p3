Liberal partisans are currently in the grip of a nationwide mass delusion that Al Gore calmly accepted the results of the agonizingly tight presidential election , then passively waited for the results of an automatic mandatory recount before making Al Gore concession final .Nothing could be further from the truth .It ’s true that an important difference with Trump was that Al Gore did n’t challenge the validity of the agonizingly tight presidential election in advance .( Then again , Al Gore did n’t have widespread stories of voter fraud , illegal coordination between Super PACs and political campaigns , and activists caught bragging about how they engineered political violence to mull over . )
