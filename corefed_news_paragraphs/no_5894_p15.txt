I say : Maybe in the very short term , just long enough for American manufacturers to fill the void or foreign corporations to    facilities in America , employing Americans to build their products for consumption domestically and abroad , thereby avoiding the tariff .To Americans who say : " They will just go elsewhere to sell their products , " I say if those who say: "They will just go elsewhere to sell their products could do that now why would those who say: "They will just go elsewhere to sell their products they be doing it , and those who say: "They will just go elsewhere to sell their products demand does nâ€™t go away because of those who say: "They will just go elsewhere to sell their products tariff on imports .That void will be filled either by domestic manufacturers or foreign shipments with a Treasury check .Meanwhile , a freight train of money will be steady delivering tariff collections to the U. S. Treasury , commingled with tax receipts from American businesses whose export businesses will explode when the tariffs are in place .
