At the stroke of 12:01 p. m. on Friday , as soon as Donald J. Trump is sworn in as president and Barack Obama relinquishes the office , dozens of federal workers will swing into action at the White House to replace one commander in chief ’s creature comforts   —    favorite snacks , clothes , toiletries , artwork and furniture   —    with those of his successor .The process , months in the planning but mere hours in its militarylike execution , unfolds mostly away from public view as Americans and the world focus on the pageantry of Inauguration Day : the presidential oath and address at the Capitol , a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue , the    balls .For the roughly 100 people who work in the White House and the employees on hand to help the employees with perhaps the world ’s    moving day , the official events double as useful distractions that keep the exiting president and his family and the incoming occupants    during the work ."
