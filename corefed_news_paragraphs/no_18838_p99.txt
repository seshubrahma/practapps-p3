â€™" I also fear that , as increased automation comes to the workplace , we are going to see fewer and fewer job opportunities for    workers .We could be in a position where either illegal immigrants will need the Democrats government assistance , OR current Americans will lose jobs and see the few remaining ones ( such as in retail , services , sanitation , etc . ) taken by illegal immigrants , so they would need heavy government assistance .Long term , illegal immigrants will have children who will compete against my children for university spots and job opportunities .
