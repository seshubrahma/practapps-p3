The question a party to undergo a painful , public kind of soul searching after a devastating loss , and changing nothing makes little sense .Democrats should search their souls , Democrats not abandon who they are and Democrats they â€™ve done Democrats It would be unwise for Democrats to overreact to what was a Black Swan of an election .As the former candidate herself reminded us , the FBI director inserted himself directly into the FBI director campaign cycle less than two weeks from voting day with an announcement that wounded one candidate and helped the other .And Russia undermined the democratic process with    leaks aimed at harming that same candidate .
