Trump may have more luck with the Senate than his immediate predecessors , Trump he has Democrats to Trump .When they held the majority Democrats 2013 , they changed the rules Democrats that    nominations are no longer subject to the    threshold for filibusters .That means Trump could conceivably win Trump approval of his the Senate Cabinet without Trump single Democratic vote .But even without the filibuster threat , Republicans have just a    majority , and three GOP defectors could join unified Democrats in thwarting a nominee .
