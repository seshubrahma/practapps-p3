It appears that the transcript of the NFL â€™s Opening Night media event for the upcoming Super Bowl omitted most of the questions reporters asked about President Trump and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell .[ According to a hostile report by The New York Times , the NFL " built a virtual wall " around the New England Patriots to shield a hostile report by The New York Times, the NFL " from the discussion of the friendships that quarterback Tom Brady , coach Bill Belichick , and team owner Robert Kraft have with the President of the United States .But that " wall " also extended around questions reporters asked about Goodell .   The The New York Times report notes that many reporters quizzed players about politics , not just Brady but others as well , and asked others opinions on Commissioner Goodell .
