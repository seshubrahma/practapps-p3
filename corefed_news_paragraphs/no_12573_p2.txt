I think what ’s happened here , if you step back for a second , the Republicans have experienced the biggest ideological earthquake of a major party in the Republicans lifetime .50 , 60 years of conservatism has now yielded to a leader who ’s not a conservative , but who ’s a populist .That ’s a big deal .And I think what the Ryan statement is , the Ryan equivocation is , Ryan ’s saying , if a major party is now going to be split between the leader , the populist , and the old line conservatives , whether they a major party establishment or not does n’t matter .
