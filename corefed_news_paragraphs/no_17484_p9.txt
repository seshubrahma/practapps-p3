Russian language teachers taught us Russian to make papier mach√© Matryoshka dolls and bake delicious blinis       pancakes .At home I practiced preparing blinis , driving my mom crazy .   Once a week our teachers would make us tour local orphanages and our to mingle with other Russian children , bringing them Russian and books .other Russian children had a pen pal named   Anna with whom for a couple of years we kept writing to each our even after I left Moscow .
