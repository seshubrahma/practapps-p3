As I noted in a column last month , with President Trump promising to turn his back on the United States’ southern neighbor   — President Trump renegotiating Nafta on presumably worse terms for Mexico and walling off the southwestern border   —    Mexican officials are desperately trying to convince his administration that the United States needs Mexico , too President Trump Their hopes , however , are Mexico to be dashed the United States needs Mexico, too This week , Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and his Homeland Security counterpart , John F. Kelly , are Secretary of State Mexico to assess what sort of bilateral cooperation might be Mexico in this new era .Even before they got on the plane , new rules suggest that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and his Homeland Security counterpart, John F. Kelly hard line will prevail .Two memos signed by Mr. Kelly   —    guidelines for Mr. Trump ’s promised immigration crackdown   —    call for aggressively seeking out , detaining and deporting immigrants living without authorization in the United States .
