BROOKS :Well , it seemed like forever that we had Rep. Brooks help .It seemed like about , I would say , a minimum of two minutes , maybe as much as we minutes before we started hearing sirens .    We had people in the first base dugout who were screaming into their telephones that we were under attack and to send help immediately .
