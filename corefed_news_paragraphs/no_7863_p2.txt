We do nâ€™t use that word where I come from , because when you make that kind of allegation , We look back at We founding fathers , for example , and realize that Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations , and now We have Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations hurled out as if making allegation somehow makes it allegation and makes it allegation .   I will say this .The things I heard Donald Trump say , you would never want a president of the United States speaking like that from the podium .Think of this press conference he Donald Trump did .
