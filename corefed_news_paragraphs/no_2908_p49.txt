Hollywood there ’s a casual intimacy to the few hours we ’ve spent together , shooting the breeze with a rapport so easy that I keep turning the recorder back on after I assume the interview is over him talking about Pitt under the spell of New Orleans , or being a " sucker for an underdog story , " or how " Beasts of the Southern Wild " is an amazing film that broke his heart .Pitt bad thing about playing an interview slow and loose is that you ’re never sure how to end it .So I keep hanging out at his office , Pitt the compound and overhearing him on the Pitt dealing with daddy business , when I realize I ’m about to miss my flight .He orders me Pitt car and walks me outside to the gate .
