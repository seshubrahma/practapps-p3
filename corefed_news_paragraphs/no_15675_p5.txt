Trump ’s first voyage abroad was a story told in chapters , each successively less pleasant for a President still taking stock of his standing on the world stage .Beyond a scattering of formal remarks , none of the story was told by Trump himself , who refused to hold a news conference and , by his advisers’ own admission , revealed little of his thinking to top aides as his hopped from nation to nation .Instead , it was a trip told in pictures with the volume on mute .By the time his departed Sicily , Trump had delivered four major addresses but clarified none of the questions that surround Trump foreign policy .
