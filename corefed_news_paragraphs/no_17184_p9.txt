After all Trump not only bragged about sexually assaulting women in the infamous " Access Hollywood " tape , he mocked Carly Fiorina Trump face and , worse , he publicly shamed the Trump women who accused him of sexual misconduct Trump calling them all liars .True , some women were not troubled by these comments , but a public apology to the big chunk that were could possibly build bridges .   There are , of course , others Trump might want to consider apologizing to     to prove he has changed as Trump person and learned right from wrong .For example , Mercutio Southall Jr. a Black Lives Matter protester attacked by Trump â€™s fans at Trump rally in November 2015 .
