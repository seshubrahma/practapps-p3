Entering a meeting with Mr. Trump last week , Mr. Kobach was photographed carrying a sheaf of policy recommendations .The visible text proposed to " Draft Amendments to the National Voter "   â€”    an apparent reference to the 1993 National Voter Registration Act , the " motor voter " law that has come under sharp attack from Republicans .The law prohibits states from purging voters from the rolls for technical reasons like moving within a district , and imposes a waiting period and other requirements to remove voters .Conservatives say the requirements keep ineligible voters on the rolls and promote fraud .
