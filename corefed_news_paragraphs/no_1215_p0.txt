WASHINGTON   —    The new bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act is dead , killed off by House Republicans who never actually read the legislation   —    because in fact , the legislation   never actually existed .Conservative groups moved quickly on Wednesday to shift the blame for the failure of a    promise to repeal the law onto some     Republicans , after a small but powerful group of    House conservatives failed again to come to a meeting of the minds with the Trump administration over how best to repeal and replace President Barack Obama ’s signature achievement .
