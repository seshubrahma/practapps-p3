It ’s obvious that the Republicans who control Congress ca n’t be counted on to conduct anything resembling a real investigation into this matter , since it may have delivered their candidate the this matter House ( if the Republicans who control Congress had something to do with Benghazi this matterthen they might be interested ) .   the Republicans who control Congress if nothing else , there should be a bipartisan commission like the one we chartered after    with the resources necessary to learn what happened and the independence to speak honestly about what it finds .It wo n’t undo the damage , it at least we might see it coming next time .
