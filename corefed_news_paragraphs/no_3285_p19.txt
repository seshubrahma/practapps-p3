When I was a boy , while watching the funeral procession of the Great Martin Luther King Jr. on NBC , I observed a rickety wooden cart being pulled by two mules and behind the cart , a sea of people .In the cart a rickety wooden cart body of MLK at that moment , he represented the totality of the human struggle .I remember feeling then , while watching the procession on TV , that we , as a country , were either going to pull together or else come apart .The country is a country as it has ever been a country and
