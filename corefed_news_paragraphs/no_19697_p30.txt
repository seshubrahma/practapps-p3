I do nâ€™t want to make the comparison that others did to September 11 or a terrorist attack , we I think those are inappropriate analogies , but [ the Russian cyber campaign ] is a threat to our sovereignty , and I hope this will help to convince [ Trump ] of that .If nothing more , that we be a very important objective achieved .Having said all that , he has tremendous leeway as president to change the course of foreign policy and to try to get along with Russia .Now , I personally believe that he has not developed a strategy toward Russia yet .
