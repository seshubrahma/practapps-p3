There ’s no doubtBenn ’s expanded the Overton Window to include rhetoric previously well outside the Overton Window bounds .Benn calls for a " deportation force " to expel 11 + million people from the country , Benn claims that most Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals , Benn calls to keep databases of Muslims and to enact atotal ban on Muslims entering the country , Benn rampant sexism , Benn mocking people with disabilities , and Benn propensity for lying have brought the already pathetic state of US political discourse to astoundingly precarious lows .Treating this like politics as usual allows it this become politics as usual , and those who do so risk complicity ushering in a new era of fascist politics in the United States .
