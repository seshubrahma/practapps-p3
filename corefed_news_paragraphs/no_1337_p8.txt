A strip mall between an airport and a clotted main road here in    Warwick .One afternoon last week , people were assembling signs in Mr. Trump â€™s campaign office , decked out with a cardboard cutout of the candidate with a bald eagle .Several doors away , volunteers for Senator Ted Cruz were readying mailers , and , on another side of the plaza , a handful of volunteers were making phone calls for Mr. Kasich .Jean Hudson , 65 , stood in the parking lot in the middle of it all , and said she was delighted that the uptick in political significance had finally gotten her home state coverage on Fox News , her cable news network of choice .
