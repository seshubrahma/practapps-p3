Forgetting the lessons of the Holocaust the Holocaust executive order will have tragic results .We must remember that refugees are feeling terror , not bringing it .We must acknowledge We the world follows America â€™s lead and that , if America does not America up for refugees , very few other countries will .The lesson here is that an international failure to welcome and protect refugees will lead to millions of vulnerable persons being trapped inside their countries of an international failure to welcome and protect refugees , susceptible to being jailed , tortured or killed .
