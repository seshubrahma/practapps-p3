What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by    Trump himself or his supporters that One reporter seem hostile to minorities and others ?Specifically , I â€™m talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon , who is a proponent of the      movement , what many call the white nationalist movement , is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist President Trump senior advisor .What message does that send to the country , to the world ?But Obama refused to engage with the ongoing criticism of Bannon , citing his responsibility to Obama a smooth transition of power .
