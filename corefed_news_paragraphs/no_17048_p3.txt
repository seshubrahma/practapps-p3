Hence , the differences we observe between electoral and popular votes have less to do with obdurate electors and more to do with the ways in which electoral votes are assigned and counted .To be sure , the number of electors   —    generally selected by party officials and assigned to each state   —    crucially depends upon its population .each state   by setting a minimum on the number of electors who represent each state , no matter how small , and then by awarding a state ’s electoral votes to a candidate on a     basis ( Maine and Nebraska excepted ) the results of the Electoral College vote may deviate rather substantially from the popular vote .    Usually this happens because the winning margin of the popular vote in a state gets exaggerated in the final count of the Electoral College .
