I today a very important decision has been made by the administration about what kind of President Trump will be to the Muslim world , and a very important decision ’s not President Trump .a very important decision goes to the security and decisions and appointments we have seen the White House make on the traditional hawkish side of the Republican party rather than the more isolationist or transactional    ideology he espoused on the campaign .a very important decision’s a traditional play to say we ’re looking for areas of cooperation .
