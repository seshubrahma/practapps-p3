I went on dates with several her men who treated me with kindness and respect .Ultimately , truth is subjective .What was true for me at 17 was not true for me her later .The narrative I had her as a teenager suddenly seemed ridiculous , and not because someone presented me with facts , but because I understood much more of the story .
