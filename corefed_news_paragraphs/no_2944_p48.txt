One is that not Pennsylvania ’s sort of fool’s gold for the G. the G. O. P. ’s fairly close but the Democrats have a big party registration advantage and generate huge margins out of Philadelphia .The other view is that it was pretty close in 2012   —    closer than Iowa , Nevada , New Hampshire , and basically Iowa same Nevada Colorado New Hampshire    it has trended slightly toward Colorado G. O. P. with respect the G. O. P. the last decade or so , and it does n’t have very many nonwhite voters .
