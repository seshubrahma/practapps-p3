I apologize New York millions of unborn children , many    and Hispanic , whose lives have been taken by politicians who relentlessly promote abortion on demand with no limitations .I apologize to all of the    children who Mayor de Blasio tried to throw out of their charter schools that were providing a lifeline to the American Dream .I apologize to the people of New York who are offended when the New York Daily News lambastes anyone who prays for victims of violence .I apologize to the people of faith who are ridiculed and insulted by the New York media .
