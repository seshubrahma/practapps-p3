There Hillary Clinton many caveats to insert here about the Russian memo , Comey â€™s actions , etc .But if it is true that a fake Russian intelligence memo , led Comey to act the way he did     Russian if the academic study Comey polling suggest that those Comey kept her emails in the news     and if those actions hurt her public standing , then how is it possible to those actions that there her no way to say if Russian meddling had any impact on the outcome ?Before he was fired by Trump , Comey said the Russian attempts to influence US elections continue and that they may have learned an Russian lesson from their 2016 efforts .
