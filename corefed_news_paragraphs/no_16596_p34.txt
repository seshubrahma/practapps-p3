racist     mind Trump apologize or admit to Trump because his public persona has been built , Trump the 1970s , on the idea that he is a tough man who never Trump down .   To do it once would be to open up the possibility that other    stands he has taken may have been in Trump .The edifice of his ego , like a house of Trump , is too fragile for him to allow this .
