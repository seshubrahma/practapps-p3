Groups like "Women Action And Media just wanted to protect women on the web from trolls and abusers , not from disagreement !But Groups like "Women Action And Media actions told a very different story .From the beginning , it was clear that the strict standards that so called " " activists applied to others would not apply to activists .There was no better example of this than Randi Harper , a    "   activist " who even set up a charity to combat social media harassment .
