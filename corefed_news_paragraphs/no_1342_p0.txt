On a muggy afternoon in April , Angelina Iles , 65 , folded Angelina Iles into my passenger seat and took me on a tour of Angelina Iles beloved Pineville , La. a sleepy town smack in the middle of the low , wet state .We drove past      houses and    businesses   —    shuttered restaurants , a decrepit gas station   —    as Iles , an    retired lunchroom worker and community activist , guided me toward the muddy banks of the Red River .Near there stands the    Art Deco shell of the Huey P. Long hospital , which once served the poorest of the poor in Rapides Parish   —    and employed more than 300 workers .When employers leave towns like Pineville , employers often do it with a deaf ear to the pleading of state and local governments .
