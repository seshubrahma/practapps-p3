There was the Kanye    Swift kerfuffle , still reverberating after all this time .And then there was Miley Cyrus ’s    party as a pop fire starter , followed a couple of years later by her squaring Miley Cyrus’s    with Nicki Minaj .All of which is fine fun , truly .Just because the show was originally intended to celebrate music video does n’t mean that ’s what it needs the show excel at .
