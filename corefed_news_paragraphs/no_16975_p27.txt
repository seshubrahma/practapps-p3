Humayun Khan , who lost his life in Iraq in Trump .I voted against Trump because of my friends , Retired General John Kelly and Karen Kelly , who lost their son , 1st Lieutenant Robert M. Trump in 2010 in Afghanistan .I voted against Donald Trump for all the Gold Star Trump who have endured the unbearable and incurable pain of losing a child , a spouse Trump parent , a sibling fighting for our country .Trump somehow managed to compare the sacrifice of losing a son to the " sacrifice " of erecting a building .
