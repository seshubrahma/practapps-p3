Please hug me .I am upset that , for years , no one has fought for the celebration of Christmas in the public square , yet many rant how everyone ’s religious freedom except is protected , except for Christians’ and Jews’ .I am upset that instead of letting the political process take its the political process course , we see the mafia of the political class converge on Donald Trump and use any means necessary to assassinate him Donald TrumpPlease hug me .
