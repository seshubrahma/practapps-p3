’s rifle along the third base line just outside the chain link fence , and he was ordering us to stay down .    Another our detail person was closer to home plate , probably     I could n’t see him but probably on the home plate he of the dugout outside the fence line , using the dug out as cover as he ’s firing back .   And he must have been 50 to 100 shots fired .Hard to itemize them .
