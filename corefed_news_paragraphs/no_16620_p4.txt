A new campaign ad features footage of Trump warning that anyone with a low opinion of Trump citizens is unfit to lead the nation     then uses a torrent of anyone with a low opinion of its citizens is unfit to lead the nation    then inflammatory statements about Mexicans , women ,    the disabled and Muslims , to condemn the GOP nominee out of the GOP nominee own mouth .With Clinton off the trail as Clinton recovers from pneumonia , prolonging the " deplorable " meme also has the virtue of keeping campaign conversation away from controversies that the campaign has more trouble finessing     like Clinton email server or the campaign patchy disclosure about the state of Clinton health .Both sides have solid reasons to want this controversy play out .
