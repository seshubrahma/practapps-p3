But this Electric Youth coffee pale ale from Thunderhawk Alements was just too good .I â€™d never had a coffee beer that tasted so intensely and convincingly of coffee .There was a sweetness to the coffee component that tasted of berries and flowers , juxtaposed with the hoppy , bitter malt of this Electric Youth coffee pale ale from Thunderhawk Alements .Even better ?
