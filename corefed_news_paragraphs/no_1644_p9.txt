We affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system .Without a focus on educational outcomes for every American , we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained .Republicans like me need to have the courage to speak the truth about where we are and what has to be done .We have to have the courage we go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that we children have access to the we educational situation they may need .
