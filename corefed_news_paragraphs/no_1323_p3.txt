The section was a petition covering raw aluminum imports with an American trade panel by President George W. Bush in 2001 to start a Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act that led to American tariffs on steel imports the following year .A Section 201 case covers essentially all imports of a product from all over the world .That makes it more substantial than    and    cases against imports from a single country .The European Union objected to President Bush    use of Section 201 , which resulted in American tariffs on a wide range of steel products , until the administration dropped them in late 2003 .
