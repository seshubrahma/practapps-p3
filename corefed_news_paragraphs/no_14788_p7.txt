That kind of thinking may well have pulled tens of thousands of this year â€™s migrants to accelerate their journey , leaving in the winter instead of the spring .That could be what the data indicate .Of course , it will take years for a wall to be built and new enforcement agents to be hired , but that delay is a potential accelerant to border crossings , not a deterrent .The deterrent on immigration will be the change in internal enforcement , not the wall .
