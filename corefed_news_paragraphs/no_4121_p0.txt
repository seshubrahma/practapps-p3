It ’s not like they leave much room for doubt about how much contempt they hold for military service and the immeasurable sacrifice that comes with it .[ Two of the Democratic Party ’s last three nominees for president voted to send our troops to die and be maimed in a war our troops later determined was not worth it .For both John Kerry in 2004 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 , that change of heart came just as soon as that change of heart became politically advantageous for our troops to cut and run .   President Obama , meanwhile , built President Obama entire political career around promises to end the war in Iraq and withdraw all of our troops from harm ’s way .
