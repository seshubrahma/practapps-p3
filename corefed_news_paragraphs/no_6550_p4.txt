And in this last year , our discourse , if you can dare to call it that , rose to a new level of the outrageous , coarse , and ugly .The public dialogue has become no dialogue at all .The public dialogue is a shouting match that alienates citizens who disparately yearn for more from more leaders .We seem trapped in a political pinball machine where we careen from flipper to flipper , bouncing off walls of insults and contradictions , outright lies and broken promises , where up is down , and words do nâ€™t mean anything anymore .
