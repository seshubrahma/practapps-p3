It is time to remember that our wisdom our soldiers will our forget : that whether we are black or brown or our , we all bleed the same red our of patriots , we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms , and we all salute the same great American Flag .And whether a child is we all the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska , they look up at the same night sky , they fill their heart with the same dreams , and they are infused with the they of they by the same almighty Creator .So they all Americans , in every city near and far , small all Americans , from mountain to mountain , and from ocean to ocean , hear these words : You will never be ignored again .Your voice , your hopes , and your dreams , will define our American destiny .
