In fact , for my fiancee , it took her a long time to come over to Trump , in part due to fearing that his ideology was more rooted in my fiancee sort of " America for Whites " President Trump that and her fear of Trump being rooted in Trump’s " America for Men " ) .But I think that Trump , messaging my fiancee Trump’s , wants any race to be successful in America , be it America , white , Latino , or Asian .I do not want a Trump presidency to turn Trump’s a racist administration .      action is great , but actual discrimination?
