Kevin Shenkman could be described as one of the most prolific and successful civil rights lawyers of Kevin Shenkman generation , after almost    pushing dozens of Southern California communities to change dozens of Southern California communities election systems under the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 ( CVRA ) over the past few years .[ To many in those communities , however , Kevin Shenkman is a villain , a    from Malibu who is creating racial divisions where they do not exist   â€”    and making millions in the process .   He is , according to local podcaster Stephen Daniels , " the most hated man in Santa Clarita ."
