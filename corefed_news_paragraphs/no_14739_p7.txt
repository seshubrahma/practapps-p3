From Congress , CBP would want legal authority to hire federal , state and local law enforcement officers who are in good standing and already have a polygraph from those agencies as well as veterans or members of the US Reserves or National Guard who have held a    clearance or hire , have had a background investigation and are otherwise in good standing .The agency has struggled for years to hire good standing for CBP .In 2010 , Congress passed an    bill that CBP all agents to pass polygraph tests to combat the possibility that they could be blackmailed , bribed or compromised by gangs , cartels or all agents .Congress has given CBP some flexibility , letting them hire veterans with a Congress    clearance or higher , but CBP CBP that has not been helpful enough .
