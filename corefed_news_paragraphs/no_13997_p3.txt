With both Trump ’s inauguration and the 44th anniversary of Roe v Wade decision fast approaching , I have been concerned that Donald Trump the man —   as president of the United States —   would actually strengthen in the American imagination the popular feminist fallacy that abortion is necessary to women’s equality .After all , Donald Trump as "   candidate " fit perfectly the    caricature of an abortion opponent : degrading to and disrespectful of women .If I could say just one thing to those at the Women ’s March , it would be this : the constitutional right to abortion has only made men like Donald Trump worse .
