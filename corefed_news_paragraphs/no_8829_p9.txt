Ye hypocrites !Like figures in Madame Tussauds wax museum , they stand together bloodless and stiff   â€”    figures in Madame Tussauds wax museum dead elitists who dare go among us , the Great Unwashed .I have met some of them .Some are nice , but the majority figures in Madame Tussauds wax museum so elitist that they are like a synod of intellectual snobbery
