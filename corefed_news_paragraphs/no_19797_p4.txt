More than 1 , 200    faced sanctions in the ‘ 90s , according to the researchers .the researchers found that when schools were threatened with the loss of access to federal aid , the percentage of Pell grant recipients (   students who depend on federal grants and loans to pay for their federal grants and loans education ) who enrolled declined by about 53 percent in the following five years .Interestingly , enrollment at neighboring    schools also fell , even if they enrollment at neighboring   schools n’t sanctioned , perhaps because the reputation of the entire sector was damaged by the sanctions .That might sound dire but it turns out these students were n’t dropping out of college completely .
