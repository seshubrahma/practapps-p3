One area of potential concern is a 2008 investigation by the Justice Department â€™s inspector general , which looked into Mr. Puzder hiring practices and case assignments at Mr. Puzder civil rights division he led were based on political affiliations .A report on the case found that Mr. Acosta had ignored warning signs about such problems .Another pitfall could be a 2004 letter to a federal judge in Ohio that Mr. Acosta sent while he was at the Justice Department , justifying " vote caging " in the presidential election .The practice , in which private citizens in Ohio Mr. Acosta eligibility of    Mr. Acosta , was widely seen as a Republican strategy to disenfranchise minorities .
