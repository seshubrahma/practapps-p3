The actual results also tend to imply that the census and Catalist figures make a lot more sense in many of the cases where the disagreements are greatest .Take Ohio , where the exit polls show that the black share of the electorate increased by four percentage points to more than 15 percent of voters in 2012 .If these figures are taken as precise , it would imply that nearly 250 , 000 more black voters turned out than in 2008 , with the turnout reaching 88 percent of adult black citizens .There is no trace of this kind of surge in turnout in the actual result .
