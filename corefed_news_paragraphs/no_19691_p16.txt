And Joanne Allard , 58 , from Tucson : " I ’ve recently decided to try and make eye contact with and pass along a cheerful    to people I ordinarily ignore .I ’m talking hellos , good afternoons , lovely weathers , etc .with an emphasis on projecting genuine interest .I just got to thinking one day that I tend to avoid contact with people who look as though they ’d staunchly people who look as though they’d staunchly disagree with my politics with my politics , and it occurred to me that maybe ’m could help make next year a better one by trying to connect in a positive way .
