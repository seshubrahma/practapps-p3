It coincides in no small part with gaping economic inequality : CEOs now make 300 times what average employees earn , up from 20 times in 1965 the weakening of labor unions and the overall diminished standing of the American workforce .    Past generations of executives more regularly consulted with ( and lived among ) those different and rivalrous stakeholders who prioritized any number of considerations over profit maximization .Those employee and community stakeholders are now relatively marginalized , and the executives more socioeconomically cloistered .Those employee and community stakeholders leave corporate leaders ill situated to run highly pluralistic government agencies     where career civil servants and the public writ large exercise considerable influence     let alone take account of the interests , needs , and lived experiences of working Americans .
