I ca n’t help but wonder what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 Never Trump crisis , at a time when leadership , compromise and careful analysis were critical .The only reason we avoided another Great Depression was because Republicans and Democrats joined together to vote for the Troubled Asset Relief Program   —    a vote that they knew would be politically unpopular Republicans and Democrats in the best interest of our country .Critical to that effort was the leadership of President George W. Bush .As I led Treasury ’s efforts to fashion a difficult , imperfect , controversial but essential solution with bipartisan support , I was   —    and still am   —    grateful to have had President Bush at the helm .
