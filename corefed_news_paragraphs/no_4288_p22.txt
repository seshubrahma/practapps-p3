Young adults with a bachelor ’s degree earn 62 % more than one with only a high school diploma .The percentage of jobs requiring a bachelor ’s degree has doubled in the past forty years .These facts made it obvious to me that men need education to be successful , and education takes money .We look forward to helping 10 men in the Spring , and many more in the years to come .
