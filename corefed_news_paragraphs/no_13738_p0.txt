John Quincy Adams , quintessential Boston Brahman and archenemy of a General and     Andrew Jackson , had a plan .[ Rumors circulated that Jackson was illiterate ( Adams had called him " a barbarian who could not write a sentence of grammar and hardly could spell him own name " ) and Adams amused Adams with the thought of giving Jackson an honorary Harvard degree , the speech for which was traditionally given in Latin .So Adams arranged to have the backwoods president invited and assumed the illiterate Jackson would decline .   Jackson accepted .
