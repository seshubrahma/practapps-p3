We laws and our government’s regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman and actively promote married family life as the basis of a stable and prosperous society .For that reason , as explained elsewhere in the platform , We do not accept the Supreme Court ’s redefinition of marriage and we urge the Supreme Court’s reversal , whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to states . "" We emphatically support the original , authentic meaning of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 .
