I described , among other things , the experience of visiting Clinton ’s Brooklyn headquarters and receiving , before I arrived , an email request from a press aide requesting that I keep " the office itself " off the record .In other words , they wanted me not to relay anything that I saw inside the entire     space , as if I were being granted access to a    Pentagon bunker or something .It was a ridiculous request that I refused .I also said no initially when the campaign said I could interview Secretary Clinton but only on the condition that we do the campaign off the record the record speak off the record to politicians all the time , but this was an unusual provision and felt slightly weird : a major candidate for president ’s agreeing to speak to a reporter on the condition that readers not be privy ?
