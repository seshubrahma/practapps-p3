Washington ( CNN )For nearly two weeks now , President Donald Trump and his aides have floated a conspiracy theory involving President Barack Obama wiretapping    Trump ’s phone lines in his Manhattan office building .    Even now , as bipartisan agreement has emerged that no such thing happened ,   Trump has dug in , leaving   Trump aides and allies fumbling for excuses and explanations     like that spying microwaves are apparently a thing , according to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway .Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Friday news conference ,   Trump showed that   Trump was not ready to quit the wiretapping story , giving the wiretapping story another boost , even if the wiretapping story meant embarrassing a world leader .
