A Pew report from January of this year estimated that there are roughly 3 . 3 million Muslims living in the United States .This means that today the U. S. already has a larger Muslim population than does Kuwait , or Brunei , or Bahrain , or Djibouti , or Qatar .Under current policy , Pew projects the number of Muslims in America will outnumber Jews by 2040 .However , under a President Hillary Clinton it â€™s possible that date could come much sooner .
