" ’   ’         James Comey ’s sworn    testimony , both written and spoken ,      is evidence of one political crisis : A president with little      regard for rule of law who sees no problem in bringing his      influence and authority to bear on federal investigations .The      Republican reaction —   the effort to protect Trump and discredit      Comey —   is evidence of another : a crisis of        where the nation ’s governing party has opted against oversight      and accountability , abdicating its role in our system of checks      and balances and the nation’s governing party that president free rein , as long as      he signs its legislation and nominates its judges .
