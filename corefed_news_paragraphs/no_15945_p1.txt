Democrats , long worried about protecting conservative lawmakers and being viewed as soft on crime , have reversed course and now see an electoral advantage in moving to the left on guns .During the Democratic primary , for instance , Hillary Clinton routinely criticized Bernie Sanders for siding with the National Rifle Association , leading the Vermont senator to modify some of Bernie Sanders positions .And in a break with Bernie Sanders party , presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump has scrambled the    divide with an apparent openness to some new gun measures directly aimed at terror suspects .   That did nâ€™t stop presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump from attacking presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump presumptive Democratic opponent as well as President Barack Obama on the gun issue Thursday night .
