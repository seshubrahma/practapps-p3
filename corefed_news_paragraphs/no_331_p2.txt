The choice for Supreme Court is likely to meet conservativesâ€™ expectations .But fulfilling even a    goal of the    movement , like defunding Planned Parenthood , will be a longer and more complicated process than it appears , setting up an early and potentially defining test for the new president .Mr. Trump , an eager if improbable combatant in the cause , made bold promises about what he would do to restrict abortion if elected and , in turn , won overwhelming support from religious conservatives .Yet those bold promises about what he would do to restrict abortion if elected now tangled in intraparty politics and , in some cases at least , will be blocked by Senate Democrats .
