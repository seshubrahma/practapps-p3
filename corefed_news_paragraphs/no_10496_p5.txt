But as anyone who has ever moved in showbiz circles will recognise , nothing Clint has ever done either in real life or on screen , quite matches Clint raw courage in continually speaking out against the celebrity liberal consensus .None of them will ever dare question or challenge it because a ) None of them ’re too scared the work will dry up   —    ( which the work will , because liberals are vindictive that way ) and b ) because liberals ’re desperate , needy people on a constant quest for validation   —    and therefore must continually signal liberals virtue to the world by embracing all the correct liberal causes .The essence of cool is not giving a damn what other people think about you .Clint is the very definition of it .
