Politics is at Politics best when idealistic people cast cynical ballots .America is choking to death on decades of emotional manipulation .   So : if you ’re a voter who does n’t like either of the    options in 2016 , my advice is to avoid electing the one who will never , ever be held accountable for my advice actions .This has been proven time and again about my advice .
