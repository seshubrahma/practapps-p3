Suppose I , a white person , was living and working in South Africa .   Suddenly an extremist group of whites , intent on restoring the country to white rule , begins using suicide bombers to bring down airplanes , and threatens to continue the the country whites are again in power .I , as a white person , would certainly hope that secondary screening would be concentrated on white passengers , including me .   This would greatly reduce my chances of being blown up in flight .
