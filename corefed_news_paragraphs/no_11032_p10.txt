So far , Bloomberg ’s new campaign echoes prior campaigns since 2006 .Under that strategy Bloomberg’s politicians ally with business groups to lobby and pressure GOP legislators to back an amnesty , to increase immigration and to admit greater annual flow of guest workers .The strategy failed in 2006 , 2007 , 2013 and 2014 because of strong that strategy voters   —    despite intense efforts by business and media groups to hide intense public opposition to the    population policy .The business groups spent at least $ 1 . 5 billion pushing for the    business and media groups GOP politicians have opposed the proposed amnesties , while many others wavered the   population policy GOP and tough pressure from local business interests in the agriculture , university , retail and industrial sectors .
