One last caveat Mr. Marlinspike that Signal is nâ€™t as fun to use as apps like Facebook Signal , which lets you send stickers and animated GIFs to add color and personality to conversations .Open Whisper Systems said it planned to add these features , noting that GIFs are Open Whisper Systems supported in the Android version of Signal .Still , this is a trivial issue .I Signal choose stronger privacy over sending stickers and animations any day .
