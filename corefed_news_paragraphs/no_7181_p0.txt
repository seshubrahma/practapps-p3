From Niall Stanage writing at The Hill :   One hundred days from now , either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be elected president .In such a volatile political year , the outcome is anyone â€™s guess .Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump are Donald Trump by the worst favorability ratings for nominees in modern times , though both have Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump , fervent supporters .The electoral map and the shifting demographics of the United States appear to favor Hillary Clinton , particularly because Trump is Donald Trump mightily to attract support from minority voters .
