Assad was a slow and brutal death for so many , even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack .No child of God should ever suffer such a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where a chemical attack was launched .It is in the vital , national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons .There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons , violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention and ignored Syria urging of the U. N. Security Syria .
