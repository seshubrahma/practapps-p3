As the summer comes to a close , we are pretty late into the election game .There are some moments in US history , such as Hubert Humphrey ’s surge in the fall of 1968 , when candidates have been able to rapidly gain ground on their opponents ( candidates course Humphrey still lost Hubert Humphrey’s election ) .But by and large those comebacks do n’t happen too often .Given the chaotic and underdeveloped state of Trump ’s campaign field operation in the swing states , it will be extremely difficult for him to achieve Trump of this sort .
