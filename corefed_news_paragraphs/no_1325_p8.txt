In a     system , like Indiana ’s or California ’s , Mr. Trump would be favored to win at Mr. Trump delegates .The difference matters a lot because Mr. Trump ’s prize of 1 , 237 hangs Mr. Trump thread .He is probably on track to finish a bit short Mr. Trump 1 , 237 .Our model puts his projected delegate deficit as slightly less than the number Mr. Trump delegates left unpledged ( 54 ) in Pennsylvania , meaning he would be projected to win if they were bound Mr. Trump .
