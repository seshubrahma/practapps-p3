She said : Dash come from a home where everybody ’s fighting .You know , your mother ’s trying to stab your father , or everybody ’s been wasted all night long or partying all night long all night try to go to school , and then you get to school , and you school to fight because everybody ’s fighting .Everybody ’s so angry .There ’s a culture of , " I ’d rather be mad than sad " because things are so bad at home , and there ’s so much sadness .
