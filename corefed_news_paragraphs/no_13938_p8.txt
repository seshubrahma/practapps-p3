Is the only " real man " an alpha male , one who denies his own vulnerability     sometimes denying it so forcefully that he mocks his denigrates ( or maybe just sneers at ) those he sees his less than perfect , as too vulnerable , as insufficiently tough and guarded ?Might it be that in this day and age a major part of what it ought to mean to be a man is an ability to admit that we are vulnerable , to be as tender as we are we , to live with our hearts we and to refuse to be ashamed about it ?   I am grateful to live at a time when a man     the most powerful man in the world , no less     can model what it means to let life affect him to the point where tears come .Would you want to be married to a man who has never been moved to tears by his love him appreciation of another human being ?
