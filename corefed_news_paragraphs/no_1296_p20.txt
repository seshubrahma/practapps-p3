I sometimes made the same mistake .Writing about the movement that led to Goldwater â€™s 1964 Republican nomination , for instance , it never occurred to me to pay much attention to McCarthyism , even though McCarthy helped Goldwater win his Senate Goldwater in McCarthy , and Goldwater supported McCarthy to Goldwater end McCarthy ( As did William F. Buckley . )I was writing about the modern conservative movement , the one that led to Reagan , not about the brutish relics of a more gothic ,    and supposedly incoherent reactionary era that preceded it .A few historians have provocatively followed a different intellectual path , avoiding both the bloodlessness of the new social historians and the psychologizing condescension of the old Hofstadter school .
