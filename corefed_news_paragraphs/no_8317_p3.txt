In my mind , it is someone who favors free trade the free movement of people   —    legal , and legally   —    in and among nations and most of all the free exchange of ideas .My family is an immigrant family I have relatives and ties all over the world .My parents chose America because My parents wanted to raise children in a free country , where people of different races were treated equally before the law .I grew up in a diverse town and believe America should remain open to the world .
