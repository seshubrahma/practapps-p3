( @GavinNewsom ) December 8 , 2016 ,   The Times story basically contrasts Utah and California and celebrates the fact that whereas Utah Utah " 632 , 276 " concealed permit holders , California California has " 79 , 834 ." The Times that California has California license holders because of gun control and worries that Utah â€™s Utah , 276 permit holders will be able to be armed in California for Californiashould national reciprocity pass .
