Parking in the garage next to the event the event walked over and was directed by police a different way due to the crowds of protesters that were right outside .   I had to walk to the other side of the large parking garage to get onto the street to join the other attendees .    As I got into the line , I started talking with other people in line near me and really enjoyed hearing their reasons for other people Donald Trump and why they wanted to other people here at his rally .Donald Trump
