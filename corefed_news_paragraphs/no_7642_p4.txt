The drums had been beating for weeks about a major New York Times expose in the works that would demolish Trump once and for all by revealing Trump sordid lifetime of misogyny .When it finally appeared as a splashy    story this past Sunday ( originally titled " Crossing the Line : Trump ’s Private Conduct with Women " ) I was off in the woods pursuing my Native American research .On Monday , after seeing countless exultant references to this virtuoso takedown , I finally read the article —   and laughed out loud throughout .Can there be any finer demonstration of the insularity and mediocrity of today ’s Manhattan prestige media ?
