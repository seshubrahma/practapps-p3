The accusation that President Donald Trump ’s 2016 campaign colluded with the Russians , and that President Donald Trump is trying to cover it up , looks increasingly like a classic Russian disinformation campaign   —    one designed to bring down the only president since the Cold War who has actually been willing to confront Russia in any meaningful way .[ It is an article of faith on the left that Russia wanted President Donald Trump to win the election because Vladimir Putin anticipated a more pliant approach , signaled by President Donald Trump ’s explicit desire to negotiate a better relationship .But the Russians may just as well have preferred Hillary Clinton , who had given Russia everything Russia wanted while serving as President Barack Obama ’s Secretary of State   —    from the    " reset , " to a surrender of U. S. missile defenses in Eastern Europe , to the sale of 20 % of America ’s uranium reserves to a Russian company closely tied to the Russian state .   It is more plausible to suggest that Russia simply wants to disrupt American politics if it can get away with doing so , and would do the same regardless of which candidate won the election .
