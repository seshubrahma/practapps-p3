There are echoes of that Islamic supremacism in the public statements of the Council on    Relations ( CAIR ) whom Bell interviews jovially on CNN .After the San Bernardino terror attack in December 2015 , CAIR not only ensured an Islamic burial for the terrorists and represented their the terrorists in court , but blamed the murder of 14 Americans and the wounding of 22 more at a Christmas party on U. S. foreign policy .( CAIR CAIR been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates , and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted    in a Hamas    operation   â€”    none of which Bell mentions . )
