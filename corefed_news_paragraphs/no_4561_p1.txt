I would like to thank Congress and the Congressional Institute for the invitation to be here today .The opportunity to visit the United States is always special .And to be invited to be the first serving Head of Government to address this important conference is an honour indeed .I defy any person to travel to this the United States any time and not to be inspired by its promise and the United States example .
