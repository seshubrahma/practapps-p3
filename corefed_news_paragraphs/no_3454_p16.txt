Paul Blumenthal ( @PaulBlu )March 24 , 2017 , Congress There are ongoing discussions in House offices    whether Republicans should use the same tactic that conservatives used in 2015 to remove    Speaker John Boehner from the House .Back then , Meadows —   then just a member of the House Freedom Caucus —   House is called a resolution with a motion to vacate the chair .He did so just before August recess , allowing it to gain public support .
