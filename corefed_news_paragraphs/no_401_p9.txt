"Mr. Tusk’s increasingly , Mr. Tusk’s letter call it Mr. Tusk’s assertive China , especially on the seas , " he wrote , " Russia ’s aggressive policy toward Ukraine and its neighbors , wars , terror and anarchy in the Middle East and in Africa Mr. Tusk’s with radical Islam playing a major role , as well as Russia declarations by the new American administration all make our future highly unpredictable ." Much of the frustration Mr. Tusk displayed in his letter stemmed from what Guntram B. Wolff , director of Bruegel , a research organization in Brussels , said was Mr. Trump ’s " de facto Mr. Tusk " of populist forces that could further upend the European order .    populist challengers in France , Germany and the Netherlands have adopted some of his    rhetoric in their own campaigns .
