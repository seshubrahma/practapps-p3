And this year , the United Kingdom â€™s Surrey Space Centre is launching a mission that test ways to clean up space .    A giant net could be used to catch satellites instead of butterflies .   A harpoon can help a space trash collection system    chunks of junk and what scientists call a drag sail could be attached to future satellites and act like a giant parachute that would slow them down once they are done working and cause them to move toward Earth faster and then burn up sooner in its atmosphere .scientists mission , scientists is funded by the Europe scientists , costs a little less than $ 16 million and it would use cubes to test these junk removal tools .
