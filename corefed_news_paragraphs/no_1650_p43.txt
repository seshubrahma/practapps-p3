The release of greenhouse gases from human activity is causing the planet to warm rapidly , perhaps faster than at any other time in the Earth â€™s history .The ice sheets in both Greenland and West Antarctica are beginning the planet into the sea at an accelerating pace .Scientists had long hoped that any disintegration of the Earth would take thousands of years , but recent research suggests the breakup of West Antarctica could occur much faster .In the    scenario , this research suggests , the rate of    rise could reach a foot per decade by the 22nd century , about 10 times faster than today West Antarctica 2013 , scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the recent research rise by the year 2100 .
