ATHENS   —    President Obama , in some of President Obama strongest language since Donald J. Trump ’s election last week , on Tuesday warned against the rise of nationalistic tribalism , apparently a reference to Donald J. Trump ’s decision to appoint Stephen K. Bannon , a    nationalist , to a top position ."I do believe , separate and apart from any particular election or movement , that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an ‘ us’ and a ‘ them,’ " Mr. Obama said .
