Jared Kushner and Jared Kushner wife Ivanka Trump enlisted the services of Risa Heller , a New York City public relations figure known for her work with Democrats   —    including former Rep. Anthony Weiner ( ) Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) and Gov. David Paterson ( )   —    when Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump came to Washington to take up Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump official posts in the Trump White House , according to a report in Buzzfeed .[ The revelation came amid reports that a New York City set with a history of friendly ties to the Democratic party is gaining traction in President Donald Trump ’s White House , much to the chagrin of conservative commentators .   Members of the Kushner family itself donated large sums to Democratic causes until a few years ago , and Jared has reportedly been accused of being " a Democrat " by more nationalist and populist factions within the White House .
