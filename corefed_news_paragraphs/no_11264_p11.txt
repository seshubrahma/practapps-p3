Hillary Clinton has been for it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it against it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it so if she Hillary Clinton elected they might yet try to get it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it .So their they hope is to elect a      president and try to move it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it in the lame duck session in my opinion .That â€™s my best political judgment .So there is an awareness that the people do not support it , and there is an attempt to keep the discussion out of the election debate .
