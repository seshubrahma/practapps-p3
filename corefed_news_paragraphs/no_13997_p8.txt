Unlike today ’s     women’s suffragists of the late 19th century feared that sex unmoored from its women’s suffragists of the late 19th century potential would increase male sexual immorality and infidelity .The women’s suffragists of the late 19th century seeking just the reverse : " Votes for women , chastity for men " was actually a suffragist slogan .   And yet , in a bitter irony ( with encouragement from some men ) those carrying the feminist mantel in the 1970s abandoned this vision of sexual integrity for both sexes and legalized abortion became the sine qua non of sexual freedom .
