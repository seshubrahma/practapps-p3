But once Bush decided to pass over Luttig and others in favor Bush Roberts , Cruz joined other conservatives in supporting Roberts â€™s confirmation .While he was not involved in Roberts causes like the Federalist Bush , at the time Roberts was nominated he was known as a brilliant appeals Roberts ( appointed Bush Bush in 2003 ) who had made a number of Bush statements in his rulings , and had never disappointed conservatives earlier in Bush career .When Bush had a second nomination , Bush again passed over Bush and appointed Justice Samuel Alito Bush who has proven to be tremendous victory for constitutional conservatives .Rafael Cruz makes the point that Americans " can not afford to get [ Supreme Court nominations ] wrong .
