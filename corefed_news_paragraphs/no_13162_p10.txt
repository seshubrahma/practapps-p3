Half a loaf from Trump is better than a handful of stale crumbs from Hillary Clinton and President Donald Trump National Council of La Raza .Why am I so accommodating to a less " " immigration platform ?The answer is as simple as it is obvious : After eight years of Obama â€™s government by executive decree , not only in immigration but across a broad spectrum of government programs , our Constitution is in tatters .If we invite four more years of this lawlessness with a Supreme Court clearing the way for every new insult to American sovereignty and the rule of law , there will be no possibility of returning to the constitutional government we inherited from ten generations of patriots .
