I believe not being openly confrontational with law enforcement made my experience with them better .On the other night , I saw a number of other people who had been taken into custody law enforcement with the police in a way that was confrontational and rude .I got to see what law enforcement has to deal with on a daily basis .While some of the protesters who had been arrested were acting disrespectfully , most were not .
