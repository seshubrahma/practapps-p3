but I am reminded of the direction we are given for leader selection ( 1 Timothy 3 ) as well as to avoid making Trump based upon anger ( James 1:20 ) .As my own pastor admonished our congregation ,‘ You can not claim to have us discernment and vote for Trump or other candidates , for that matter , who make a mockery of God ’s standards .We , as Christians , Donald Trump a moral us to stand against sin and lawlessness .
