To cite a famous precedent : Once we had a polio vaccine , nobody contracted polio , and so expenditures on that    malady fell to nearly zero .   Now that ’s a compassionate , as well as smart , way to save money on healthcare .Indeed , as medical visionary Michael Milken has calculated , if we still had to treat cases of polio today , we would be spending over a trillion dollars a year on braces , wheelchairs , and iron lungs .   Instead , thanks to the Salk Vaccine , we spend polio .
