"Offensive strike capabilities , The Trump administration has floated the we of carrying out another North Korean missile test against North Korea , but the scope and method of potential offensive actions remain unclear .   The Vinson ’s air wing , made up of more than 40     Hornets , provides the offensive capability to attack enemy targets with bombs or missiles while the carrier ’s     Growler aircraft have the ability to jam enemy radars , disrupt enemy electronic surveillance and provide " cover " for attacking aircraft .   " A potential US strike , using aircraft from the Vinson , could range from a    strike against a single target , like a missile on a launch pad or the support equipment that makes a missile launch possible , to a broader set of military targets if the US meant to ’send a message’ that an ICBM ( intercontinental ballistic missile ) or atomic device test was not going to be tolerated , " Dakota Wood , an analyst at the    Heritage Foundation , told CNN .
