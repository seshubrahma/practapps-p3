Details about how they will cover people with existing medical conditions have not yet emerged , but many lawmakers have started pushing an idea   —    known as    pools   —    that left many people uncovered or with strict limits to their coverage in the past .The many people uncovered for lawmakers is this : How do you get insurers to cover people who will definitely need costly medical care   —    and do so without making insurance too expensive for everyone ?The Affordable Care Act addresses that question by requiring everyone to get coverage or face a tax penalty .That mandate is meant to increase the number of healthy people who have insurance , distributing the costs of caring for those who are sick across a wider population .
