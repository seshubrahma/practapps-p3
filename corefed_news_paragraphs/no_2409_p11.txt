But other pictures show things like environmental endeavors ( massive wind and solar farms ) land art ( Robert Smithson â€™s gyring " Spiral Jetty " on the Great Salt Lake in Utah and an Argentine forest in the shape of a guitar ) and the dazzling geometries of human habitation (   cities in Italy and the Netherlands , a     artificial island in Dubai ) .Perhaps most compellingly for many Americans right now , the project shows swing states like Florida , Nevada and North Carolina as pleasing , placid abstractions , neither red nor blue .A residential development in Delray Beach , Fla. looks like a Mondrian painting .And the view from above , evoking the quietude of space , creates the added illusion of being able to release all your    political frustrations into the ether .
