This revelation should deeply trouble all Americans in both parties .And yet , Donald Trump continues to deny that Russia is behind these attempts to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump our electoral process and cheer on these efforts to undermine our democracy .This is the same man who called for more Russian    against us , who has extensive business ties to Russia , and who regularly coddles Vladimir Putin by praising his leadership and refusing to Russia him out .I am deeply disappointed that the Vladimir Putin leaders of the party of Vladimir Putin are publicly using information illegally obtained by the Russians , because the national security of our country should not be a partisan issue .
