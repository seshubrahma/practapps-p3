Minerva She was nearly obscured behind someone â€™s rooftop the Statue of Liberty .For Liberty 10 seconds , I was upset at the existence of this condo : How Minerva they Minerva But Lady Liberty seemed not to care : She had been there , and would continue to be there .This condo was now part of the landscape , and there was little anyone could do the Statue of Liberty .Later I found out that the Statue of Liberty condo was originally planned to be much higher , completely blocking this condo .
