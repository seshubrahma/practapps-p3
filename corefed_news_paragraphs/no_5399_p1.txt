Mark Meadows ( ) and House Tuesday Group    Rep. Tom MacArthur ( )since House Speaker Paul Ryan ’s unpopularity jeopardizes the Republican Party ’s chance at success .   " Mark Meadows and Tom MacArthur have gotten together and negotiated out a fix , a new bill , a series of compromises from both sides that likely could pass the House of Representatives , " Boyle said .
