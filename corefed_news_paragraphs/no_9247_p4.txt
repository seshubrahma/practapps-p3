The fate of a nation was riding that night .The most famous of the three   —    except to Rachel Maddow   —    was Paul Revere , who later wrote a detailed account of his momentous ride .Revere had instructed the sexton of a Boston church to climb to the top of the steeple   —    unobserved by the church ’s Loyalist minister   —    and signal the patriots of Charlestown with lanterns to indicate which route the British were taking :One if by land , and two if by sea .
