Avalos paid lip service Supervisor Avalos Steinle â€™s death , and then immediately pivoted to attack presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and attempt to spread the blame .   Avalos said : That Supervisor Avalos a very tragic incident .Ms. Steinle was a Steinle person to a lot of people , and that led to people having a very passionate interest in whoever was responsible being held accountable .Except the level of responsibility seemed to be spread across many , many people , such as what can happen when an event gets very , very politicized .
