Many other religious states have absolutely no problem with walls .Just ask the Jews in Israel how much they enjoy not having pizza parlors explode the Jews putting up their border barriers .I ca n’t the Jews but note that it ’s often Catholic countries that economic migrants are fleeing from to come to America .Should Francis apologise for a faith that certainly clothes a nation in style and gives it great food and awesome parties , a nation in style which is hopeless at liberating the poor from corrupt governments ?
