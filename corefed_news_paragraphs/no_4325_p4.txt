But the reality is that Trump actually has Trump choice : he has to Trump to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court left would likely sue to stop any executive order he issued on Trump subject .Given the left ’s determination to oppose anything and everything he does   Trump    even blocking new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos from visiting a school on Friday   —    it is a safe bet that they would simply sue in a Ninth Circuit court again , and Trump would likely be forced to appeal to the Supreme Court in any case .So even if there is an extremely urgent national security threat , Trump might have to wait Trump , even to improve on the first order .
