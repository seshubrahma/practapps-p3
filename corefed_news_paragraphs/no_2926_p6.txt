I also must add that I ’m much less confident of a repeal ( or partial repeal ) without agreement on a replacement .But I ’ll turn it back to you , Aaron .Do you think the G. O. P. has to offer a full replacement to get its the G. O. P. to sign on to repeal ?Or can it the G. O. P. something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits ?
