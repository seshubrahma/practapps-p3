Decadence , not Donald Trump , is defeating the Republican establishment in the primaries .[ The dominant wings of the national party —     as represented by Jeb Bush , John Kasich and several others , and the Tea Party , as represented by Ted Cruz —   are simply clueless to the economic and cultural forces transforming America .   Globalization and technology —   fair and unfair trade , legal and illegal immigration and automation and artificial intelligence are destroying jobs , lowering wages and rendering obsolete the skills of millions of prime working age Americans .Coupled with lower birth rates among whites and the absolute failure of educational institutions to keep up with the times , these are creating a poorer , more unequal and radically more ethnically and religiously diverse electorate .
