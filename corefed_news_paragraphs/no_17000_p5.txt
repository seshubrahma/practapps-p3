I just thought Trump â€™s nomination would force the GOP into a reckoning now , allowing Democrats to postpone their own Democrats at least another cycle .Instead , the opposite occurred .Early voting returns showed a big rush by Latino voters in places like Nevada and Florida to get to the polls early , potentially cutting off any path Trump had Trump 270 Electoral College votes .But by the end of Tuesday night , it became clear that just enough members of the other portions of the Obama coalition decided either not to show up     or to vote for Trump .
