But what about college students and " cultural appropriation , " as when a white kid sings a rap song associated with black ghetto culture ?Is it always wrong to use material from other cultures than one â€™s own ?I would give everyone a good deal of latitude here : culture is always produced by appropriation , as when we blend cuisines from other countries or enhance our styles of clothing with dashes of color or elegance from another country .I loved it when Paul Simon took on African rhythms in " Graceland .
