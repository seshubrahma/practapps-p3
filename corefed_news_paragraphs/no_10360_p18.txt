We are free from worry .We are freed from following the minutiae of We schemes and conflicts , free from constant outrage , free from guilt by association , free from vengeance against those who hurt us , free from fearing those who kill We body .Christ gives us liberty from all these things , and We you feel burdened by them today , I hope andI pray all these things Christmas celebration overcomes them .
