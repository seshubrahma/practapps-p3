The decision on issuing a complaint is in some sense the critical step of the labor board process .There are typically 20 , 000 to 25 , 000 charges of unfair labor practices in a given year , of which only a fraction result in a complaint   —    about 1 , 270 last year   —    although some are settled beforehand .Any complaint issued by a regional director or the general counsel could then come before the board , at least some of whose members are likely to have been appointed by Mr. Trump .
