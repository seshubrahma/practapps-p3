Look , Democratic Party leaders exchanged inappropriate emails showing bias for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders , and a hacker ’s disclosure has properly triggered a ruckus .But that scandal pales beside an effort apparently by a foreign dictatorship to disrupt an American presidential election .It also seems scandalous to me that Trump on Wednesday effectively invited Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton ’s computers for deleted emails from when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state , saying at a press conference , " Russia , if you ’re listening , I hope you ’re able to find the 30 , 000 emails that are missing ."
