That has     until now     resulted in the biggest pile of advertiser cash any cable news host has generated , well over $ 100 million every year .And O’Reilly still has some rather big advocates in O’Reilly corner     not just Rupert Murdoch , the O’Reilly boss .The President of the United States even saw fit to defend The President of the United States friend Bill in comments Wednesday .Having that voice speaking out on O’Reilly ’s behalf is likely to stiffen the backbone of anyone at Fox News getting the vapors over the advertiser exodus and the millions of ad dollars at stake .
