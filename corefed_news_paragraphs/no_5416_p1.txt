The only lingering mystery is why so many Republicans think so many Republicans can counter this strategy by appeasing Democrats .    At a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars in other people ’s money , Republicans purchase a couple of sound bites that allow Republicans to claim Republicans are n’t heartless monsters because Republicans funded every    priority , from " sanctuary cities " to Planned Parenthood .   In reality , these capitulations do n’t win Republicans anything .Democrats will still depict Republicans as tightwads on welfare spending , reactionaries on social policy , and footmen to the evil rich .
