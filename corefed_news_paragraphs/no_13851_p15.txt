Indeed , over the past year , I â€™ve been following a case in Idaho where a black , disabled teen was allegedly lured into the locker room by three white teammates from the football team .Court reports say he was grabbed and anally raped with a coat hanger .    The local prosecutor , however , declined to press hate crime or sex crime charges , instead accepting a guilty plea to a lesser felony of " injury to a child , " which will carry no jail time ."
