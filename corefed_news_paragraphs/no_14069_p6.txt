Aerial photos prove the lousy numbers and so do subway rides .The rides recorded for the Women ’s March in Washington were nearly three times that of Inauguration Day and the second highest in the Metro ’s history .Plus , the turnout was so big , there was no room to actually march .Same in Chicago , Boston and Los Angeles .
