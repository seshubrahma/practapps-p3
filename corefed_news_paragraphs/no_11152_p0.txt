Did you know that earlier this year , the Navy announced it was changing the Navy    rating system for sailors , because gendered titles like " yeoman " were supposedly sexist ?I could n’t   reach ISIS for comment , but I suspect they were giggling like schoolgirls at the priorities of America ’s Armed Forces .[ Luckily for us all , common sense and the fortitude of America ’s sailors has trumped social justice .The Navy is scrapping the plan .
