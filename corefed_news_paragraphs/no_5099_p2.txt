Last month , congressional Republicans took aim at the Endangered Species Act because the Endangered Species Act could prevent necessary projects from taking place   —    and also , possibly , because of longstanding grievances over the diversion of water from farms to the Delta smelt because of the Endangered Species Act .California Democrats are now pushing back with a state bill that would prevent federal changes from affecting the protection of endangered wildlife at the state level .The California Environmental , Public Health , and Workers Defense Act of 2017 , introduced in December by Democratic state Senators Kevin De León (   Angeles ) and Henry Stern (   Park ) would require the Golden State to implement environmental laws that are equal to or even more stringent than regulations set into law under federal environmental laws .According to the San Bernardino Sun , the bill , SB 54 , seeks to ensure that California maintains and strengthens protections for air , water and endangered species , including for worker safety laws .
