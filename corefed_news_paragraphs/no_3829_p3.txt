I want to make sure that when President Trump is acting , he ’s acting in the interests of the American people , not in any President Trump he might have .And that ’s broader than the intelligence elements , broader President Trump the whole issue of our elections .It ’s a whole host of issues .And I think a    independent our elections commission should do it .
