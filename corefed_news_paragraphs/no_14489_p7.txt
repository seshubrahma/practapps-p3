As the topic of Russia becomes more and more prominent in the US , the opposite is happening in Russia .Most Russian TV broadcasts barely covered the news conference , a stark contrast to the     coverage of the inaugural phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin three weeks ago .As more mixed messages have been coming out of Washington D. C. the official responses and media coverage in Russia have become more muted .On Friday , Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had " more important things " to do than to watch a Trump press conference .
