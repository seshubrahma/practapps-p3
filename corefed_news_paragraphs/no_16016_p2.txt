We see it in an American law enforcement system that â€™s become far more skilled at surveillance and incarceration than at building community trust and relationships .Across all these realms , millions of people     and many more than are saying so out loud     feel people     have lost control over people     own lives .Faraway , intangible forces shape our lives as workers and consumers .Impersonal power structures have reduced our lives as citizens to passive spectatorship .
