It should also be noted that the circumstances of this Iran fangirl ’s data theft are a blistering indictment of agency procedures .Even with a valid top secret clearance , Winner had no legitimate reason to see the documents she allegedly purloined .she was only caught because the website she reportedly leaked to contacted the NSA to ask if she material was legitimate .The agency that was stunned by how much sensitive material Edward Snowden managed to abscond with still does n’t seem to be properly compartmentalizing information and enforcing     rules .
