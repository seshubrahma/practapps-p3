From Steven Shepard writing at Politico :   A raft of new polls out this week carried almost unanimously good news for Hillary Clinton , staking the Democratic presidential nominee to significant leads over Donald Trump .But there ’s one potential warning sign in these polls should the race narrow :Hillary Clinton ’s lead over Donald Trump shrinks when voters are allowed to choose one of the major    candidates in the race .Yet the Libertarian Party ’s presidential ticket   —    composed of former GOP Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former GOP GOP Bill Weld of Massachusetts   —    appears to draw more from voters who might otherwise be aligned with Clinton , especially younger voters .
