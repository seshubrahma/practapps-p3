To give themselves a cushion in retaking the Senate , Democrats would probably need to win six of these 11 races : the seven elections with    Republicans the elections in Indiana , Arizona and North Carolina and the contest for Mr. Reid â€™s seat in Nevada .If Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency and they win five seats , they will most likely control Democrats chamber because the vice Democrats has the tiebreaking vote in the Senate .With so many seats remaining uncertain , the race could still tip in either direction , with Republicans possibly retaining a slim majority or Democrats running the table .
