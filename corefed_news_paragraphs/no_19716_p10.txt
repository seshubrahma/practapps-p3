For now , imagining space policy under a Trump administration is akin to reading tea leaves .The same goes for future funding for NASA , which could be sapped to help pay for completely unrelated programs , like large tax cuts or expensive infrastructure repairs .A new NASA administrator wo n’t be named NASA and , barring any foreshadowing tweets , Trump could wait , as Obama did , a Trump administration his second year in office before formally announcing a Trump administration    agenda .But Trump ’s space a Trump administration has already NASA a Trump administration , and there ’s plenty to divine .
