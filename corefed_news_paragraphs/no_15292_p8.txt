Despite how it seems , platforms do n’t have a stake in who is standing on them .Just watch Olympic diving some time to see that everybody does n’t dive off the platform and get a perfect score .Just because you put someone on TV , you are n’t necessarily cosigning everything ( or anything ) they do .It is about how you frame it     and in this case , the frame around Richard Spencer is beautiful .
