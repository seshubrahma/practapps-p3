Michael voted against Obama eight years Obama , but Obama to support his    reform efforts : In Obama , Hillary Clinton â€™s bruising primaries against President Obama misled me to John ObamaAlso , I genuinely wanted to see a Vietnam War veteran win the presidency , after John Kerry had his presidency by the Bush John McCain 2004 .My profound ignorance of Sarah Palin did not help .For the first and only time in my life , I backed a Republican candidate for president .
