the conversation turns to this horrific scene kind of reminds me of the Democrat convention during the Vietnam War when people were out protesting .Chicago has a history of that kind of thing .You know , look , Donald Trump has used tactics that have raised an army of very ardent fans for sure , but Donald Trump has locked in a lot of people who just do n’t like Donald Trump .And I ’m not saying the people protesting there in Chicago are Republican voters by any means , but there is a growing coalition of    Tea Party Ted    people and establishment folks that are rallying behind the candidacy of Ted Cruz to unify our party before the national convention so that our can have a positive message .
