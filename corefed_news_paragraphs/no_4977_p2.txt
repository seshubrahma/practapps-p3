True , there will be no wall .But the Democrats graciously agreed to allow the administration to fix broken parts of any existing fences on up to 40 miles of our 3 , 000 mile border .The other big wins , according to Mulvaney Mick Mulvaney are : 1 ) more defense spending , which is fantastic news , because I was worried Boeing and Lockheed Martin CEOs were falling behind Mark Zuckerberg with their Lockheed Martin CEOs salaries and , 2 ) school choice , an obsession of Washington wonks that is hated out in America , where parents move to    towns for the express purpose of avoiding schools full of disaffected urban youth , and the disaffected urban youth do nâ€™t want to spend two hours on a bus every day .But Mulvaney assures us that this monstrosity of a spending bill has set things up beautifully for the next budget negotiation in October .
