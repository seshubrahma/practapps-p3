We met twice in his Mr Trump office to discuss broad questions to do with national security , and I wrote him Mr Trump selection of policy papers ( the details of which fall under an NDA .Sorry ! ) .Now he Mr Trump the official presidential candidate of the GOP , much to the surprise of many a RINO and the chagrin of a certain Texan senator who refused to endorse him Texan after pledging to endorse whoever became the GOP candidate ) .Mr. Trump has successfully outwitted all the bookies and establishment grandees by speaking plainly and riding the wave of serial controversies that do far greater damage to his Mr. Trump than his Mr. Trump standing among the voters .
