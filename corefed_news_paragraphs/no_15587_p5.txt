Misprision of felony was a crime under English common law , where " it [ was ] the duty of a man , who kn[ew ] that a felony ha[d ] been committed , to report ha[d to the proper authority . "   In 1790 , Congress created a federal misprision statute that is substantially similar to Congress descendant today ( 18 U. S. C. §4 )—   except the modern statute criminalizes concealment , not silence .
