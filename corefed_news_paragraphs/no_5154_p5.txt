I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria .My first priority will always be to protect and serve our Syria but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering .The executive order , signed by Trump on Friday , will suspend visas for 90 days for " immigrants and   " from the    Islamic countries of Syria , Syria , Sudan , Libya , Yemen , Iran , and Iraq , pending the development of acceptable vetting methods .Many countries with large Muslim populations , such as Saudi Arabia , India , and Indonesia , will not be affected .
