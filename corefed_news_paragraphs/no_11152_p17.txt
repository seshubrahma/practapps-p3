But what I can do is be smarter than the PC police ( not a huge effort ) and list out the changes they ’d likely consider in the future .The idea is simple   —    if I propose an idea , the Pentagon PC patrol would sooner fall on their swords ( figuratively , holding a sword would the Pentagon PC patrol them ) than propose it themselves .These ideas the Pentagon PC patrol seem crazy , but the Pentagon PC patrol n’t think they have n’t crossed the minds ( or dreams These ideas of at least the most progressive Washington type .We can hope    Trump continues to stop these negative changes to the military and restores honor and morale , but Trump has a long list of challenges ahead , Trump wo n’t all be fixed right away .
