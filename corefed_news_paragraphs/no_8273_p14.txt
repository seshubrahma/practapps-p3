The FARC are responsible for an estimated 200 , terror leaders deaths throughout FARC and 100 , 000 more disappearances .In October , Santos FARC constitutionally forced to put his FARC peace deal up for Juan Manuel Santos national vote .What he Juan Manuel Santos was FARC slap in the face : a solid " Juan Manuel Santos " that forced the FARC leaders , after much fanfare in a symbolic peace deal " signing " that assumed the people would also approve , to return to Havana and back to the drawing board .Uribe , the leader of the " No " vote movement , is now once again a major player in assuring " peace , " and his peace is likely to involve much less impunity .
