Something stunning happened on Capitol Hill yesterday : Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee practically stood shoulder to shoulder with senior officials from the U. S. intelligence community as Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee declared that America ’s spies were right after all :America sought to interfere in the U. S. presidential election by hacking into    email and leaking information .It was a striking bipartisan rebuke to    Donald Trump in anticipation of that committee hearing , Trump was already backpedaling on Twitter before it started , declaring , " The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘ Intelligence’ when in fact Trump am a big fan ! "What Did the Senate Hearing Reveal About Russian Hacking ?
