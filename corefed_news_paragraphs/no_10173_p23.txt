a lower inflow of foreign workers helps explain why House Speaker Paul Ryan this week dropped the House plan to expand the        program from 66 , 000 visas per year up to 264 , 000 visas per year .The    program is used by many companies that operates restaurants .Under the       program , the federal government annually imports at least one million legal immigrants , plus almost one million temporary    guest workers and    guest workers for jobs sought by Americans .Those two million new foreign workers   —    plus the roughly eight million illegal immigrants in jobs   —    compete against the four million young Americans who begin looking for jobs each year .
