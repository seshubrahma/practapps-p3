The debate made me an advocate Monday nightâ€™s debate watched someone who is presidential .I watched someone who is decisive , clear , poised and brilliant .I saw , for the first time , the candidate that most of my former bosses adore so much they have spent the last several months my former bosses the campaign trail as surrogates .I saw Hillary Clinton present and deliver the very best version of herself to the American people .
