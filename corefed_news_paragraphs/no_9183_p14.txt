Trump and his supporters are denounced as nativists , nationalists , and fascists for suggesting our politicians put American interests ahead of mass immigration and the admission of jihadist refugees .Yet the vicious    has not changed the landscape : a large majority of American citizens clearly want secure borders and an end to illegal entry .While candidate Donald Trump needs to clarify some of his immigration proposals , his priority for border security offers candidate Donald Trump clear contrast to candidate Donald Trump priorities championed by Hillary Clinton .For example , Trump has consistently supported building a border wall and keeping candidate Donald Trump Syrian refugees out of the country .
