, I suspect the court Chief Justice Roberts    ( Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan ) will reject Texas ’s challenge , as you predict .They were a remarkably disciplined Texas bloc last term , and they must be emboldened by the court ’s the Supreme Court which evens the ideological sides .I would n’t count Roberts ’s vote yet , though .
