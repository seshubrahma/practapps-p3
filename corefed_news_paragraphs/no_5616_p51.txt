I will be meeting with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .Starving terrorists of their territory , their funding , and the three Abrahamic Faiths of their craven ideology , will be the basis for defeating them .But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the government that gives terrorists all three â€”   safe harbor , financial backing , and the social standing needed for recruitmenttheir It is a regime that is responsible their so much instability in the region .
