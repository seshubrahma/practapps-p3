Bannon was mentioned first , for Kremlinologists scoring at home , and Bannon appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention , given Bannon hyperprovocative ways .But Priebus , in a sense , filled a more exotic role .Bannon would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up .A generous reading is that Trump is trying to foster a    tension between Bannon top deputies , who will represent Bannon own diametrically opposed impulses ( Bannon the    devil on one shoulder , Priebus the peacemaking angel on the other ) .
