However , I am severely offended by the continual comparison of a sexual preference , a gender preference , to the plight of an enslaved , raped , lynched , brutalized , oppressed people .Dare anyone compare choice of bathroom to the plight of blacks for the past 400 years ?Is n’t that a bit ridiculous ?First of all , it ’s insulting to every black person in America .
