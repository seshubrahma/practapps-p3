"Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , a towering political figure among today â€™s liberal Democrats , brought Mrs. Clinton energy , folksy appeal and populist roar to a candidate not known for energizing crowds .For Ms. Warren , the joint event with Mrs. Clinton here on Monday , the first time the two Democrats campaigned onstage together , was a moment for Mrs. Clinton to elevate Mrs. Clinton profile as the liberal voice of the party and a favorite to be vice president .For Mrs. Clinton , it was a chance to woo the the party wing and convince economically    voters that she Mrs. Clinton too , is a populist champion running for president to improve their lives .
