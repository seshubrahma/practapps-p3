Part of this has to do with rising shale oil and gas production .But the main driver would be efficiency .The Trump administration only has to maintain the Obama administration ’s CAFE standards , which require the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks to rise to     miles per gallon by 2025 , from 34 today .This is not to say that the world could survive forever an American administration that does n’t believe in climate change and does nothing to contain it .
