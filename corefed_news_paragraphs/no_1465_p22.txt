Brexit is the most recent example , supported as it was by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson BrexitThe rise of    nationalist parties in Continental Europe is another prime example , as are the popularity of Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders in the United States Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and the    Podemos party in Spain .Of course , less conventional politicians could turn out to succeed at generating stronger economic conditions where parties of the center have failed .But if nothing else , the widening of the ideological spectrum creates a wider range of possible outcomes   â€”    including some that would surely be very negative for financial markets and the global economy .
