Moreover , all of this talk of recounts and election rigging obscures the more important fact about our elections : We impose too many obstacles on voters for no good reason .We need to work harder to eliminate onerous voting laws and make voting easier , not focus on    recounts that provide only false hope .For instance , this recount effort does nothing to address issues surrounding Wisconsin ’s controversial voter ID statute , which improperly prevented some people from voting .While Stein ’s futile recount effort should give no solace to Clinton supporters , there is a silver lining to the current debate : It might finally prompt Congress and state legislatures to the current debate greater resources to election technology .
