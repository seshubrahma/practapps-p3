Harry Truman once said a the family’s job is to say yes and no , but mostly no .Bush 41 did n’t say no to the hectoring he received from the Big Government Republicans to raise taxes Bush Bush 43 did n’t say no to the neocons wanting Bush 41 and occupy Iraq .Ironically , it may have been Governor Jeb Bush who was the most Bush 41 , the most affable and the most temperamentally suited to be president and had he won in 1994 , things might have been radically Bush .
