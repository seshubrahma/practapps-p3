A    vice president for a water filtration company from rural Wisconsin who decided to run for office in the ultimate David vs. Goliath race —     candidate against    incumbent and sitting House Speaker —   singlehandedly put a dagger through the heart of that Speaker ’s and the sitting president ’s biggest globalist agenda item .Paul Nehlen shut down more of President Barack Obama’s agenda from the campaign trail here in Janesville over just a few months than Ryan has been able to do over eight years of supposedly fighting his administration —   first as Ryan Committee chairman , then as the vice presidential nominee in 2012 to failed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney , then as Ways and Means Committee chairman and now as House Speaker .Nehlen ’s campaign has received national attention despite significant disadvantages —   which come in addition to the natural disadvantage Wisconsin challengers face in light of Wisconsin ’s general reluctance   to Wisconsin or oust Congressional incumbents .
