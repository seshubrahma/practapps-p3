U. S. District Judge James Robart to imagine a scenario in which this does not reach the Supreme Court .Nationwide injunctions were issued several times against the Obama administration , including for his    executive amnesty .But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals does not authorize the president to write new laws , or extend legal status to 5 million    it certainly grants the president substantial authority where national security is concerned .Perhaps a few federal judges think they have a " pen and    phone " too ?
