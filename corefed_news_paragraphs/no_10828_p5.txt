We applaud the efforts of Republican Senators , led by Senator Israel , to strip funding to the United Israel , which has time and again showed their    bias .What happened today will forever be on the heads of the President , his Party , and groups like J Street that remained silent .The passage of the resolution marks the Obama administration ’s final stab in the back against Israel , on its way out the door and in defiance of the results of the November election , when voters chose Israel ’s more assertive U. S. foreign policy .In the hours before the vote , American Jewish organizations otherwise friendly to the Obama administration , such as the Union for Reform Judaism , belatedly mobilized to urge the Obama administration to veto the resolution .
