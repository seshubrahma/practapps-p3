A patient with cancer might , for example , still be allowed to buy a plan , but it would nâ€™t do a plan much good if A patient with cancer plan   was a plan cover chemotherapy drugs .The second    would make the insurance options for those with    conditions even more meaningless .    , the deal would still prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with a history of illness .But without community rating , health plans would be free to charge those patients as much as they wanted .If both of those patients Obamacare provisions went away , the hypothetical cancer patient might be able to buy only a plan , without chemotherapy coverage , that costs many times more than a similar plan costs a healthy customer .
