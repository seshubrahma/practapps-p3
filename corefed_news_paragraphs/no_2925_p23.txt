In Wyoming influence who gets Wyoming , through    minimums ( no state California receive below a certain share of education funding ) and through formulas that privilege rural states ( early road spending was doled out in part by land area and not road use ) .There are policy reasons that the country might want to disproportionately spend resources on places with few people .Repairing an interstate highway in rural Oklahoma keeps national commerce flowing .And when the private market wo n’t build essential infrastructure , public investments like the New Deal ’s rural electrification help fight poverty .
