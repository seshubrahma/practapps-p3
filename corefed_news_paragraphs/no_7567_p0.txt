Columnist Charles Krauthammer said GOP presidential candidates Ohio Governor John Kasich , former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were the winners of Saturday ’s GOP presidential debate , while Florida Senator Marco Rubio was " really hurt " by Florida Senator Marco Rubio exchange with Christie in a way that will impact the results of New Hampshire ’s primary significantly and   " put something of a brake on Florida Senator Marco Rubio momentum " during the Fox News Channel ’s coverage of the debate .   Krauthammer said there was " not a lot of ambiguity " in the debate results , " The winners were the three governors for sure , the ones with most , way behind , who had to gain , particularly I thought Kasich , Kasich made Kasich case as perfectly pitched for New Hampshire , of the guy who can appeal to independents , to reach across the aisle , who ’s a moderate , a bit like the Obama appeal of 2008 .I thought Kasich was the most effective .Bush had Bush best night , had a good night presenting his case , but also he nailed Bush on the eminent domain , Kasich took Kasich on , number one , and second , I think that Kasich really landed a blow .
