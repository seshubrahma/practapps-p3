For Hillary Clinton , Britain ’s emotionally charged uprising against the European Union is the sort of populist victory over establishment politics that Hillary Clinton fears in the coming presidential election .Hillary Clinton shares more with the defeated " Remain " campaign than a similar slogan   —    her Hillary Clinton Stronger Together " echoing its " Stronger In ."Her Hillary Clinton argument , much akin to Prime Minister David Cameron ’s against British withdrawal from the European Union , is that Americans should value stability and incremental change over the risks entailed in radical change and the possibility of chaos if Donald J. Trump wins the presidency .
