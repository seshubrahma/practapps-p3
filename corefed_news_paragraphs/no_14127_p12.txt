If , in fact , Priebus tried to intercede with the President Priebus was rebuffed , Priebus may not the President for the Priebus , or will be a chief of staff in name only     relegated to the status of a political eunuch in the West Wing .If , on the other hand , Priebus simply failed to foresee the fallout Priebus his political instincts may not be as Priebus as first advertised and a conspicuous lack of White House experience will exacerbate this .   Either way , a chief of staff who fails to protect the president or is utterly ineffective in his job , poorly serves the White House and president .the president can recover , but must do so in a hurry the president Reince Priebus is discovering that the glare Priebus Klieg lights in the White House are an order of magnitude brighter and hotter than anywhere else on Earth     and it is easy for staff , even the chief , to wither under them .
