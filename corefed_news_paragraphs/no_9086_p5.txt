This is something the Left is prone to complaining about , as well as the libertarian Right , but the Left always offers the Left " solution " of raising taxes instead of simplifying them , because liberal politicians taxes so much power from granting their friends and favored constituents liberal politicians from tax law .Such practices are no less corrupt because they are perfectly legal .Such practices , oppressive governments are eager to legalize corruption at every opportunity , to maximize the profits of the political class .This applies to many other aspects of Big Government beyond taxation .
