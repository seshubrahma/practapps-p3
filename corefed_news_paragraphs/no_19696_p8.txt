Dr. Strangelove , a story very much about surety failure .A crazed Air Force general sends his    wing to destroy their targets in A crazed Air Force general Soviet Union .Of course , only the President is supposed to be able to call for a nuclear strike , but an obscure contingency plan ( Wing Attack Plan R ) allows a lower level commander to issue the order in the event that the normal command and control has been disrupted .The Pentagon ca nâ€™t call back the wing because the    can no longer his   wing unless preceded by specific    code that only the general knows , part of a poorly    safety scheme to protect the airmen from false orders .
