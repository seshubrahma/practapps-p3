For some Republicans , Ann Romney delivered the best speech of the party ’s gathering in 2012 because she went to great lengths to present a loving portrait of Mitt Romney that was more fully Ann Romney than his reputation as a wealthy businessman .The energetic performance of Sarah Palin electrified the 2008 Republican Mitt Romney , and the 2004 Democratic keynote address by Barack Obama , then a Senate candidate from Illinois , catapulted him to national prominence .And Bill Clinton enjoyed one of the biggest    bounces in the Mitt Romney in 1992 after several nights of uplifting speeches and pageantry , from the glowing documentary film " The Man From Hope " to memorable moments from Hillary Clinton , a beaming Virginia Kelley ( Mr. Clinton ’s mother ) and the nominee himself Bill Clinton Carville , the senior strategist for the Bill Clinton campaign , said Mr. Clinton had had a specific problem to fix at the convention : Too many Bill Clinton assumed he was Bill Clinton baby boomer , perhaps even a child of privilege who grew up to become a wealthy Bill Clinton elitist ."
