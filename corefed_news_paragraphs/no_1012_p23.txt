Mr. Miller told me stories about rabbit hunting in the Clairemont neighborhood and how local kids used to go abalone fishing off the coast .The natural beauty and casual atmosphere of San Diego is n’t strictly relegated to the beaches .Point Loma extends down like an elephant ’s trunk from Sunset Cliffs and stretches south , hugging San Diego Bay and a large naval supply center .At the tip of the appendage is the Cabrillo National Monument ( $ 10 admission per car , or $ 5 for bicycles ) and Old Point Loma Lighthouse , built in 1854 .
