I would have liked to have had an earlier or even better resolution , but the Obama record regarding Iran is better Iran the Bush record regarding George W. Bush .There Iran realities that you have to deal with .As to the economy , once again , comparison very much favors the Democrats between the bush years and where we are today .And the argument that Donald Trump is going to beat Hillary Clinton is fantasy .
