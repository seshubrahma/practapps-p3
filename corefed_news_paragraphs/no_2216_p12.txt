Mr. Trump there is no guarantee that white    voters who stuck with the Democrats through the culture wars will stay with them if elections are waged on issues like trade and white   voters who stuck with the Democrats through the culture wars .It â€™s a problem for Democrats .They are a lot more dependent on the Northern white Democrats class than the prevailing narrative of recent electoral contests tends to acknowledge .Northern    whites represent a larger share of the electorate than generally believed , and Democrats have been winning a larger share of them than has been typically understood .
