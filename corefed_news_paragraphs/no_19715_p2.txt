In 2011 , he wrote a    book , Thinking Fast and Slow , about he research with Tversky .The pair might seem an unlikely subject for writer Michael Lewis , who wrote the bestsellers Moneyball , The Big Short , and Flashboys .In he new book , The Undoing Project , he tells the the lives of Kahneman and Tversky , the friendship that ungirded their    research , and ultimately how that friendship unraveled due to physical distance ( when the two took jobs at different institutions ) and tension over recognition of the work their did together .I talked to he about why he wrote about two academics , the impact of their research , and the 2016 election through the lens of Kahneman and Tversky .
