And you can look at that .I tell the story about her Hillary Clinton first lady of the United States , when the effort to get Hillary Hillary Clinton failed , and that was a tough , tough , bitter loss , but then it tested her as Hillary Clinton leader .And she worked Hillary Clinton with Democrats and Republicans to get health insurance for eight million    American children in the CHIP program .The measure of character in somebody in public life , I think , is whether they have a passion for somebody other than themselves and they they keep they that passion a passion for somebody other than themselves are they or losing .
