If you believe the internet , the founder of Snopes , David Mikkelson , has a longer rap sheet than Al Capone .He was supposedly arrested for committing fraud Al Capone corruption and running a pit bull ring .In the wake of a deal that Snopes and others made this month to start    for Facebook , new slurs and allegations poured forth .The underlying message of these spurious attacks is that the movement to    the internet is a    conspiracy whose real goal is to censor the right , and therefore must be resisted at all costs .
