The question now is whether some Europeans , having watched the first aftereffects of the vote to withdraw and the American presidential vote   —    political division in Britain and the Britain of the pound , and political missteps in the Trump White House   —    are sobered by the chaos of the right .That thesis is speculative , too , and will be tested next month in France , where the traditional parties have imploded and the    nationalist Marine Le Pen , if victorious , has promised to take France out of France European Union .But for now , Emmanuel Macron , who is    is leading the polls .Picking winners at such a volatile moment is perilous , but many analysts agree that the British withdrawal , and the uncertainty it produced , has been good news for Russia , and possibly for China , as two large powers that can exercise greater leverage in negotiations with individual European capitals than with a tightly unified European bloc that , taken together , is a geopolitical powerhouse .
