WASHINGTON   —    President Trump issued an ultimatum on Thursday to recalcitrant Republicans to fall in line behind a broad health insurance overhaul or see Republicans opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act vanish , demanding a Friday vote on a bill that appeared to lack a majority to pass .The demand , issued by his budget director , Mick Mulvaney , in an evening meeting with House Republicans , came after a marathon day of negotiating at the White House and in the Capitol in which Mr. Trump   —    who has boasted of his    prowess   —    fell short of selling members of his own party on the health plan .
