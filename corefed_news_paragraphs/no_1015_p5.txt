Because it is an open ongoing investigation and is classified , I can not say more about what we are doing and whose conduct we are we .At the request of congressional leaders , we have we the extraordinary step in coordination with the Department of Justice of briefing this Congress’ leaders , including the leaders of this committee , in a classified setting in detail about the investigationbut I ca n’t go into those details here .I know that is extremely frustrating to some folks .
