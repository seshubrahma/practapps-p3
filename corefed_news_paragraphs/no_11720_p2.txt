Over at Tablet magazine , an online publication devoted lately to the    analogy , the hitherto    Yair Rosenberg seemed to have trouble digesting Trump in a tallit , offering a short and corny listicle full of    ending with the wishful thought that "   Twitter " might be having just as hard a time accepting the idea of    Trump .The day before   Trump , Yair Rosenberg had published an article arguing that because     types would be gratified by a Trump win ,   Trump voting for Trump would be   Trump for " the mainstreaming of    and    bigotry into the American government and the country ’s political discourse ."Why that illogic applies to Trump , and   Trump to Hillary Clinton , given the many antisemites in the Black Lives Matter and " Palestine solidarity " movements who would be gratified by her victory , Hillary Clinton did not explain .
