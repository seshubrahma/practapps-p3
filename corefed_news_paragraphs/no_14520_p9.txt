It ’s wrong that I. Scott was called an Uncle Tom , but worse that Donald Trump policies have already begun causing great harm , including a de facto    travel ban that has been put on hold by the courts .I. Scott voted for Donald Trump , a man who said I. Scott wanted the discriminatory policy " stop and frisk " to be implemented nationwide , a man who spent years trying to undermine the legitimacy of the nation ’s first black president and a man who attacked a federal judge based on the judge ’s ethnicity .I. Scott called those comments racially toxic     then supported Trump anyway .I. Scott feelings may have been hurt by a bevy of unsavory characters on Twitter .
