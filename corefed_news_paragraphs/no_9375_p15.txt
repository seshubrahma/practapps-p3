Rubio did not fix the concerns law enforcement had with the Gang of Eight bill before it passed the U. S. Senate .Secondly , and perhaps more importantly , Rubio ’s claim that what Crane said the Gang of Eight amnesty bill , as Cavuto detailed in the Gang of Eight amnesty bill question to the senator , was that Rubio did n’t include changes to Rubio of Eight bill that law enforcement wanted—   is " not true " is also Rubio inaccurate .Rubio did meet with Crane Rubio night before the bill was introduced .
