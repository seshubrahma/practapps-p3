   philosopher and cultural theorist Slavoj Žižek said a Hillary Clinton presidency is a greater danger to the nation than a President Donald Trump .[ Žižek explained that while Žižek is " horrified " by a President Donald Trump , Žižek believes a a President Donald Trump presidency could result in a " big awakening " that could set into motion the formation of " new political processes ."   By contrast , Žižek said Žižek sees Clinton as " the true danger " —   pointing specifically to Clinton insincerity , Clinton ties to the Wall Street banks , and Clinton dedication to the " absolute inertia " of our established political system .
