we this mystery and uncertainty over the future of the school might be temporary .I personally believe it ’s just the   School of Moscow of time before the dust settles .Putin appears to have no interest in taking any hazardous steps before    Trump takes office , possibly waiting on a reversal of Obama ’s decision and thus easing    ties .   I really hope I am right , and that the school will continue to live on .
