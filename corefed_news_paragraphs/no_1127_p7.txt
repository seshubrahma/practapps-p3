With each grisly new assault   —    and the specter of Syria and the Islamic State looming beyond it   —    the voices of hatred and reaction in the United States and throughout Britain and Europe found not only sympathetic ears but also willing hands to pull levers in the voting booths .Throughout the upheaval and backlash , Nawaz has remained a constant presence in the media : on " Real Time With Bill Maher , " trying to draw a distinction between religion and political dogma in Nawaz book , " Islam and the Future of Tolerance " (   with the prominent " new atheist " Sam Harris ) insisting that Islamism does have something to do with Islam and that ISIS in fact possesses a plausible if terribly ungenerous interpretation of the Quran .But whatever role Nawaz enjoys as a public intellectual is inextricable from Nawaz personal celebrity as a former fundamentalist .Nawaz work is Nawaz story , and his story is his personal celebrity .
