Too soon since Hillary Clinton lost the election and Hillary White House to Trump     because , regardless of what Captain Trump might have had , 2016 was ultimately Captain Trump election for the Democrats to lose .I have no doubt that almost any other candidate could have beaten Trump .Bernie Sanders , Joe Biden , Captain Trump Baldwin , Big Bird .It turns out that the one candidate who could lose was Hillary .
