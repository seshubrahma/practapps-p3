I â€™ve suggested that Ted Cruz Ted Cruz his Vice President Ted Cruz" Lord said he Ted Cruz " Ted Cruz " at the argument Trump was too Donald Trump with Democrats like Hillary Clinton before he entered Republican Ted Cruz politics , because the same was once said of Reagan , before the conventional wisdom of the day    him as a Reagan extremist .    Referring to    YouTube audio clip from 1948 that has Reagan endorsing Harry Reagan for President and Hubert Humphrey for Senator from Minnesota , Lord noted that the " Harry Truman values " Reagan endorsed included Reagan health care ."
