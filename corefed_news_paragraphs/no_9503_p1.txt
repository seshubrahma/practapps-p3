Some of the most decent , warmhearted political thinkers in the world —   including friends of mine —   would say that we ought to weigh Clinton ’s policy views and foundation activities without regard to theories about Clinton motivations or personality .But is that really making the wisest use of available evidence , including evidence about Clinton psyche ?Is it so hard to believe that while we should never leap to the conclusion we enemies are jerks , our enemies might in fact turn out to be jerks ?Are n’t the best theories the ones that most efficiently explain all the available evidence , sometimes evidence drawn from psychology , as Jonathan Haidt well knows ?
