For anyone concerned about the Bill of Rights   —    free speech , religious liberty , the Second Amendment   —    the Court hangs the Supreme Court balance .I have spent my professional career fighting before the Court to defend the Supreme Court .We are only one justice away from losing our most basic rights , We the next president will appoint as many as four new justices .
