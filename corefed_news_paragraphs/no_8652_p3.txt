I did not foresee that Sanders Sanders last so long   —    I overestimated Clinton Hillary Clinton strength   —    but there was hardly a path to victory if he Sanders to make the only ironclad case for rejecting our    first female president .It is unfair , perhaps , to pick on Sanders   —    who , at least , began to talk about Clinton Clinton’s with 48 hours left before the California primary .
