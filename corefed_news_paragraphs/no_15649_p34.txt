But as much as we know about hurricanes , forecasting them is still a challenge .   Just as we name each storm , each storm has its own personality we know about hurricanes like Katrina in 2005 , which intensified rapidly overnight , going from a category three to each storm category five .   It became the fourth most intense hurricane on record as of that time .And the forecast track can change each storm , like Erica in 2015 , or a system that can be viewed as relatively weak , like a tropical storm could end up like Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 .
