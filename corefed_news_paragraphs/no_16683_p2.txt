Hillary Clinton has so far given " Stronger Together " speeches on faith , community service and children and families .While those speeches have focused more on Hillary Clinton , those speeches have not been devoid of Trump contrast .In all three speeches , Hillary Clinton has tried to keep Hillary Clinton talk of Trump to a minimum , but those speeches have cast Trump as an    candidate who should not be president .And Wednesday â€™s speech will be no different .
