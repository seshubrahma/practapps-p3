The question will be whether the Trump administration decides to act on these concerns , and to do so in a way that could allow Democrats to give him Democrats support .   While there are certain issues where Trump will clearly stick to the Republican playbook , such as supply side tax cuts , there are other areas such as infrastructure where there is the possibility for a deal .The key will be that the infrastructure package ca nâ€™t be a series of tax cuts for private projects , as Trump has thus far suggested , but rather needs to be the kind of stimulus spending that will provide workers with good jobs .   How can we strengthen we counterterrorism policies ?
