Oh , The interview with Donald J. Trump â€™s back on again .So here we are , in a boardroom at The New York Times , over a lunch of salmon and steak , sitting around a giant wooden table with the president elect , posing questions to a man who has mocked , maligned and threatened we for the past two years .What actually happened in that room , when Donald J. Trump sat down with the editors , reporters and columnists for The The New York Times Tuesday ?How did it feel ?
