ve been lucky to see many great sports moments in my life( Dave Wottle ’s 1972 Olympic    victory might still be number one ) including the Super Bowl two years ago .But , this is in the top three somewhere .The poise , the coaching , the team spirit and personal achievement that lets a comeback like this happen without really any one big sensational long td play ( although Edelman ’s catch   —    one of the greatest ever ) or unfair call in their favor , can not be touched in the     history of the SB .
