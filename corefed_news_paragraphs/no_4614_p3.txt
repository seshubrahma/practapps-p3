As with health care , the GOP in Congress is sharply divided on tax reform .For example , should corporate reform tax imports to make the package revenue neutral or accept a somewhat bigger federal deficit ?And , Mr. Trump are unlikely to get much help from Democrats to forge a bipartisan majority .Similarly , paying to improve roads and bridges with private money has some potential but many improvements will likely require unpopular new taxes and user fees .
