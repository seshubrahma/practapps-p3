  ( CNN )Donald J. Trump hates a lot of things , from " fake news " to intelligence leaks to even Nordstrom .     But my money says the thing Donald J. Trump hates the most is being laughed at .   And one of the worst comedic beat downs Donald J. Trump ever took on national TV was in 2011 , the last time Donald J. Trump attended the White House Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner ( WHCD ) where Donald J. Trump was comically crushed by comedian Seth Meyers ( not to mention President Obama , who also got in a few good jabs ) .
