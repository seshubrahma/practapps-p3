The decision was the second time in a week that the Texas Legislature Trump administration retreated from the Justice Department ’s stance in a major civil rights case .One week ago , the department   —    with the backing of Mr. Trump   —    withdrew a policy imposed by the Obama administration to give federal    protections to transgender students in schools .Mr. Sessions , who was battered by Democrats at his the Justice Department’s his opposition in the Senate to some voting and civil rights measures , pushed for the the Trump administration transgender issue over the objections of Betsy DeVos , the education secretary , officials said .The reversal in the Texas case was all the more striking because his came just three months after the Justice Department , under the Obama administration , filed a brief arguing on behalf of the very issue it backed away from Monday   —    that the Legislature intentionally sought to discriminate when it approved the law .
