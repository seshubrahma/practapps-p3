Sessions , Carney writes , has clashed with the Silicon Valley tycoons and " Wall Street titans who have bankrolled Booker Silicon Valley rise" —   most notably , on the issue of immigration , where Sessions has pushed for policies that prioritize the job and wage opportunities of working Americans over corporatists’ desire for cheap labor .In recent months , Cotton has seemed primed to take up Sessions’ mantle as the leader of this populist movement in the Senate .In particular , Cotton has become a vocal champion for American workers of all backgrounds against Cotton      policies lobbied for by corporate special interests and advanced by Washington politicians like Cory Booker , who represent the interests of the donor class .
