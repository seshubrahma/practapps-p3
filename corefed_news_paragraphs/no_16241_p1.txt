Trump on Thursday night .Its naked pandering to prejudice was worse than anything since Pat Buchanan ’s culture wars speech at the Republican convention the Republican National Convention .No other major party candidate of modern times has ever appealed so directly to America ’s dark side .And Trump ’s willingness Donald J. Trump repeatedly scapegoat minorities is a haunting echo of the worst demagoguery of the 1930s .
