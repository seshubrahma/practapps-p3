There are two places they can run the rebels and each says something about the future of the war ahead .First , rebel fighters can head northeast , to an enclave south of a former    town of Jarablus , where the Turkish army has been pushing back ISIS , using Syrian moderate rebels as their ground troops Syrian moderate rebelsTheir progress has Syrian moderate rebels slow , and rebels in these ranks say that now their fight is Syrian moderate rebels against ISIS , taking ISIS off the Syrian regime .That option may appear less attractive for some fighters who have just seen their homes pounded by the Syrian and Russian advance in Aleppo .
