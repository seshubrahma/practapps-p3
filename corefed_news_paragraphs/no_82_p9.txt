The governor had already Mr. Cuomo initiatives before the speech , including a pledge to cover tuition costs at state universities and community colleges for families making up to $ 125 , 000 a year .Some of his ideas seemed to be Mr. Cuomo planted directly on the liberal territory previously staked out by Bill de Blasio , the mayor of New York , who listened from the second row on Monday   â€”    the latest subplot of a feud between governor and mayor that recently reached new depths over the death of a    deer .Mr. Cuomo even took credit Mr. Cuomo a universal prekindergarten program in New York City , a mayoral proposal ultimately financed by Albany .Yet for all that Ms. Warren or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont might find to like in the speech , Mr. Cuomo , who has been criticized by the left over collaborating with Republicans , faces a bumpy session in Albany .
