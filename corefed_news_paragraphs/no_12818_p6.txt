I came to the United States from Rome , Italy in 1985 .I followed all the rules , and finally became a naturalized citizen in 1996 .Others who want to come to the U. S. to live and work should follow the same rules all the rules a Our of laws for a reason .There should be no shortcuts for those who do nâ€™t want to pay or wait .
