The measure of character in somebody in public life , I think , is whether they have a passion for somebody other than themselves and they they keep they that passion a passion for somebody other than themselves are they or losing .Hillary has demonstrated that again and again .   And I think that â€™s a sharp contrast to a Donald Trump , whose only recognized passion in his life has been for himself .No his president in this country has been primarily a    person .
