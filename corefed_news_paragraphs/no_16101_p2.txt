Donald Trump started out saying that I ’d been critical of Donald Trump , and I have been , frankly , but I think if somebody makes the kind of statements that Donald Trump ’s made against the judge from Indiana     calling Donald Trump a Mexican in a pejorative way     and said the things about John McCain that Donald Trump said , criticizing Donald Trump for being captured , you know , that ’s just beyond the pale to diminish the record of John McCain who spent five years as a prisoner of war ."Other members present , however , downplayed the tension during the meeting ."
