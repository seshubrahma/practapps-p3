There has not been rail service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas since Amtrak Las Vegas line in the late 1990s .A typical drive between the two cities takes at least four hours through the high desert in ideal conditions .But on a busy weekend , that    journey can easily take up to seven hours each way .A viable    rail can eliminate a lot of that congestion on the Interstate 15 , deliver millions of travelers within three hours each way , and boost the already booming tourism for Sin City .
