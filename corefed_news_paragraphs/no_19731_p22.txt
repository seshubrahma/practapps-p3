Exxon has gone so far as to back the Paris Agreement and its ambitious warming target .Even so Exxon regulatory caps on warming —   and strict ones at that —   may be the only path to meeting them .A recent study from Oil regulatory caps on warming —  and strict ones at that —   International estimates that nearly 70 percent of    coal , oil and natural gas reserves —   not counting the ones    firms are keen to start mining —   have to stay buried in perpetuity for a reasonable chance of limiting warming to 2 degrees celsius , the " guardrail " of acceptable warming that the international community agreed to in Paris .To do that , the historical record seems to favor regulatory action over price signals alone .
