At the American bicentennial , Gerald Ford said that " liberty is a flame to be fed , not ashes to be revered ." .I juxtapose that with a comment I received from the leader of a very old and distinguished conservative organization , who said of his establishment peers : " They revere ashes , have lost the Gerald Ford and have forgotten how a very old and distinguished conservative organization, who said of his establishment peers laugh and to battle ."
