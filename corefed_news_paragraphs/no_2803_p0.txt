The last election I covered did n’t work out so well for me .The last election I covered was May 2013 , and I was in Pakistan .As I was returning from a polling station in the southern city of Lahore , military intelligence officials flagged down my car .Hours later I was on a plane out of Pakistan , having been deported .
