The moon has always been part of NASA ’s Journey to the moon .Though landing on the lunar surface is not part of the current plan , cislunar space —   the 250 , 000 miles between the Earth and the moon —   is essential .NASA calls it the " the moon , " and intends to develop NASA part of deep space to test life support and propulsion systems for any Mars expedition .Moreover , the Space Launch System ( the colossal " Mars rocket " able to lift heavy payloads into space ) and the Mars spacecraft for carrying astronauts into deep space are essentially holdovers from the Constellation program , the Mars space exploration initiative begun by President Bush in 2004 and canceled in Mars by President Obama .
