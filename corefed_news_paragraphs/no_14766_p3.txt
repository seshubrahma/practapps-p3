Among other issues , the group does not like the part of the bill that changes the ratio for what insurance companies can charge customers based on age .   Under Obamacare , insurance companies can charge up to three times more for someone older     and more likely sicker     compared with insurance companies younger , and presumably healthier , counterparts .   The new legislation would allow insurers to charge older customers up to five times as much as younger customers .The new legislation gives states the latitude to change that ratio , so states like Vermont , which has a 1 to 1 age rating , can keep their states like Vermont, which has a 1 to 1 age rating .
