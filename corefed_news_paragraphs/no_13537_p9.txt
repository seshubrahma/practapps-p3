There was one small victory today with which conservatives and    employers should be happy .The Court ordered the Obama administration not to impose fines on all the    employers involved in these challenges up to this point , and while the litigation is ongoing .At minimum , this alleviates millions of dollars in crushing penalties , at least until the situation is finally resolved one way or the other .But two liberal justices put a shot over the bow of the Little Sisters and other religious employers , warning them that they did not win their case today , and signaling that these justices were more than willing to rule against the    employers if and when the time comes .
