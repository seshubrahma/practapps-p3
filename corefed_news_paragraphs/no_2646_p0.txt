MANDEVILLE , La.   —    It has so far been a mostly humdrum race for Louisiana ’s open United States Senate seat , likely to end in a victory for some veteran officeholder : the Republican state treasurer , one of the congressmen , maybe even , in a surprise , a Democratic public service commissioner .But there have been gritted teeth across Louisiana that the one candidate who has drawn by far the most attention , nationally and even internationally , is the one whom pollsters give virtually no chance , whose own party has publicly dismissed   as a "   fraud " and whose unfavorability ratings approach those of North Korea ’s .That candidate is a previous    political contender , and      David Duke .
