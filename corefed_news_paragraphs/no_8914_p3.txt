So , rather than simply rely on any specific or even basket of polls , it is perhaps better to step back a bit and consider what we do know about the state of the race today .Florida is a closed primary state ,i. e. only registered Republicans can vote on March 15 .Trump has done best in states where primaries are open to all voters to participate .
