Jackson â€™s populist vision was founded on a strong nation wherein the primacy of institutions was all the detailed policy Jackson constituents required of Jackson .The populism that Jackson tapped into would make Jackson the first president elected inland from the eastern seaboard , and , in the minds of Jackson constituents , his constituents president not elected by big cities and big plantations .For many , it heralded a fulfillment of the    republicanism on which they believed the country had itself been founded in the country colonial revolt against the country taxation without representation .The salient combination of    continental nationalism , and Lord Protector of institutions has been revived at times , most recently by Donald Trump .
