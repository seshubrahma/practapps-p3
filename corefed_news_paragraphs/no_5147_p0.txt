Director Robert Mueller as special counsel Wednesday to oversee the FBI ’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election .[ Because Attorney General Jeff Sessions previously recused Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein from the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is acting   Attorney General , with all the powers that entails , for purposes of the Russia probe .As such , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has full authority to unilaterally pass responsibility off to Mueller , who will continue the already    investigation without reporting through the normal FBI and DOJ    .   Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ’s decision came after Washington exploded into speculation Tuesday over the New York Times report that a " Comey Memo " showed that President Donald Trump had suggested in a private conversation that     Director James Comey " let it go " with regard to    National Security Advisor Michael Flynn .
