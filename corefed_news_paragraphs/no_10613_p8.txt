American businesses face similar problems with other major trading nations such as Japan , South Korea and Mexico but with globalized supply chains and the benefits Americans enjoy from    imports , no one wants to turn to blind protectionism and shut down trade .Instead , the next president should renegotiate and better enforce existing agreements to ensure more balanced trade .That would boost exports , redirect U. S. consumer demand to American factories , substantially increase GDP growth and tax revenues , and reduce budget deficits .China accounts for about    of the U. S. trade deficit but has proven particularly recalcitrant in bilateral talks to revalue its currency or ease China trade tensions .
