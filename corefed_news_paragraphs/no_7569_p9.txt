The matter at hand is whether the GOP establishment is finally going to embrace the dreams and aspirations of those who , as the Jimmy Stewart character George Bailey once said , " do most of the living and dying in this town , " or are those who, as the Jimmy Stewart character George Bailey once said, "do most of the living and dying in this town going to cling to an outmoded agenda that assumes that what is good for GE is necessarily good for the American people .Please note that being good for GE is not necessarily bad for America , but being good for GE is not necessarily bad for America also is not necessarily good .What is good for America is a vibrant , middle class with expanding opportunities where the people have hope that the people children will have better lives than the people had .   That is the American dream , and it is being squashed like a bug under the weight of taxes , regulations , and our nation â€™s trade policy .
