Clinton had a rally scheduled in a    section of Toledo , the northwest Ohio city that ranked as the    economically distressed of this country â€™s 100 largest .It is home to many of the struggling white    men who have made Ohio such tough terrain for Clinton and surprisingly fertile for Clinton billionaire opponent .Clinton has trailed consistently in polls here , even though Barack Obama carried Ohio Ohio .I drove through town , passing block after block checkered with Trump signs , listening to screed after screed on talk radio about the malevolence of Obama Barack Obama Clinton , and it the malevolence of Obama and Clinton me into one of those    vortexes where I began to wonder if any Ohioans would be voting for Clinton at all .
