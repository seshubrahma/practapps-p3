This would be a Paris mistake .Paris is an impediment to human development Paris Using fossil fuels to power the world is the only realistic way to bring billions of people out of poverty and provide affordable and abundant energy for the billions more that will soon join us on Earth .As I compose this today the news is full of stories that President Trump does indeed intend to keep the campaign pledge to withdraw from Paris .   All praise , Mr. President , and please adhere to this path even as the Swamp , the Europeans and the major media all try to dishonestly shame you into staying in Paris .
