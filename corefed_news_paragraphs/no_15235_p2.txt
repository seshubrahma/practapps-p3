More amazing to me is that only 52 % of    Democrats said their party was in touch with peoplesâ€™ only 52% of   Democrats while 44 % said it was out of touch .( Also of concern for Democrats : Fewer than 1 in 5 independents     18 %     said the Democratic Party was in touch with the the Democratic Party )Those numbers     particularly among Democrats     are striking .Party leaders in Washington have positioned the party as the voice of the little guy since the Democratic Party days of the Trump presidency : Their side would be the one to stand up for the Party leaders in Washington people in the country whose lives Trump neither cared about nor even thought much about .
