It ’s an image of rural America ingrained in many people ’s minds , and one that was often reinforced in the election .The reality is far more complex and can be seen   —    and smelled , in the    paint   —    inside a Clif Bar factory that opened here last summer in    Idaho .The largest yogurt plant in the world is here , too , opened in 2013 by Chobani , the Greek yogurt giant , in a vast space of whirring robots , steel tanks and 1 , 000    employees .New manufacturing jobs and population growth have bolstered southern Idaho , bucking the pattern , and the perception , of rural struggle .
