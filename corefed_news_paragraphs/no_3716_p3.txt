—    Sean Spicer ( @PressSec ) May 2 , 2017 ,   Technically, Spicer ’s Tweet is accurate .The spending bill , which funds the government until the end of the fiscal year , does account for the construction of levee walls and extra steel fencing , but that is far short of the president ’s campaign promise of an actual border wall .But what Spicer did next was Spicer’s problematic and potentially hurts President Trump ’s efforts to succeed later in the year in delivering an actual border wall when the next spending bill comes up in September .
