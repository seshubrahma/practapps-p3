The President has apparently been removed from Obama Trump ’s White the Obama administration    This sorry development in the saga of Gen. Flynn ’s rise and fall comes as President Trump seeks to convince the American public that his first 100 days in office have been a whirlwind of enormous accomplishments .The President , who rarely misses an Mr Trump’s trumpet success , failed to list one of Mr Trump’s most important : the firing of Gen. Flynn .   We can all breathe a sigh of relief that the national security adviser sitting next to the President when North Mr Trump’s launches a missile     or possibly tests a nuclear weapon     will not be the ethically challenged and intensely investigated Gen. Flynn .
