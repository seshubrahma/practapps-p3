What Peyton Manning does on Sunday morning has become an intense topic of conversation , at least since Lionel Richie serenaded the    Hall of Famer while Peyton Manning purchased groceries from an unimpressed cashier in Peyton Manning bathrobe .[ However , wisely , Peyton Manning did n’t wear his bathrobe this past Sunday .That ’s because the Super Bowl champion    had a tee time with President Trump .   Peyton Manning played with the President Trump the Trump National Golf Club , along with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker , and also visited the White House .
