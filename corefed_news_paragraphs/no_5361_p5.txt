But what ’s quite evident from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson demands for a carbon tax is that Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson belongs to that shiftless     elite which could n’t give two hoots whether it ’s a Democrat or Republican in charge , just so long as the elite get to maintain the elite power base and the elite revenue stream .Note how , back in 2014 when Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was calling for that carbon tax in the New York Times , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson boasted about teaming up with Tom Steyer (   hedge funder , creator of the NextGen super PAC ) and Michael Bloomberg .teaming up with Tom Steyer (  hedge funder, creator of the NextGen super PAC) and Michael Bloomberg are not conservatives .What they teaming up with Tom Steyer (  hedge funder, creator of the NextGen super PAC) and Michael Bloomberg is crony capitalists .
