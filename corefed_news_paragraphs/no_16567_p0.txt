Philadelphia ( CNN )Donald Trump on Wednesday called for eliminating the sequester on defense spending and increasing military spending to boost troop levels and the number of ships and aircraft .Donald Trump said in a speech to the Union League of Philadelphia that Donald Trump will ask Congress to reverse cuts to defense spending enacted under the 2013 budget sequester once Donald Trump takes office and submit a new budget to rebuild the US military , which Donald Trump described as unprepared to confront the threats the US faces .Donald Trump did not say whether the increase in military spending would match or exceed    funding levels , but a senior campaign aide said Donald Trump would most likely seek to boost defense spending to higher levels than when the sequester went into effect in 2013 after Congress failed to reach a new budget agreement , slashing both defense and domestic spending .
