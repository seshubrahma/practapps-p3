The government reported on Friday that employers added just 38 , 000 workers to employers payrolls in May , a sharp slowdown in hiring that is expected to push back a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates .The latest snapshot suggested that the economic recovery might have stalled this spring , at least temporarily .Despite the anemic job gains , the official unemployment rate , ( which is based on a separate survey of households ) fell to 4 . 7 percent , its lowest point in nearly a decade .But the decline was primarily a result of Americans dropping out of the labor force rather than finding new jobs .
