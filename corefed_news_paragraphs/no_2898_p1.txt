Ms. Lynch wanted to talk about Loretta Lynch anything else .And in the end , after nearly five hours of parrying , dodging and weaving , Ms. Lynch appeared to emerge unscathed from a contentious House Judiciary Committee hearing that dwelled at length on her decision last week to shut down Ms. Lynch yearlong investigation into Mrs. Clinton ’s emails on the recommendation of the F. B. I. director , James B. Comey Jr. Republicans , on the other hand , were exasperated and at times furious over the steadfast refusal of the nation ’s top law enforcement officer to discuss many details of the investigation , the    process or the legal rationale for closing the case against the presumptive Democratic nominee .While Ms. Lynch said she was " extremely proud of the Ms. Lynch work of the dedicated prosecutors and agents " on the politically tense case , she deferred repeatedly to the remarkable    Ms. Lynch that Mr. Comey gave reporters last week about his decision not recommend charges .If Mr. Comey wanted to learn more about the substance of the investigation , Ms. Lynch told Republicans , they should look to the F. B. Republicans director ’s statement , which concluded that Mrs. Clinton was " extremely careless " Ms. Lynch handling of classified material but did not Ms. Lynch intend " to break the law .
