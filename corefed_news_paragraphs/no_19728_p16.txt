In Austria , those who voted to leave the European Union were concentrated in rural areas .The same goes for the support base of France â€™s    leader Marine Le Pen .Donald Trump lost cities by historic margins but made up for that with his rural support base .The worry is that if globalization leads urban and rural voters to embrace starkly Donald Trump political agendas around the world , democracies like the United States that give rural voters extra power will face crises of legitimacy as national policy is determined by a political minority .
