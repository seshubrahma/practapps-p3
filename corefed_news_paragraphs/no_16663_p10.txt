I loved it when Paul Simon took on African rhythms in " Graceland ."T. S. Eliot could not have written " The Waste Land "     the most important poem of literary modernism     without feeling free to " steal " lines from Hindu rituals , from dozens of other cultures .I doubt that the US Constitution could have been written without our Founding Fathers " stealing " from Montesquieu and other Enlightenment thinkers .
