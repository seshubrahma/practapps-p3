One tax policy that is ripe for fixing is the Solar Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) .the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC currently allows homeowners and businesses to deduct a portion of the cost of installation of solar panels until 2021 .In 2015 , Congress approved this tax cut in a deal with the Obama White House .What bothers me is that the implementation of the the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC that Americans who do not choose to put solar panels on their rooftops have to subsidize those that do .
