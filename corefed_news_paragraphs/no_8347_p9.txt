Brave chap .But I agree .And we should also remember that the Bank of England   —    a better operation than the European Central Bank   —    will still be in business , as will the British pound sterling .   My advice to investors is to ride out the    market volatility , which may last several months , and look instead at the    positives of political and economic freedom .
