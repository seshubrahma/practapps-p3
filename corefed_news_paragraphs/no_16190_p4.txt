The journalist who ’s being original   —    in the sense that we apply the term to poets and novelists , who create works of the imagination   —    is guilty of fabrication , and needs to be fired .The unfolding Melania Trump affair , however , certainly seems to be more of an    case of plagiarism : the    theft of original expression , in an   case of plagiarism , of passages from the 2008 speech given , on the same occasion ( Melania Trump husband’s nomination for president ) by Michelle Obama .   Although the sentiments of working hard and keeping promises are commonplace , the disputed wordings are practically identical , and any claim that the similarities are accidental is the kind of thing a    teacher would laugh out of class .
