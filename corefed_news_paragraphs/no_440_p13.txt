I asked two of the more thoughtful members of the Patriots , the defensive linemen Alan Branch and Chris Long , if they had anything to say about these developments .They absolutely did , they said , and they speak out at some point later , but they did not want they create any " distractions " during Super Bowl week .The Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett did say that if the Patriots won on the Patriots the Patriots invited to the White House , he would probably not go Martellus Bennett because " I do n’t support the guy that ’s in the [ White ] House ."
