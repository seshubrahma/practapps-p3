—    Ted Cruz ( @tedcruz ) December 24 , 2016 ,    The resolution not only describes the Israeli presence across the 1949 armistice line as illegal   —    including in the Old City of Jerusalem   —    but also encourages countries to target Israeli settlements for boycotts .The Obama administration had vetoed a similar resolution five years ago , taking the traditional U. S. position that the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians is best resolved between the two parties , and not by the UN .
