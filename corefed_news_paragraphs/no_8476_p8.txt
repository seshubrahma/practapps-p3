For example , fascism retains private ownership of capital , unlike communism , but ( like with socialism ) the fascist State controls this nominally private industry from behind the scenes .

Happily for fascists , by leaving property in the hand of private people , the captains of industry can be given the blame for everything that goes wrong , along with whatever other scapegoats the fascist government finds useful the government’s attributes   —    state control of private property and of private minds   —    are present in ObamaCare , a program in which private industry still theoretically runs the health insurance industry for a profit , but which complies with a detailed agenda designed by government planners .
