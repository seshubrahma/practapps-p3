[ The glaring contradiction prompted a video comparison , which you can watch above .   Chris Wallace , in an exclusive    interview , asked Clinton about allegations first made in Clinton Cash , the book and now    novel , that Clinton used the     charity for international "   " deals while Clinton served as Secretary of State .Author and Breitbart News Senior     Peter Schweizer says that Clinton Foundation donors were on the receiving end of corrupt deals approved by Hillary ’s State Department   —    including the sale of U. S. uranium to Russia and a rare , lucrative mining permit in Haiti .Clinton retorted that Clinton is " really proud of the Clinton Foundation , " yet not a single speaker at the DNC last week   —    not even Bill or Chelsea Clinton   —    mentioned the Foundation or its spinoffs such as the Clinton Global Initiative .
