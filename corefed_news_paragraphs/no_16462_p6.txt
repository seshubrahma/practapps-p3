Clinton appearance , scheduled for December 20 , was pushed back as Clinton recovered .   In a bit of dark irony , Clinton â€™s political opponents then , most notably the Republican former U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton , suggested that Clinton was faking it     that the secretary of state , as Bolton put it , had come down with a " diplomatic illness " in order to avoid the congressional inquiry .In the weeks after the injury , Clinton would be hospitalized and prescribed blood thinners to dissolve a blood clot located in a vein behind Clinton right ear .The diagnosis was made during a    exam related to Clinton concussion .
