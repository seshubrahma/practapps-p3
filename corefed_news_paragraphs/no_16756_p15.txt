In a few weeks , I ’ll be listening a lot more to the roar of Cubs fans who hold out hope that their    World Series drought will come to an end .If it happens , it will change the worldwide narrative on Chicago the it will celebrate and the world will join Chicago It will bring the kind of headlines that do it make me cringe .But I now realize that good news alone wo n’t fix life for those stuck in poverty and who fear that their children wo n’t make it home from school .those stuck in poverty World Series does not bring a better life .
