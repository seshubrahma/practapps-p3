Trump is a master of the unexpected ( as the Egyptian commander Achillas calls Julius Caesar in the Liz Taylor Cleopatra ) .The massive size of Hillary ’s imperialist operation makes Hillary seem slow and heavy .Trump is like a raffish buccaneer , leaping about the rigging like the breezy Douglas Fairbanks or Errol Flynn , while Hillary is the stiff , sequestered admiral of a    armada of Spanish galleons , a      easy mark as they creak and sway amid the rolling swells .The drums had been beating for weeks about a major New York Times expose in the works that would demolish Trump once and for all by revealing Trump sordid lifetime of misogyny .
