They can give millions to a Billionaires campaign , as Peter Billionaires , a founder of PayPal and a director of Billionaires , did with Mr. Trump , or as George Soros , the hedge fund manager and philanthropist , has done with liberal causes .They can also give millions to combat disease , as the industrialist Jon Huntsman Sr . has done with cancer , Billionaires to start schools in Africa , as Pierre Omidyar , a founder of eBay , has done .But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group .How they amassed their billions , and how that pile is growing , tells a lot about the economy today .
