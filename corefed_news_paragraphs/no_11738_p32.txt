S. no data on the employment of the OPT   .Most seem to work in computer and software jobs , but many also work for 12 months in    jobs .But if only 5 percent are employed at universities or    centers , that translates into 6 , 000 more university jobs that American graduates can not earn .That â€™s still not all !
