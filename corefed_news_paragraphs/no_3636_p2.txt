I applaud the announcement of President Trump â€™s America First policy to return more American jobs to American American by rooting out fraud , identifying necessary reforms and punishing companies exploiting the system for their American workers financial gain .Brat touts his    reform plan introduced with Rep. Bill Pascrell ( ) Rep. Ro Khanna ( ) and Rep. Paul Gosar ( ) where employers seeking foreign workers through the    visa would have to raise the minimum wage for those workers , while also giving " investigative authority " to the Departments of Homeland Security ( DHS )and Labor to " find abuses and creates more defined allotment categories to prioritize STEM workers ."
