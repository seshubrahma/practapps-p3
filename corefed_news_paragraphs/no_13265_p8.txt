"In the    to this year â€™s elections , the National Association of Manufacturers ( NAM ) detailed the disproportionately negative impact regulations have on smaller businesses .Although the average cost per employee to comply with federal regulations is advertised as $ 19 , 564 , it is only $ 13 , 750 for large companies with over 100 employees , $ 18 , 243 for companies with 50 to 99 employees , and $ 34 , 671 for firms with fewer than 50 employees .NAM wrote that given that almost all the employment gains each year are created by small NAM , this explained why the    hourly wage for middle class workers peaked at $ 21 .
