I do n’twant Republicans to hold any comfort in that .I do n’t want that cancer in my city when I honestly feel the Republican Ideals , not the politicians , are the cure and they stand by and watch the Republican Ideals, not the politicians get sicker , weaker , and more radicalized .So with my history of living the Progressive nightmare , I will not comfort you Republicans .
