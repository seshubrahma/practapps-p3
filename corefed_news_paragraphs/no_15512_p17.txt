It was n’t just     Republican senators who had n’t heard from the White House in the more than 15 hours since story broke .It was committee chairs , including Sen. Chuck Grassley , the top Republican on the Judiciary panel , and perhaps most surprisingly , Sen. Richard Burr , the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee , and other more senior members of the conference .It was the second time in as many weeks , multiple aides told CNN , where communications staffers were calling between offices trying to figure out who , if anyone , had accurate information , and more importantly , if anyone had an idea of how exactly to respond .   Sen. Marco Rubio , among those who did hear from administration officials on Monday night , answered plainly when he was asked if he he received any more clarity on what actually occurred in the meeting between Trump and Russian officials .
