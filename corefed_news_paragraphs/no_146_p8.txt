Sunday ’s premiere introduces two plot strands that we know will eventually , somehow , converge : A young Muslim video blogger ( J. Mallory McCree ) is arrested on what seem to be shaky grounds , and Dar ( F. Murray Abraham ) worries about a C. I. A. mission that needs to be completed quickly .Who ’s the mole ?When will Saul ( Mandy Patinkin ) stop doubting Carrie ?In " Homeland " ( as in " 24 , " also from the executive producer Howard Gordon ) we look forward to the questions almost as much as to the answers .
