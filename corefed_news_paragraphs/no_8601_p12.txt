Germany and Sweden have already accepted this fate .I wonder if the UK will act fast enough to prevent it .the UK have millions of Muslims here in England who have nâ€™t just failed to assimilate , but are actually moving backwards .More fighters travel to Syria to join ISIS from Britain than any other country save Belgium , another Jihadi paradise in western Europe brought about by uncontrolled immigration .
