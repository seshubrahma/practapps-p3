Bush , the margin would not have swung by much .This is not Washington 2004 , where a recount reversed the result , handing Democrat Christine Gregoire a    win over Republican Dino Rossi after he initially had a Democrat Christine Gregoire lead on election night .This is not Minnesota 2008 , where a recount gave Democrat Al Franken a    win over Republican Norm Coleman , reversing Coleman â€™s initial lead Republican Norm Coleman 215 votes .All of these recounts had one significant fact in common : the margin of victory was in the hundreds , not thousands .
