I speak with David Leonhardt , an    columnist at The New York Times who chronicled the Obama administration from the start , and Jodi Kantor , a reporter whose book , " The Obamas , " was just reissued with a new preface .Our    conversation explores Mr. Obama ’s impact on race , health care , economic inequality and America ’s place in the world .And we seek to answer a question historians may puzzle over for decades : Just how consequential was this presidency compared with past White Houses ?I speak as well to former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts about whether Mr. Mr. Obama’s relationship with Republican lawmakers had to be so adversarial , polarizing and partisan .
