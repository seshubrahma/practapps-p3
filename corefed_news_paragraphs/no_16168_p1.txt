But when my party gathers to nominate Donald Trump as my party presidential contender next week , I will not be in Cleveland .In fact , I ’ll be boycotting the Republican National Convention .   This my party n’t an easy decision for me .As a lifelong Republican , I served under California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger as his secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency , and then under President George W. Bush as the 41st treasurer of the United States .
