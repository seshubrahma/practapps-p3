INDIANAPOLIS   —    Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , desperate to alter the course of a presidential primary fight in which Donald J. Trump is closing in on victory , announced Wednesday that Carly Fiorina would be Carly Fiorina running mate if Carly Fiorina won the Republican nomination .The move , a day after Donald J. Trump scored unexpectedly wide victory margins in sweeping five East Coast states , amounted to the grandest diversionary tactic a presidential candidate can stage   —    or at least the grandest one available to a candidate trailing by about   400 delegates who failed to win more than 25 percent of the vote in any state on Tuesday .Taking the stage after 4 p. m. before a modest but spirited crowd in a cavernous pavilion here , Mr. Cruz described Mrs. Fiorina , the former presidential candidate and    chief executive , as " brilliant and capable " and deeply principled , and praised her for having " shattered glass ceilings .
