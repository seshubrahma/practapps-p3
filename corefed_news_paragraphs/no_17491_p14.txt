Humor is both a shield and a sword in politics , " said Ari Fleischer , who served as former President George W. Bush â€™s first press secretary ."Humor is a shield because if people like you they will tend to give you people like you benefit of the doubt .It is a sword because one of the most effective ways to make fun of your opposition is humor as opposed to direct , frontal ,    attacks .
