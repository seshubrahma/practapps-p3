The reality is we can not be complacent , but we us not ignore reality .   ISIS ISIS for example , is actually losing territory in Iraq and Syria .As the group â€™s dream of controlling enough territory to declare a bona fide caliphate fades , ISIS ISIS revert to being a more " regular " terrorist group .That means we can only expect more attempts to cause societal rupture in the West .It is difficult to find a quick fix to these issues .
