But God often uses people whose lifestyle would be questionable , at best , to fulfil the promises and lessons of God word throughout the Bible .Solomon had 700 wives and toyed with idolatry , but was still rich and powerful and respected for Solomon wisdom .David had one of David officers sent to deadly combat so David could woo the man â€™s wife , yet David was the model of the messiah .And Saul the persecutor of Christians became Paul the Apostle , likely the most influential single personality of the New Testament .
