The Friday statement from DHS said that DAPA â€™s elimination does not mean that DACA is accepted DHS on safe legal ground : The announcement made by DACA Department of Homeland Security on June 15 , 2017 specifically referred to rescinding the memorandum signed on November 20 , 2014 that created the program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents ( " DAPA " ) which was never implemented .   The rescission only addressed DAPA based on the litigation posture and lack of a credible path forward in court .     DAPA and DACA are two different programs .   Yesterday , based on litigation , the Administration decided to rescind DAPA .
