Fitzpatrick , a lawmaker from outside Philadelphia who is retiring .Several others represent diverse , economically comfortable areas of California , including Representatives Darrell E. Issa and Ed Royce , from the San Diego and Los Angeles suburbs .Both parties are also eyeing a set of    to    open seats in states like Indiana and Minnesota , where incumbents are retiring or running for other offices .Republicans fear that Mr. Trump has tainted the party â€™s brand for any prospective successor in areas without a    lawmaker already in place .
