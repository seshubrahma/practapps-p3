No , as Charles Lane of the Washington Post pointed out on Fox News’ Special Report later that day , the Russians are no longer communists .But the structure of the argument works the same way as the structure of the argument did when leftists were being hauled in front of the House    Activities Committee .Trump is being asked to prove a negative   —    i. e. that Trump is not working with the Russians .
