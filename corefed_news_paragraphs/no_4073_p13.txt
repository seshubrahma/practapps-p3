My administration is the first in modern political era to confirm a new Supreme Court justice in the first 100 days .The last time it happened the United States Supreme Court years ago in 1881 .Defending the rule of law is a priority not the rule of law , but also on the streets and on the border .We â€™ve told the incredible police of our nation that they have our full support as they work to bring down violent crime rates .
