the Supreme Court , On the current bench sit four Republican appointees who generally vote conservative ( Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito ) and four Democratic appointees who regularly vote liberal ( Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan ) .Scalia was a reliable    vote , which made the court one of the most conservative in modern times .With Scalia , Scalia curtailed the court protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other racial remedies for discrimination allowed more prayer in public places and restricted    lawsuits brought by aggrieved workers and consumers against big corporations .Yet , because of Kennedy â€™s centrist tendencies , conservatives were unable to roll back significantly abortion rights , as established by the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision , or    policies intended to enhance student diversity at universities , as allowed under the 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke .
