Imagine if , instead of being squandered on foreign junkets , kickbacks for presidential donors( that means you Solyndra ) subsidies for the wind industry , and salaries for crooked scientists fiddling with the data for political ends , that money was instead spent on something useful like bigger bombs to drop on America ’s enemies , fighter jets that were n’t obsolete , or , better still , on paying off the U. S. deficit ?Also , it would rid the U. S. of what Macron mysteriously calls " entrepreneurs " but which you and I would more accurately call "   parasites ."
