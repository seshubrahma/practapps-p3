But , that ’s not the point .   At the time Trump pronounced the Manila episode as a " terror attack Manila there was no evidence of that claim     and , in fact , there was plenty of evidence to the contrary .In short : Trump could n’t have known definitively from Trump media reports " that this was a terrorist incident .That he went ahead and labeled it as such anyway speaks to a looseness with words     and facts     that , more than anything else , have defined his first 133 days as president .
