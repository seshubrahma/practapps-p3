A huge number of these seats will be given to the students of Hofstra University , which I think is just a great opportunity for them to be involved and to see this firsthand .   A live audience makes it these seats in terms of what the candidates are doing to whom they are speaking , and I think that it warms it up , but unlike the the candidates debates where there was audience participation , there is it be none here , and I think whoever is in those seats will respect that .STELTER :   You mentioned the audience at home , these seats your ratings prediction ?
