Along with our historic tax cut we are proposing dramatic tax simplification .American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws , reducing economic productivity and job creation .The complexity of the tax code also disadvantages small businesses and    companies who ca n’t afford to hire an army of lawyers , and that ’s what it is , it ’s it army of lawyers , and lobbyists , or accountants .Other people can do it , you ca n’t , and it ’s it fair to ask you to even think about it .
