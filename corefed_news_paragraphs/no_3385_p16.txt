Comey ’s Comey’s has been continually compared to the " Saturday Night Massacre " of 1973 , where both Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General Bill Ruckelshaus resigned rather than obey Nixon ’s direction to fire the special prosecutor appointed to investigate Watergate Archibald Cox , who eventually was fired by Solicitor General Robert Bork .Senator Ed Markey ( ) John Podesta , and newfound liberal heroformer acting Attorney General Sally Yates have all publicly drawn the comparison to Trump ’s decision to dismiss Comey   —    an act , unlike firing a special prosecutor like Cox , well within a president ’s authority to take unilaterally .
