Well , that did n’t stop the leader of the    propaganda media , Rachel Maddow herself , from going off the deep end last night , claiming that in 2005 , a Russian oligarch knew that Donald Trump was going to be president , so he bought a property from him in Florida and a Russian oligarch made a huge profit a Russian oligarch more than two Donald Trump what he paid for it !And as I said a Russian oligarch night , Donald Trump thinks that somehow , maybe Russia knew in 2005 that Donald Trump would be elected president in 2016 .Donald Trump NBC News did n’t think that was possible even on election night .Now , that ’s pretty pathetic , and the media should know better , but they ’d rather put their radical    agenda than telling the media truth to the the media people .
