During the almost 40 years I have been involved with the political process , I have had to endure insults from the left and the Republican elitists calling activists like me stupid or , in recent history , " low information " voters .I have learned to ignore the disparaging attacks from the elitists on both sides of the political spectrum that worked to oppose conservative ideology .I have volunteered countless hours to the conservative cause and to my country because I am true believer in conservatism .I was disheartened to learn that you recently joined   progressives and Republican establishment elitists by attacking millions of activists like me that support Donald Trump by calling us low information voters .
