my wife the same time , on this side of the border , California was doing things to embrace our undocumented population .We had things like AB60 which allowed for undocumented immigrants to get a we license , for example .Other legislation was passed to help undocumented immigrants live as normal of a life as possible in California while the Americans were doing the opposite , while the American people California largely spewing pretty hateful    rhetoric .Those forces combined , a push and a pull , is what caused me to change my allegiance from Washington to Sacramento .
