I thought that if a person me color could be elected president of the United States , a boy born in Colombia could do anything in America .   Yet I feared that going to college in the United States would be impossible , because America nâ€™t provide financial aid to undocumented students or refuse to even admit us .My family was too poor to pay my way .Fortunately , the scholarships I earned through hard work and good grades enabled me to come to Columbia University .
