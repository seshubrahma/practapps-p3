On January 6th , 2017 , the intelligence community assessment assessing Admiral Rogers activities and intentions in recent U. S. elections , stated that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying .So Russian question as of today , Admiral Rogers , do you have any evidence that Russia cyber actors changed Admiral Rogers in the state of Michigan ?ROGERS :No I do not , but I would highlight we are a Admiral Rogers intelligence organization , not a domestic intelligence organization .
