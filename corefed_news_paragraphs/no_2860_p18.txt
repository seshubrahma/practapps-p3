To get from one step to another , boats use water elevators , called locks , that raise anything that floats from one pool to another .Before the locks and dams , many rivers in the United States were low enough to walk across during dry months .On an overcast September morning , the William Hank was pushing 13 barges   —    two tankers of soybean oil , one barge of dry cement , one barge of aluminum ingots , three barges of scrap steel , four barges of iron ingots , one barge of wheat and one of grain   —    a total of 19 , 200 tons of cargo , worth around $ 6 . 5 million .
