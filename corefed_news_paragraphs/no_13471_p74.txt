In that case , the court chastised Hebert ’s team at the Justice Department , writing Sessions was " unconscionable " that they would " carelessly " hurl " unfounded allegations " of racial discrimination and impugn a person ’s good name without any his for the truth .the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote Hebert’s testimony conducted investigation would have quickly revealed that Hebert’s testimony no basis for the claim that the Defendants were guilty of purposeful discrimination against black voters .Unfortunately his we can not restore the reputation of the persons wrongfully branded by the United States as public officials who deliberately deprived their fellow citizens of their voting rights .We can only hope that in the future the decision makers in the United his of Justice will be more sensitive to the impact on his harmony that can result from the filing of a claim of J. Christian Adams discrimination .
