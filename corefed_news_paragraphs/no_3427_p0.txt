Breitbart is a " very extreme right " organization that pumps out " fake news " but has no impact in the real world because it is ignored by the mainstream media .[ I learned this from a Berkeley professor of linguistics called George Lakoff who was given space by the BBC to spout his views , virtually unchallenged , for half an hour this week on a Radio 4 programme called Word of Mouth .   Lakoff was introduced as an " eminent linguist " at the " forefront of the debate ."
