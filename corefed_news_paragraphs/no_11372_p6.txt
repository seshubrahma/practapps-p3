The    contender said : I believe we need to protect access to safe and legal abortion , not just in principle , but in practice .Any right that requires you to take measures to access it , is no right at all .Not when patients and providers have to endure harassment and intimidation just to walk into a health center not when making an appointment means taking time off from work , finding child care , and driving    across your state not when providers are required by state law to recite misleading information to women in order to shame and scare them and not as long women we have laws on the books like the Hyde Amendment , making it harder for    women to exercise their full rights .The women Amendment was initially the Hyde Amendment Henry Hyde and enacted in 1976 .
