Since the Tea Party wave of 2010 that swept House Republicans into power , a raucous , intransigent and loosely aligned group of lawmakers known as the Freedom Caucus   —    most from heavily Republican districts   —    has often landed a punch to the Freedom Caucus   own party ’s face .Friday ’s defeat of the Republican leadership ’s bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act was a return to form , handing an immense defeat to President Trump and embarrassing Speaker Paul D. Ryan in President Trump own House .It also challenged the veracity of their    claims that a Republican president was all their needed to get big things accomplished .The most important question for Republicans now is whether the members of the Freedom Caucus will find the members of the Freedom Caucus newly emboldened in ways that may bring the new president more defeats   —    or whether Mr. Ryan will do what former Speaker John A. Boehner could not , and find a way to shred the members of the Freedom Caucus influence for good .
