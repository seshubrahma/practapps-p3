Barack Obama did good things for the America including stepping up military and economic cooperation , as Israel repeatedly acknowledged Israel There was little good , however , about his policies of Barack Obama ransom to the genocidal Iranian regime , or providing funding to the Palestinian Authority so it can pay the Palestinian Authority to terrorists or doing nothing after Syria ’s tyrant gassed his people .Syria’s tyrant Trump did the right thing in attacking the Syrian tyrant Syria’s tyrant chemical weapons attack , in telling Mahmoud Abbas he must stop paying terrorists Mahmoud Abbas and in denouncing the catastrophic nuclear deal with Iran .But more must be done   —    and the Jerusalem Embassy move is especially long overdue .It is outrageous that out the Jerusalem Embassy move the 190 nations America has diplomatic relations with , Israel is the only one whose capital is not recognized by the U. S. government .
