In an interview with 60 Minutes last month ,    Donald Trump made yet another pledge to remove undocumented immigrants from the United States , saying   Donald Trump would deport up to 3 million of undocumented immigrants who " have criminal records ."Similar promises —   like building a wall along the U. S.   border , and blocking federal funding to    sanctuary cities —   were a cornerstone of   Donald Trump campaign .But as   Donald Trump assumes the presidency , Trump will face not only continued public opposition to   Donald Trump plans , but potential obstruction by state and local law enforcement who   Donald Trump would need to implement any new policies .
