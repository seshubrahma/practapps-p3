During Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee , Senator Tom Cotton ( ) asked whether any spy fiction had " a plot line so ridiculous that a sitting United States senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded at an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of espionage ? "   Senator Tom Cotton said , " [ A ] very simple question that should be asked is , did Donald Trump or any of Donald Trump associates in the campaign collude with Russia in hacking those emails and releasing those emails to the public ?That ’s where we started six months ago .we have now heard from six of the eight Democrats on this committee , and , to my knowledge , I do n’t think a single one of the eight Democrats on this committee asked that question .the eight Democrats on this committee ’ve gone down lots of other rabbit trails , but not that question .
