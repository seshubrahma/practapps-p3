Such     is part of the    " Deep State " strategy to undermine the legitimacy of the 2016 election results .It is quite a stretch in both fact and logic to suggest that any conversation with any Russian official , including the Russian Ambassador , during calendar year 2016 must have been part of a Russian to control the outcome of the election â€”    a conspiracy for which no evidence whatsoever exists !And yet , despite the obvious partisan motivations behind this slanderous campaign against the President , we see some Republican members of Congress Like Coffman supporting that Soros game plan through cheap shots to generate    media coverage .The mainstream media is engaged in a witch hunt that makes the Salem witch trials of the 17th Century look like a Disneyland vacation .
