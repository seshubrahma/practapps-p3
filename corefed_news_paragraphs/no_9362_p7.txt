It all seems based on a political philosophy that is not terribly optimistic about the    outcome of globalization and seeks to protect cultures from erosion .That does n’t seem like racism to me ( though many liberals certainly wo n’t like the philosophy ) .Now , to be sure , there are those who conform to what we traditionally understand as racism .In a Reuters poll , slightly more Trump supporters seem to believe that whites are more intelligent than blacks .
