I think a Pruitt EPA will be an EPA that will focus on actual results , not on theoretical threats that might somehow get in the way of achieving those results .When you run a business , you are always searching for the most efficient way to achieve your goal .When you â€™re in charge of a bureaucracy , the traditional model has been to find a way to achieve your goal that : ( a ) would make everyone happy , and ( b ) involved not even the slightest , tiniest , most insignificant bit of risk .I think Pruitt will change that way of thinking , at least as far as the EPA is concerned .
