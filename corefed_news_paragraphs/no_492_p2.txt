I â€™m a the Atlanta Falcons fan today ."Not long before the game started , pro Trump , in an interview on Fox , which was broadcasting the game , predicted a Patriot win by 8 points in part out of support for his pro Trump .That prediction was the object of ridicule as Atlanta surged ahead , but then it the object of ridicule as Atlanta up appearing prescient as the Patriots stormed back to win ,    in the first Super Bowl overtime .
