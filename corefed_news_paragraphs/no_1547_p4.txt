2 .I think we do n’t remember how recently women were n’t allowed to wear pants , or could n’t attend Ivy League schools .Somehow we failed to pass these stories on to we daughters as we sought to give them all the opportunities of them male counterparts .Now the sexism is often more subtle , more hidden and our daughters take their our daughters for granted .
