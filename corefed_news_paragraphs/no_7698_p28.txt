because of the inability of some who are nâ€™t able to afford to sit in many places in these stadiums , we have seen a separation of class as determined by individual income .Now we see corporations and    individuals being seated in the best places while the rest of the great unwashed is moved to the outer limits of these facilities .Sports used to allow for the janitor and the stock broker to sit side by side at games and . if just for a little while , share a common interest within that environment .
