As he seeks to revive he embattled candidacy , Donald J. Trump has seized on a new argument to rally he supporters and to explain away a possible defeat in November : that Democrats are preparing to exploit weak voter identification laws to win a " stolen election " through fraudulent voting .The claim has spurred outrage among Democrats and has alarmed some Republicans who worry his tactics will backfire , angering minority voters and threatening the party ’s chances in close races down the ballot .Since 2010 , Republican governors and    state legislatures have fought for stricter voter identification laws , which Democrats argue are intended to hinder turnout by the poorest voters , many of Republican governors and   state legislatures black and Hispanic , who tend to vote Democratic .But Mr. Trump ’s language has moved beyond Mr. Trump ’s call for rigid identification requirements and the unfounded claims that polls are " skewed " to predictions of outright theft of the November election .
