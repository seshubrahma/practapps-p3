No one , prior to the    century , would have called that " conservative , " A good friend of mine from the tech world says .In fact , it ’s just liberal utopianism .   A good friend of mine from the tech world ’s right , in the sense that American conservatism is basically classical liberalism , plus an embrace of faith   —    a faith largely grounded in the unique values of the American Protestant tradition , which itself was a radical break from authority .What we call " liberalism " today is really socialism , combined with hostility toward traditional mores and a sentimental ( though largely superficial ) embrace of the poor , both of which are necessary for the    state to emerge as the only authority .
