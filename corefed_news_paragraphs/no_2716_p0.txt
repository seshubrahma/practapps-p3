In 1832 , during a performance of " Richard III " at the Bowery Theater in Manhattan , 300 boisterous audience members joined the cast onstage to participate in the final sword fight and the slaying of the tyrannical King Richard .According to a newspaper account , " the audience mingled with the soldiers and raced across the stage " and during the last duel " made a ring around the combatants to see fair play , and kept the combatants at fair play for nearly a quarter of an hour ."In today â€™s theater , where audience members are admonished to unwrap audience members candy in advance to avoid making a sound , such a scene is hard to fathom in the    theater , it was of a piece ( although on the rowdy side of the spectrum ) with standard audience behavior .
