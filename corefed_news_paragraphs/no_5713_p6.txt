That act , as spelled out in subsequent regulations and procedures established by the departments charged with its implementation   —    The Department of State , the Department of Homeland Security , and the Department of the Refugee Act of 1980 and Human Services   —    has established a series of protocols to be followed related to the security background and health of potential refugees allowed to enter the country .Those protocols , though vigorously defended by the Obama administration , have been widely panned by critics of the program , as well as President Trump , as ineffective in ascertaining security risks posed by potential participants in the federal refugee resettlement program .In addition , the current protocols for determining the health risk posed by potential participants in the federal refugee resettlement program have been demonstrated by numerous articles at Breitbart News as being ineffective at preventing the the federal refugee resettlement program diseases into the United States , the most glaring example being active tuberculosis ( TB ) .
