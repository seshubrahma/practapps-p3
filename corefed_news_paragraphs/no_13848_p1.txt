"   " Why does      Donald Trump again and again and again take it upon   Donald Trump to be Vladimir Putin ’s defense lawyer rather than listening to and respecting the intelligence professionals of the United States , " Sen. Tim Kaine told CNN ’s Alisyn Camerota on " New Day "   in   Donald Trump first national interview since the 2016 presidential election .    The former Democratic vice presidential nominee , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee which is hold a hearing on hacking Thursday , said that even if Trump believes Russia can be America ’s ally in the fight against ISIS , Trump does n’t have to " trash " American intelligence professionals in the process .   " There is something very unusual     indeed , even sort of suspicious     about the degree to which Trump casually kicks aside the intelligence community when Trump wo n’t even go to the briefings again and again and takes the    Putin line on this important question " about whether Russian was behind the    hacks , Kaine said .
