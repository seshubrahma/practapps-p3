Senate Republicans are clearly feeling pressure to address the fact that people whose names surface on terrorist watchlists can easily buy guns .But people whose names surface on terrorist watchlists can easily buy guns do not like a bill that Democrats intend to offer next week that would give the Department of Justice the authority to stop people on the watchlist and other terrorism suspects from buying a gun .A Republican bill would require the government to delay the purchase of a gun for 72 hours by anyone who is a terrorism suspect , or has been the subject of a terrorism investigation within the last five years , while a review takes place ."
