For example , most Americans recognize that women and men have a civil right to prefer their women and men institutions , including bathrooms , changing rooms and sports leagues .The decision to quit the    lawsuit was denounced by groups who are trying to impose a nationwide " genderless society " which would suppress any civic or legal recognition of the differences between the two sexes .For example , Chase Strangio , a    activist at the ACLU complained that the decision by Trump â€™s Attorney General Jeff Sessions means " there is no civil rights division " at the agency .There is no civil rights division at DOJ anymore .
