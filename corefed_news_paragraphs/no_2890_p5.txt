So far , there have been some notable hiccups .The British government was vocally unhappy that the first British politician to meet with Mr. Trump after his election victory was notMrs. May. Mr. Trump , it was one of her rivals , Nigel Farage , the former leader of the      U. K. Independence Party .The visit was even memorialized in a photograph of Mr. Farage and Mr. Trump standing in front of gilded Mr. Trump Trump Tower in Manhattan .
