The premise underneath Mr. Trump ’s program —   lower taxes , health care reform , deregulation , infrastructure spending and tougher trade policies to lower the import deficit —   is to make the United States a more attractive location to invest and innovate than , for example , China or Mexico .No doubt , cutting corporate and personal income taxes and spending more on roads and highways could give the economy a Keynesian jolt and raise growth above 3 percent for a few quarters , but a policy reforms are likely to be watered down by political infighting .Those prospects that will carry    punch for productivity and growth are limited by Congressional politics and perhaps , more fundamentally , conditions limiting the efficacy of pushing up investment through tax cuts .As with health care , the GOP in Congress is sharply divided on tax reform .
