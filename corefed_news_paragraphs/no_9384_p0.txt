The California    Rail Authority came up empty when The California   Rail Authority asked the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama for a $ 15 billion loan , the Los Angeles Times reports .[ State officials feared that with Republican Donald J. Trump taking office   —    somewhat unexpectedly   —    in January , and perhaps cutting off funding to the struggling project , which has never had a clear idea of how it would be financed , State officials would appeal to the President Barack Obama administration for a financial break .   The Times notes : With the President Barack Obama administration on its way out , it seemed like a good time to nail down more    federal support on the assumption that Hillary Clinton would be the next president .So the state set up a meeting to ask the U. S. Department of Transportation to publicly announce a federal loan of up to $ 15 billion that would help build an initial rail segment from San Jose to Shafter , northwest of Bakersfield , which would cement federal support during the transition to a new presidential administration .
