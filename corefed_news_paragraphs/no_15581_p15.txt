everyoneIf there was ever a week when I wished we could have had more than an hour for the episode , this episode this week .There are so many outright lies about Islam circulating out there that stand in stark contrast with the real people I was meeting and learning about .I with talked Rima Meroueh , a mom and graduate student in Near Eastern Studies , about hijab , burkas , and feminism .
