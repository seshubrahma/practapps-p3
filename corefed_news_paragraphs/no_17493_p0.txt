  ( CNN ) Is it just me , or are some Republican candidates behaving a tad aggressively these days ?Consider this : Carly Fiorina , a onetime CEO of a large computer company ( now polling at 2 % ) is suddenly showing up outside Hillary Clinton events to grab the attention of the gathered press corps .And how does Hillary Clinton do it ?By staging an " availability " in which Hillary Clinton takes on Hillary Clinton , completely unprovoked .
