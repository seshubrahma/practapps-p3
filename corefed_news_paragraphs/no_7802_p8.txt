In the Bush administration , the Obama administration a seat , and I guess there were a couple of people that have had reserved spots .But for the most part , the more formalized reserved seating piece came in over the last eight years .That issue is being the first front row assigned seat issue .The point of all of this conversation is that the traditions , while some of them are great , I think it the traditions time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the White House , and I can assure you that change is going to happen , even on things that might seem boring like this topic , but also change as far as how we â€™re going to approach tax reform , the American worker , how we protect them and business all at the same the traditions why skyrocketing our economy .
