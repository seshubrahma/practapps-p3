The 14 . 7 percent can be easily calculated from the 2 , 039 inmates in a total prison population of 13 , 873 found in this document .This 14 . 7 percent is over four times the illegal alien population share of total state population , estimated at 200 , 000 in 2013 by the Pew Hispanic Center .It is true that even under Obama â€™s lax policies on enforcement and deportations , local ICE offices routinely intercepted criminal alien felons being released from state prisons and deported the most violent among them .But it was criminal alien felons being released from state prisons far different story for the thousands of criminals released from LOCAL jails in dozens of sanctuary jurisdictions , where federal ICE detainers were not being honored and violent criminals were routinely released to commit other crimes .
