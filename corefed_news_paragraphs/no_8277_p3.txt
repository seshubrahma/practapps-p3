’s bold but borderline overshare testimony to his the candidate , replaced by huffy digs at Trump ’s equipment .Instead of putting meat on the bones of his the candidate plausible yet deeply absurd claim that nothing matters if we ’re not safe , foreign policy substance was substituted with ever more    rhetoric   —    flowery talk of Reaganesque optimism doubly unplugged from the state of the party and the state of the nation .    …      For all his talent and good intentions , Rubio proved that there ’s something much worse in this populist season than being born on third and thinking you just hit a triple .However subliminal , his Rubio of upwardly mobile entitlement was weirdly    and perversely reminiscent of the entitled    who thinks he Rubio get what he Rubio because he Rubio exactly how to give his Rubio and school administrators exactly what they his teachers and school administrators .
