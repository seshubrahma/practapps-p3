’ ’   ’ ’    I went to Smithfield in 2008 to   event and talk to locals in    this town of 900 residents .This was in the middle of the    financial crisis and foreclosed homes were a big issue .But even    more on the   financial crisis and foreclosed homes minds were the fundamental structural changes in    the economy that have left places like this behind .
