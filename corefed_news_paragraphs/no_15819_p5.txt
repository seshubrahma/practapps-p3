I â€™ve been thinking about trees and bloodlines since Donald Trump won Wisconsin and America cracked in two .Half of my Facebook feed cheered his victory Half of my Facebook feed thanked God for this miraculous answer to prayer .The other Half of my Facebook feed the stages of grief and braced for end of the world .It was like watching the American family tree get struck by lightning , trunk alive , branches on fire .
