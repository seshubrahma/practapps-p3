It is particularly insensitive to have this passage read in the Scottish Episcopal Church on the Feast of the Epiphany when we celebrate not only Christ ’s manifestation to the gentiles but also not only Christ’s baptism and the divine declaration ,‘ you are my beloved son in whom I am well pleased’ ."the Scottish Episcopal Church is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion , which also includes the Church of England and America ’s Episcopalian Church .
