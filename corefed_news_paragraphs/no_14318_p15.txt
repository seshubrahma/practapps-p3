The Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ’s attack on Judge a President of personally attacking a judge who delivered a ruling critical of his administration     , a Bush appointee who passed with 99 votes , shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that does n’t always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of a President of personally attacking a judge who delivered a ruling critical of his administration     for the Constitution , making it more important that the Supreme Court the Constitution as an independent check on the administration , " Schumer said in a statement .But Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer President Mike Pence made clear in a speech to the Federalist Society in Philadelphia on Saturday that the White House would respond to any attempt to use the Senate filibuster to block Gorsuch ’s nomination by urging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to enact the    nuclear option to change the chamber ’s rules to allow GOP senators to schedule a vote on his nomination with a simple majority .GOP , the likelihood that the tussle over the legality of Trump ’s executive order sooner or later ends up in the Supreme Court gives Democrats a fresh rationale to do everything possible to delay his confirmation , given that the Supreme GOP , currently operating one justice short , may not be able to amass a majority in support of the President’s move .
