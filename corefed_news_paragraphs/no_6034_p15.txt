I probably sound like a the America that was originally established here , but I consider myself a progressive .To me being progressive is about using the collective power of the people to help those who ca n’t help themselves .I believe it is in the nature of Californians those who can’t help themselves help others and that is the kind of independent nation I envision   —    a nation that ensures everyone healthcare and education regardless of their ability to pay , a nation that protections its citizens everyone healthcare and education corporate exploitation and political corruption rooted in campaign everyone healthcare and education , a nation that prioritizes the domestic needs of its people , their quality of life and cost of living everyone healthcare and education over its everyone healthcare and education agenda .
