It is hardly a perfect union , one without pain , or frustration .Some Latinos have wondered why the shooting that left 49 people dead has become a    touchstone and not a Latino one .Some immigrants with loved ones among the dead have collapsed in the arms of local leaders , desperate for financial help , wishing for more of the support found in the larger Puerto Rican community .There is some confusion too many countries in the hemisphere are still trying to figure out if any of their citizens were killed , a challenge since many of the victims had United States too many countries in the hemisphere even if they were originally from somewhere else .
