Mr. Trump claimed at one point during the campaign that the real jobless rate was not the number below 5 percent widely cited by economists , but something like 42 percent .There is certainly a filament of truth in that .The unemployment rate counts only people who say they want a job and have looked for one in the last month   â€”    meaning that millions of Americans who dropped out of the labor force during the aftermath of the 2008 recession do not count as unemployed by the standard definition .But we have some exciting news for the president .
