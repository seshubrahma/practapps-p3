I thought from the Breitbart News of what the NBC staffer was saying that there was some legal reason why we could n’t talk about Hillary and that we just could n’t go there for legal reasons ."When the story broke in January , NBC News did not provide Breitbart News with a statement we Broaddrick ’s accusations despite being given five business days to do so .It has yet to Breitbart News that request for comment .
