Reviewing the state of the presidential race , I see that very little has changed for the past year .Every few weeks , the media roll out a new Trump " scandal " that has already been thoroughly covered , day in , day out , for the last 15 months .[ In fact , all of the shocking new Trump " scandals were aired in the very first GOP presidential debate , where he was asked seven questions about the following charges :   ( 1 ) he is mean to women .( 2 ) he is mean to Mexicans .
