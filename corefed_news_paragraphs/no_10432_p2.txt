Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s did not give a great speech tonight , but Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s hit some ground that is very , very valuable to Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s .I think the arguments against Trump , particularly the one I mentioned on     the other one is going after on the I alone can can fix the other one , which I think we heard the president work that last night .I think that ’s a very damaging argument against the president , and not just with Democrats or Independents , but with conservatives and Republicans .I think on the economics , she probably scored very , very well , because people were looking for real proposals that people think might help people , not just trust me , I can do it .
