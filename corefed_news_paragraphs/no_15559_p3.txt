While any sentient primate facing a special counsel would know to lay off social media and refrain from antagonizing Trump investigators , Trump sees things differently .Trump ’s already tweeted that " this is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history ! "And Trump ’s complained that " there was never a special councel ( sic ) appointed " for Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .   This might be an ominous play     if Trump knows the investigation will likely dig up some pretty    dirt , Trump may have decided the only court Trump can win in is that of public opinion , specifically Trump public .
