Donald Trump caused diplomatic ripples Tuesday when   Donald Trump tweeted that Farage would " do a great job " as Britain ’s ambassador to the United States .And Farage , who ’s interim leader of the    UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) and the figurehead of the Brexit movement , was the first UK politician to meet with Trump    when   Donald Trump spent time with   Donald Trump at Trump Tower 11 days ago .   By contrast , Trump called Trump    other world leaders before placing a call to Britain ’sPrime Minister Theresa May following his election win , suggesting that the two countries’ much vaunted " special relationship " might be a little rocky .
