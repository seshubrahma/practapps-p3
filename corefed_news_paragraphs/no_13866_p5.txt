There would be no " South Carolina South Carolina " Bush Jeb Bush be out of the race     and Steel out of his Jeb Bush as a top adviser     just 10 days later .But my error did not come about because Steel was spinning me ( though , as a    communications guy , there was most certainly an element of that ) .Instead , Steel and I Steel caught in the same vortex , a trap in which we assumed that the absurdity of the previous six months simply had to end at some point .Normalcy would eventually take over .
