my father would respond without missing a beat : " You know , just out here fighting this racism , man . "    My mother worked really hard to ensure that I had black dolls ( of all hues ) black books by black authors , and my personal favorite :a poster from the 1975    Great Kings and Queens of Africa collection ( of course , My mother removed the beer logo ) .   My mother would regularly have me name family members and friends who looked like each of the queens and kings on the poster .
