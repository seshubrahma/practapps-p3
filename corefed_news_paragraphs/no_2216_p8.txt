Youngstown , Ohio and the Iron Range counties in Wisconsin all gave more than 60 percent of the vote to President Obama in 2012 .There are areas like this across the Northern United States   —    from Aberdeen , Wash. and Butte , Mont. to the coasts of Rhode Island and Maine   —    where the Republicans have made marginal or no gains , in no small part because cultural appeals fell flat where there were not many evangelical Christians .
