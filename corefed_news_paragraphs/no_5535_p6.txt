But I have never heard of a case where the rhetoric of a candidate , ambiguous rhetoric to be sure   —    because I do not believe this is a Muslim ban   —   focusing on a country like Iran , the greatest exporter of terrorism , not only no vetting , it sends terrorists this in order to kill Americans .Iran has so Iran blood on its hands of Iran and American allies , to exclude a country like Iran from the Iran would be absurd .And the list   —   although for a different purpose   —    was originally designed by President Obama .
