Cruz won an upset victory over Trump in nearby Idaho Utah with help from the state ’s 19 percent Mormon population and Trump ’s failure to Utah state .It is currently unclear how much , if any , Utah will spend in Donald Trump prior to the March 22 caucus , but the Trump campaign tells Breitbart Utah an announcement of his scheduled events for Donald Trump next week will be made Wednesday afternoon and posted to the campaign ’s website .If that schedule shows several trips to Utah as well as Arizona over the next week , it will be a Utah signal Trump intends to contest the next week Utah , where more than 55 percent of the residents are Mormons , is Utah only state that has a higher percentage of the population that is Mormon than Idaho .Governor Mitt Romney , a Mormon with strong ties to the state where he helped lead the 1998 Winter Olympics out Mormon financial trouble , chose Utah as the venue to make his recent    pronouncement .
