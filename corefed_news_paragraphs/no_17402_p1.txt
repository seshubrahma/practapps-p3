On December 19 , 2016 , a     Turkish police officer named Mevlut Mert Altintas , pulled out a pistol in an art gallery and killed the Russian ambassador to Turkey , Andrey Karlov .Much like in 1914 , the world today is brittle with tensions .Nationalism is on the rise , political ideas are causing ferment .The old order seems to be breaking down .
