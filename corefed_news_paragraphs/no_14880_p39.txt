altogether I try to imagine giving Nowruz to grief as an opportunity to meditate on the horrors of this era .But it ’s hard to commit to even a lack of commitment these days , not knowing what will happen next .   Just as I try to let go of Nowruz , it comes for me .It starts when a neighbor ’s card appears it my door : " Happy 1396 , we are with you , " it says in cursive .
