There is a little something for everyone in Mr. Gapen report from a    perspective ."The 2 . 6 percent increase in wages in the last 12 months is better than the 2 . 3 percent annual increase in 2015 , but it is still less than many    workers would hope to see at this point in the recovery .Still , there are plenty of signs the tighter labor market is finally paying off and producing raises , for workers at both the bottom and the top of the pay scale .
