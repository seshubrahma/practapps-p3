In 2015 , I attended a dinner where current Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a roomful of    that we     along with other minority communities     were not alone , since she was standing with us against hate we and attempts to deprive us of our we .we with Sessions as attorney general , it appears that many communities will be even worse off than if they were standing many communities .It appears that women , people of color , the LGBT community and others have a person in Sessions who actually opposes equal rights for all Americans .
