Thus , while describing Obama as having " done what he [ could ] through executive actions " and Clinton as wanting to go even further if given chance , they lament that the eventual GOP candidate will most certainly stand in the way of more gun control " by portraying the government as intent on trampling gun owners’ rights and confiscating gun owners’ rights firearms ."And it is worth noting that the NYT editorial board accuses GOP candidates of acting this way due to fealty to the " gun lobby " —   which is leftist code talk for NRA , Gun Owners of American , and National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) .But they do not mention the number of campaign stops that gun control proponents Gabby Giffords and Gabby Giffords husband Mark Kelly have done and will do for Clinton .
