Voters thought they were getting a Voters attractive version of Mitt Romney with Kasich , but it turns out they a less attractive version of Mitt Romney with Kasich getting a Voters televangelist version of Ted Cruz .They â€™re also getting Voters less warm and personable version of Hillary Clinton .Last week , Kasich lashed out at Kasich reporter who asked a perfectly appropriate question , going from boring campaign boilerplate to irritated browbeating in about one second flat .As much as I enjoy watching reporters being berated , this was deranged .
