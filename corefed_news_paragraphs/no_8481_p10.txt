You are not going to be looking at a collection of political hacks .You are not going to be looking at the people responsible for the phony Iraq war .You are not going to be looking at people who have been part of the last 30 years of policy failures across the board , whether it â€™s immigration or trade or our fiscal situation .It is time for fresh thinking .
