The CPS also urges prosecutors to watch for hate speech on social media .Prosecutors must also have regard to whether the offence was motivated by any form of discrimination against the victim ’s ethnic or national origin , gender , disability , age , religion or belief , sexual orientation or gender identity or the suspect demonstrated hostility towards the victim based on any of those characteristics .The presence of any such motivation or hostility will mean that it is more likely that prosecution is required .This is in line with other European states’ crackdowns against online hate speech and follows the arrest of a man in Scotland for alleged hate speech against Syrian migrants on Facebook .
