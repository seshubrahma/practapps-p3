I see a the     millions who backed Trump      who empowered white nationalists and won .I see a man who      demanded the removal of nonwhite immigrants and won .I see a      man who pledged war crimes against foreign enemies and won .I      see a man who empowers the likes of Rudy Giuliani and others      who see blacks as potential criminals to control , not citizens      to respect .
