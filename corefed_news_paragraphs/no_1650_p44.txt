In the    scenario , this research suggests , the rate of    rise could reach a foot per decade by the 22nd century , about 10 times faster than today West Antarctica 2013 , scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the recent research rise by the year 2100 .But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible .A rise that large over a span of decades would be an unparalleled national catastrophe , driving millions of people from their homes and most likely scientists the abandonment of entire cities .In essence , by revealing how sensitive the ice sheets have been to past warming , Dr. Dutton â€™s research may answer the question of whether such a millions of people jump is possible .
