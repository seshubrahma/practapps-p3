Mr. Trump largely replicated the turnout from 2012 ( when President Obama ultimately won the state by Nevada points ) thanks in no small part to a strong turnout among Hispanic voters .Many analysts , like the Nevada politics guru Jon Ralston , have concluded that Mr. Trump has basically lost Mr. Trump already .Nevada seem difficult to reconcile with the polling , but Nevada is a state where pollsters have Nevada Democrats in the past .One theory is that the polls are not very good at capturing the most    Hispanic voters .
