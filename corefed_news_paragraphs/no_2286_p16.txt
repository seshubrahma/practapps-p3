Yet the people of Mingo County have forged their own brand the people of Mingo County resilience , one born of the    rural values that draw embattled citizens together .For some , that means planning for a better future : Dr. Dino Beckett , a local physician , has spearheaded initiatives to grow healthy food locally and reduce diabetes .For others , it means lifting a defiant finger to the outside world .At the Regional Church in Delbarton , 10 miles from Williamson , Sunday services were both exuberant and solemn , a mark of the conservative Christianity that holds strong here .
