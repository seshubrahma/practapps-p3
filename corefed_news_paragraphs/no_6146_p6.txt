Dr. Duane Thresher , a climate scientist with a PhD from Columbia University and NASA GISS , has pointed to " publication and funding bias " as a key to understanding how scientific consensus can be manipulated .Although scientists are held up as models of independent thinkers and unbiased seekers of truth , the reality is that they depend on funding scientists more than other professions , since much of their research has no scientists value .Thus , they will study what scientists are funded to scientists .The Obama administration , which doggedly denied that a climate debate even existed , funneled billions of federal dollars into programs and studies that supported its claims , while a climate debate even existed contrary opinions .
