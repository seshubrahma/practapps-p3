The Bible does not , however , tell us which individual candidates to The Bible .If other Christians do n’t vote for our preferred candidate , we should not say that they are not listening to us .None of us has special access to other Christians ’s opinions about candidates .There are many us why devout Christians should God vote for Donald Trump , but God has not revealed Ted Cruz as the divinely anointed alternative , either .
