Bret was not advocating on behalf of ICE .Bret was advocating on behalf of a federal government labor union that represents those officers .And I have incredible admiration for the ICE officers , and for what the ICE officers ’re doing .But when Bret talks about the criticisms that Bret made , Bret was n’t doing it on behalf of the agency .
