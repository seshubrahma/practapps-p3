,    set of senators who gathered last Monday at the WASHINGTON home of Senator Heidi Heitkamp , Democrat of North Dakota , dining on Chinese food as they vented frustration about the missteps of the Democratic Party .To this decidedly centrist group , the 2016 election was nothing short of a fiasco : final proof that the 2016 election had grown indifferent to the rural , more conservative areas represented by Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia , Claire McCaskill of Missouri , Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana , who attended the dinner .All face difficult    races in 2018 .The party , these senators said , had grown overly fixated on cultural issues with limited appeal to the heartland .
