The Cabinet officials wrote back , saying they officials around the country make such arrests and blaming sanctuary officials around the country lack of cooperation with federal law enforcement for needing to make such arrests in public .They wrote that officials unhappy with the arrests should revoke officials around the country sanctuary policies , and they have continued to defend arrests at courthouses as safer officials around the country trying to apprehend people in environments without the security of courthouses .   The US Commission on Civil Rights noted , though , that courthouse arrests have happened even in places without sanctuary policies , and it argued that arresting witnesses and    community members at The US Commission on Civil Rights will make it less likely that undocumented immigrants will report crimes or agree to testify in cases .   " The fair administration of justice requires equal access to our courthouses , " commission Chairwoman Catherine Lhamon said in the statement .
