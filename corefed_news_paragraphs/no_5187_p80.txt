I wrote Identity politics piece in 2015 America " Identity politics Wars " that chronicled the way different groups within the leftist movement will fight each other over the next decade .Some of them have the groups it pretends to care true !One of the battles I foresaw was intersectional feminists versus white feminists .That has already started , with white women at the women â€™s march being told to shut up and learn their place .
