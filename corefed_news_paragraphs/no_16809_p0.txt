  ( CNN )Hillary Clinton emerges from the first presidential debate with a    lead over Donald Trump in the race for the presidency , having narrowed the enthusiasm gap between Hillary Clinton supporters and Donald Trump ’s , and holding broad advantages over the Republican nominee as the candidate with the right temperament and preparation for the job , according to a new    poll .The survey finds Clinton topping Donald Trump 47 % to 42 % among likely voters with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson at 7 % and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 2 % .   Clinton ’s boost in the race stems largely from gains on Donald Trump among men ( from a    deficit with that group in early September to just a    one now ) and sharply increased support from independents , who broke heavily in Donald Trump ’s favor in the early September poll but now tilt Clinton , 44 % to 37 % .
