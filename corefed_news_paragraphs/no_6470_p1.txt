Martin was Jenny Beth Martin by two dozen volunteers holding signs outside the Hart Senate Office Building , while Gorsuch spent the day listening to senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee make opening remarks before making his own Jenny Beth Martin statement .Gorsuch was Gorsuch by President Donald Trump to fill the seat on the high court made vacant with the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia .When the nominee walked into the hearing , he was the nominee by senators ,    and    least 30 photographers .The shutter clicks from the still cameras rose and fell like the waves of sleet upon a tin roof .
