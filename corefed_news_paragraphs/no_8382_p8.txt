How tough conditions are for U. S.   industry is strongly determined by international trade agreements —   those administered by the World Trade Organization and deals struck with individual countries .The Obama Administration heralded the U. S.   Free Trade Agreement as creating " countless new opportunities for U. S. U. S.   sell more     goods , services and agricultural products to Korean customers   —    and to support more good jobs here at home . "Since implemented in 2012 , imports from Korea have risen much more than exports , and the bilateral trade deficit is up about $ 16 billion —   destroying 130 , 000    American jobs .Now the Obama Administration is making similarly fanciful claims to win congressional approval for a    Partnership .
