The problem , as Bruce Schneier , a security expert who has written often on the issue , noted in an interview , is that the usual triggers for a recount   —    a very close margin between two candidates   —    make little sense in a world of    computer hackings .A truly sophisticated hacking would result in a wider margin of victory that would not set off an automatic recount .Mrs. Clinton would have to triumph in all three states to win the Electoral College .The electors will meet in December to formally choose the president .
