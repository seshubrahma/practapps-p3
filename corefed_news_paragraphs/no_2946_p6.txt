The Massachusetts law , which will go into effect in July 2018 , takes other steps as well to combat pay discrimination .Companies will not be allowed to prohibit workers from telling others how much they Companies paid , a move that proponents say can increase salary transparency and help employees discover disparities .And the law will require equal pay not just for workers whose jobs are alike , but also for those whose work is of " comparable character " or who work in " comparable operations ."
