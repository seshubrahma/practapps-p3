The current systematic murdering , torture , enslavement , kidnapping , raping and persecution of religious and ethnic minorities in territories dominated by the Islamic State constitutes the very same type of evil that we like to comfortably pretend is confined to only history books .Each time a    fanatic group is finally beaten down , we view the remains and repeat the promise of " Never Again " articulated at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1946 .   And each time , we break the promise of "Never Again" articulated at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1946 anew by waiting too long and not working hard enough at we commitment to prevent genocide or crimes against humanity .Labeling is far from enough , but it Labeling an important first step .
