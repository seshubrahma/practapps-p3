Stanley McChrystal , a commander of US troops and International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan , told CNN .   " It is deciding we ’re going to push the clock further , we are going to stay involved longer , we are going to engage the American people and the Afghan people .That ’s a presidential level decision that he has to own , " McChrystal said of Trump .    Mattis told lawmakers Thursday that the President had delegated he the authority " to turn the numbers up and down as necessary " after months of discussion .
