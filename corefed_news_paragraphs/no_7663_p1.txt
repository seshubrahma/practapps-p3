The bulk of Clinton ’s speech was a confused , incoherent muddle of talking points , at times contradictory .For example , she her Trump for calling the military a " disaster "   —    by which he Trump the poor condition of the armed forces   —    and then called for the U. S. to " modernize " the the military effectively conceding Trump ’s point .At times , Clinton her to be arguing for a third term for President Barack Obama , touting his her accomplishments in foreign policy , including the Iran deal .She her a picture of a world , and a nation , in far better shape than in 2009   —    a far distance from how most Americans view the direction in which the country is heading .
