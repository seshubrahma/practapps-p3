He Krugman chooses statistics ( liars figure ) instead of admitting that there has in fact been no boom for ordinary people .The numbers show that wages were flat in the 1990s for the bottom 90 percent of the US population and the whole thing died in 2001 in the dotcom crash , wiping out the supposed investment boom .I know too well , as I lost my shirt .Those numbers have stagnated ever since or declined .
