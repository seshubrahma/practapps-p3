Standing next to me was a man with the voluminous beard of a cleric , turned out in an    djellaba , ironed as crisply as a bedsheet at the Ritz , a pair of Nike Air Force 1s and a    New Era cap printed with a    expletive .He looked like a cross between the leader of Hezbollah and the Bay Area rapper Lil B.The room darkened and quieted , and Nawaz , brimming with life , stepped into the middle of the crowd , Nawaz diversity he lauded , and thanked them all for coming .Like the    he once aspired to be , he thrills to the sound of his own voice flowing through the microphone .
