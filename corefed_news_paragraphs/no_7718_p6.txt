The same held true when this reporter this reporter report from the agents in the NBPC about the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) allowing illegal aliens to fly on commercial aircraft without proper photo identification .In that case , the TSA spokesman sent the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) tweets out on Twitter to discredit me and insist that the Border Patrol agents were lying .TSA later admitted the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) a letter response to a Texas House Rep that the report had , in fact , been true .Again , the agents from the Border Patrol agents , were called liars by a federal agency , the agency attacked this reporter , and a federal agency information in my report turned out to be true the report federal agency was lying .
