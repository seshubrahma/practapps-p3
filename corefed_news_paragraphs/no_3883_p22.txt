Critics insist that Schumer ’s hypocrisy here was shameless , because during the Obama years , when Democrats narrowly held Republicans Senate , for a while Republicans followed the Democrats’ new standard , and filibustered a couple of President Barack Obama ’s nominees .Crying    indignation , in 2013 Sen. Harry Reid ( ) Dick Durbin ( ) the Senate ( ) and Schumer created a parliamentary ruling that the filibuster rule , Senate Rule XXII , did not apply to any presidential nominees , except that the ruling did not explicitly cover the Senate Supreme Court .During this time , Schumer gave Schumer’s passionate speech about how preventing an     vote on judicial nominees was profoundly undemocratic , the Supreme Court on the constitutional order .So Democrats created that precedent on November 21 Schumer 2013 , one that did not address the Supreme Court simply because there was no Supreme Court vacancy at the time .
