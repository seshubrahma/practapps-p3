She promised to Mrs. Clinton the country in a new direction with " smart " foreign policies designed to make the U. S. more secure and the world more free and peaceful .Some significant examples of where those policies led to and how she handled her Mrs. Clinton of Mrs. Clinton duties follow :Ironically , Secretary Clinton and her allies are Mrs. Clinton to voters in campaign ads , on the campaign trail , and in media that her prime presidential Mrs. Clinton , Donald Trump , is advocating dangerous policies that would harm the U. S. and world and therefore is unfit to lead this great nation .Time will tell whether American voters will look through that smokescreen and see the harm that President Obama and Secretary Clinton " smart " foreign policies may have done to U. S. and global peace and security , and how she behaved in office .
