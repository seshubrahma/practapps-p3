Washington ( CNN )Democrats are n’t finished with Attorney General Jeff Sessions , and Democrats ’re using the Senate confirmation hearing for his potential second in command as an opportunity to grill his on the Trump campaign ’s potential ties to Russia and the President’s baseless claim of being wiretapped by his predecessor .   Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee pressed Rod J. Rosenstein , President Donald Trump ’s nominee for deputy attorney general , almost exclusively on the Russia investigation and whether Sessions told the truth in his own confirmation hearing when his said his had not met with any Russian officials .
