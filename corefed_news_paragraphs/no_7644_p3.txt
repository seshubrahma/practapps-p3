Ann Coulter ( @AnnCoulter )March 12 , 2016 ,   Cruz suggested Trump ’s campaign " bears responsibility " for violent protesters threatening Donald Trump and Donald Trump supporters , as social media revealed images of a policeman bleeding from Donald Trump head and anecdotes of peaceful attendees terrorized by agitators .As reported by Breitbart ’s Katie McHugh , this statement angered many Cruz supporters : " I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment , when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence   —    to punch people in the face .The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates and today is unlikely to be the last such instance .
