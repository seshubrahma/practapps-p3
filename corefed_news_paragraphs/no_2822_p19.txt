Stone wanted nothing Stone do with another political docudrama .He spent two Stone trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground , only to see " Selma " get made to critical acclaim .Then there was the My Lai massacre film .Merrill Lynch put up cash , Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an Stone village in Thailand .
