Presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , the Globes have a reputation as a freewheeling affair , where booze flows and gaffes are embraced .What emerged overall , however , was tedious and dull , as NBC dispensed with any pretense of edginess by tapping the Globes    host , Jimmy Fallon , to emcee the telecast , insuring there would n’t be any of those uncomfortable moments that , say , Ricky Gervais doled out in the past .Given Hollywood ’s liberal bent , such showcases have become closely watched targets by conservatives .And while Jimmy Fallon ’s few monologue jokes at Trump ’s expense     including one comparing Jimmy Fallon to " Game of Thrones’ " King Joffrey     were tepid at best , the otherwise drab show was punctuated by political moments that dribbled out over the night .
