After almost 100 days of Donald Trump , the contrast could not have been more striking .Donald Trump ’s first    months in office have been largely defined by a flair for the dramatic and an absolute conviction that the course Trump’s is charting     even if Trump’s changes course      is the right one .There is very little in the way of philosophical conversation about what binds us     and ails us     as a country .It ’s full speed ahead at all times no BS     or       allowed .
