When I was a little girl , for example , I was n’t allowed to call my father at work unless it was an emergency .I was told he did n’t need any distractions from home .Even after becoming chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court , that accommodation was never afforded me , however my father either by my children , my husband or my mother     who told me not to bother my father !   I was expected to handle familial obligations while at work and still keep pace with my male peers .
