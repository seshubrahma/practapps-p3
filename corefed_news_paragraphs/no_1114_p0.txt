In the escalating rhetoric of public shaming , being embarrassed online is tantamount to being wiped from the face of the earth .Whenever a    host upbraids a public figure in a monologue or a pundit bests another in a Twitter fight , onlookers crowd around to declare the loser DESTROYED ! or EVISCERATED ! or ETHERED ! or ANNIHILATED !But alongside these symbols of destruction has risen another , more apt metaphor for the dynamics of the modern media power play .In this one , the defeated party was nâ€™t killed , but possessed : the defeated party got OWNED .
