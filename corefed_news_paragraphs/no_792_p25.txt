For Mr. Trump , he said we intend Mr. Trump fight terrorism and win .And there ’s an underlying trope or assumption there that one can win militarily , which I do n’t think is possible , and I do n’t think the military thinks is possible .He spoke of people Mr. Trump were ignored by the media or silenced by special interests , and then he pulled up a Mr. Trump of people whose relations have been killed by immigrant felons , and it was to me, I found it a kind of grotesque mischaracterization of the way the country is .
