That opportunity to be part of history had drawn many voters to Barack Obama , and it would be a    argument for Hillary Clinton also .A rational Republican voter , looking at the extended GOP field in late 2015 , could be forgiven for deciding that none of these characters , regardless of these characters qualifications , could be counted upon to defeat Hillary Clinton   â€”    and , more important , to defeat the media , which would doubtless be pushing as hard for Hillary Clinton victory as these characters could .Trump alone had seized the popular imagination , and for that reason alone , Trump alone stood out : Trump alone was a risky choice , but perhaps only a risk would do .The silver lining is that a Trump alone loss does not mean a loss for conservatism in general or the Republican Party in particular .
