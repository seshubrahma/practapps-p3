So as we step back and think about cities in    America , we can see long trends : first , the trend of suburbanization , as whites ( and others ) fled crime in the cities .And second , the trend of gentrification , as the young and the affluent moved back downtown .Yet if the crime surge continues , we â€™re now on the edge of a third long trend :   .Yes , the suburbs are as " boring " as they ever were , but personal safety is not boring .
