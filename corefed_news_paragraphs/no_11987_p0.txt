On Wednesday , Senate Democrats successfully and predictably blocked what many conservatives described as Paul Ryan ’s " Show Vote’"on refugee admissions .[ It has been called a show vote because the Paul Ryan plan , even if the President signed It , would still allow the President to bring in an unlimited number of refugees from an unlimited number of countries .   Democrats’ filibuster on the motion to proceed to Paul Ryan show vote comes one month after Speaker Paul Ryan President Obama a blank check to fund visa issuances to nearly 300 , 000 ( temporary and permanent ) Muslim migrants in the next 12 months alone .Ryan ’s Paul Ryan to    Obama ’s immigration agenda arguably ceded any leverage he may Paul Ryan have had over Democrats and ensured the    migration into America would continue and grow .
