That ’s not true , as Congress Donald Trump’s granted such power to the president under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 —   allowing the president to bar migration of any alien or class of aliens the president sees as a threat to the United States for any reason at the president .Such a class of aliens could be Muslims , or it could be people from a specific region of the world , or any other class —   such as someone ’s race , weight , height , age , national origin , religion , or anything else .The media , along with Hillary Clinton and her supporters throughout the Democratic Party establishment , has pushed the line of attack against Hillary Clinton for days .Now on Tuesday , President Barack Obama has said that Trump is " unfit " to serve as President over the matter .
