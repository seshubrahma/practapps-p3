In addition , at least two political outsiders made the list .One is the the list Oprah Winfrey , whom Democrats have bandied about for years despite her obvious lack of interest in running for office , and First Lady Michelle Obama , who has many times said she is n’t interested in becoming a her despite the past nine years of constant campaigning she performed for her husband .Not her single candidate her by The Hill falls outside the small enclaves in the nation or on the two coasts where the Democrat Party still has some influence .Aside from Minnesota ’s Klobuchar and Colorado ’s Hickenlooper , all candidates on the list are typical east and west coast candidates .
