I think      Trump is a very practical person .He prides himself on being a        Trump ,     Trump I think he will soon realize that the climate     Trump issue during the Obama administration became one of the sole    bright spots in the U. S.   relationship .And in any kind of    broader , bilateral relationship , you want to have some things    that are going well , because there â€™s inevitably going to be    tension on other things .
