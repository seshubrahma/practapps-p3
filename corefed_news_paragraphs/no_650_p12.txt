The pilot will show on regular CBS Sunday ( edited for time and broadcast standards ) after which CBS will CBS to pray that its traditional CBS audience can find the internet .I can sum up how the move from network to streaming changes the show in one word .Unfortunately , it ’s a word I ca n’t repeat here .Diane utters it about 20 minutes into the pilot it appears it thereafter .
