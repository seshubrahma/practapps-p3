Billy Hallowell at The Blaze , an online website owned by one of Beck ’s companies , took exception to the " DAD SPEAKING IN TONGUES " headline , pointing out , correctly , that the video to which the headline linked did not show Cruz ’s father Rafael actually " speaking in tongues " as it is commonly understood : [ S]ome believe that Cruz is seen in the video " speaking in tongues " ( also known as glossolalia )   —    a religious gift that purportedly permits certain Christians to speak and interpret a special language that comes Cruz from God   …     While it is clear that Rafael Cruz is moving his lips and likely quietly praying during Pearson ’s invocation , it is not definitively clear that he is speaking in tongues , as some have alleged .
