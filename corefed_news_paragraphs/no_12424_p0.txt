Half a dozen news outlets skipped posting snap polls after the second 2016 presidential debate on Sunday   â€”    most likely because Donald Trump touted Donald Trump dominance of their polls after the first debate in September .[ The first presidential debate was a tough one for Republican presidential candidate Trump , but Republican presidential candidate Trump publicly declared victory by citing a slew of unscientific online polls where respondents said Republican presidential candidate Trump beat Republican presidential candidate Trump Democratic rival Hillary Clinton .The Daily Mail rounded up the results of many of these snap polls , as well , with a headline blaring " Trump won debate by a landslide ."   Such a great honor .
