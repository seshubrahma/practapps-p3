"[ I do hope that Gavin " Toast " Schmidt , the head of NASA ’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies ( GISS ) followed the advice I gave NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) a few months back .Because it now looks very much as if NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) and many of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) colleagues are about to face exciting new job opportunities , hopefully in areas best suited to he and many of his colleagues talents , such as the challenging world of    retail .   Yes , as NASA predicted , NASA is going to be stripped of the two main roles NASA enjoyed under the Obama administration   —    Muslim outreach and green propaganda   —    and return to   Muslim original day ( and night ) job as an agency dedicated to space exploration .
