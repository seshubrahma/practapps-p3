’s not worth to stay it if their kids can not get an education and they can not get work .In terms of rounding up those who do remain , you can give local police additional resources in terms of money and manpower .If they ’re it overwhelmed many illegals then they could use the new officers many illegals after the immigration problem is finished or at least reduced .I do see the need to prevent the rise of an SS sort of force , so you could try using the military to assist they especially those trained as MPs , or various    contractors that would not be unionized and could be disbanded after the crisis and find new employment .
