Seems fairly simple .Not only that , American citizens give birth to American citizens , whether here or abroad .That ’s not only common sense , it is the law .And think about it for a moment   —    if you follow their stupid argument , babies born of American citizens serving abroad in our military would be    citizens ineligible to run for president .
