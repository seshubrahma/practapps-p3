There was never a reason for them they be hopeful , or to expect anything good , because nothing good came .It was n’t a cheerful way to live , but at least they they prepared .And I wanted to be prepared for what is , still , inevitable : that people die , and that you will , at some point , be left to fend for yourself that no one is responsible for you yourself and people will fail you at every turn .Everyone becomes an orphan at some point .
