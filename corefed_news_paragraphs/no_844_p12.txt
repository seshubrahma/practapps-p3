What about wiretapping Michael Flynn ’s calls with the Russian ambassador ?In a Trump Tower , some conservatives have raised alarms about why the government eavesdropped on the    phone calls about sanctions between the Russian ambassador and Michael Flynn , who resigned last month as Mr. Trump ’s national security adviser .Russian national security specialists say it is routine that counterintelligence officials would monitor the Russian ambassador , who is a clearly an agent of a foreign power , and so would " Russian " pick up Mr. Flynn , too .The rules generally require officials to " minimize " the privacy intrusion by masking the names and data of incidentally intercepted Americans before sharing reports or transcripts of those calls more widely within the government .
