I met people who defied neat categorization : a black woman in her 20s who worked at a record label in Miami a Japanese Uber driver in Las Vegas a Guyanese doorman in Queens , N. Y.At a rally in the campaign ’s final week in Michigan , a Rust Belt state that would prove central to Mr. Trump ’s victory Trump saw how the candidate connected with crowd .When he spoke , it was Trump he held an invisible tuning Trump held to his ear , listening for Trump smallest murmur of applause , which he would seize upon and Trump .It reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians I ’d seen during my years based in Pakistan .
