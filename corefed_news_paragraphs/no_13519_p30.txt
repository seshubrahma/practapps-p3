Everyone read LIFE magazine , listened to Jack Benny on the radio , and then later watched Ed Sullivan together , every single Sunday night .All Americans watched the moon landing , were traumatized when Kennedy was shot and supported the troops .But today , with a billion cable channels , and specialty magazines on everything from bridal gowns to automatic rifles , and a wildly heterogeneous population , there ’s not a whole lot that brings us together .It ’s pretty much down to the Super Bowl , the Muslim ban , and , as of Tuesday night , loathing Hillary Clinton .
