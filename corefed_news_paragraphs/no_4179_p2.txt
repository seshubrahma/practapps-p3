If cities really want to protect immigrants , they cities really want to protect immigrants also end the    style of policing that makes immigrants the victims of unnecessary arrests and disproportionate punishment .Many of these unnecessary arrests stem from the discredited idea that a draconian crackdown on the most minor offenses   —    littering , selling loose cigarettes , biking on the sidewalk   —    will prevent more serious crimes .This model of policing , known as broken windows or zero tolerance , helped to drive mass incarceration .Its next cost could be mass deportation .
