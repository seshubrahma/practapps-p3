I want to be very clear there , although I have many Republican friends .Where I live , if you do n’t have Republican friends , you do n’t have any friends .We ’ve got a lot of work to do to our party to return it to the days of Jacksonian We   —    where social justice , and economic fairness , and individual liberties run at the top .
