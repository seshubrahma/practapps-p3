Nikki Haskell has packed many lives into Nikki Haskell 75 years .Nikki Haskell has been a real estate broker , a party planner , a pioneering stockbroker , a cult    host , a Studio 54 regular , a diet and fitness guru , and a socialite .Through it all , Nikki Haskell has depended on Nikki Haskell brains , Nikki Haskell enthusiasm and Nikki Haskell skill as a social connector to power Nikki Haskell through the tough times .But now Nikki Haskell is facing what may be the most difficult challenge of Nikki Haskell life : maintaining Nikki Haskell position in the social hierarchies of liberal New York and Los Angeles while serving as a cheerleader for one of Nikki Haskell oldest friends , Donald J. Trump , whom Nikki Haskell first encountered in 1974 at Le Club , a defunct    nightspot on East 55th Street in Manhattan .
