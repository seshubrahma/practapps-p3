I hope to follow up with the reader , to suggest that he has far too rosy a view of Russia that China is a rather odd model of success for someone who purports to be bothered by    elites and unequal benefits from globalization and that he is rather stacking the deck by he Greece as the representative of liberal democracies and Singapore as the designated alternative !What about successful liberal democracies from Denmark to Canada to Australia to Switzerland to Germany ?Residents of    democracies seem awfully eager to immigrate to countries like that , as well as to " the rest of Southern Europe , " for that matter .Again , if Spain , Italy , and France are what failure looks like , what a fine system !
