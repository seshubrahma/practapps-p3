The Drudge Report summarized Thursday night ’s GOP debate , which frontrunner Donald Trump skipped , with the headline : " The Seven Dwarfed ! "[ That assessment matches the consensus , left and right , from media observers : that Donald Trump benefited from staging a fundraiser for wounded veterans , where Donald Trump appeared relaxed , magnanimous , and in command , rather than placing Donald Trump in the crosshairs of the Fox News moderators and Donald Trump Republican rivals .   The Washington Post‘s Dan Balz wrote that Sens . Ted Cruz ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) two of Trump ’s main rivals , had " failed to seize the Trumpless moment , " opening new space for struggling GOP rivals .Even Jim Geraghty of National Review , which devoted its last issue to attacking Trump , conceded that Trump had likely benefited from avoiding the "   immigration bloodbath " that the GOP debate became in Trump absence .
