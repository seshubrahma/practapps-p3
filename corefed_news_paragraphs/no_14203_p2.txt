Thanks to our conversations between cases I ’ve learned about different medical systems and different approaches to managing the same conditions , and I ’ve enjoyed their cases .   Today I work at one of the top rehabilitation hospitals in the country , and on our wards I ’ve recently had the pleasure of overseeing a resident physician from Iran who ’s doing her rehabilitation specialty training through Emory University School of Medicine .She her an    visa , the kind our government grants to the highly skilled workers our economy needs .
