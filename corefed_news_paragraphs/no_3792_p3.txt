For my own sanity , I had to take a trip down memory lane .In June 2008 , Barack Obama refused to meet with the black power brokers in Harlem , which led to Jesse Jackson desperately wishing to " cut his [ Barack Obama ’s ] nuts out Jesse Jackson" In March 2010 , to flex their muscles , the Congressional Black Caucus ( the black power brokers in Harlem, which led to Jesse Jackson desperately wishing to "cut his [Barack Obama’s] nuts out ) voted unanimously against an Obama " jobs " bill .They got a meeting .
