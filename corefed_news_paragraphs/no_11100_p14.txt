Other documents obtained by Judicial Watch show that the United States was also complicit with arms shipments from Benghazi to the jihadi rebel groups in Syria .These particular shipments were distinct from the more Syria case arms shipments from Benghazi , a Libyan fishing vessel that arrived in Iskanderiyah , Turkey , crammed with weapons in late August 2012 .The shipments described in this recently declassified document were sent directly to small Syrian ports under rebel control and included RPG    sniper rifles , and ammunition for 125 mm and 155 mm howitzers .As I revealed two years ago , the U. S. backed arms shipments to ISIS and its allies in Syria appear to have been run out of the ISIS House by    advisor ( and current CIA director )
