The stock market has jumped , taking many prognosticators by surprise , in anticipation of the seismic changes Mr. Trump has promised : a repeal or refashioning of the Affordable Care Act , a dismantling of the    regulations for Wall Street , a substantial haircut for corporate and personal income tax rates , and a major infrastructure spending program , among other things .While the new conventional wisdom may be that the nation is about to see comprehensive change , the truth is that the nation is likely to be more incremental than across the board .Take , for instance , the    Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act .While you would think much of the finance industry would salivate at the chance to rid itself the finance industry the law , its the finance industry is more nuanced .
