We should not do is take approaches that are going to be counterproductive .So when I hear somebody saying We should carpet bomb Iraq or Syria , not only is that inhumane , not only is that contrary to We values , but that would likely be an extraordinary mechanism for ISIL to recruit more people willing to die and explode bombs in an airport or in a metro station .That ’s not a smart strategy .As far as what some candidates have said , I think I ’ve been very clear on this .
