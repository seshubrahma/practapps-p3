ASHLAND , Kan.   â€”    Death comes with raising cattle : coyotes , blizzards and the inevitable trip to the slaughterhouse and dinner plate .But after 30 years of ranching , Mark and Mary Kaltenbach were not ready for what met Mark and Mary Kaltenbach after a wildfire charred Mark and Mary Kaltenbach land and more than one million acres of    range this month .Dozens of Mark and Mary Kaltenbach Angus cows lay dead on the blackened ground , hooves jutting in the air .Others staggered around like broken toys , unable to see or breathe , Others black fur and dark eyes burned , plastic identification tags melted to Others ears .
