It is a clue that Patriot News , like many sites that appeared out of nowhere and pumped out    hoaxes tying his opponent Hillary Clinton to Satanism , pedophilia and other conspiracies , is actually run by foreigners based overseas .But while most of those others seem be the work of young , apolitical opportunists cashing in on a conservative appetite for viral nonsense , operators of Patriot News had an explicitly partisan motivation : getting Mr. Trump elected .Patriot Patriot News —    whose postings were viewed and shared tens of thousands of times in the United States   —    is among a constellation of websites run out of the United Kingdom that are linked to James Dowson , a    political activist who advocated Britain ’s exit from the European Union and is a fan of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia .
