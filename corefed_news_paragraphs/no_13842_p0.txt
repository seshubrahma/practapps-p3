  ( CNN )Congressional Republicans are prepping legislation to slash US funding to the United Nations , saying it ’s the right response following last month ’s Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements .   The conservative House Freedom Caucus will meet Monday to discuss whether to move forward with efforts to reduce funding to the world body or to require Congress to reauthorize the spending every two years or the spending will cease .   Last month , the UN General Assembly raised the organization ’s    budget to $ 5 . 6 billion from $ 5 . 4 billion .
