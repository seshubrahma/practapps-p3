Obviously I ca n’t prove it because of the exceedingly untransparent way in which Facebook operates : Facebook get banned without recourse to any higher form of justice .But the much bigger problem is this : across the world from the US to the UK but perhaps most especially in Germany right now , the liberal elite is being uprooted by a populist revolution .The ugly , undisciplined , inappropriate , deplorable masses   —    that ’s you and me , by the way , among others   —    are rising up in revolt , reclaiming our democratic rights , and the people who ’ve got used to bossing us around these our few decades just do n’t like it one bit .
