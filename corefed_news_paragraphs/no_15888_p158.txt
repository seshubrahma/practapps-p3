We had people in the first base dugout who were screaming into their telephones that we were under attack and to send help immediately .And I think that was because of the concern that our security detail may be outgunned .    people , it is pistols versus rifle .And it seemed to take forever for local law enforcement officials to figure out that we were under attack and to get reinforcements in time to be    assistance .
