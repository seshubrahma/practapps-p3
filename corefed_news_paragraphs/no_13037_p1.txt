I have seen one in every previous election I have covered , but in every one I have seen before the leader on the stage tries to lower the temperature , not raise the stage .Do you ever consider whether you should be trying to lower the temperature when protests on the campaign trail erupt ?TRUMP :I think in many cases I do lower the the temperature I tell the police , please take it easy when people are punching the police the police to hurt people .
