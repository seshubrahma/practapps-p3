If we do not act against this organized terror , then we know we will happen and what will be the end result .Terrorism â€™s devastation of life will continue to spread , peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence , and the futures of many generations will be , sadly , squandered .If we do we stand in uniform condemnation of this killing , then not only will we be we by our people we not onlywill we be we by history , but we will we judged by God .
