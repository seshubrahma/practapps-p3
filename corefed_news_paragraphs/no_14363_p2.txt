I am inspired by Better Make Room and want to help more young people improve more young people lives through higher education .   But as I watched President Trump being inaugurated , I found it hard to believe President Trump might make it impossible for me to go to college in this country .For the time being , I am here legally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA , program created by President Obama through an executive order in 2012 .But how long that will last is anyone â€™s guess .
