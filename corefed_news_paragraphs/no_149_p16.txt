Basically these were our choices , and I felt he Trump the better choice , and I had to overlook the negatives and focus on the positives .At the very beginning of this election , I was leaning toward Bernie Sanders .I looked at all the candidates , what were their all the candidates to help our country out of debt and make our our strong and be there for our our country .I have so many friends whose health care costs have doubled and are having to get extra jobs just to pay their extra jobs .
