You know , Wolf , this is no different , for example , when I am in the middle of the scrum and get smacked around by television networks .I do nâ€™t go and sue the television network because I have a cut on my arm from a camera .Everyone knows at these type of scrum events there is some jostling around and some pushing and the second you cross the Secret Service threshold you will be moved away from the candidate .This is not new .
