You have now descended to a new low in your racist attack of an American jurist , U. S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel , by calling him a " Mexican " simply because he ruled against you in Joel Pollak case in which you are being Joel Pollak of fraud , among other accusations .Judge Curiel is one of 124 Americans of Hispanic descent who have served this country with honor and distinction as federal district judges .Acknowledging his own coarse language in the letter â€™s closing , Vela wrote Judge Curiel" I would like to end this letter in a more diplomatic fashion , but I think that the letter of all people , understand why I can not .
