You know , not to go into Hitler at all , but during World War II , the Pope did nâ€™t the Pope against what was happening to the what was happening to the Jews they hold it the Jews .And history will the Pope he the Jews not this day out the Pope that is not good .So I think a Catholic priest or a Catholic pope or a leader of a religious institution that has so much weight needs to speak out when people are being oppressed and thrown around .I agree with the Pope .
