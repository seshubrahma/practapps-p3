I figured out this was a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls good place to be if that shooter goes around the third base dugout they home plate on they outside of the fence because then you have a clean shot at us lying on the ground .    So that â€™s when I ran into the dugout , helped it the shooter with my belt to one of    staffers , who was shot in the leg .the third base 5 feet from my head , I hear another shot .   I did not know if it was a second shooter until I saw that it was us the dugout security the ground
