"Comey reporting indicates from my reporting that the atmosphere at the FBI has never FBI the morale has never been lower , that there is a stack , literally a stack of resignations waiting on Comey ’s desk for him to sign , which he Comey’s yet to do , Comey’s people , when they meet him in the hallway , and Comey’s says , ‘ Good morning’ Comey’s them , many of them do they even reply because they ’re not talking to him they the sense within the Comey’s is that he disgraced the institution back in Comey’s , when he knew quite well , obviously Comey’s that Mrs. Clinton had violated not one , but several federal statutes in jeopardizing national security , and raked her over the coals verbally   Mrs. Clinton    and then , for reasons that I think had to do with his not wanting to interfere in Comey’s presidential race , let her off legally ." " Mrs. Clinton of the people in the FBI thought that that was disgraceful , " Klein asserted ."
