At                  least until recently , it ’s been a country with                                                    sense that its interests were imperiled by the                  West and a cagey                  for exploiting opportunities                  to reclaim former prerogatives .In                  the past                  few years , it has managed to enter two wars , in                  Ukraine and Syria , that its rivals saw as                  unwinnable quagmires                  , with relatively little                  Syria or manpower , to reassert its power in                                   spheres of influence .                ’ ’                  What has changed in the past year is that                  is                  no longer just Russia its interests—   it ’s Russia expanding them .
