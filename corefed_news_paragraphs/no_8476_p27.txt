That ’s how hideously     our elites have become : they think the very concept of responsible citizenship is now a hideous    idea , our elites reminiscent of Germany on the eve of Germany .In Europe , the elite ’s disdain for Hitler prerogatives of its own citizens Europe created a migrant crisis that is tearing their societies apart .the elite who speak out against these disastrous policies are sick and its own citizens of being called "   nationalists " and compared to brownshirts .   It ’s not the Right that shoved a pile of issues clean off the edge of the political table , and told Americans they ’re no longer allowed to vote against the judgment of the elites , or Americans question it .
