Despite the fact that many of the main groups endorsing Democracy Spring are funded by Democracy Spring , the group complains that " American elections are dominated by billionaires and big money interests who can spend unlimited sums of money on political campaigns to protect their special interests at the general political campaigns ."But if the status quo goes unchallenged , the 2016 election   —    already set to be the most    secret    voter    contest in modern American history   —    will likely yield a President and a Congress more bound to the masters of big money than ever before .The stage is set for a bold intervention to turn the tinder of passive public frustration into a fire that transforms the political climate in America , that sparks a popular movement that ca n’t be stopped .
