I was first diagnosed before Obamacare , and I had only purchased my policy a few months beforehand .Insurance was expensive , my income limited , and I did n’t consider me at risk .I was a    bicycling vegan health nut who neither drank nor smoked , meditated regularly and did all the perfect things I ’dlearned to do to prevent cancer .
