Later on Thursday , Trump   saying that the judge presiding over the Trump University fraud trial   —    reminder : Trump   is a defendant in the fraud trial   —    could not be impartial because he Trump   of " Mexican heritage " and a member of a Latino lawyers ’’ association.’" I do not believe this timing was a coincidence , or an unforced error on Trump Trump   part .I believe it was a deliberate tactic designed to change the subject   —    one that could work .
