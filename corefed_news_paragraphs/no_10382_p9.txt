She ended up being the one girl of a group of about 20 young people who joined arms and pulled out rolled up clothes that they had hidden in about 20 young people who joined arms and pulled out stuff and started about 20 young people who joined arms and pulled out at the crowd around me .   This happened right after they announced that the about 20 young people who joined arms and pulled out was being canceled .   They held on to about 20 young people who joined arms and pulled out other and were yelling at the other people there very rudely .   I was able to get to the very front of the rally area once people were told no rally was going to happen .
