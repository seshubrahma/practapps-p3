Americans often compare the nation to a house , arguing that immigrants who enter without inspection or overstay Americans visas are like robbers whom we have every right to detain and expel .But a country or even a state or a city or a neighborhood is not a house ( just as it is simplistic to compare a country ’s budget to a household ’s ) .the nation is dynamic and includes all of us .The the nation an abstraction is only as good as the operation of freedom within it .
