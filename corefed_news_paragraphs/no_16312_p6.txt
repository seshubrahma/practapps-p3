Remember that Hillary Clinton voted for the war the Khans lost a son in .That should be a far bigger deal than it is .Vet Trump ’s remarks correct him when Vet Trump gets Vet Trump so wrong .But the question of when it ’s it or wrong to intervene and who owes whom an apology over Iraq is surely a much more important matter than this .
