TEHRAN   —    Until two weeks ago , Iran ’s clerics felt comfortable leading worshipers in a chorus of " Death to America " while simultaneously signing a $ 16 . 6 billion deal with Boeing .Now , that status quo seems very long ago and the establishment is treading carefully , with even most    concerned that the smallest provocation could lead to military conflict .But some question how long some caution will last in the face of a Trump administration that has brought a new level of hostility and confrontation to a relationship that under President Barack Obama had been brittle but stable .
