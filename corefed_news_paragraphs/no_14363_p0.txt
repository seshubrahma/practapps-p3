  ( CNN )I am one of an estimated 750 , 000 Dreamers , undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children , now facing possible deportation by President Donald Trump .I worry that the President     whose grandfather , mother and wife all immigrated to the United States     will turn my dream into a nightmare and throw me out of the land where I grew up .A few weeks ago I felt like I was dreaming when I was at a White House event   and met first lady Michelle Obama .
