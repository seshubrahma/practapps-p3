Democratic strategist and CNN commentator Hilary Rosen noted that the margins in battleground states where Clinton lost were relatively close , making the discussion about what to do even more complex .   Many Democrats were stunned by the fact that Clinton Clinton Trump were separated by only about a percentage point in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin â€”   and the race in Michigan still looks even closer than Clinton .Sanders supporters noted it was hard to imagine him losing states like that in the Industrial Midwest .( Obama won Michigan , which is still too close to call , by 9 . 5 Sanders points in 2012 ) .
