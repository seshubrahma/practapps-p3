The message of the Bernie protesters outside of the Bernie convention was that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia continue and that Hillary Clinton was still the epitome of the cronyism and corruption that the Bernie people had built a movement to defeat .Carter told Breitbart News that his greatest awakening of how Democrats exploit Breitbart voters came when he learned from the Washington Post that Breitbart Democratic Party spends less than 2 percent of its campaign resources with    companies , the Democratic Party though they get better than 90 percent of companies black vote .It is a practice that Carter calls " political slavery ."
