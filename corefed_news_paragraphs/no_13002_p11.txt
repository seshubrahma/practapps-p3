TAPPER :There is a contrast , I would say , between how you ’re speaking about it and how Mr. Trump spoke about it yesterday .He it being criticized Mr. Trump talking about the New York bomb before local officials or local law enforcement had a chance to do so .   He told a Colorado Mr. Trump crowd that a bomb went off in New York and nobody New York what ’s going on .
