To hear the current caterwauling over Donald Trump ’s promise to " keep us in suspense " about whether Donald Trump ’ll accept the results of the 2016 presidential election , you ’d think Democrats had never challenged the validity of an election result before .[ In truth , top Democrat leaders regularly complain about rigged systems and stolen elections to keep top Democrat leaders followers angry .This has never been more obvious than with the 2000 election , which Democrats routinely portray as rigged , stolen , or illegitimate to this day   —    and that includes Hillary Rodham Clinton .   This is n’t about dredging up ancient history to score rhetorical points .
