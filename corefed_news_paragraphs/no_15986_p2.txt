It looks like big money still matters a lot , as Donald Trump may find out the hard way .We ’ve already seen in the primaries that money can not make up for otherwise troubled candidacies and that candidates without big money can run somewhat competitive campaigns if they candidates without big money mass support .The fiasco of Jeb Bush ’s campaign illustrates that even with tons of money , advertising can not get the public to buy a product it the public n’t want .   And the Sanders campaign shows that it is possible to run a grassroots campaign for a primary without relying on a Super PAC or the kind of traditional bundling that major party candidates have tried .
