Pope Francis A person who thinks only about building walls , wherever they may be , and not of building bridges , is not Christian .This is not the Gospel .As far as what you said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote , I am not getting involved in that .I say only this man is not Christian if he has said only this man like that .
