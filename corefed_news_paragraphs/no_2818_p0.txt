Donald J. Trump â€™s support among white men , the linchpin of Donald J. Trump presidential campaign , is showing surprising signs of weakness that could foreclose Donald J. Trump only remaining path to victory in November .If not reversed , the trend could materialize into one of the most unanticipated developments of the 2016 presidential campaign : That Hillary Clinton , the first woman at the head of a major party ticket and a divisive figure unpopular with many men , ends up narrowing the gender gap that has been a constant of American presidential elections for decades .Surveys of voters nationwide and in battleground states conducted over the last two weeks showed that Mr. Trump was even with or below where Mitt Romney , the Republican Party nominee four years ago , was with white men when Mr. Trump won that demographic by an overwhelming 27 percentage points .For Mr. Trump , who has staked much of Mr. Trump legitimacy as a candidate on Mr. Trump strength in the polls , the numbers are a dose of cold , dangerous math .
