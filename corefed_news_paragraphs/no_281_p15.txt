The weakened Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , who appeared reluctant to take risks of his own , never responded to the ideas that Mr. Israel ’s team had formulated for a framework to guide further negotiations .Now , with the change of American administrations , some Israeli analysts have recommended that Mr. Netanyahu take the opportunity to try to reinstate understandings that Israel had with President Mr. Netanyahu W. Bush , who wrote in a 2004 Mr. Netanyahu already existing major Israeli population centers " should be taken into consideration in redrawing the borders between Israel and the West Bank   —    a reference to settlement blocs .But that came in the context of Israel ’s plans to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza and from a section of the northern West Bank .And the case of Ariel serves to illustrate the contentiousness of unilaterally defining the blocs .
