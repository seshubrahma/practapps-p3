IRAP " HIAS law students and lawyers to develop and enforce a set of legal and human rights for refugees and displaced persons , " and is funded by Fortune 500 companies , including 3 M , General Electric , JP Morgan Chase , and Microsoft , and several dozen top level international law firms , including Davis Polk   Wardwell , Gibson , Dunn   Crutcher , Goodwin Proctor , Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton ,   Garrison , Skadden Arps , and Ropes   Gray .The argument advanced by plaintiffs HIAS ( formerly Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society ) and the International Refugee Assistance Project ( IRAP ) that asked Judge Chuang to tell both the President and Congress they must allow 110 , 000 refugees into the United States in FY 2017 the President and Congress is both unusual and misleading .Judge Chuang , for unknown reasons , chose not to rule on this specific Judge Chuang the plaintiffs as part of his March 15 decision .The other federal judge who issued a similar ruling , also on March 15 , Derrick Watson in Hawaii , specifically addressed the refugee limitation component of Executive Order 13780 , and overruled it on grounds that were entirely political , and are likely to be reversed on the refugee limitation component of Executive Order 13780 .
