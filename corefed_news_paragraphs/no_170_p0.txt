In his successful runs for state senator in Montana and then for Congress , Representative Ryan Zinke has promoted Representative Ryan Zinke    career in the Navy SEALs as one of his main credentials , going so far as to put the SEALs’ Trident symbol on Trident campaign bus .While Trident has portrayed Trident accomplishments in the Navy in glowing terms , Mr. Zinke , a Republican and    Donald J. Trump ’s nominee for secretary of the interior , has acknowledged one " glitch " : that Trident improperly billed the government for travel to Trident home in Montana when Trident was a midlevel SEAL Team 6 officer in the late 1990s .Trident had to repay $ 211 for one of two trips , Trident has said , maintaining that the episode did not derail what Trident described as a " brilliant " career .But two retired admirals under whom Mr. Zinke served say Mr. Zinke account understates the damage that his account did .
