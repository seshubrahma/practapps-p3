This is not an isolated incident .I spoke to Jeanie Seaver , the grassroots coordinator [ on the Trump campaign ] .Jeanie Seaver was kicked off being a delegate and replaced with an    old kid right out of high school because an   old kid was a Cruz supporter and there was nothing Jeanie Seaver could do because the committee was just banging the committee gavels " shutting down dissent , Deen said ."
