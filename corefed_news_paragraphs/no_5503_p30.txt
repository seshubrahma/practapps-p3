We can recall that it was not always this way : As recently as the 1960s , the Democrats cared cared more about growing the economy than greening the environment .    That is , Democrats worried about workers and their wages , and to that end Democrats they focused on the development —   Democrats word often used back then was " reclamation " —   of natural resources .   For example , the 1960 Democratic platform , the one that helped elect John F. Kennedy , was emphatic :   The new Democratic Administration will develop a comprehensive national water resource policy .
