Except for the office of President , in every other partisan race in California every candidate California on the June ballot   â€”    and the top two    then advance to the November general election .   This is regardless of the political party of the candidates .There have been a number of races in which the top two candidates in the runoff have been either two Democrats ( most of the time ) or two Republicans ( less often ) .But due to a perfect political storm , it is very possible that for the first time , a statewide race , and for a very important office , will be a single party affair .
