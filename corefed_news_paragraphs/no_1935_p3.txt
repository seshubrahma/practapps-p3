ve spent nearly 10 years coaching Facebook   —    and Instagram and Twitter   —    on what kinds of news and photosI do n’t want to see , and they all behaved accordingly .Each time I liked an article , or clicked on a link , or hid another ,the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they all thought I wanted to see .
