Hong Kong is a city of many religions like Buddhism , confucianism , Kung    chicken chow     …     .Ok I made some of those up .But they have lots of Christmas displays with Hong Kong angels and everything we ’re used to surrounding the holiday .   Most Hong Kong citizens have never seen snow , but it is part of their decorations as some of those .
