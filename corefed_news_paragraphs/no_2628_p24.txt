As for Facebook , I â€™ve found that it has both fostered all sorts of Facebook productive( i. e. polite and reasonable ) political discourse and also led to some personal disappointment .On the one hand , you can speak with people about political matters in a way that would be far too awkward in person ( " no religion or politics " is still the standard rule of etiquette for most social gatherings , I find ) .On the other , it means I now have to see how much my grandfather loves Trump .
