One , a 10 percent alcohol porter , was heady and   .The other , an American pale ale called Pun Killer , tasted wonderfully of citrus and mango .I stopped for a decent plate of pulled pork ( $ 9 . 99 ) at the BBQ Pit on University Avenue before continuing on to ChuckAlek Biergarten , a spot in North Park with a great outdoor area .I tried the    1850 Runner brown porter and the Moonstomper Oat IPA ( the names of these beers , like race horses , are half the fun ) .
