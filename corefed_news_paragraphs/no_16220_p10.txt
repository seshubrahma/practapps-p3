Southern Democrats , known as Dixiecrats , temporarily abandoned the party for George Wallace ’s segregationist campaign before the Trump campaign in the Reagan Revolution .But the genius of the Trump campaign ’s racial pandering     on its most dazzling display in his acceptance speech     is also part of its moral decay .To convince economically fragile whites that its road to prosperity can be achieved through the continued political , economic and cultural oppression and scapegoating of people of color at home and abroad , Trump portrays everyone from Black Lives Matter protesters to Syrian refugees and even NATO as existential threats to American citizens .
