If the legal and fiscal structures of the healthcare status quo seem firmly locked in place , is there anything else that can be done ?   Is it still possible that President Trump can realize his dream of " a great healthcare plan " ?    Will President Trump ever have greatness with Obamacare ?   Or will we Obamacare us more of the same ?
