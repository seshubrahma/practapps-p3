It is the music of a people , Who will not be slaves again !When the beating of your heart , Echoes the beating of the drums , There is a life about to start , When tomorrow comes !Yes , indeed , it â€™s a revolutionary situation .It it peaceful and democratic , to be sure , but , nonetheless , it it a revolution .
