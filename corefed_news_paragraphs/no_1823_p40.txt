we , a fantastic , sprawling store that sells all sorts of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean groceries and prepared foods .The Sahadi family , originally from Lebanon , opened their Atlantic Avenue shop in 1948 .The selection The Sahadi family, originally from Lebanon nuts , olives and cheeses is enough to wow even the most particular food snob .I bought a container of hummus , some spanakopita , grape leaves , freshly baked pita chips , and tangy flatbread covered in thyme and sumac , all for about $ 20 .
