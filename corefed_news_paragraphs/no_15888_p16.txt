a number of congressmen and congressional staffers who help us lying on the ground off my belt and myself and another congressman, I do n’t remember who , applied a tourniquet to try to slow down the bleeding .    In the meantime , towards the right field side of the dugout , and there is gunfire about five or six , seven feet to my head .   I look up and there ’s a guy with a gun blasting away .
