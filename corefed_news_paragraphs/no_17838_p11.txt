It â€™s something drug companies are starting to tackle , by   after rebates and discounts , which    often paint a much different picture than routinely increasing    list prices .For example , Lilly , which has   told Business Insider     was down 24 %    in the    of 2016 , from the    of 2015 .The    numbers coming out , however , tend to be on average , so the exact    rebate different PBMs are getting is still under wraps ."
