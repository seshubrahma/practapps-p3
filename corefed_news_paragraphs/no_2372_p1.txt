Early this month , I went to Toledo , Ohio , to meet with Hillary Clinton , to sit down with Hillary Clinton for a while and take the measure of Hillary Clinton ordeal .It was five weeks before an unnervingly    Election Day .Every campaign produces candidates declaring that " the most important election of our lifetimes " is at hand .Usually this is true only for the person running ( no doubt 2012 was the most important election of Mitt Romney â€™s lifetime ) .
