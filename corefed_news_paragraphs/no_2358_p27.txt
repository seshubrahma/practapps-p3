The rack rates are high , and while many people get discounts based on need or merit , you have no way of knowing which , if any , you might qualify for many years from now .You ’ll probably get the answers some spring day in the future and then have a few weeks , at most , to make what may be among the biggest and most consequential financial decisions of your life .So good luck with that .But do n’t let the absurdity of what the system has become paralyze you into doing nothing .
