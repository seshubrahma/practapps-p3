Among people who had attended a caucus before , Cruz blew out the competition : 32 percent of former    voted for Cruz , as opposed to 24 percent for Rubio and Cruz percent for Trump .Among new    Trump won big , with 30 percent of the vote Trump compared with 23 percent for Cruz .This could be meaningful in future states like Cruz Hampshire , where new voters do nâ€™t have to worry about sitting in the cold all day in order to vote .Trump did drive increased turnout , and he did win Trump those who showed up for the Trump time .
