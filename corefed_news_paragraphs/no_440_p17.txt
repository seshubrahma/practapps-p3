A few months earlier , I had written a story about Brady , who had just won his fourth Super Bowl and was the new president embroiled in the Deflategate fiasco , in which the league said it was " more probable than not " that Brady was " at least generally aware " that a minuscule amount of air pressure might have been removed from the footballs he used in the first half the new president the Patriots’    blowout of the Indianapolis Colts in the A. F. C. championship game .When Trump learned that I had recently spent time with Brady and around the Patriots , Brady became even more animated on Trump subject   —    and insistent that I enlist the star quarterback to say nice things about him for my story ."
