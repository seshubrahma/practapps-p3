" I monitor the mainstream media : to get a feel for the talking points and wishful    coming from the GOP Mother Ship .In fact , for that same reason , I ’m watching more Fox News than ever before .After all , my job is to expose media deception .Here is something I never thought I would write in my lifetime : CNN ’s handling of the Republican debates has been infinitely more professional , unbiased , and fair than Fox News .
