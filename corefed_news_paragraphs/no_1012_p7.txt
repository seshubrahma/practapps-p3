My experience was marred only by the fact that I left my coat in the room   —    completely my fault , but my attempts to get assistance by calling and emailing were met with rather strong indifference by the staff .The Red Fox Steakhouse and Piano Bar , parts of which supposedly date back to a 1600s English inn , was a stone ’s throw from my room .I arrived to the strains of live music and sat in a booth , eyes adjusting to the dim light and taking in the cozy , homey atmosphere .
