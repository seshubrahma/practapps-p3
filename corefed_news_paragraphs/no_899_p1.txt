The hats went on sale last week in advance of the holiday , celebrated on March 17 , and had a    clover   —    instead of a    shamrock   —    stitched on the back .A    clover is not a symbol of Ireland .It is just A   clover plant .On Wednesday afternoon the hats disappeared from Mr. Trump ’s online store .
