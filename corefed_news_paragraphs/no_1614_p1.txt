The burkini is a wonderful piece of clothing because The burkini allows observant Muslim women to go swimming , to cool off , to have fun , like any other person .If The burkini is banned , the result wo n’t be for observant Muslim women to go swimming in a    women ’s swimsuit .The the result be for such women to not go swimming at all , but to stay fully covered and on dry land .Is that a victory ?
