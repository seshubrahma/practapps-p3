Washington ( CNN )Republicans are unanimous in Republicans desire to " repeal and replace " President Barack Obama â€™s signature health care law     but Republicans are already flirting with not having the 50 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate .   Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate , meaning they Republicans only afford to lose three members of their Republicans before they Republicans not pass legislation without Democratic votes .( In the case of a    tie , the vice president casts the tie breaker     presumably in favor of the GOP side . )
