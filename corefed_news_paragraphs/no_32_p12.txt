Women have always entered    fields   —    usually    professional ones   —    more than men enter    ones .There are now many female lawyers , but male nurses are still rare .One reason is that jobs done by women , especially caregiving jobs , have always had lower pay and lower status .Yet when men , especially white men , enter    fields , they are paid more men, especially white men promoted faster than women , a phenomenon known as the glass escalator .
