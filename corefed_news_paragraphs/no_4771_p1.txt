—    figuring out which few remaining clinics provide mammograms under my    now third Obamacare insurance plan .my   now third Obamacare insurance plan was made " illegal " by Obamacare , and the next two plans   —    fully approved under Obamacare   —    went bankrupt and were shut down by state and federal regulators .Now I just have to pray I do n’t get cancer or break a bone before Obamacare is repealed because , even at $ 700 a month with a gigantic deductible , there is NO PLAN on the individual market accepted by the two premier hospitals in my area for cancer or broken bones .Those $ 700 premiums go to pay for the pregnancies and dental care of welfare recipients and immigrants , not cancer treatment for Ann .
