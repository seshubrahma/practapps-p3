The public editor ’s take : I contacted the writers , Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo , to ask about their intent .the writers, Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo wanted to the writers, Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo readers that they were not the writers, Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo to use Christian values as a    for any specific policies .They also said the writers, Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo were n’t the writers, Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo to assert whether he lives a good Christian life , only that he is a he Methodist who views his religion a he factor .Seems reasonable .
