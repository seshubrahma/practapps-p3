Even now , the turnout among white registered voters is at a higher percentage in the Florida early vote than among Hispanic voters because Hispanic turnout , historically so low , has a long way to go to catch up .There ’s another possible error in the polls : Mrs. Clinton ’s share of the Hispanic vote .In general , the    polls of Hispanic voters give her a larger lead than the Mrs. Clinton Mr. Obama held with that group in 2012 .But there are plenty of surveys where this does n’t seem to show up .
