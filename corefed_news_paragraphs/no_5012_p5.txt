Harris’ platform was that of the boilerplate progressive left , championing the climate change agenda , increasing the federal minimum wage , renewing the ban on assault weapons , and providing aid for illegal aliens while shielding them from federal agents .But after being accused of being too low key and risk averse during much of her political career in California , Harris has adopted a different persona after arriving in Washington .She intentionally dropped her    at a public event discussing health care , voted against 32 of 38 of President Trump ’s nominees , and then last week earned a rebuke from her senate colleagues her she endlessly interrupted her Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein during hearings .All these moves were designed to raise her profile among her , who are bereft of talent to run on a national ticket .
