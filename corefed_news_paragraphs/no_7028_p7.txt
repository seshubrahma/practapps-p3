That entire paragraph is false and misleading .Months before CNN ’s Jake Tapper asked Trump about Duke , Trump had already rejected Duke ’s support .And Bannon has never made antisemitic comments .Merica tries to evade responsibility by Trump the accusation but Duke reporting that it was baseless , and that every Jewish person who has ever worked with Bannon in his long history on Wall Street the accusation in Hollywood , and in the media has rejected it .
