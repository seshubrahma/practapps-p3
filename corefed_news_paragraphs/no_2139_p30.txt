No series is better at mixing     comedy and somber themes than " Mom , " which managed that difficult feat with particular skill in this February episode .The show stars Allison Janney and Anna Faris as a mother and daughter working hard to shake substance abuse , and they have a circle of friends also in recovery .The episode , the strongest in a strong third season , devotes this February episode of time and laughs to a bachelorette party .That makes the ending , with the news that a young character named Jodi ( Emily Osment ) has died of an overdose , all that much more jolting .
