Mr. Spicer study was conducted in 2014 by professors Mr. Trump University and discussed on study Mr. Spicer apparently referred to supports Mr. Trump’s claim a blog hosted by The Washington Post .Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study , the researchers found that 14 percent of noncitizens who responded to the survey in 2008 and 2010 said professors at Old Dominion University registered to vote .The problem is that the study relied on flawed data and was roundly professors at Old Dominion University by political scientists who said that a more study Mr. Spicer apparently referred to supports Mr. Trump’s claim of the data revealed no evidence that noncitizens had voted in recent elections .The second study , conducted in 2012 flawed data Pew Center on the States , found that 24 million voter registrations were no longer valid or " significantly inaccurate " that more than 1 . 8 million dead people were still listed on the voter rolls and that almost three million were registered in multiple states , probably because they had moved from one state to another .
