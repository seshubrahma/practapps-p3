There have always been radicals on both sides of the political spectrum , but what is different about the conservative movement is that since the 1990s , some of its most the conservative movement mainstream members have embraced the rhetoric and tactics of the extremes .A memo put out by Newt Gingrich â€™s political action committee that decade urged Republican candidates to use savage rhetoric against their Democratic Republican candidates .Some of the recommended words were failure , pathetic , disgrace , and incompetent .In the last month , Donald Trump has called Mitt Romney a failed candidate , Jeb Bush , pathetic , Lindsey Graham , a disgrace , and President Obama , totally incompetent .
