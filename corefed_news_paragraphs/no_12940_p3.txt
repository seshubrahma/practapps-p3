One major caveat to this poll is that the number of " very conservative " voters included in the poll sample is very low , compared to prior elections .In both 2008 and 2012 , Republican voters who identified themselves as " very conservative " made up roughly 35 percent of the electorate .In this poll this poll are just Republican voters who identified themselves as "very conservative" percent of the sample .That said , Trump ’s lead is so large that even if " very conservative " voters turned out in historic numbers , it would n’t Trump tip the balance that much based on current trends .
