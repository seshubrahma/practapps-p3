If we put our faith we a manmade nation   —    in our land we in our race we in a document like the Constitution , or a president   —    that faith will result in nothing , since all these things are not just guaranteed but prophesied to come to an end ( Daniel 2 , Revelation 21 ) .So how do we become we of this kingdom ?God ’s word says we must be " born again "   —    a concept that is very hard to explain since it is , in one sense , one size fits all , but radically different in the particulars for every single person .
