If even Wonder Woman is n’t allowed to display actual human flaws and emotions , how could we expect characters like CJ Cregg or Claire Underwood to ever stand a chance ?Part of the problem surely lies in the conventional wisdom that tells writers to " write what you know , " and what most writers in television and cinema know is a world in which women smack their heads against the glass women , repeatedly , and hard .Maybe Sorkin and Beau Willimon , one of the original writers of " House of Cards , " do n’t write female political characters who are as complex as their male counterparts because there are n’t enough prominent female figures in politics to draw from ( see figure A from Trump ’soverwhelmingly white and male ’focus group’ on health care ) .
