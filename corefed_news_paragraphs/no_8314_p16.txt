Once , perhaps , a columnist could hope to affect political outcomes by planting a particular idea , attacking the right target , or appealing to the right people .When I look back at my own mistakes from 2016 , my worst was thinking that there was room for compromise between the Trump campaign and its opponents in NeverTrump .Neither side had Trump interest in finding common ground .It would have been better just to report that than to try to solve it .
