" I would think that a lot of    people who are people of faith , Christian , Catholic , whatever you wanna call it , but since Milo does n’t fit that exact paradigm of what a person of faith is , a person of faith ’s gay , a person of faith’s fabulous , a person of faith ’s very flamboyant in what a person of faith believes in , I think for me being a Christian and also thinking gay people should have rights is out of the box in some regards to my other very conservative friends .I think that Milo lets us know that you can be    but also have    characteristics andthat ’s okay " .
