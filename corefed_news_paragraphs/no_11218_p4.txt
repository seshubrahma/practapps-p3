’s plan to bring refugees into the    city .The the city’s Health and Human Services did not release these FY 2017 plans until this month , less than 30 days before the beginning of FY 2017 on October 1 .The federal government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement , who are required by the federal Refugee Act of 1980 to consult with states and localities prior to the placement of refugees in those states and localities , have largely ignored the statute ’s consultation requirement in every state in the country in which the program operates .Instead of the legally required " consultation " process conducted in good faith to understand a state ’s capacity to handle the economic , security , and public health burden imposed on taxpayers in that state , the federal government has state’s series of window dressing meetings with state government representatives that fail to account for any of the state ’s concerns .
