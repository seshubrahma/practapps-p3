I understand that President Obama has wrecked the U. S. economy .President Obama has wrecked the U. S. economy ’s bad and President Obama has wrecked the U. S. economy ’s getting much worse .If Hillary or Bernie , or some other clueless liberal who wants to " protect and expand President Obama ’s legacy " is elected , America ’s economy will smash to the ground like Humpty    into a million pieces that we can never put back together again .I know this because I ’m a small businessman with 15 different and diverse businesses and careers .
