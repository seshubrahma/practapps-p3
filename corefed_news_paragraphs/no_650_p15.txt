The Kings often argued that " The Good "The Good Wife" for churning out 22 episodes a year for CBS , implying that the show might have been different if given the shorter season of a cable or streaming series .But " The Good Fight , " despite having 10 episodes , so far plays much the same   —    the snappy dialogue , the technology obsession , the      structure .It contrasts with , say , AMC ’s " Better Call Saul , " which established a different voice for a different protagonist .Consistency is no crime , but it will be interesting to see if the show evolves .
