Kennedy veto the executive order , rather than resigning .President Trump later fired the United States Supreme Court :    websites and social media are celebrating Yates ’s exchange with Cruz , as if she " schooled " him .Yates cited the    provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , Yates has never been interpreted to overrule the president ’s broad authority under 8 U. S. C. Yates ( f ) to determine immigration policy   —
