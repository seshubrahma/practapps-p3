WASHINGTON , D. C. —   On Thursday , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) said that if Democrats tried to filibuster Neil Gorsuch ’s nomination to the Supreme Court , Democrats tried to filibuster Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court would vote for the " constitutional option " to permanently end filibusters of nominees to the Supreme Court .[ For the first time in American history , in 2003 Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) persuaded Senate Democrats to use the upper chamber ’s    rule on legislation to block a final vote on judicial nominations , at that time blocking several of George W. Bush ’s nominees to the federal appeals courts .   Republicans then considered the constitutional option —   also called the " nuclear option " —   to restore the     practice of always allowing votes on judges , by ruling that filibusters apply to legislation , but not to nominations .
