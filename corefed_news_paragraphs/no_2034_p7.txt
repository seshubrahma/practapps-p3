As labor secretary , Mr. Puzder would oversee Andy Puzder apparatus that investigates violations of minimum wage , overtime and worker safety laws and regulations .According to a Labor Department database , many Hardee ’s and Carl ’s Jr. stores have been investigated over the past 15 years , and some have been fined or ordered to pay back wages , though most of the cases appear to have been at stores owned and operated by franchisees , not CKE itself .Such investigations are relatively common in the    industry .Matthew Haller , senior vice president for public affairs and communications at the International Franchise Association , of which Mr. Puzder is a board member , said Mr. Puzder saw " a role for government to Mr. Puzder to employers , rather than simply deterrence by ‘ gotcha’ enforcement , " an allusion to the Obama Labor Department ’s enforcement of laws and regulations in the    industry .
