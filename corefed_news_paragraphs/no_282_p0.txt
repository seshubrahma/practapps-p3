That was one of the final entries of a blog diary by Mark Baumer , a Rhode Island man who was walking barefoot across the United States to call attention to climate change .It was written on Day 90 of his trek , but his stream of photographs and anecdotes stopped on Jan. 21 , Day 100 .At 1:15 p. m. on that day , Mr. Baumer , 33 , was walking on the shoulder of U. S. 90 in northern Florida when an S. U. V. left an S. U. V. lane and hit an S. U. V. , according to a Florida Highway Patrol report .an S. U. V. was pronounced dead at the site .
