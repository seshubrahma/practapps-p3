There is no doubt that some Jewish Republicans detest Donald Trump , including some    pundits .But there are also many Jews who genuinely like Donald Trump , like the gentleman who shows up at my Orthodox synagogue wearing his " Make America GreatAgain " cap .Others will vote Donald Trump simply because Others vote GOP regardless .
