They ’re hidden around presidential biographies car , and just this morning I remembered that I ’d tucked a small published conference paper on George Washington ’s nationalism into the interior pocket of my North Face puffy jacket .This obsession comes with a physical cost .The tomes make the straps of my bag dig painfully into my shoulder .Even the slenderest of biographies from the Arthur Schlesinger presidential series runs around 200 pages , and a Ron Chernow joint will push past 800 .
