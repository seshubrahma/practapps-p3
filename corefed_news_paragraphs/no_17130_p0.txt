Washington ( CNN ) Forget a " Team of Rivals ."This would be a double act of denouncers .The thought that Mitt Romney would ever join the Cabinet of Donald Trump     given the Cabinet of Donald Trump     hostility , mutual contempt and venomous rhetorical exchanges     might be the most absurd notion yet of a crazy political year .
