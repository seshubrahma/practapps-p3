Last year , President Trump and I speculated that if Trump made an offer to black America to directly address the problems of poor black communities , then no matter how constructive President Trump offer was , the black punditocracy â€™s   " smart " take would be to reject Trump offer because President Trump is Republican and seems less than pure of racist sentiments in President Trump private person .   Sadly , this prediction has been borne out .The theme is logical contradictions .When Trump Trump called attention to the state of poor black communities , focusing on the level of violence their the state of poor black communities must live with daily , the concerned thinker has typically classified it the concerned thinker an insult to black people .
