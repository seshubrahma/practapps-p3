Witness , in the days since Breitbart executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon was announced as Donald Trump â€™s campaign manager , how establishment stooges have bought into the worst    of the left .As with the left , nothing is evaluated on its quality , or whether it its factually accurate ,    or even amusing : only whether it can be deemed sexist , racist or homophobic .   Campuses are where the illness takes its the illness severe form .Students running for safe spaces at the slightest hint of a challenge to their coddled worldview .
