Imagine you ’re an illiterate single parent in an impoverished Central American city that is rife with violence ( the situation is different for Mexicans , despite northern stereotypes , who have better access to the middle class and to education ) .You may have decided that 2017 is the year to try to take the journey north , but you have heard that the new American president , Donald Trump , will build a wall .You decide to go now before the a wall built .That kind of thinking may well have pulled tens of thousands of this year ’s migrants to accelerate their journey , leaving in the winter instead of the spring .
