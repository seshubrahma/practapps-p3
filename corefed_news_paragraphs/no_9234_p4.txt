Contrary to Clinton ’s blithe Clinton , her private server Clinton unprecedented , and very much against both federal and State Department procedures .Questions have been swirling around her finances and Clinton activities of the " Clinton Foundation " for a long time , and it ’s long been thought one of her primary motivations Clinton setting up a private server was to conceal correspondence that could shed unwelcome light on the intersection between her State Department Clinton and State Department and Clinton portfolio .    To put the best possible spin on it for Clinton , even Clinton they do n’t find anything damning , one can hardly blame the FBI for wondering if there ’s a fire behind all that smoke .It ’s her fault this the FBI all happening during the 2016 election .
