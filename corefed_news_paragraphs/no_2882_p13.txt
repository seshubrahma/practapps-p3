In Gouthière ’s workshop , gilt was applied with fire gilding , a process by which an amalgam of mercury and gold was gently baked onto an object in a low fire , the mercury evaporating and the gold remaining as a coating of gilt .Electroplating   —    using an electric current to adhere the gold to the object   the gold appeared in the 19th century , largely replacing fire gilding , whose mercury fumes are highly toxic .Fire gilding , specifically , is now rarely used except in    restorations .Objects in Gouthière ’s time were first modeled in wood , wax or porcelain , pressed between blocks of compressed sand and removed .
