VANCOUVER , British Columbia   â€”    Seattle and VANCOUVER are like fraternal twins separated at birth .Seattle and Vancouver are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with    populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers .Yet 140 miles of    roads and an international border divide the two cities , keeping the two cities farther apart than the two cities geographic and cultural identities would suggest .Now the political , academic and tech elite of both cities are looking for ways to bring the political, academic and tech elite of both cities closer together , with the aim of continuing the growth of two of the most vibrant economies in North America .
