Let me quote him here : " It is , in fact , the President Armstrong ’s responsibility to support the rights of all people the University of Missouri opinions and ideas   —    regardless of how unpopular they may all people   —    while also encouraging students to think critically all people independently .   " Protecting freedom of speech is not an option , it is a critical responsibility that the university , and all of us as members of a democratic society , must defend ."President Armstrong is right , and the left is absolutely furious .
