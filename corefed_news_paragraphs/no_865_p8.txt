Buying more imported consumer goods because you are making more money is generally a good thing , not a bad thing .Some exports of products were down in a few sectors where the United States has important competitive advantages .Exports of civilian aircraft   —    think Boeing jets sold across the globe   —    fell by $ 611 million , and shipments of other    capital goods like aircraft engines and telecommunications equipment were also down .Such sectors tend to be volatile , so these may turn out to be blips .
