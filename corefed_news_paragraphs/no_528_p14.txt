It goes without saying that having Mr. Trump in the White House gives House and Senate the decisions opportunity to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda if they can find common ground .That prospect should be heightened by installing colleagues like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and two fellow Republicans , Representatives Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tom Price of Georgia , at the highest levels of the administration House and Senate Republicans Mr. Sessions is Mr. Trump ’s nominee for attorney general while Mr. Mulvaney has Mr. Sessions and Human Services .Mr. McConnell looms as potentially the president ’s most important ally in Congress because success in the Senate is central to any legislative victory .But Republicans have Mr. McConnell of the new Congress .
