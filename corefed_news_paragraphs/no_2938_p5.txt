As my colleague Claire Cain Miller wrote , some of the very innovations that have helped improve workers’ productivity are also the main culprit behind the decline of    manufacturing jobs .These advances have made the United States richer   —    with jobs like designing software systems and taking medical images .But that ’s not much solace for former manufacturing workers who have n’t found lucrative or rewarding work in growing fields , a group that is at the core of Mr. Trump ’s campaign appeals .It ’s not just manufacturing .
