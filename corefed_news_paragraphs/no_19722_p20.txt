So well protected was the    establishment under Obama that its head , Bush of National Intelligence James Clapper , was forced to admit lying to Congress under oath about the    " metadata " program —    —   and suffered no adverse consequences as a result .The above is a sobering record for an administration that liked to pose as a friend of the Constitution and of civil liberties .History ’s judgment may be tempered by the evidence that Obama wanted to do better .He struggled for eight years , for example , to close the extraterritorial prison camp at Guantanamo .
