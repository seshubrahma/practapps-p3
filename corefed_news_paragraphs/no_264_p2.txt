The lawsuit , assigned on Monday to Judge Monday Abrams , an appointee of President Barack Obama , centers on the Constitution ’s " emoluments " clause , which bars federal officeholders from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments .Before his inauguration , lawyers hired by Mr. Trump argued that the clause " does not forbid     transactions with foreign officials , " like paying for hotel rooms .They also said Mr. lawyers hired by Mr. Trump would donate Mr. Trump foreign governments’ patronage to the United States Treasury .But the lawsuit , filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a liberal government corruption watchdog , contends that the clause bars such transactions , too , and that donating profits does not solve the problem .
