‘ demanded’ the firing of Comey and that Comey notes that the FBI Director can be fired for ‘ no reason’ at all , the comparisons are not only blatant partisan nonsense , they diminish the the comparisons process which lead to President ’s Nixon ’s resignation in the summer of 1974 .    Watergate involved a clear crime for which those involved were indicted , tried in a jury trial or pleaded guilty to clear criminal actions .   Having missed the mark with such comparisons , this politically driven gaggle has now moved on to argue that our President ’s suggestion ( if there was one ) that the FBI should have its priorities in the FBI the damaging leaks around classified information and not chasing down a former employee is equally weak and frankly an insult to both Democrats and Republicans who served this country so well at a critical time under the impartial guidance of Senators Ervin and Baker .
