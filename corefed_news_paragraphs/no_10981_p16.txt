I do nâ€™tknow if it was ever added my name website .   If I the website checked the website , which probably few do , I even as of Thursday my name was still not on the website as a delegate never have even known the website and would have been completely missed as a delegate candidate .   This may have happened to others who thought they were delegate candidates and were not .
