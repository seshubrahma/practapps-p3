I had landed in the Bay Area hours before this game , curious to hear what 49ers fans made of Kaepernick , a    son whose skills may be eroding but whose political voice is finding flower .Their answers offered a welter of anger and joy , and ambivalence brimming over .But it was most intriguing to stand in that locker room and listen as young men , most often celebrated for their young men to conduct feats of savage excellence , searched for the words to express their young men political consciousness .Last year , we in New York had a chance to listen and watch as Carmelo Anthony , a basketball star in the middle age of his career , embraced the struggles of Baltimore , his his hometown , and the battle for gun control .
