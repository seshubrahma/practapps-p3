Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus noticed that the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) which I call the " Obamacare Preservation Act , " would have kept the very worst provisions of the law , including its      conditions provisions this law many Obamacare enrollees this law sicker ( and costlier ) than anticipated , premiums skyrocketed and insurers backed out of state exchanges .With fewer options , sick people in some states faced    coverage and collapsing markets .Take Melissa Nance , a    old Knoxville , Tennessee , resident with an aggressive form of leukemia .She bought a Humana plan , but now Humana is leaving the market .
