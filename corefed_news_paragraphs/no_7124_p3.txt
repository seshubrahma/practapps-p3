no doubt that Trump was directing himformer FBI Director James Comey’s end the investigation , but as I say , as a lawyer , I would take some solace in both of those .My guess is when Marc Kasowitz , the president ’s lawyer comes out sometime between 1:30 and 2:00 today , he ’s going the president’s declare victory and say Comey cleared Trump .And Trump a legal sense , you could say that he did .
