What ’s significant about my temporary Facebook Facebook is not so much that it my temporary Facebook ban but that it my temporary Facebook ban for no good reason .Sure , my piece contained some strong language : " cucks " got used a few times , as did the phrase " " .But neither of those terms is proscribed under Facebook ’s Community Standards .And though there was definitely a goodly amount of righteous rage in the piece , at no point did I name names .
