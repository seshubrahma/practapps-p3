Had the framers of our Constitution intended the " public use " language to have such sweeping scope , they would have selected a more expansive the "public use" language to have such sweeping scope for inclusion in the Amendment ’s text , such as " general welfare ."Instead , the    " public use " language was more narrowly construed , as it simply embodied the founders’ understanding that the   "public use" language of property is a natural and fundamental right .History demonstrates that secure property rights are an indispensable condition for the preservation of freedom , economic prosperity and social harmony .
