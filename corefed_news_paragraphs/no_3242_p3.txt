Last week , We introduced an improvement to reporting abusive Tweets that gives people experiencing targeted harassment more ways to report it .Today , We ’re announcing three changes : stopping the creation of new abusive accounts , bringing forward safer search results , and collapsing potentially abusive or    Tweets ." " Safer search results " will work by removing " sensitive " tweets and tweets from blocked and muted users from your searches on the platform , while their new collapsing system will hide a large quantity of replies on your tweets .Twitter does not explain what qualifies a tweet for being deemed " sensitive , " and while Twitter says " this type of content will be discoverable if you want to find it , " it does n’t say how since " it wo n’t clutter search results any longer .
