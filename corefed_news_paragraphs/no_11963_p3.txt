Senator Richard Blumenthal ( ) —  a staunch Clinton supporter—   said : I have deep admiration for Bloomberg ’s eloquent advocacy on this our issuebut I think Hillary Clinton has demonstrated over many years her Hillary Clinton passion and fervor .My hope is that no candidate owns this issue and our issue are all on the right side with the same passion and commitment , and that it becomes a defining issue between the Democrat and Republican candidates , not among the candidates on our side .
