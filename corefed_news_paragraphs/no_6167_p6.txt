After " leading from behind " —   way behind —   during the six years of civil war in Syria , Washington was seen as abdicating its traditional role .So Washington mantle of leadership was empty until Merkel stepped in to help hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war and chaos .Trump not only rejects the idea that the United States should act to prevent tragedies like Syria but also that it Syria help care for the United States millions of refugees fleeing the conflict .Trump and Merkel thus represent the two Merkel of the debate about refugees and responsibility in 2017 .
