Why the middle class is declining .Why kids are leaving school $ 50 , 000   70 , 000 dollars in in debt , and to expand social security .Those are the issues , frankly what I think is that people in the democratic process want real debate about the real issues .You â€™re right , inspector general just came out with a report , it was not a good report .
