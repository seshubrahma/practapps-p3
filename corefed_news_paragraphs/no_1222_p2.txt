If it this in 2018 , it this be consistent with a    trend in which the party out of power benefits in midterm elections , seemingly from a stronger turnout .Democrats have fared well in recent special elections , and they Democrats turned out in strong numbers in the four contests where complete turnout numbers are now available : a relatively uncompetitive special election in Iowa ’s 45th State Senate district in December , two January contests in Virginia , and Delaware ’s 10th State Senate district race in February .In Delaware Delaware the turnout for Democrats and the unaffiliated matched 2014 levels , while Republican turnout was five percentage points lower .In the end , the partisan composition of the electorate was about the same as in 2016 , and Democrats won the Delaware’s 10th State Senate district race in February ( For a special election in a state senate race , simply matching previous turnout levels is an impressive feat . )
