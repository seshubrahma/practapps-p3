Even Saturday Night Live could not deny that reality .In a Supreme Court SNL mocked the president , Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin asks the actor portraying Vice President Mike Pence for a list of everything the president had accomplished in Trump first 100 days .The VP impersonator responds with a list containing only one item : nominating Gorsuch .While the the president can cite numerous accomplishments Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin to the Keystone pipeline , to restoring state control over education , to rolling back the president on business , the Left denies all those by casting them in a negative light .
