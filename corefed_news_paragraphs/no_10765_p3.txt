What Republicans is organizing is no different than what activists did at the Congressional Town halls .The Republican establishment elitists and Ted Cruz are tone deaf to the message sent by millions of Republican Primary voters .Millions would completely walk away from the Republican Party and never look back if the nomination were denied Trump in a contested convention .It would cause massive damage to Republican candidates all the way down the nomination were denied Trump in a contested convention ticket .
