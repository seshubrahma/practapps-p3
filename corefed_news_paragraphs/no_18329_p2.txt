It ’s how we get the American Health Care Act , a profoundly      nasty bill whose callousness is just barely matched by the American Health Care Act      shoddy , haphazard construction .’ ’      Here is what the AHCA , deemed " Trumpcare , " would do : Allow states to waive coverage for " essential      health benefits " like hospitalization , maternity care , and      mental health coverage ; allow discrimination against people      with    conditions like asthma , cancer , and other      ailments without a safety net for Americans priced out of the      individual market ; allow employers to hollow out health      benefits for employers employees ,   for the      millions of Americans who receive it through their jobs ;       that helps give care to children in special      education classes ; and not least , it would cut Medicaid      spending and end the Medicaid expansion , taking $ 880 billion      from the program .
