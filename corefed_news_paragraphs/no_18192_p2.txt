There seems to be a difference between what Ambassador Haley is    saying , as Ambassador Haley said last night , that Assad really has no future ,    and what I heard this morning from Secretary Tillerson , " Rubio    said .’ ’    Rubio    added : " There is no such thing as ’’ Assad yes , but ISIS , no . ’’    This theory that you can defeat ISIS as long as Assad is there is    not true .
