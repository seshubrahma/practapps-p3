I remember well how State Department offices were told by Powell ’s and Armitage Colin Powellstaffs not Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage share any information with Bolton and his Ambassador John Bolton about Ambassador John Bolton war planning .Looking back on this , Bolton believes Powell Ambassador John Bolton him a Colin Powell Ambassador John BoltonHe says on Ambassador John Bolton    of his 2007 book Ambassador John Bolton is Not an Option : I played no significant    role on Iraq policy , because Iraq and Armitage largely Colin Powell me from these issues , no doubt fearing that my views would be similar to Cheney ’s and Rumsfeld ’s and not their own .
