Now it is difficult to recall a time when the borders between society and celebrity were sharply delineated and seldom crossed .And in an era when many celebrities attend parties because they have many celebrities paid to do so ( and post the evidence later on Instagram ) it is startling to remember a time when people went to parties to have fun .A certain indulgent pleasure can be had in reliving the innocent wonder that inspired Capote â€™s Black and White Ball , a party its host Black and White in some ways begun to plan as a precocious , lonely     in Monroeville , Ala. but did not have the social power to pull off until the year of his huge literary success ."
