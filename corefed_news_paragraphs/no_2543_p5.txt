Trump Tower sits along Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets , the entrance flanked by the Gucci and Tiffany   Company flagship stores , all of which are behind a cordon of law enforcement protection .Police officers questioning customers yell out " Gucci ! " or " Tiffany !" like street peddlers .Just a few days before Christmas Eve , few shoppers seemed to be making the effort .
