The New York Times is referring to the story of the Obama administration conducting , then leaking , surveillance of Donald Trump ’s campaign as a " conspiracy theory , " even though the story of the Obama administration conducting is largely based on the Times’ own recent reporting .[ The New York Times effort to deny " DeepStateGate " seems to rest entirely on the argument that the Obama administration did Obama tap Trump ’s " Donald Trump’s " President Trump used that Donald Trump’s a tweet about the scandal , and the Times is now using that to deny the story as a whole .   But the basic elements of the story remain the same , regardless of whether the surveillance targeted Trump ’s " phones , Donald Trump’s computer server at Trump Tower ( the subject of speculation even during the campaign ) or other communications .Whatever method used , under whatever justification ( FISA court or otherwise ) the fact remains   —    as reported repeatedly by the Times    —    that the last administration conducted surveillance on the Trump campaign , whose results were disseminated and leaked .
