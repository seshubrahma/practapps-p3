advocates note that the current system caught those violations   —    and that the numbers , less than one per state per year   —    constitute a tiny sliver of the millions of votes cast in any election cycle .No one doubts that election fraud has occurred and needs to be monitored .Election outcomes have been changed by officials who altered vote tallies , and in theory hackers could pick winners by playing havoc with voter rolls , voting machines or electronic reporting networks .But voter fraud , in which someone deliberately casts an invalid ballot or a ballot under someone else ’s name , is exceedingly rare .
