Well , first of all , I’’d like    to be clear that a number of people find me intolerable , and they    don’’t hesitate to say so   —    which they and I cherish .We wouldn’’t    be successful if we didn’’t have independent thinkers who can a number of people argue and then resolve their arguments .And , yes a number of people I can see that    our culture appears odd .
