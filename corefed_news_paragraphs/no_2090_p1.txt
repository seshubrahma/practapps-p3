Of The New York Times â€™s newly named White House team , all six are white , as is most everyone in the Washington bureau .Traveling to other departments , Metro has only three Latinos among its Metro reporters , in a city with the second largest Hispanic population in the country .Sports has one Asian man , two Hispanics and no    among its    reporters , yet blacks are plentiful among the teams they blacks and the audience they blacks .In the Styles section , every writer is white , while American culture is anything but .
