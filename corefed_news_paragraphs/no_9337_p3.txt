Sure , white men and women showed up and voted for Trump’s , as did 28 percent of the Latino population .The funny thing is , however , actually not so funny , is that white men and women did so while too many of Hillary ’s supporters were so busy lamenting the possibility of a Trump’s presidency that white men and women actually ensured his presidency by not showing up at the polls , where it counted .   2 million fewer    who came out and voted for President Obama in 2012 showed up to vote for Hillary this past election .More than 100 million eligible voters did n’t bother to vote at all .
