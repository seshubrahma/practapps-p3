This manhunt which ended a success of course does not mean an end because we still have to investigate further .Unfortunately , the terror threat in Germany has not changed .It is still the terror threat in Germany ‘ high risk’ and the security agencies are working close together .I would like to point out my deportation proposals and would like to make more proposals for safety and security .
