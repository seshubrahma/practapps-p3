Cohen Cohen’s , unlike Moscot Moscot Warby Parker , sells brands that are not its Cohen’s ( Gucci , Tom Ford and so on ) .A few weeks ago , however , it Cohen’s selling a house line called the Collective simple frames that are meant to look as if they come with a free Smith Corona , and sell for under $ 100 .Cohen Cohen’s remodeled its flagship Cohen’s , outfitting it with its flagship store tiles and making it look its flagship store the kind of place a recent graduate of a    liberal arts college might come to shop .Recently , I sat down with Bob Cohen , who runs Cohen ’s Cohen’s at Katz ’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side .
