Seriously .I wrote about the whole thing here .But     with the help of super intern Liz Stark , who graduated college Saturday and was at work Monday morning ( ! )     I went through the transcript and ranked the Cabinet Cabinet by just how obsequious their the Cabinet members to Trump actually were .Before we go any further , an important note : The people on this list are those who required Senate confirmation plus Vice President Mike Pence .
