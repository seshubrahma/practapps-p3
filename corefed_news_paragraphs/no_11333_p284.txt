( @HillaryClinton Trump , 2016 ,   3:03 :    eviscerates Clinton on her " abysmal record on open government ."Clinton has a long track record of public service but an equally long record of obfuscation , secrecy and working in the shadows to boost her power and further her ambition .We encourage voters to think long and hard about that record when choosing the next president .
