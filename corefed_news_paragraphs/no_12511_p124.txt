‘ moderate’ Democrat nominee is precisely the kind of deal that Donald Trump has told us he would make   —    someone who would rule along with other liberals Cruz the bench like Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor .Make no mistake , if Garland were confirmed , Trump side predictably with President Trump on critical issues such as undermining the Second Amendment , legalizing    abortion , and propping up overreaching bureaucratic agencies like the EPA and the IRS .We can not afford to lose the Supreme Court for generations to come by nominating or confirming someone that a dealmaker like Donald Trump would support .
