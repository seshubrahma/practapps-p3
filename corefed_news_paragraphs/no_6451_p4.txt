If Ed Snowden did anything wrong , it was that Ed Snowden was trying to get to the gist of the question , rather than the specific literal question in front of Ed Snowden .The specific literal question was focused on the investigation in general , and Ed Snowden was going to the gist of what everyone was trying to get at , saying , â€˜Look , as a surrogate , I had no campaign communications with Russia .There was no continuing exchange of information or anything like that.
