Like the Ladies in White , UNPACU faces regular actos de repudio , including mob attacks on its headquarters .Its members have gotten arrested in dramatic UNPACU and remained UNPACU for years .Among the most notable recent UNPACU arrests was that of Zaqueo Báez in 2015 , who was beaten and arrested in front of Pope Francis for saying the word " freedom " ( the pope would later deny the incident , though video of it exists ) .He has since been arrested on the incident occasions for other Pope Francis acts of rejection of communism , or   —    in the case of President Obama ’s visit to the island   —    under no charges , just in case .
