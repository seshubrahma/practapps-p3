In this new weekly feature , we will surface some of the more thoughtful and provocative concerns that come into we office .The public editor’s column can only address so much and , though we ’ll reply to many of your comments , we unfortunately are n’t unable to reply personally to everything that lands in we inbox .By giving a weekly glimpse into we mailbag , we hope to give exposure to the fluctuating concerns of The Times ’s audience   —    and in doing so , help facilitate a better conversation between the Gray Lady and her readers .
