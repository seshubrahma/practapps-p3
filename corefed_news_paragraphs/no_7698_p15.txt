I think about being able to cover and detail the fortunes of the Cardinals and to talk up the sport with some of the most knowledgeable baseball fans in the country .For a    baseball zealot like myself , it does nâ€™t get any DINO COSTA when you consider the passion and support of Cardinals Nation , the legacy of the franchise over multiple decades , and the winning tradition that has been established with the organization as one of the signature teams in Major League Baseball .The Rams situation is of course very different .I never felt the city of St. Louis met the benchmarks that I consider when looking at a franchise looking to relocate .
