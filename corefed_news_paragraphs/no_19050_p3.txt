Eisenhower , who served as the supreme allied commander in Europe    during World War II , is the most recent person to have been voted    to the presidency without holding prior elected office , a streak    Trump is attempting to break .Only four presidents have ever held    the position without holding prior elected office , and the other    three   —    Herbert Hoover , Ulysses S. Grant , and Zachary Taylor   —      all did so long before Trump was born .
