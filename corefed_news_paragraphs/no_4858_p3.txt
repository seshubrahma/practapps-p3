In conclusion , Gorka said : What we are witnessing today —   whether it ’s RT , whether it ISIS tweets , Telegram —   none of it is new .The platforms may be new , but the concepts of propaganda , dezinformatsiya , Maskirovka , none of these are true .none of these are just being packaged in new and far more effective ways .
