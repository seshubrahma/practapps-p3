  ( CNN )Someone in the Democratic Party should remind Sen. Chuck Schumer of the axiom that " revenge is a dish best served cold , " because Someone in the Democratic Party Senate leader is preparing a piping hot bowl of it in their Senate leader veiled threat to block consideration of any of Donald Trump ’s Supreme Court nominees indefinitely .The remarks are clearly meant as an aggressive counterstrike against Republicans who refused to even allow a vote on President Barack Obama ’s nominee , Judge Merrick Garland , who the President submitted for Senate approval last March after the death of Antonin Scalia a month earlier .But although the approach Schumer hinted at might be perfectly legal , a petulant Democratic refusal to consider and vote on Supreme Court nominees at the beginning of a newly elected president ’s term would violate over a century of legal precedent     and could cause gridlock in the nation ’s highest court .
