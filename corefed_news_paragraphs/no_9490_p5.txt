Because of his wide swathe Donald Trump support , I believe he will easily Donald Trump Hillary Clinton in November .As one who has recently changed her views on issues Hillary Clinton in depth investigations , I truly believe Donald Trump is now embracing conservative ideology and will be a strong fighter for conservative principles .He has a track Donald Trump of winning and has already won in relegating Republican establishment darling Jeb Bush to underdog status despite hundreds of millions of dollars in his war chest .Donald Trump any other candidate have been able to accomplish that ?
