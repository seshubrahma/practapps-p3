Yes   —    more than BLM " protestors " can grasp , as evidenced by their    provocateurism .Does n’t it go without saying that Native lives matter , too ?And Asian and Eskimo and Hispanic and Indian   …      and every other race comprised of people who see clearly the agenda at play to weaken America through disunity .Get fed up and stand America if you ’re sick of being called racist when proclaiming EVERY LIFE MATTERS , black as much as white and every skin tone in between .
