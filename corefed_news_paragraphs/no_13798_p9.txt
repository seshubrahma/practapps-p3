Such boosterism apparently made Milo a good fit for Simon   Schuster ’s Threshold imprint , which publishes not only Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh but also Trump himself ( most recently " Great Again : How to Fix our Crippled America " ) .By signing Milo ’s " Dangerous , " the publishing house simply makes more evident what Trump ’s campaign already proved : for today ’s GOP , racist rhetoric has become normal political discourse .The risk that hateful rhetoric could become an inspiration for rather than a deterrent against hateful action is particularly relevant in Milo case , since his Milo raises the question of the link between dangerous speech online and     actions     a connection that came up repeatedly during our recent Presidential campaign .   Milo Milo above all a performer who lives for the attention     in the form of outrage     his Milo of bigotry brings .
