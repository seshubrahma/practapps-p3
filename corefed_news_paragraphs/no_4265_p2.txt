How can someone so blatantly contradict what someone said and then solemnly reaffirmed ? "In statements earlier this week , Archbishop Negri claimed that the Obama administration may have been complicit in the " tremendous pressures " that led the former pope to resign in 2013 .It is " no coincidence " that some Catholic groups " have asked President Trump to open a commission of inquiry to investigate whether the administration of Obama exerted pressure on Benedict , " Archbishop Negri said in an interview Monday , citing revelations by Wikileaks regarding efforts by the Democratic Party to influence the Catholic Church in the United States .Father Lombardi , who was papal spokesman during the Benedict Benedict , noted that the former pontiff offered a substantially different account of his resignation from the one offered by Negri , and he his so " publicly before the cardinals gathered in Consistory and the world " and again in an interview book with Peter Seewald titled Last Testament .
