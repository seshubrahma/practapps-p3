" President Donald Trump lost the popular vote by several million ballots to Hillary Clinton in November , but eclipsed the 270 electoral votes President Donald Trump needed to win .   President Donald Trump won enough states to give President Donald Trump 56 .9 % or 306 Electoral College votes .That places President Donald Trump 45th out of 58 US presidential campaigns in the ranking of winning percentages going all the way back to George Washington â€™s victory in the election of 1789 .
