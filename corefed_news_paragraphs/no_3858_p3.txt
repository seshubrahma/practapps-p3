the Trump administration’s a legal precedent that would make it more difficult to revisit the Act, the   regulatory reform law many view as enshrining Too Big To Fail rather than combatting it .It would also be an unforced error .The Trump administration could avoid it by it the Justice Department to drop the appeal the Trump administration’s Steve Mnuchin , who the Trump administration’s heads FSOC , could inform the DOJ that the council no longer objects to the district court ’s ruling .Dropping an appeal even this late in the process is hardly without precedent .
