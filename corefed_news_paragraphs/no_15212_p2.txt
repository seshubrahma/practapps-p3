That neglect is undercutting our country ’s strategic effectiveness in using military force .When I served on the legal staff of the National Security Council , perhaps our most vital responsibility was to work with top lawyers across the government to ensure that America ’s use of violence abroad was lawful .We scrutinized targets proposed by the Defense Department , scoured reports on those targets from the intelligence community , and ultimately ensured that a community of lawyers could articulate on paper , to collective satisfaction , why a potential drone strike or commando raid was lawful .That did n’t always mean We could share every detail with the global public .
