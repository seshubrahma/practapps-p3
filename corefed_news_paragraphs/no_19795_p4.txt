Why did n’t the public hear anything about this matter until five months after the FBI received the memos ?CNN does not report on the FBI the FBI FBI the memos got the information only that the Rome contact took place in August .So it is possible the FBI Rome slow in reacting to the initial " over the the FBI the FBI in Rome .I ’d like to know the precise timeline of activity from the Rome of first contact to better understand whether the bureau should have been moving with greater effort and urgency on a matter of such significance .
