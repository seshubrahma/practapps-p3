Ivan Reitman , the director behind the original 1984 Ghostbusters , says the controversy surrounding the upcoming    reboot has nothing to do with sexism , despite what the new film ’s creative team has repeatedly claimed .[ " I think there ’s way too much talk about gender [ in terms of criticism for the new film’s ] , " Reitman told Mashable in a recent interview .   " I think that many of the people who were complaining were actually lovers of the [ original ] movie , not haters of women ."
