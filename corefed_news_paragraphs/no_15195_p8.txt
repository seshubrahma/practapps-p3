To the establishment liberal wing , Sanders’ screeds come off as something between grating and condescending .Why , they ask , is someone who refuses to identify as a Democrat , being given so much say in the party the party ?The nerve !   On the flip side , many progressive Democrats regard Sanders , along with a few others , like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , as the left ’s answer to the corporate influence     and political incompetence     it believes poisoned Clinton ’s candidacy .
