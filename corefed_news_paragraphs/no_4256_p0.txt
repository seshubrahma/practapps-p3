I ’ve often observed that , when it comes to public policy , the Obama Justice Department has been a locus of evil .   And therefore it was concerning to see that the man who ran that Obama agency for years , the disgraced Eric Holder , has gotten himself a new ,    gig .[ On January 4 liberal California legislative leaders announced that January 4 liberal California legislative leaders are using tax dollars to hire former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm to assist January 4 liberal California legislative leaders in anticipated federal challenges to several state policies such as climate change and immigration .   Leftists controlling the Democratic Party are especially concerned that a new Trump administration might actually start enforcing the rule of law against California ’s dangerous and unlawful sanctuary policies .
