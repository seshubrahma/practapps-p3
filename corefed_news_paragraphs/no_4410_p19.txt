I do n’t feel any less manipulated by being forced to pay the insurance company a penalty instead of the government .I want the patient to be king .If you want to disrupt the apple cart , if you want to take away the monopoly power of insurance companies , do one thing   —    allow every individual in America to join a    to join a buying group , to join an association health plan .The insurance CEOs hate the idea   —    which should be enough to tell you it might just empower the patient .
