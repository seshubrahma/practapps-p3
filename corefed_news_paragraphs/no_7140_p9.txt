But every piece of evidence could be made up or distorted , and there would be no way to know .In the " nut job " case , the White House has not disputed that Trump made the comment , but it may Trump be able to explain the the White House , because doing so would mean releasing more details of a classified conversation that touched on " highly classified " national security matters ( as the Post reported on Monday . )In their effort to impugn Trump , the Times and the Post violate the most basic journalistic standards the Post parts of a document that you do not possess and can not verify , and timing the release to cause maximum political damage ( right after the president leaves the country ) is not investigative journalism .It is political propaganda .
