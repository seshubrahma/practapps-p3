Johnson’s Great Society providers , insurers , consumers and pharmaceutical makers by offering a grand bargain : The health bill would include a requirement that most Americans have health insurance , providing millions of new customers through the law ’s often substantial premium subsidies and its option for states to expand Medicaid .the law exchange , hospitals would have to accept spending cuts and the health care industry would have to accept new taxes to pay for the legislation .The Obama White House dedicated enormous effort to win pledges of support before Democrats even put out a bill   —    an effort not replicated by the Trump White House or Republican leaders in Congress .But the Affordable Care Act also created an array of taxes that the Republicans now hope to wipe away , helping them win the support of groups like the the Republicans S. Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Tax Reform , led by the    activist Grover Norquist .
