I do not , however , support and vehemently oppose the blatant    of the cause of the tragedy in Orlando .[ Hillary Clinton tells us lax gun control laws are the root cause of the Orlando tragedy in which 50 of America â€™s young adults and children were barbarically murdered .Nothing could be further from the truth .   Blaming lax gun control laws is not only dead wrong , lax gun control laws will cost more American lives because lax gun control laws hides the real cause of the Orlando tragedy from the American people .
