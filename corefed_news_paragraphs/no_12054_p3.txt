you dare restrict my First Amendment right .Do nâ€™tyou dare make me bake a    cake .Never forget that these are the same    who believe the government has the power to force you to participate in the sacramentalization of sin to risk your eternal soul by baking a    cake or participating in a    wedding by doing the flower arrangements .
