At the G20 summit in China , President Obama now tells us our we our it wrong and that we our behind the rest of the European Union in terms of trade priorities .What a way to treat your oldest and closest ally .I suspect the British public will now view him President Obama an object of contempt .Given that Trump was clear about Brexit both during and after the campaign , I can now see this issue being a real political football between now and polling day on November 8th .
