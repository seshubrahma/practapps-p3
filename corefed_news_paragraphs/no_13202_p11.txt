Look , I do n’t want to see    racism .I do n’t want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following .Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation , and America and bigotry ,    misogyny , all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America .So I ’m not looking for Mr. Trump to change a policy that more aligns with my own .
