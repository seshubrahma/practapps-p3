All Nowruz ’s symbolic purification Nowruz was exciting for me as it meant we were symbolic purification talk wear us clothes that day     and that meant a mall visit , during which I could make a case for some impractical Wet Seal creation ( " We have to do us for Persia ! "I ’d cry , waving some lacy tube top on sale ) .   And all sorts of    foods entered our lives then and only then too .The Persian cookies ( walnut , chickpea , almond , rice ) from the Persian grocery stores in LA ’s " Little Persia " were my favorite .
