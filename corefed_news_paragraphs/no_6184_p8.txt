The leading factor , seven separate factors to the poll , was the national anthem protests , which scored " yes " at a rate of 56 percent .But , Cote says do n’t worry about that , because the " closer to patriotic " Kaepernick says he ’s done with kneeling during Kaepernick National Anthem .Interesting how he made that decision now that Kaepernick is effectively unemployed and looking Kaepernick another    dollar contract from a team that will give him a place on the bench Kaepernick the 2017 season and beyond .So , no more kneeling for Kaepernick now , but as a Kaepernick to any team owner " brave enough and smart enough " to sign him , you might want to Kaepernick his socks first .
