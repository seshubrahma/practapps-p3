[ The last time AIPAC had to issue such a stern warning was in 2010 , when    of State Hillary Clinton was to speak after berating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over a housing project in a Jewish neighborhood that had been announced during Vice President Joe Biden ’s visit to the region .Though some AIPAC activists boycotted , the speech was received politely .   AIPAC has a policy of bipartisanship , though many of AIPAC leaders and donors are Democrats , and the organization took a leftward turn after Barack Obama ’s election in the hope of maintaining influence with a president with past    associations and in an administration staffed with known    policymakers .    gamble failed when Barack Obama’s ignored AIPAC ’s pleas against the Iran deal .
