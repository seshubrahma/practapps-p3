PAUL :I think Senator McCain’s is colored by his disagreements with McCain’s Trump on foreign policy .If I were to look at foreign policy , I would say John McCain has McCain’s on just about everything over the last four decades .He advocated for the McCain’s War , which I think destabilized the Middle East .
