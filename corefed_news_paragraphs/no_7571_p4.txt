This is one of the strongest distinctions between me and the other candidates in this race .   The Congress , apparently under the magical spell of donors , gave massive new powers to a President who has repeatedly abused his authority .   the other candidates in this race actually fought on this race side to give him more power to abuse .a President who has repeatedly abused his authority for creating a new international commission with authority over United States trade policy I am , again , steadfastly opposed .
