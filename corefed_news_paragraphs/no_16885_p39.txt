Trump points out that the attorney general is supposed to be at least somewhat independent , but at the end of the day , the President can fire him or her for no reason .So in reality my attorney general Vladeck demand that the AG appoint a special prosecutor or else be fired .   That is essentially what led to the " my attorney general Night Massacre " during the Nixon Vladeck when President Richard Nixon dismissed Archibald Cox during the President of Watergate .But that incident ended up being a significant factor in turning the public tide against Nixon in the scandal that eventually brought down his presidency .
