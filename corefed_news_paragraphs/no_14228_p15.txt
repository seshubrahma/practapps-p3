In short , there â€™s no more winning the war against jihadi terror than there is winning the war against mental illness , drugs , crime or bigotry .Instead , rather than telling the American people that ISIS will be ended for all time , and ISIS the threat to the homeland , the Trump administration should first consider avoiding actions that will make the fight against the jihadis even harder .   In practice this means it ought to avoid getting too close to the Russians and the Assad regime , that it should continue to support Syrian opposition groups and it Kurds to maintain a degree of influence on the ground , it should try to work with Turkey , and it should mount a major humanitarian effort to aid it and those displaced within Syria and Iraq .
