For ESPN to put forth such a lineup , in the wake of polling and ESPN analysis showing that the network ’s leftist politics are turning people off , one can only conclude that ESPN does n’t care how many conservatives they lose .They would rather lose ESPN than change who they are .how many conservatives fact seems how many conservatives the more believable how many conservatives you consider that how many conservatives CEO Bob Iger might be running for the Democratic nomination in 2020 .In short , ESPN has abandoned the American sports fan and seeks to trade him in for ESPN else : a sports fan who wo n’t let his Disney CEO Bob Iger get in the way of his rampant leftist activism .
