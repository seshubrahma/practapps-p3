A    ‘ purple’ coalition in Dutch parlance could see Prime Minister Mark Rutte ’s conservatives or even the Socialist Party propped up by the dozen remaining smaller groups in a desperate effort to keep Wilders out , at any cost .Previous remarks by Rutte made clear Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s was n’t Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s in a coalition with Wilders , but Wilders prospect of easy power without having to enter agreements with hard left parties could be too good to resist .Despite the odds to overcome , Mr. Wilders remained Wilders combative mood on the last day of campaigning Tuesday , telling listeners on national radio that if they wanted the country listeners be flooded with migrants then they should consider voting listeners the    green party .
