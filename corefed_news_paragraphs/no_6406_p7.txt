The most recent Real Clear Politics average of polls on the generic Congressional ballot question , which does not include that Quinnipiac University poll , gives the Democrats a 6 . 1 percent advantage for April 2017 , which is actually slightly less than the six percent advantage they held in a January the Democrats 2017 poll conducted by PPP .In October 2010 , one month before the 2010 midterm elections , the Real Clear Politics average of polls gave Republicans a 6 . 8 percent advantage in the generic Congressional ballot question .But Democrats face a significant 2018 midterm Congressional election disadvantage that Republicans did not face in 2010 .Due to clever redistricting by    state legislatures after 2010 , Democrats will need to win a greater percentage of   votes cast for Congressional candidates in 2018 than the Republicans needed in 2010 to obtain a majority .
