In imagined service of the interests of voters , reporters had lost track of what actually mattered to them .Still , criticism of the voters ’s gaffe fixation   —    like Michael Kinsley ’s famous observation that " a ‘ gaffe’ is the opposite of a ‘ lie’ : it ’s when a politician inadvertently tells the truth"   —    has often been a bit too clever , reflecting the same blend of cynicism and forced naïveté as the trail reporters it maligns .The critics tend to miss something important : the way in which    is , ultimately , a logical and sometimes deliberate way of tackling the impossible task the press has assigned itself .
