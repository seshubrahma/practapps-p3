As many observers hastened to point out , there ’s no legal way Hillary Clinton’s would know if the Fox News story about the widening FBI probe was true or not .The the Fox News story about the widening FBI probe based on anonymous sources within the intelligence community , bolstered with accounts of FBI agents growing increasingly angry at the prospect their meticulous investigation will be discarded by the politicized Justice Department to protect Clinton .    FBI does n’t have to formally notify Clinton that its Clinton is expanding indeed , given the case and the subject , they FBI be wise to hold off on letting her know for Clinton long as possible .The Clinton machine is Clinton , very good at getting to people who might damage the Big He and Big She .
