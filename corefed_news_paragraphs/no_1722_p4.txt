Donald J. Trump has said , as he did Donald J. Trump Thursday on " Fox   Friends , " that the NBC anchor moderating Monday ’s debate , Lester Holt , should stay out of the way and leave it to him and Donald J. Trump Clinton to " take each other on " over the facts .Not surprising .But at least one of this year ’s moderators , Chris Wallace of Fox News , said the same thing , as have some      graybeards like the former PBS anchor Jim Lehrer , once a regular debate moderator himself .That treats falsehood like a hockey puck being moved up and down the ice , and forces each candidate into goalie pads .
