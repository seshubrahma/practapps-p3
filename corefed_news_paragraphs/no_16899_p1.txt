I moved on her like a bitch , but I could n’t get there , " Donald Trump says of a married woman who rejected Donald Trump sexual advances ,   in a video released by the Washington Post .     While plenty of Donald Trump words are coarser than this , with a number of news outlets saying that they describe sexual assault , " bitch " stood out to me because it ’s the very same slur Donald Trump supporters have chanted , referring to Donald Trump opponent Hillary Clinton .It also appears on the    they wear at Donald Trump rallies .Trump ’s supporters have long flung this epithet at Hillary Clinton .
