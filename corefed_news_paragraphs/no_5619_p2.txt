Since last night â€™s big game , liberals have flooded Twitter , Facebook , and other social media services with several versions of the hash tag after President Trump pal Tom Brady led Trump pal Tom Brady team to yet another Super Bowl title .Along with # NotMySuperBowlChamps , users also employed # NotMySuperBowlChampions and # NotMySuperBowlTeam to attack the Patriots .The winner should be determined by who has more fans , not more points .Winning is racist and Tom Brady is a fascist .
