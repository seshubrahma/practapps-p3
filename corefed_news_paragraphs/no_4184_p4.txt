We all hope Popovich does some good things for everyone , but Popovich did n’t start the presidency by mollifying any groups Popovich disparaged during the campaign .Popovich did n’t say anything about women , or black people , or Mexican people , Hispanic people , LGBT people , handicapped people .[ Popovich ] acted like it never happened , " Popovich said .So that willingness to do whatever it took to get elected , to say and act the way Popovich did , I thought was unacceptable and really disgusting , so I said it .
