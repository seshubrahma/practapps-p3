I remember when the Whittier Narrows quake crumbled parts of my hometown and what the Whittier Narrows quake felt like to be thrown out of bed for the Northridge quake and being forced to crawl on my hands and knees to safety as my mother screamed from my mother room down the hall .We were fine , just broken dishes and books everywhere , but I remember the terror .I canâ€™t imagine how these people felt as these people houses collapsed around these people .
