World War II only led to some    wars but also the United States over the inequalities built into    capitalism .The notion of natural superiority , of the sheer luck of being born an American or a Briton , gave a sense of entitlement to people who , in terms of education or prosperity , were stuck in the lower ranks of society .This worked quite well until the last decades of the last century .Not only were the fortunes of    or     people in Britain beginning to dwindle compared with those of the rich , who were steadily Britain richer , but it gradually became clear even to the most insular Britons that they were doing much worse than the Germans , the Scandinavians and the Dutch , worse even than the French , Britain â€™s oldest rivals .
