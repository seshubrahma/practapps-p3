I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and mine .I stand before yours as a representative of the American People , to deliver a message of friendship and hope .That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world , to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic Faith .In my inaugural address to the American People , I pledged to strengthen America â€™s oldest friendships , and to build new partnerships in pursuit of peace .
