Flake , who has slammed Trump for Donald Trump positions on immigration and Donald Trump racially charged criticism of a Latino judge , reminded Trump that Donald Trump is not up for    until 2018 , according to two sources familiar with what occurred ."It was a bit tense , " Flake told CNN Thursday afternoon . "Donald Trump started out saying that I ’d been critical of Donald Trump , and I have been , frankly , but I think if somebody makes the kind of statements that Donald Trump ’s made against the judge from Indiana     calling Donald Trump a Mexican in a pejorative way     and said the things about John McCain that Donald Trump said , criticizing Donald Trump for being captured , you know , that ’s just beyond the pale to diminish the record of John McCain who spent five years as a prisoner of war .
