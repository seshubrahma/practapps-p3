I wondered , knowing the reputation Petersen has online for being somewhat Petersen a " troll "   —    perhaps an unfair description of a man who simply seeks to challenge the status quo at every opportunity .He describes it better , or Petersen traditionally , as " American contrarianism " .   So how does a     from Independence , Missouri who was raised on a horse farm on the edge of a town called Liberty ( I ’m not making any of this up ) convince conservative America to support him ?Especially with his socially Petersen attitudes .
