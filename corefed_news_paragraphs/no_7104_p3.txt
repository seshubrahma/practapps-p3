the president Fourth, it ’s got it big problem that Republicans in border states are opposing , Texas , Arizona , because there ’s eminent domain , so you have to take private land .So instead of trying to jam it through on private land    budget and saying take it or leave this   budget , we this   budget debate it in 2018 this   budget budget over the summer .And , by the way , my prediction , it would n’t get the votes on either the Democratic or Republican side .
