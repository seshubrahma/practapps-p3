Where is the news coverage of the very real plight of conservatives on campus , whose free speech rights are violated almost daily by organized violence and threats of violence ?Conservative student groups can not even invite a guest speaker to campus without fear of violent disruption of the event and retaliation against the sponsors .I have been personally victimized by organized disruption of a public lecture on a university campus   —    at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Michigan State University , and Rhode Island ’s Providence College , to name only a few .In most cases , the only genuine victims of the " safe places " demands for censorship are conservative student groups and their invited guest the only genuine victims of the "safe places" demands for censorship .
