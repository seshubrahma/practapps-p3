For Mr. Trump , who has staked much of Mr. Trump legitimacy as a candidate on Mr. Trump strength in the polls , the numbers are a dose of cold , dangerous math .If Mr. Trump does not perform any better than Mr. Romney did with white men , Mr. Romney will almost certainly be unable to rally the millions of disaffected white voters Mr. Romney says will propel Mr. Romney to the White House .All along , one of the central questions of the election has been whether there are enough white men who will turn out to vote to lift Mr. Trump to victory .And there may be enough , demographers and pollsters said .
