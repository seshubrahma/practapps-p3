The poise , the coaching , the team spirit and personal achievement that lets a comeback like this happen without really any one big sensational long td play ( although Edelman ’s catch   —    one of the greatest ever ) or unfair call in their favor , can not be touched in the     history of the SB .Without slighting any of the amazing players on their team , I could n’t be prouder today to be a [ Tom ] Brady and [ Bill ] Belichick fan .It is about remarkable character , organization and discipline .   —
