S. leaders pursued the " American System " of    partnership for national development of things like the Erie Canal , the telegraph , the transcontinental railroad , the aircraft industry , the RCA company founded by the U. S. Navy , and much more   …      [ The American System ] consisted of government policies and programs aimed at developing advanced infrastructure and protecting and subsidizing development of intellectual property and manufacturing industries ."This , of course , was antithetical to the      policies , " which Great Britain   —    and eventually the U. S.   —    would come to adopt .
