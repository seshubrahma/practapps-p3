Isolated in an inconspicuous spot near a door , and indifferently lighted , it ’s a sculpture of the It Enthroned from    Scandinavia .Just under three feet tall , cut from a piece of poplar , she has the recessive ,    her of a shy adolescent and the    face of a dove .She ’s one of my usual her in the museum .
