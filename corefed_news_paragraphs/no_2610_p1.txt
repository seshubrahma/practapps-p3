"New York Times reporters have spent over a year covering Donald J. Trump ’s rallies , witnessing so many provocations and heated confrontations at New York Times reporters that the cumulative effect can be numbing : A sharp sting that quickly dulls from repetition .But what struck us was the frequency with which some Donald J. Trump supporters use coarse , vitriolic , even violent language   —    in the epithets some Trump supporters shout and chant , the signs some Trump supporters carry , the    some Trump supporters wear   —    a pattern not seen in connection with any other recent political candidate , in any party .Not everyone attending a Donald J. Trump rally behaves this way .
