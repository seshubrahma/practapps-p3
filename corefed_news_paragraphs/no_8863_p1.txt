Black said on the air : Sanders and Trump have a lot of supporters for that very reason : Sanders and Trump ’re not being bought and paid for by corporate interests .I will say that we need to go a little further , I think that somebody like Trump who is    has an advantage over a lot of people who would like to run for President as an example .I do n’t want to see a scenario where in another four years the only people who can run for our highest office are billionaires .There needs to be some kind of cap on what you can spend .
