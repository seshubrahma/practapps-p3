it â€™s clear to me that Trump Trump sure he Trump not a bigot     and I am inclined to accept this assertion .I think he Trump instead a man who has been so isolated by wealth , power and his Trump moral laziness that he Trump never grown out of the 1950s racial mentality of his Trump in Queens .   As any New Yorker knows , the melting pot metropolis Trump Trump up in is so diverse that people of different races , religions , ethnic groups and other identities rub up against each other all day long .
