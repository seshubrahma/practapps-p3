The Obama administration has vetted and backed .But Donald J. Trump , the American    has gone a step further , at least in Donald J. Trump, the American    remarks , suggesting that Donald J. Trump, the American    will end all support to rebels and perhaps even treat the Syrian and Russian governments as allies in the fight against the Islamic State .Some rebels and civilian supporters say such a move might not make much practical difference , and would at least put the American position out in the open , instead of hiding the American position behind condemnations of Bashar    the Syrian president .Seeking a silver lining , some rebels express hope that American allies like Saudi Arabia and Turkey would then go it alone and defy United States orders not to provide more sophisticated weapons to rebels   â€”    though in the short term , such a cutoff could mean losing supplies of American antitank guided missiles .
