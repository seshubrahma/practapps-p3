No ’lesser of two evils’It may seem strange for someone like me     a longtime and devoted member of the GOP and a former Republican delegate from my home state     to be taking a leadership role in a movement like this one .But I am even more disillusioned by GOP leadership than by our candidate .the GOP party    failed to sound the alarm at the outset of the primaries that the nominee has never been a Republican and does not follow the party ’s platform .
