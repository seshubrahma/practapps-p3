There are of course a few reasons for the U. S. to maintain the United Nations on its home turf   â€”    not least the U. S. fact that the New    organisation allows the U. S. to spy on almost every the U. S. world from the comfort of downtown Manhattan .But the Obama administration has now accidentally heaped pressure on this relationship , and the intelligence community has , as yet , not uttered a peep about it .Too busy working on undermining the next President of the United States with the whole Russia saga , perhaps .Nevertheless , I fully imagine a USexit campaign could take root in 2017 .
