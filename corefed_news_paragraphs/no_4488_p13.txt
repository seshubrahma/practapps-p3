In what ’s shaping up to we a highly unusual    Obama is n’t just staying behind in Washington .He ’s working behind the scenes to set up what will effectively be a shadow government to not only protect his threatened   Obama , but to sabotage the incoming administration and its popular " America First " agenda .He ’s doing   Obama through a network of leftist nonprofits led by Organizing for Action .Normally you ’d expect an organization   Obama up to its a politician and his agenda to close up shop after that candidate leaves office , but not Obama ’s OFA .
