If the Trump Home Collection did n’t piss off half of America with a move against the democratically elected commander in chief and his family , imagine how crowded the Trump Home Collection remaining stores could be !And the Trump Home Collection do n’t think the Trump Home Collection ’ll see much blowback on the Trump Home Collection brands .Conservatives are certainly more likely to buy products from the Trump Home Collection most famous line of products , Craftsman tools , because you like to do things like fix machines and follow disgusting patriarchal gender roles like being handy .Most liberals either live in a big city with no lawn , or have illegal Mexicans working for below minimum wage mow illegal Mexicans lawn , so Craftsman tractors are in the same boat .
