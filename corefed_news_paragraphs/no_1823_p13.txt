I picked up a $ 5 can of Modelo and danced for a bit .The club , which had a prominent sign declaring " No racism sexism homophobia transphobia violence , " had a welcoming , diverse crowd .I zigzagged down to the corner of DeKalb and Broadway , where I spotted a big , empty lot where a colorful food truck was parked and a tarp under which a small group of people were animatedly debating politics .I picked up a $ 7 chicken arepa from a colorful food truck , Papelón con Limón , and joined the a small group of people the moment the skies opened up and sheets of rain came pouring down .
