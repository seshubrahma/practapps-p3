I am not alone .Muslims     and indeed the majority of Americans outside the White House     are united on the urgency of the issue of climate change .In August 2015 , I witnessed over 80 global Muslim leaders from over 20 countries release the Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change in Istanbul , urging world governments to phase out fossil fuels and make a transition to renewable energy to tackle climate change .In December of that year , by signing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change , almost 200 governments set a path to do just that .
