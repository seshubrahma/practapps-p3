In a significant victory for gay rights , the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects gay workers from job discrimination , expanding workplace protections in the landmark law to include sexual orientation .The decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , the highest federal court yet to grant such employment protections , raises the chances that the politically charged issue may ultimately be resolved by the Supreme Court .While an appeal is not expected in this case , another appellate court , in Georgia , last month reached the opposite conclusion , saying that the law does not prohibit the landmark law work for gay employees .The ruling on Tuesday comes as gay rights advocates have voiced concern about the potential rollback of protections under President Trump .
