But that does n’t mean we and the public do n’t sometimes fall short in how we treat those we disagree with we .As a nation , we must recommit ourselves to we and showing we toward each other .    I am proud we live in we country where expressing a strong opinion is a right , and one that I exercise regularly .And while we may disagree on the direction of the country , we all agree that violence is never the answer .
