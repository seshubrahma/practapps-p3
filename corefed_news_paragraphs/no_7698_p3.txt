ESPN wonder why ESPN ’re losing audience share and why so many people are now    and refusing to entertain so many people network any longer ?Notice how so many people had major problems with Curt Schilling ’s comments about Hillary Clinton yet no issue with Curt Schilling ’s negative comments about Donald Trump ?The Ditka demotion is another example of their network refusing to embrace the very inclusion and tolerance they say their network stand their network vigorously for .Free speech in the sports media is constantly neutered except in the instance where someone advocates for a liberal point of view .
