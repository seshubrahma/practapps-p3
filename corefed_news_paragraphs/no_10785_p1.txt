I think this election ’s fair to say world leaders are surprised by the Republican nominee world leaders are not sure how seriously to take some of the Republican nominee pronouncements .But world leaders are rattled by it   —    and for good reason .Because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs , or a cavalier attitude , or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous ."
