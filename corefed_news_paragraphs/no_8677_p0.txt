Notwithstanding his    son ’s genuinely patriotic example , Khizr M. Khan has published papers supporting the supremacy of Islamic law over " " Western law   —    including the very Constitution his   son championed in his   son Democratic National Convention speech attacking GOP presidential nod Donald Trump .[ In 1983 , for example , Khizr M. Khan wrote a glowing review of a book compiled from a seminar held in Kuwait called " Human Rights In Islam " in which Khizr M. Khan singles out for praise the keynote address of fellow Pakistani Allah K. Brohi , a    Islamic jurist who was one of the closest advisers to late Pakistani dictator Gen. Zia    the father of the Taliban movement .   Khan speaks admiringly of Brohi ’s interpretation of human rights , even though it included the right to kill and mutilate those who violate Islamic laws and even the right of men to " beat " wives who act " unseemly ."
