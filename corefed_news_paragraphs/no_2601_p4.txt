Typically , most of the effect of    candidates can be found in their   candidates states , where a selection can help a ticket by a couple of percentage points .There are a few examples of bigger boosts : The selection of Mrs. Palin , for instance , probably helped Mr. McCain by more than five percentage points in Alaska in 2008 .But there are also instances where it ’s hard to identify an effect at all .Mr. Pence ’s home state , Indiana , is already thought to lean toward Mr. Trump .
