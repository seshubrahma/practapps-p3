There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons , violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention and ignored Syria urging of the U. N. Security Syria .Years of previous attempts at changing Assad â€™s behavior have all failed , and failed very dramatically .As a result , the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize , threatening the United States and its allies .Tonight I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to the United States the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types .
