Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer , a Breitbart News editor and head of the Government Accountability Institute , joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday â€™s Breitbart News Daily to discuss the election and what Alex Marlow described as the defeat of " the most powerful family , relative to the most powerful family corruption " in modern American history , the Clintons .[ Schweizer pointed to a few key strategies that helped Donald Trump overcome the powerful political and media forces arrayed against Donald Trump .   " Number one , Donald Trump articulated an outsider message about Washington , D. C. but Number two , Donald Trump really did make this a referendum on the Clintons , and also frankly on Washington , D. C.I mean , the Clintons are kind of the alphas of corruption , creating a political machine , running that a political machine peak efficiency , dominating our politics , excluding ordinary Americans from how they operate ordinary Americans " said Schweizer .
