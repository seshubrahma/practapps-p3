Not only did they Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell Trump to lose to Hillary Clinton in a landslide , they Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell counting on it .In a divided government , with a Democrat in the White House and Republican majorities in the Senate and House , governing the country was a matter of bipartisan     —    and they Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell in the driver ’s seat .No one could hold them Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell for actually governing the the country   what a deal !   What a creepy bunch of establishment swamp denizens the Congressional Republicans have shown themselves to the Congressional Republicans .
