  ( CNN )The upcoming debates are Donald Trump ’s best ( and likely last ) chance to influence the course of this year ’s presidential election .   The three general election debates planned over the next two months are crucial     particularly for the candidate who is behind     because they give voters a chance to see both candidates in both candidates own words , free from the influence of scripted television ads or staged campaign events .A strong performance by the underdog , such as Mitt Romney ’s showing in the first debate against President Barack Obama in 2012 , can force voters to take a second look at a candidate voters may have written off and make the fall campaign competitive once more .
