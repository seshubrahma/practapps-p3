Usher ’s piece reports President Trump ’s policy towards Syria has Syria on the " back burner " while the new White House has dealt with other more pressing issues at home .The position appears to be broadly in keeping with previous public comments by President Trump on the country including a 2013 Tweet where he called President Trump then President Barack Obama to not attack Syria and Syria deal with domestic issues instead .Indeed , the report notes Trump ’s present    policy is n’t much of a development from the ultimate position of the Obama years , which was initially enthusiastic to enact regime change in Syria but Syria off when it became Syria that this would entail conflict with Russia .
