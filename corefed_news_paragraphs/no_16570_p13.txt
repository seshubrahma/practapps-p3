Well , what everyone should understand is that Syria is a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions , with consequences reaching across the globe .It would help if voters knew that a brutal dictator , Bashar    is using poison gas and dropping barrel bombs on civilians that Russia â€™s Vladimir Putin is backing him , and that a brutal dictator, Bashar    rebels fighting the government include both radical Islamists and moderate Kurdish forces fighting alongside groups of moderate Arabs .For voters , this is knowledge is optional .For presidential candidates , it is just the beginning .
