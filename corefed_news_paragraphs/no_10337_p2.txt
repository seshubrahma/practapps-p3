I have to know I weighed in not only in writing but in the voting booth .The media needs to be destroyed .And although voting for Trump wo n’t do it , it ’s something .Essentially , I am voting for Trump because of the people who do n’t want me to , and I believe I must register my disgust with Hillary Clinton .
