It was nice that Vice President Joe Biden announced a " moon shot " against cancer earlier this year it would have been nicer if the Obama administration had put real muscle behind the effort .The    administration could have drawn inspiration from the way that Franklin D. Roosevelt shouldered the vast    effort known as the March of Dimes in the 30s and 40s .That campaign the Obama administration , led to the Salk Vaccine in 1955 .Instead , this administration chose the way of the press release â€”   and not much else .
