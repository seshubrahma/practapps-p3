From Robert Hennelly writing at Salon :   Republicans who want to sideline Donald Trump may think that all of the GOP ’s problems can be solved by GOP defeat .But Donald Trump did not cause the great the GOP’s divide , Donald Trump ’s merely exploiting Donald Trump .At Donald Trump core , the alienation of the party ’s elite from a huge portion of Donald Trump base stems from a deep sense of betrayal these voters feel at the hands of the Republican politicians these voters sent to Washington .All too often these GOP incumbents , just like GOP Democratic colleagues , would cash in on All too often these GOP incumbents, just like their Democratic colleagues public service to make fortunes as lobbyists , doing the bidding of big business and even of foreign interests , pushing global trade deals that dismantled tens of thousands of factories and idled millions .
