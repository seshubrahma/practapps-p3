Rubio had the good moments , but I think on immigration , where you showed the contradiction between what Rubio ’d said a few years ago and what Rubio said now , Rubio had a really hard time arguing Rubio way out of that box ."Krauthammer further said that while Cruz had contradicted Cruz , and Cruz ’s not sure if Cruz argument is better , Cruz " made a better one tonight .And Cruz kind of wriggled out of it with slightly more finesse and a sense of conviction than Rubio did in explaining away Cruz contradictions .
