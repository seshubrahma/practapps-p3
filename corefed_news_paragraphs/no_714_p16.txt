None of this is to say that the white    voters who defined the 2016 cycle will be unimportant in 2018 .The races for Senate seats and governor â€™s mansions will often play out in the same white    battleground states that decided the 2016 election .There are a few competitive    districts in Iowa , New York and Maine with large numbers of white    voters .In a wave election , many more white    districts could come into play elsewhere .
