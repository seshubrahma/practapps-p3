I guess the Trump Home Collection ca n’t be accused of being the rocket scientists of the retail world .Just think of the advantages this presents .the Trump Home Collection ’re closing 150 stores by April .If the Trump Home Collection did n’t piss off half of America with a move against the democratically elected commander in chief and his family , imagine how crowded the Trump Home Collection remaining stores could be !
