The good news is that these problems are fixable , with adequate monitoring and funding to address dam safety issues across the country , regardless of whether the dam is owned by federal , state , local or private entities .Historically , large federal investments in water infrastructure projects have been integral parts of economic policy that have helped to spur growth .The Oroville Dam , which lies north of Sacramento , for example , was completed in 1968 to much fanfare , being the countryâ€™s tallest dam then and now .
