If this has n’t been the worst year ever for truth in politics , I ca n’t think of what was .Nor can anyone tell me .The Republican presidential nominee has produced more falsehoods than the major    sites have identified from a major presidential candidate since they came into existence .The Republican presidential nominee has n’t come anywhere close to that .
