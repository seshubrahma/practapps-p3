"In these times of terror we need more bobbies on the beat , " he said , emphasising the importance of the ordinary community policing which the Police Federation claima has " collapsed " in recent years , causing local intelligence to " dry up " .Nuttall also pledged to tackle the " rampant radicalisation within our prisons " by reversing cuts to prison funding and officer numbers , and to train 4 , 000 new border guards to " properly control our borders "   —    which experts now believe to be " porous " particularly along the coast .Asked how Nuttall would fund these changes , along with a " major increase in resources for MI5 " the UKIP leader pointed to £ 35 billion in savings identified in the UKIP leader party ’s manifesto , mainly from reducing the ballooning foreign aid budget , cutting the controversial High Speed Rail 2 project , and changing the Barnett formula   —    described as a " terrible mistake " by its late creator   —    which sees Scotland receive higher levels of funding than elsewhere in Britain .
