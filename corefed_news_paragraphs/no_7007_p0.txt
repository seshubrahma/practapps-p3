The Beltway consensus is that President Donald Trump lost so badly by pulling the American Health Care Act last Friday that President Donald Trump has permanently crippled President Donald Trump presidency .President Donald Trump may not achieve anything in President Donald Trump first 100 days ( as if President Donald Trump has n’t already ) President Donald Trump may not even last a full term .[ You do n’t have to believe that President Donald Trump plays    chess like a savant to understand that these conclusions are premature ,    ( especially for NeverTrumpers eager to seize on any stumble ) and perhaps wrong .   The fact is that the House Republican bill had to fail for President Donald Trump to fulfill President Donald Trump promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare .
