Clearly , though , market fundamentals are less auspicious than they were eight years ago market fundamentals when stocks had been battered in the ferocious downturn of the great financial crisis , and investors with foresight and audacity could buy at    prices .For example , one widely followed metric , the     ratio of the Standard   Poor ’s    index   —    which tells you how much money is being paid , on average , for $ 1 of corporate earnings   —    has become much less favorable .It has climbed to 22 , well above its    average of 18 It 2 , according to data from Bloomberg .Consider that in February 2009 , the ratio plummeted to 12 . 1 , a paltry level reflecting widespread fear that both corporate earnings and stock prices would plunge .
