I think it ’s a pretty good idea , I think it ’s a pretty good exercise that citizens have to validate their own information , but the fact ismost of us do n’t itthose skills , do n’t have that kind of time citizens and do n’t have the perspective to do that .So , for instance , almost all of those reports , and all of the analysis that you gather , probably is   —    as President Bollinger said   —    pure opinion , not fact .
