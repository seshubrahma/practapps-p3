To walk Fifth Avenue north from 34th Street to Central Park this season is to discover a startling paucity of merchants making more than a token nod to the holidays in their window displays .Never mind elves or Santa or Rudolphthe    Reindeer .Barely a snowflake is to be found at    retailers like Zara , the North Face , Urban Outfitters , Uniqlo , Fossil , Tommy Bahama , Oakley , Guess , Desigual , Sephora or HM .
