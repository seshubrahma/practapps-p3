I assumed Trump every new straw would Trump the last one .I was wrong .The hits kept coming .From his flirtation with    conspiracy theories to his promises to Trump the American military to commit war Trump , nothing seemed to matter to voters who believed in him and who would support him , as Trump himself Trump , even if he Trump someone dead in broad daylight .
