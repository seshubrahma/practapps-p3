At end of the day the legal issue is quite straightforwardbut I would note that the birther theories that Donald has relying on , some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U. S. soil , but have two parents born on U. S. U. S.Under that theory , not only would I be disqualified , Marco Rubio would be disqualified , Bobby Jindal would be disqualified â€”   and interestingly enough , Donald J. Trump would be disqualified .( Applause )
