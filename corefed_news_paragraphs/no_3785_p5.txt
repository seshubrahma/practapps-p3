Lorraine Carol Minnite , a professor of political science , as well as an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers    jumped to an educators listserve to Rutgers participation of professors , teachers , and educrats across the country to oppose Trump ’s commission .The message , also circulated by Rick Hasen , a leader in urging academics to oppose any election integrity projects , called on the education community to " resist participation " in the commission .If the President does indeed create a commission to study voter fraud and voter suppression in the American election system to be headed by the Vice Preisdent [ sic ] and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , I ’m calling on scholars of election administration to resist participation of any kind in such an effort .We should expect a    Commission to find " evidence " of rampant voter fraud across the U. S. and to recommend proposals to amend the Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act to require     to register and a national voter ID requirement , among other changes that will be damaging to voting rights and therefore , damaging to democracy .
