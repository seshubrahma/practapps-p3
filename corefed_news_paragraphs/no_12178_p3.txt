I witnessed with my own eyes the Christianity taking place in our communities .It Syriac Catholic Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem Joseph III Younan no longer acceptable nor permissible to close one â€™s eyes to the atrocities that are being allowed in the 21st century .We hope that American politicians can echo this message throughout the country and speak about this injustice .The Christians in Iraq and Syria are hopeful    Trump and his incoming administration will help secure peace throughout the region for all people and for the sake of humanity .
