The conventional wisdom holds that sweeping demographic shifts propelled Barack Obama to the presidency .So here ’s a simple question : Why have n’t these demographics swept Hillary Clinton to a big polling lead and a smooth glide to victory ?Donald J. Trump , after all , has alienated just about every growing demographic group and every category that helped push Barack Obama to victory .The biggest reason is that demographic change was an overrated contribution to Mr. Barack Obama victory , and it will help Mrs. Clinton Hillary Clinton the margins this year .
