But it was me yesterday and it may be you or YOUR favorite candidate tomorrow .A few years ago while still in Congress , I had been invited by the College Young Republicans to speak on the campus of the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill .As I watch what is happening at Trump rallies I am reminded of my own experiences and the thought that I have never seen a group of conservative students   —    or adults   —    pull the same violent crap on liberal speakers .
