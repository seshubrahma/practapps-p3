Some large states with significant nonwhite populations have been out of reach for Republican candidates for much of the last three decades California , New York , New Jersey , Illinois and Pennsylvania have voted for every Democratic nominee since 1992 .Mr. Obama also won Florida twice , and Mrs. Clinton has a lead there now in part because Mr. Trump is unpopular with Hispanics .Together those six states offer 166 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency .Mr. Trump is at Mr. Trump greater disadvantage than other recent Republican presidential nominees because of his dismal standing with nonwhite Mr. Trump    and female voters .
