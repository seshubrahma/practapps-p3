worked to strike a deal to allow states to repeal Obamacare regulations known as essential health benefits and community ratings .The essential health benefits rule prevents health insurers from pricing health care plans based on age , gender , or health status , while the essential health benefits provision requires that health plans cover services such as mental health , pregnancy , and hospital visits .However , states can only receive these waivers if states opt into the bill ’s $ states billion    pool fund to subsidize coverage for older and less healthy patients .The    pools would lower costs for these individuals and lower premiums for everyone else .
