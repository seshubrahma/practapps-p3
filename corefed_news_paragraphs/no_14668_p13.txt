At town hall meetings across the country    they are hearing from angry and anxious constituents Republicans what is the mirror image of the tea party protests we saw when the Affordable Care Act was being debated seven years ago .    In his speech , Trump said , " Mandating every American to Trump    health insurance was never the right solution for our country .   The way to make the country available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance , and that is what we are going to do . "    When the President and his team finally delve into the complexities of health care , he may come to regret that politically pleasing stanza his    Barack Obama also opposed mandates , until confronted with the reality that to achieve the goal of covering the uninsured , including Americans with    conditions , you must have everyone , from the young and healthy to the older and frail , in the pool .    The House plan the President tacitly endorsed Tuesday    would cost millions Barack Obama , return the country to the days when millions companies could refuse people with    conditions and remove myriad consumer protections that guarantee patients a minimum standard of coverage while preventing them from losing it if they become seriously ill .
