Hillary Clinton has never had to worry about being alone in Hillary Clinton home in an emergency situation .Unlike most Americans , Hillary Clinton does not have to think about dialing 911 if Hillary Clinton hears the glass break downstairs at 2 o’clock in the morning .   And Hillary Clinton never has to wait the national average of 11 minutes from the time Hillary Clinton calls for help to the time the police arrive .Despite that reality , Hillary Clinton does n’t believe you and I have the individual right to keep firearms in our homes to protect our and our families .
