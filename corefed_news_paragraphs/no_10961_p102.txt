I posit that there is a second window   —    the underton window , shall we say , constituting the range of unacceptable ideas , words , and thoughts on society .As the overton window narrows , the underton window broadens .And when the underton window gets bigger than the overton window   —    well , it ’s time for polite society to panic .
