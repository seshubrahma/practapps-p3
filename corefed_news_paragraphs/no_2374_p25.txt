be aware that sampling error will play a bigger role than usual .The gains from big samples are smaller than you might think , so do nâ€™t give a lot of extra credit for a poll that goes much higher than 1 , 200 .Often , the polls with huge samples are actually just using cheap and problematic sampling methods .If the sample is less than 400 , the result should be considered no more than a ballpark estimate .
