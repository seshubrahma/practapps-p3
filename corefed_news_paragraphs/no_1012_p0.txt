I ’m a fairly big guy   —       with plenty of mass to soak up alcohol   —    but I was being particularly careful as I hopped ( no pun intended ) from brewery to brewery in San Diego .Touring the dozens of worthy beer options in the sprawling , beautiful city requires a car , and I was being conservative with my intake .But this Electric Youth coffee pale ale from Thunderhawk Alements was just too good .
