These the movements which led to Brexit and the Donald Trump n’t endorsements of the kind of arbitrary authority and abuse of state power we saw in the 1930s but rather very explicit rejections of them the movements which led to Brexit and the Donald TrumpIf you really want to use the word " fascistic " in a modern context , you could more aptly apply it you really want to use the word "fascistic" in a modern context , say , the remoteness and democratic unaccountability of the European Commission , to the corruption and profligacy of the D. C. Establishment , to the businesses ruined and the lives broken by overregulation and Big Government meddling which have led to mass unemployment and poverty in what were once thriving first world nation states , to the ordinary citizens all over Europe being told by their the ordinary citizens all over Europe , " Here is some cultural enrichment for you from some new friends from the Middle East   —    and if you do n’t like it , tough , because that ’s the future we ’ve decided to impose on you "   …      The fact that an intelligent ,      man like the Archbishop of Canterbury can not see the good in Trump and Brexit and the fundamental evil in the systems they Trump and Brexit overthrown speaks more eloquently than a thousand clever articles by people like me as to why the revolutions we experienced in 2016 and the ones we we going to go on experiencing in 2017 are so very , very necessary .The Archbishop of Canterbury is a decent ,    man with a very lofty position in the global hierarchy : but then , so are large numbers of many of the other Establishment types who fought so hard for Remain and so hard against Donald Trump .
