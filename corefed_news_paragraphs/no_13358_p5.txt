It ’s beyond hilarious to read screeds against the evils of " direct democracy " coming from the party that was , just two years ago , telling us the midterm elections were meaningless because President Obama should be an absolute dictator certified by democratic vote , and maybe it was timePresident Obama should be an absolute dictator certified by democratic vote do away with midterm elections , or possibly even Congress .Obama himself announced President Obama only was direct democracy    as long as it empowered him ,    he President Obama n’t even President Obama to see the ballots , because he can read the President Obama of people who do n’t vote , and would defy the authority of Congress on their behalf .
