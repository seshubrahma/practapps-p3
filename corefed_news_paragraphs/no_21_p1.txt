But Megyn Kelly move , announced Tuesday , has broader implications for the television news industry , raising new questions about the future of Fox News , where Megyn Kelly was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with    ideology , and of NBC News , which has been a longtime bête noire for conservative press critics .And it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives Jan. 20 with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump .The Murdoch family , which controls Fox News ’s parent company , 21st Century Fox , had become so invested in Ms. Kelly as a franchise that ’s parent company, 21st Century Fox were prepared to pay Ms. Kelly a salary of more than $ 20 million a year .People inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the Murdochs were staking the network future on a journalist who effectively made Ms. Kelly name by upending the expectations for a Fox News anchor   —    for instance , by publicly taking on the Republican nominee for president .
