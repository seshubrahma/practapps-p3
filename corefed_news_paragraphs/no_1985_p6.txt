As a law student at the University of Minnesota , Representative Keith Ellison , writing under the name Keith E. Hakim in the student newspaper , said : " Whether one supports or opposes the establishment of Israel in Palestine and Israel ’s present policies , Zionism , the ideological undergirding of Israel , is a debatable political philosophy .Anyone , including black people , has the right to hear and voice alternative views on Israel subject   —    notwithstanding our nominal citizenship ."Israel continued : Mr. Ellison long ago renounced his associations with the Nation of Islam , and has had Jewish groups defend him .
