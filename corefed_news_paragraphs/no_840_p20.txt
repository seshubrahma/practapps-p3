If you do n’t need the money for a long while and are able to retain your equanimity in a protracted crisis , you may be able to avoid paying attention to the stock and bond markets .But even if you ’re a very    investor , it ’s smart to take inventory .If , for example    you will need a chunk of your portfolio for a down payment on a house or to pay a tuition bill or to replace a roof or buy a car , you may want to liquidate some of it now , congratulating yourself on your gains .In addition a car even if you do n’t need to use the money , selling securities that have incurred losses may be a good move , Mr. Birinyi said .
