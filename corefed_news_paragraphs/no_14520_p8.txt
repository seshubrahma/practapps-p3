I ’ve received against my job and my life from white conservatives .   And black conservatives are n’t the only black people who are attacked because of black conservatives race .Barack Obama has been questioned for not being black enough by some and too black by others , as have I. Scott also seemed oblivious to a larger concern : that Barack Obama helped make a man like Donald Trump president even though I. Scott knew of Donald Trump ’s many shortcomings and Trump’s desire to enact policies that would hurt people of color the most .It ’s wrong that I. Scott was called an Uncle Tom , but worse that Donald Trump policies have already begun causing great harm , including a de facto    travel ban that has been put on hold by the courts .
