A billionaire , a queen and an American first lady walked into a public charter school on Wednesday , collecting bouquets , examining owl pellets and hugging students amid the    clicking of cameras .The visit to Excel Academy , an    charter school , by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , Queen Rania of Jordan and Melania Trump , the first lady , was meant to emphasize the Trump administration â€™s stance on school choice .But it was also part of a day of photo ops intended to cast a softer lens on a presidential administration grappling with several international crises , and provide another glimpse of a first lady whose sporadic appearances in Washington have revealed relatively little about her own leadership style .Earlier in the day , Mrs. Trump and Queen Rania stood behind President Trump and King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House .
