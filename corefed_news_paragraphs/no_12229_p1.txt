Benenson was asked by anchor Kate Bolduan if the Clinton campaign would agree to debate in Brooklyn before New York ’s primary .Benenson responded , " I think what was notable this weekend , was n’t so much that , but in my mind was the Washington Post story with Benenson own campaign talking about how his own campaign ’re poll testing more negative attacks on Clinton .They his own campaign talking about running harsher negatives now .We saw them his own campaign negative ads .
