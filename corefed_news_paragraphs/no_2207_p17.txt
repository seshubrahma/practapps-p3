The nightmare unleashed by Mr. Mateen is a continuation of the shared nightmare we keep reliving   —    from Virginia Tech to Newtown to Aurora to Charleston .The names of the victims may change , but the Greek Chorus reaction is all too familiar .Shock and grief , candlelight vigils and calls for unity , vows for change and legislative paralysis ,    and vitriol , and , in the end , nothing much different   —    other than ,    , South Carolina ’s vote to remove the Confederate flag from State House grounds after the Charleston shooting .It took a    filibuster by Senator Chris Murphy , a Democrat from Connecticut with searing memories of the slaughter of 26 schoolchildren and educators in Newtown , to get modest    measures to the Senate floor .
