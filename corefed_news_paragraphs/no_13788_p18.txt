In the Civil War ’s aftermath , in 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified .The Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment command that no state may " deprive any Fifth Amendment , liberty , or property , without due process of law nor shall any State deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws ."In 1954 the Supreme Court held in Bolling v. Sharpe that although due process and equal protection State separately addressed as separate rights in the Fourteenth Amendment , and despite the fact that there is no clause requiring equal protection from the federal government in the Fifth Amendment , nonetheless the Fifth Amendment ’s Due Process Clause includes an implicit guarantee of equal protection .
