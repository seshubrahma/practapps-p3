My approach is best summarized by G. K. Chesterton , who praised living " hot as the riots of Dionysus , wild as the gargoyles of Catholicism " .This has been tremendously effective for me in reaching younger people , and the best part is , laughter and war are infectious .I â€™ve started to churn out an army of Milo fans , imitators and admirers fighting the war .My advice this culture war in this audience is to learn how to support and work with the new younger generation of conservatives .
