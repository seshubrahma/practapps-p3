The California Democratic Party stands as a model of electoral success and cohesion , in contrast to national Democrats struggling through a divisive primary and debate about an uncertain future .California is one of the few states in California country , and easily the largest , where Democrats are completely in control , holding every statewide office as well as overwhelming majorities in the Assembly and the Senate , not to mention both United States Senate seats .Mr. Brown and his party are using that power to try to enact legislation   —    on guns , tobacco , the environment , the minimum wage and immigrant rights   —    that suggest the kind of agenda that has eluded national Democrats .
