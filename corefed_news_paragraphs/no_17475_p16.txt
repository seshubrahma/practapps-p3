Mrs. Trump can say she ’s an idiot ( although , I question whether that term applies to Mrs. Trump woman who speaks five languages fluently ) .Such attacks are petty and small , but in the United States you have the right to be petty , small , offensive and even insulting toward Mrs. Trump and anyone else you like .       What you do n’t have the right to do is to lie about her in a defamatory way .Sullivan will give you no shelter if you Mrs. Trump wish to shout " free speech " without knowing what that means .
