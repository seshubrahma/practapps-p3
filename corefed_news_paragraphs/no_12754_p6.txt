I am not placing all of these movements on the same footing in terms of my personal position , nor am I suggesting that , because I find these movements to be analogous , these movements are equal .But there are , in my opinion , strong commonalities , both good and bad .Each movement is made up of at least three factions : believers , political insiders and instigators .I saw these divides emerge in the Tea Party , where    " leaders "   —    but really just insiders   —    tried to take control of Each movement to their these divides benefit .
