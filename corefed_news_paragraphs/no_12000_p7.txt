We just get statistics that supposedly demonstrate We vague offense has been perpetrated against the poor , with demands for the remedial seizure of wealth , skipping all that messy business about a trial and evidence .The very notion that political power can achieve economic " equality " is the biggest lie ever told .   You will find nothing of the sort in any place   —    in this century or previous ones   —    where politicians seize power over production and wealth .
