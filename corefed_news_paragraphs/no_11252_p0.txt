Amidst the media hubbub around Donald Trump ’s new accusers , Hillary Clinton campaigned this week with a man who has faced several accusations of sexual assault   —    not former President Bill Clinton , but former Vice President Al Gore .[ Hillary Clinton appeared with former Vice President Al Gore in Miami on Tuesday , focusing Hillary Clinton remarks on climate change .Notably , neither mentioned the accusations against Trump , which Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton surrogates have mentioned at nearly every other opportunity in the past several days .   Clinton and her surrogates likely avoided the topic for a very good reason : former Vice President Al Gore has been accused of worse , and has even faced police investigation for sexual assault , though ( he former Vice President Al Gore never been charged ) .
