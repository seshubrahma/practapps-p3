" What I always tell people is , if you do n’t like the decisions that are being made and you feel like Washington , DC , is unresponsive to you , chances are it ’s because somebody is being paid off or palms are being greased .The reason we do n’t have representative government is because we we corruption , and we we payoffs .That ’s really the root cause , in my mind , of a lot of the issues we ’re talking about today , " he said .
