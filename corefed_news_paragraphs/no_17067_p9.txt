Sociologists have done a lot of work on my Progressive American friends    divide and other common markers between the two Americas .In simple strokes , Progressive Americans tend to live in major metropolises , to be highly educated , to work in knowledge industries like media , tech or academia , and to be less religious .Traditional Americans tend to work with their hands , may have less education , live in rural or suburban areas and have deeply held Traditional Americans Christian beliefs , though there are exceptions to both stereotypes .The true dividing line between the two Americas is not geography , race or education .
