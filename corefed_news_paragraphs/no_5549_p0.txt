The lawyer representing the State of Hawaii in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit today has stated the collection of data with regards honor killings should be removed from President Trump ’s Executive Order in order to " pass constitutional muster " .[ In his arguments , Neal Katyal stated today that the collection of such data as outlined by President Trump’s Executive Order contravenes the Establishment Clause , in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion   …     " .   In doing so , Katyal appears to Neal Katyal making the case that honor killings   —    murder committed in the name of restoring a family ’s dignity following discouraged behaviour within fundamentalist homes   —    is in itself Islamic .
