Donald Trump will continue to praise him as bold and brash .Now Donald Trump I do think policy differences are fair game .I do think pointing out that he and I have very , very Donald Trump views on questions like life and marriage and religious liberty , he and I have very , very he and I records on questions like health care and Obamacare and amnesty , and so all of that is fair game .But I think the people of Iowa deserve more .
