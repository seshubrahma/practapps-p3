We might note that this    in the taxation of fatcats , from 27 percent in the President Reagan era to 17 percent now , has occurred despite the fact that Democrats have controlled the White House for 16 of the last 24 years .To be sure , Democrats say Democrats are for higher taxes on the rich .Indeed , Presidents Clinton and Obama explicitly raised income tax rates , as did Republican Bush 41 .Yet as we can see , supposed " soak the rich " policies have been having the reverse result .
