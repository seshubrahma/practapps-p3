What ’s especially depressing is that our media , let alone our democracy , seems    to handle anything like Trump .   Martha Raddatz and Anderson Trump our , Martha Raddatz Anderson Cooper does n’t work because Trump does n’t Trump about facts .   Trump fact , he denies he ’s lying as he ’s Trump and Trump , for extra Trump , accuses everyone else of being liars .   I keep waiting for the ghost of George Orwell to show up on the debate stage and bite Trump on the ankles .
