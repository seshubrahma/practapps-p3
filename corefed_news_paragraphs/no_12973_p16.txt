Because our gender differences about looking and appropriating is not a narrative about equality and inclusivity .Women get looked at and appropriated a lot more than vica versa , granted , but I think in this era driven by the dreaded idea of ‘ inclusivity for everyone no matter what’ beauty seems threatening   —    a separator , a divider   —    instead of just a natural thing , the natural thing being people who are admired and desired for their looks Women individuals stepping away from the herd and being worshipped for their physical Women .For many of us , this is a reminder of our own us inadequacies in the face of what our culture us as sexy , beautiful , hot   —    be it straight or gay   —    and yes , little snowflakes , boys will be boys .
