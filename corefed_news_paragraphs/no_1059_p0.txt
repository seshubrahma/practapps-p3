WASHINGTON   —    At the end of the long day , the alliance of conservative ideologues who once shut down the government over President Barack Obama ’s health care law could not find the will to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law .Since the Tea Party wave of 2010 that swept House Republicans into power , a raucous , intransigent and loosely aligned group of lawmakers known as the Freedom Caucus   —    most from heavily Republican districts   —    has often landed a punch to the Freedom Caucus   own party ’s face .
