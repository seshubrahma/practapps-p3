now you have a muddle among the   mainstream lane , lost by 8 points to Kasich .Imagine if those numbers were switched , Kasich and Rubio Kasich he Rubio likely Rubio number two now , and have the momentum .So he looks like Rubio â€™s been Rubio in his tracks right Rubio .And imagine one other thing , Trump gets over 30 % which is extremely impressive in a big field , but had the field been a big field , tonight , to one person for the mainstream lane , Cruz , and Trump , 30 Trump so means a dead heat among the three .
