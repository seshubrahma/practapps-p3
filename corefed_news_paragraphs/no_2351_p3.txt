No one has relegated me to a gas chamber .And no one has hit me with anything like the sustained racist and sexist barrage that forced the " Saturday Night Live " and " Ghostbusters " star Leslie Jones to temporarily leave Twitter in disgust .Now that Twitter is contemplating putting Twitter up for sale , we can only wonder what lucky suitor is going to walk away with such a charming catch .Twitter is seeking a buyer at a time of slowing subscriber growth ( Twitter hovers above the 300 million mark ) and " decreasing user engagement , " as Jason Helfstein , the head of internet research at Oppenheimer   Company , put it when he downgraded the stock in a report last week .
