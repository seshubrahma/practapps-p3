There is overwhelming demand from American companies     both large and small     for educated , skilled foreign workers to fill jobs in computer programming , coding , medicine and information technology .These are jobs that would be left largely unfilled if not for international workers , as our domestic workforce does nâ€™t consist of graduates with these skills in the enormous numbers we require .This is why it will be critical for Congress and the next president to push for immigration reform that expands the    program .    visas are a cornerstone of the American economic system .
