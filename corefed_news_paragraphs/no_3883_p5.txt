I answer , that the necessity of their concurrence would have a Senate though , in general , a silent operation .It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President , and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice , from family connection , from personal attachment , or from a view to popularity .In addition to this , it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration .In other words , the Senate would ensure that the president did not choose someone on an improper basis , such as because that person was the President member , or a good friend , or perhaps the president owed the nominee money .
