In his book Politics and the English Language , George Orwell wrote , " it is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it : consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy   …     .Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way . "[ Seventy years later , George Orwell ’s insight on the use and abuse of the English language still rings true .Take for example , the    attack on Hungary for being " undemocratic .
