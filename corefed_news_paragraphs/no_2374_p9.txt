In a presidential election year , I generally prefer looking at the registered voter numbers   —    with a caveat .That ’s because many methods that screen for likely voters are poor and yield noisy data .Registered voter samples are larger , and there are n’t additional questions to add statistical noise .But here ’s the caveat : Registered voter polls tend to overrepresent Democrats , so I often focus on the registered voter number and mentally shift it a the registered voter number or two toward the Republicans .
