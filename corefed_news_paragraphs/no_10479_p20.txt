And it was only because of the development of a mass movement all over the world , that my life was saved , and that I can be with you this afternoon , reflecting on the possibilities of building a movement that is building a movement to    our future .And so , let me say that we can not take where we are our granted, it is our that young people are rising up , not only all over this country , but lets remember our movements are connected with what is going on in Brazil , with what is going on in Columbia , with what is happening in Palestine , with what is going on at this very moment in South Africa , because they are struggling again to be able to imagine a future that is a future of freedom .And so let me conclude by saying that there is one river that we have to cross next month .
