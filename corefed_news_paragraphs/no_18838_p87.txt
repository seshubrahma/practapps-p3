Like the 1986 amnesty , this would get a whole lot of people who live here operating inside the system .And it would avoid destroying the lives of countless people with deportations that needlessly separate families , lovers , friends , and acquaintances .If a border wall would make this more politically palatable , that ’s fine .I dislike the symbolism of this wall , but the status quo , where we have large swaths of a wall ,    gaps in parts of the desert that are particularly dangerous to cross , and armed guards on patrol , many of them corrupt , is n’t exactly a symbol of welcome !
