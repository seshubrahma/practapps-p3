In the case of steel , both the United States and global markets for steel products are distorted by large volumes of excess capacity‑‑ much of which results from foreign government subsidies and other unfair practices .The United States has placed more than 150 antidumping the United States orders on steel products , but they have not substantially alleviated the negative effects that unfairly traded the United States have had on the United States steel industry .   Repeated efforts by the the United States encourage other countries to reduce and address the underlying the United States capacity in the steel market have had little meaningful effect .
