Facts and statistics would have meant very little to changing the story in my mind about what it meant to be a Latino man .My facts were wrong , but my story was what mattered to me the story I saw anyone I perceived as a Latino man in public , and I was alone , I would feel myself become anxious .How could facts in me moment of fear for a     girl make any difference ?It would be equivalent to telling someone who is afraid of flying that more deaths occur by car than plane .
