While the rest of the nation can look forward to the rollback of all the excesses and abuses of the Obama years , California ’s    machine is California down on all those disastrous policies , including continued harboring and supporting of illegal immigration ,     environmental regulations , and more onerous tax increases .Just this past week , Gov. Jerry " Moonbeam " Brown announced a $ 5 . 2 billion tax hike to fix the state ’s broken roads .The increase will come from 2 billion tax hike to fix the state’s broken roads gas tax to nearly $ 1 per gallon and also vehicle registration fees .The funds are needed because for years the state has socked away    the state’s general funds to pay for , among other things , generous welfare benefits .
