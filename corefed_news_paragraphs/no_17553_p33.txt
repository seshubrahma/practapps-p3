Rafael was probably the most pessimistic person we met on    the trip .When I asked him about the prospect of Raul Castro    stepping down Rafael a year or so , his response was that a Castro   —      any Rafael   —    would replace him .( Most Cuba experts think it    would Rafael be   a rising star in the party and one of the    first of the    generation to gain power . )Change    in his mind was impossible , no matter how    US    or    tourists arrive on Cuba ’s shores .
