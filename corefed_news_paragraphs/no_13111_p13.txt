Yet   —    and allegiance to the values that truly make America a great country demand that we make this crystal clear   —    Donald Trump ’s candidacy is making this kind of unity across differences incredibly difficult .We are a nonpartisan campaign but not an amoral one .We are compelled We speak ( and I am confident that I can speak for us all ) when I say that Trump ’s statements , proposed policies , and threats of violence concerning undocumented immigrants , Muslims , the KKK , protesters exercising their First Amendment protesters , and others have crossed a very serious line into the territory of fascism and hate speech .America is better than this .
