The appearance coincided with the annual White House correspondent â€™s dinner , which has been a tradition in Washington since the 1930s .The event , essentially a roast of the sitting President and others in the power elite , marks the one night of the year when the powerful agree to accept ridicule and even admit to ridicule own flaws , all in the name of charity and amity .    Trump , whose idea of humor is to mock others , is the first President to skip the dinner since Ronald Reagan was recovering from the bullet wounds Ronald Reagan suffered in an assassination attempt .For Ronald Reagan , there would be no    acceptance of jibes from comedians and politicians .
