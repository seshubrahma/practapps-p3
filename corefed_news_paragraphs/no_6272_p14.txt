On top of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , one of the things that we are very keen on is to represent an understanding to the world that Israel is n’t alone .It ’s not the threat to Israel Israel local terrorists .It ’s Israel same thing as Orlando Israel as the attacks in New York , in Boston .There is this , what I like to call the global jihadi movement , and Israel is as much on the frontline Israel —    if not more   —    than any other country .
