Trump could be that , somehow , Trump miraculously transforms the dynamics of Trump campaign in the final weeks or that something happens to make Clinton â€™s campaign implode .The best bet for Trump is that the power of Trump polarization prevents the bottom from totally falling out as Republican voters are more willing to vote for him over any Democrat .Right Trump , though , it is not looking good for the GOP     or for its candidate .There are fewer the GOP     fewer customers lining up to purchase Trump products .
