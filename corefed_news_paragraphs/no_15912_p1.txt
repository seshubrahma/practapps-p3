Not so much .But this weekend , President Donald Trump , first lady Melania Trump and presumably     Barron are testing the woodsy digs at Camp David , the rural presidential getaway deep in the mountains of Maryland .It will be the President ’s first trip to Camp David , and the President’s first weekend overnight trip away from the White House not at a    property .It ’s an unusual decision for the President , who is widely known as someone who does n’t like to disrupt the President’s daily routine or spend weekends anywhere except at    properties .
