Sen. Dick Durbin ( ) went so far as to call the Federalist Society , an association of conservative lawyers that endorsed Gorsuch , a " special interest group " and launched into an extended diatribe against the validity of judicial originalism , the idea that the constitution and laws ought to be interpreted according to the original intentions of the drafters .Durbin quoted the late liberal Sen. Dick Durbin Court Justice William Brennen as calling the very idea judges can find the intention of the Founders as " arrogance cloaked in humility ."Sen. Chris Coons ( ) who had held out on supporting the proposed filibuster and was posited as a possible partner in a deal to save the    cloture requirement , used the Committee meeting to come out against an up or down vote on Gorsuch .
