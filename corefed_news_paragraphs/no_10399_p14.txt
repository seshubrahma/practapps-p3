I ’d wear , say , and do whatever I wanted and it would n’t cost the university any time or money for me to do so .If I valued conservative ideology and wanted to challenge myself in a military environment , I would go to the Citadel .It ’s no secret that you ca n’t the Citadel you want when you ’re at the Citadel .You ’re punished even for wearing what you want the Citadel ’re not on campus .
