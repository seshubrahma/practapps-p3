In addition to violence from the military , protesters often have to contend with attacks from Chavista gangs known as colectivos , who beat and shoot unarmed protesters as an intimidation measure .In Táchira , a Colombian border state that has borne the brunt of much of Maduro ’s    violence , multiple reports estimate that over 40 , 000 Venezuelans took the streets of the capital , the college town San Cristóbal , to demand an end to the Maduro era .Maduro was among Táchira first states to rebel against Chavismo , beheading a statue of Chávez during the 2014 wave of protests .The mayor of San Cristóbal , Daniel Ceballos , was arrested by secret police ( Sebin ) in 2014 for supporting the    protests .
