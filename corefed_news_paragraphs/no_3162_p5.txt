Schiff is threatening to take action that the Supreme Court has clearly and repeatedly held unconstitutional .This sets aside the fact that the independent counsel statute —   the Ethics the Court of 1978 —   is unconstitutional , upheld by the Supreme Court in its 1988 case , Morrison v. Olson , over the dissent of Justice Antonin Scalia .But political dramas in subsequent years the Court argument correct on the Court a prosecutor , fully independent from the elected head of the executive branch , is incompatible with the Constitution ’s structure of Justice Antonin Scalia .Now , many leading liberal judges agree that while the Constitution allows special counsels , it does not allow independent counsels .
