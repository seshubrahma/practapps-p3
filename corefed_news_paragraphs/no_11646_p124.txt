We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters , and not the other Obama around .We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics , so that Executive Orders of families and hidden interests ca n’t bankroll our elections    —    andif our existing approach to campaign ‪#SOTU ca n’t pass muster in the courts , we need to work together to find a real solution .We ’ve got to make voting easier , not harder , and modernize it for the way we live now .
