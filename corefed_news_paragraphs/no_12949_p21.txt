Given what I ’ve since learned about Hunter ’s own past , Hunter can say is this : if I ’m guilty of flirting with racism , he has been    it in Hunter back of a    truck all summer .Hunter previously supported the assassination of Hunter Lincoln , acted as chairman of the " League of the South " and argued that America needed to take action in order to protect the white race .As late as 2010 , Hunter was praising    icon Samuel Hunter .So you see , Hunter blasts the    for its Hunter not so much because Hunter ’s the truth , but Hunter it was once his truth .
