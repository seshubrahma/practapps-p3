We are celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American Worker .American citizens have worked every job , every occupation , no matter what it might be   â€”    no matter how grueling , how challenging , or even how dangerous .   American citizens wash the windows on our tallest skyscrapers American citizens create works of art from burning fire and molten steel American citizens mine the earth and dive the ocean depths to bring energy into our cities and towns American citizens care for the sick , the elderly , and the wounded and American citizens lay the bricks , mortar , rebar , and concrete that give us places to live , to work , and to thrive .
