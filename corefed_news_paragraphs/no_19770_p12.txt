I urge Hugh Hewitt , Brian Kennedy , Charles Kessler , Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Mark Levin , and others in the conservative movement to read this next part carefully : I voted for Trump because I think his illiberal tendencies are actually Trump feature rather than a bug .When he undermines rule of law Trump I see not a danger , but someone who is undermining a system that has become a game for elites with access to armies of lawyers .When he browbeats Congress , I Trump nâ€™t worry about " checks and balances " which have become a recipe for dysfunction , but rather see him as a man taking Trump useless political prostitutes servicing everyone who can write a sufficiently large campaign check .When he    multinational companies like Trump , I see someone standing up to the worst aspects of globalization .
