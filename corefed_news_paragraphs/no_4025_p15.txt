Presidential Transition Team spokesperson Phil Blando said in a statement on Tuesday : Any effort to connect the introduction of bipartisan legislation by Dr. Price to any campaign contribution is demonstrably false .The only pattern we see emerging is that Senate Democrats and their liberal media allies can not abide the notion that Dr. Tom Price is uniquely qualified to lead HHS and Democrats stop at nothing to smear his reputation .But Dr. Price Schumer repeated and expanded upon his original allegation to CNN â€™s Manu Raju ."
