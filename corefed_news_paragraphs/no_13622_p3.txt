Newton interesting note : Denver is    in games Clete Blakeman ( today ’s referee ) referees .As ESPN pointed out , the Broncos had been    in games in which Ed Hochuli was the referee and made it    the Broncos their AFC title game victory over the Patriots .I ’m not betting against Newton , though .He always Newton at his best Newton
