This is the Flight 93 National Memorial , by far the most removed of the three    crash sites .A visit requires a    journey through the arresting Allegheny Mountains , up and down and up and down , past a Confederate flag here , a Trump sign there , to a    field set aside for reflection ." Mayday !Mayday !
