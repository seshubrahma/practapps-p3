I also thought his smug appearance , constant head shaking , Ruth   outcry Mike Pence Kaine ’s mere repetition of Trump ’s words were " nonsense ," was condescension and arrogance .   Pence is probably wondering Republican Mike Pence he got here ( until he realizes he was not likely to win a gubernatorial    anyway ) .He kept saying Kaine ’s statements were nonsense .
