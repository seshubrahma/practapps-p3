As a concession to President Obama , the Democratic platform does not explicitly oppose the TPP .However the Democratic platform does include unambiguous language opposing    dispute settlement mechanisms   —    the    tribunals that are an integral part of the TPP .If the political prospects look bleak there also is not much that can be said for the economic merits of the pact .The classic story of gaining from free trade by removing trade barriers does n’t really apply to the the TPP because we have already removed most of the barriers between the countries in the pact the pact United States has trade deals in place with six of the eleven countries in the TPP the TPP tariffs with these countries are already the countries in the pact very near zero .
