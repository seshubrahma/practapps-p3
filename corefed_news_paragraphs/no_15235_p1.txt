What the focus on President Donald Trump numbers misses , however , is that Democrats are n’t in a great place with voters either .One number in the a new Washington   News poll stood out to me as something that should worry Democrats pondering the party ’s the Democratic Party whether the Democratic Party is in touch with the concerns of the average person , just 28 % of respondents said it is     as opposed just 28% of respondents 67 % who said Democrats are out of touch .Those numbers are worse than the " in    of touch " numbers for either the Republican Party or Trump the Democratic Party poll .More amazing to me is that only 52 % of    Democrats said their party was in touch with peoples’ only 52% of   Democrats while 44 % said it was out of touch .
