S. job displacement , especially between the United States and Mexico , were the result of Mexico surge in outsourcing of production by U. S. and other foreign investors .The rise in outsourcing was fueled , in turn , by a surge in foreign direct investment ( FDI ) into Mexico , which increased by more than 150 percent in the    period .Clinton will talk in glowing terms about NAFTA when writing memoirs but criticize it when she runs for office in terms about NAFTA to Clinton progressive labor allies .
