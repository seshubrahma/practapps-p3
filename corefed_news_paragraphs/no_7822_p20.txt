If Rubio Marco Rubio race had any effect on Rubio’s protest , it was a disappointment that such a uniquely gifted rising conservative star , who was so    to make a strong case for security and rule of law , instead agreed to become the disposable pitchman for Sen. Chuck Schumer ’s immigration bill .Rubio was the establishment ’s ambassador to Rubio , not The GOP Establishment ’s representative .I would also note that Ted Cruz is Ted Cruz well in the Republican primary without anyone having dark thoughts about his " heritage " Ted Cruz …      except for that business about his alleged Canadian heritage Ted CruzThat ’s about legal technicalities , not serious concern that Cruz is the Manitoba Ted Cruz of the Manchurian Candidate .
