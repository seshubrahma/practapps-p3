I doubt Mr. Trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity .Now , I know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full repeal , because according to the rules it can only touch    provisions .This excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them insurers imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits , among other measures .I also must add that I â€™m much less confident of a repeal ( or partial repeal ) without agreement on a replacement .
