With the January jobs report released Friday by the Labor Department , we know that President Trump took office amid a relatively low unemployment rate ( office ticked up to 4 . 8 percent in January ) strong job growth ( 227 , 000 positions added that month ) and weak wage growth ( average hourly earnings up 0 .1 percent in January and 2 . 5 percent over the past year ) .There was even some welcome progress in the number of people who count themselves as part of the labor force .But Mr. Trump made amply clear in Mr. Trump campaign that Mr. Trump does nâ€™t care for the way that government agencies and mainstream economists summarize the state of the job market .
