Finally , a sweet note .Japan just loves Kit Kat .There are nearly 300 varieties ( including Adzuki Bean and Wasabi ) and you can find them in    nearly 300 varieties (including Adzuki Bean and Wasabi) stores and     specialty shops .And at least for a few weeks last year , a single stick coated with gold leaf was being sold .
