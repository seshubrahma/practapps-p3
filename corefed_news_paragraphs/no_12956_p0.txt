Calling recent political discourse in the U. S. " lacking in civility , " a Washington bureaucrat is insisting that we stop using the phrase " drain the swamp " to describe change in Washington because , apparently , it is an insult to real swamps everywhere .[ Adam Rosenblatt , a science and technology policy fellow at the American Association for the Advancement of Science based at the Department of Energy in Washington , D. C. recently noted in a Washington Post    that using the term " drain the swamp " is a " terrible analogy ."   Rosenblatt , an ecologist by training , has decided to take the term literally , instead of metaphorically as it is intended , and is now warning about the dangers of draining real   —    not just political   —    swamps .It is , he says , very bad for the ecosystem .
