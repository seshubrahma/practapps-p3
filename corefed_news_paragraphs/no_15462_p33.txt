the North Korean people I tried to capture the North Korean people in the photographs that I take .Of all the things that I posted about on this trip , I think the one thing that resonated so much with people were these songs that play over loud speakers across the city .    They begin at 5:00 a. m. with a wake up the one thing that resonated so much with people .   And then almost hourly , there â€™s this song that plays called " Where Are You , Dear General ? "
