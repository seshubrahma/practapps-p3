I want a president who cares more about protecting my life than praying at the altar of political correctness .A growing number of my gay and lesbian friends feel the same way .In fact , one friend told me that she was " weighing the scales one friend with Hillary Clinton on one scale and Donald Trump on the other scale .Hilary , my friend said , would preserve one friend to marry her partner , Hilary not save her Hilary .
