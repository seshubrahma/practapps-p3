I understand that visual symbols of solidarity are important , but when meanings are ascribed to these colors , as these colors are , we run into peculiar and often misleading interpretations of history .From the time Hillary Clinton appeared in a white pants suit for a presidential debate and then for Hillary Clinton acceptance speech at the Democratic convention , observers went haywire .Every major news outlet , presumably relying on snippets found on Google , proclaimed that white was the color of the suffrage movement and that Hillary Clinton wardrobe was " a nod " to that long ago fight for the vote .A few commentators discovered that earlier women â€™s movements were as conscious as we are of colors as symbols .
