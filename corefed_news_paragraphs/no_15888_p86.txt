I must confess the shooterfirst shot that I heard was after it had already gotten past the batting the shooter , in     sometime it passes us lying on the ground .    I figured out this was a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls good place to be if that shooter goes around the third base dugout they home plate on they outside of the fence because then you have a clean shot at us lying on the ground .
