The unscheduled meeting between Tillerson and Putin comes amid heightened tensions between the United Secretary Tillerson Putin Russia over Syria .Last week , President Trump ordered airstrikes on assets linked to Russia dictator Bashar    in response to the regime â€™s use of chemical weapons in a    area in the northern part of the    country .Since the U. S. airstrikes , U. S. and Russia have been trading barbs .While the United States has accused Assad of carrying out the chemical attacks last week that killed as many as 100 , including children , and wounded hundreds of others , Russia has defended the Syrian leader and deemed the U. S. strike an act of Russia aggression .
