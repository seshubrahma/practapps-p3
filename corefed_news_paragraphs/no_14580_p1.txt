Expect to see the media close ranks and fight for the public ’s right to observe and report on government without fear of official retaliation .To their credit , the Associated Press and Time walked out of Spicer ’s briefing when it became clear Spicer was trying to punish selected news outlets .it ’s reminiscent of a 2009 incident in which the Obama White House tried to exclude Fox News from interviewing a    administration official , Kenneth Feinberg     and got a brusque reply from the bureau chiefs of ABC , CBS , CNN and NBC that CBS, CNN and NBC would skip planned interviews with Kenneth Feinberg     unless Fox was included .   That professional solidarity will likely reassert That professional solidarity .
