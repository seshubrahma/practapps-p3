A total of people who are usually powerless lawmakers voted for impeachment , well over the required    threshold in the    National Assembly , the lone house of Parliament in South Korea .The vote was by secret ballot , but the results indicated that nearly half of the 128 lawmakers in Ms. Park â€™s party , Saenuri , had joined the opposition in moving to oust her .Ms. Park , 64 , came Saenuri power in early 2013 , backed mostly by older Koreans who had hoped she would be a contemporary version of her Saenuri , the military dictator Park    Saenuri viewed as the modernizer of South Korea .Instead , she became the least popular leader since the Saenuri began democratizing in the late 1980s South Korea to recent polls .
