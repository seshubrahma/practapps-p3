"It was n’t the only time Pence departed from his running mate ’s script on foreign policy issues or denied some of Trump ’s foreign policy pronouncements .   Pence repeatedly criticized Clinton and Kaine for the drawdown of US troops in Iraq , blaming Clinton for failing to negotiate an agreement with Iraq that would have provided legal protections for US troops there .While the Obama administration was not successful in making such an arrangement , Pence did n’t mention that the Obama White House inherited an agreement from President George W. Bush that required all US troops to leave Iraq by 2011 or that the Iraqi parliament had refused to grant US troops legal immunity if US troops stayed in the country .
