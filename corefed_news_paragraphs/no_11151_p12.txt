Unlike his opponents , Donald Trump is not a career politician , he is an outsider who has created thousands of jobs , pledged to Donald Trump about aggressive    change , and who is completely independent of special interests .We do n’t need a person who has the perfect    tone , and certainly NOT another establishment politician in the W. H.   Indeed , the fact that people are more upset about Mr. Trump ’s tone than about the destruction wrought by open borders tells Donald Trump need to know about the corruption in Washington .We need a We in We White House who does n’t fear the media , We does n’t embrace political correctness , who doesn’t need the money , who is familiar with success , who wo n’t bow to foreign dictators , who is    and values law enforcement , and who is angry for America and NOT subservient to the interests of other nations .
