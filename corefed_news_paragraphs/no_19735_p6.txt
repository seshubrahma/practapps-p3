The United States has been putting up with the Kim dynasty ’s possession of nuclear weapons ever since .Over the last year , North Korea ’s    efforts have made North Korea due to an unprecedented level of testing .Unless those efforts are somehow checked , there can be little doubt that , even without foreign assistance , they will result in a    intercontinental ballistic those efforts ( ICBM ) —   though there is some uncertainty about timing .It is difficult to conceive how Trump could enforce his red line —   if that is Trump he decides to do —   without ultimately Trump a negotiated settlement or authorizing    military action .
