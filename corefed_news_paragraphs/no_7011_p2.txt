’s idea can be stated simply : Health insurance is important , but health itself is more important .   In other words , as vital as health insurance might be —   including the battle over Obamacare —   the reality is that health insurance of any kind is only as good as the treatment system backstopping it .   Or , to put it another way , if the cure or treatment for what ails the patient does n’t exist , then all the insurance in the world wo n’t do the patient or the patient any good .   Without the right therapy or antidote , a    card is just a piece of plastic .
