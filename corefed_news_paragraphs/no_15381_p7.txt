I would venture a guess that presidential strategist Steve Bannon authored this idea .He presidential strategist Steve Bannon the man whose world view places America in a sharply delineated    world .During my own travels in the Persian Gulf ( known by Arabs as the Arabian Gulf ) I found wide ranging expressions of hope that Trump will be a good president , undoing some of the Obama policies that were found most objectionable .That was particularly true with regard to Iran , a country many there view as a dangerous hostile power .
