Traditional spies seem far less important these days , because unclubbable , technically adept people can do that kind of work far more effectively .The press , at least for now , has assumed a larger role in the ecosystem of revelation , because hackers prefer finding partners in the mainstream media to simply releasing information on their own .But hackers new set of arrangements makes journalists look more like conduits and contextualizers , and less like originators of information .Reporters are n’t supposed to be hackers themselves ( see the News of the World scandals in London five years ago ) but they ’re not capable of resisting juicy information that others have hacked , no matter how unsavory the purpose ( see the ubiquitous coverage of John Podesta ’s    private emails during the fall campaign ) .
