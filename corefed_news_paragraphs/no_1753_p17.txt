The space center , whose launchpads sit less than a mile from the beach , has been dealing with the threat of climate change for a number of years , and has had to fight beach erosion caused in part by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 .Why , then , put vital space infrastructure in such a vulnerable place ?Much of the reason has to do with physics : launching rockets from a site relatively close to the Equator gives a speed boost into orbit .   â€”    JOHN SCHWARTZ in New York
