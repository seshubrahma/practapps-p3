Both girls were perfectly still , skin cold to the touch .Tess was covered with a hospital blanket , and her clothes lay in a bag by her bedside , Tess off by the EMT and the Tess doctor who tried to revive her , to no avail .I looked at her Tess brown eyes , pupils dilated , eyes wide Tess , staring at the ceiling .She still had a mask taped to her mouth with Tess long rubber tube .
