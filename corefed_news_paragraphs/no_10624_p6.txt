" You ’re not likely to hear any senior members of the Senate Democratic Caucus insulting their own party as a band of any senior members of the Senate Democratic Caucus or joking about how Hillary Clinton is so unpopular that she could be killed without consequence .Hillary Clinton is a glittering example of the very same " loser " mentality Trump attacks so effectively .He ’s also the kind of reptilian Graham that would set aside all those    professions of contempt for Cruz to admit he might just be the only effective Graham against Trump   …      and then , in the very same breath , admit he doubts it would work anyway .
