a ban alone speaks volumes about the frustrations and distrust voters have with political leaders today .A blanket ban , after all , makes sense if one does nâ€™t trust the government or political leaders to enforce existing laws or pursue potential threats with the necessary vigor .The attack by Omar Mateen exposed , again , multiple failures of law enforcement or federal authorities to recognize potential threats .A blanket ban simply saves us the consequences of future bad decisions by federal authorities .
