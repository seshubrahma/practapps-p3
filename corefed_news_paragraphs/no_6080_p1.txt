[ One of the things I like is a no BS approach to dealing with other world leaders as President Trump did with Mexico ’s President Nieto .Eight years of President Obama gave other world leaders the impression that America has become weak and pliable and will not exert our influence .    In his inauguration speech , President Trump also spoke of a nation ’s right to act in their sovereign interest .Globalism has met its Globalism opponent following Brexit .
