Would a President Trump use the apparatus of the federal government     such as the Federal Communications Commission     to intimidate comedians and dissuade them from mocking him ?   Yes , I comedians we Trump a First Amendment , but alarmingly I bet there are Trump supporters who would go along with anything Trump a President Trump for , even if it was flat a President Trump unconstitutional .   ( Trump has bragged as much , claiming he could a President Trumpsomeone on Fifth Avenue and his a President Trump would stand with him . )
