Many pundits have predicted that , if other more mainstream candidates like Chris Christie , Jeb Bush or John Kasich dropped out , Rubio could consolidate their supporters and topple Trump or Rubio from the other more mainstream candidates like Chris Christie, Jeb Bush or John Kasich dropped out positions .That seems increasingly like magical thinking on the part of pundits .Even if a Republican voter is n’t supporting Cruz or Trump as their first choice , they Cruz more Trump supporting Cruz or Trump of them , Cruz or Trump outsiders , as the party ’s Cruz or Trump than one of the other candidates .That fact , itself , goes a long way to explain this
