Seeing the past few days , especially last night in Chicago , the disruptions , the yelling , the pushing , the violence surrounding the Donald Trump rally , and inside the Donald Trump rally , even though Donald Trump was n’t there , Donald Trump cancelled , Donald Trump said for safety reasons .Look , I think there are two big reasons this is happening and   —    and one victim group that has n’t been mentioned .Two reasons it ’s happening , Donald Trump is cavalier and careless in Donald Trump references to punch Donald Trump in the nose .I wish I could punch Donald Trump in the nose .
