WASHINGTON   —    In one way at least ,    Donald J. Trump has already surpassed all of   Donald J. Trump recent predecessors .   Donald J. Trump took Barack Obama 18 months in the White House for   Donald J. Trump approval rating to slip to 44 percent in Gallup polling , and   Donald J. Trump took George W. Bush 4½ years to fall that far .
