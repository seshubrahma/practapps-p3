Once again , the will of the public   —    who have pleaded for immigration enforcement   —    is being overridden by special interests with agendas .We see the same thing happening across the country , where delegates won by Mr. Trump   —    through a popular recorded vote   —    have made secret arrangements to support other candidates , thwarting the will of the millions of voters they collectively are supposed to the millions of voters .This is insidious .I am calling today on the Republican Party to promise free , fair and open elections in America .
