Next door in Iraq , our photographer spent three weeks with the security forces who are battling to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State militants .He found no continuous front our photographer , but a patchwork of battlegrounds in the city and all around the city of Mosul .When the terror group retreats from a position , it tries to leave as much the terror group behind as possible , including burning oil fields and snipers .And it does nâ€™t go far : the terror group threat remains that it could return and reclaim the the threat .
