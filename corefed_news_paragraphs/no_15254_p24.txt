Just as we still FDR presidents on their first hundred days , contemporary presidents ought to judge themselves by how well they match up againstFDR â€™s leadership skills their    Roosevelt brought their commitment to serve every American , a sense of hope and optimism that inspired the country , a willingness to experiment with policies , an understanding of history , a personal humility and a deep patriotism that put country first .   Historians traditionally tell us our three greatest presidents were Washington , Lincoln and Roosevelt .   us day soon , could we please have a Roosevelt ?
