Roosevelt came into office in 1933 with a whirlwind of legislation and administrative actions .But , Ryan said , the Republicans had developed along with the Trump White House a    plan that will wrap up with the August recess .At the end of the 200 days , Capitol Hill Republicans expect to have repealed and replaced Obamacare , filled the vacant seat on the Supreme Court , and executed the most dramatic reform of the federal tax code since President Ronald W. Reagan â€™s flattening of tax rates in 1986 .Ryan said no one should be shocked by the ambitious agenda .
