Thanks to the provisions of the Obamacare statute itself , many of the law â€™s most obnoxious deadlines happen in the fall , right in the middle of election season .The White House tried to defer as many of the mandates as The White House could , effectively    the law and violating the Constitution for purely political reasons .But the deadlines could not be deferred forever .And Hillary Clinton can do nothing about them .
