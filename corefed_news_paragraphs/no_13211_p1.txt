’s 2 , 000 seats out there , there ’s six candidates on stage , they should just divide them evenly so everyone has them , but instead they just give them to the donor six candidates on stage , they give six candidates on stage to the lobbyists and six candidates on stage all the special six candidates on stage .It six candidates on stage not fair, it ’s six candidates on stage equitable six candidates on stageSo I think what they should do moving forward is take the total number of It available , allocate them across the board and six candidates on stage the candidates bring their people in , because that ’s who should be here six candidates on stage not the donors .
