Bloomberg writes :   The united Republican establishment front against Donald Trump started to crumble in a potentially profound way on Friday when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie backed the New York billionaire for president with an enthusiastic endorsement .The move , combined with the endorsement of Maine Governor Paul LePage later Friday , adds the establishment bona fides of two sitting U. S. governors to a devoutly outsider campaign .It also comes just days after Trump â€™s first two congressional endorsements in Representatives Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California .In Christie , Trump also gained a powerful surrogate responsible for the lowest moment in the campaign of one of Trump last Republican adversaries : Marco Rubio .
