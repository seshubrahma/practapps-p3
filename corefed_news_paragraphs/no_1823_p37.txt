your the Brooklyn Museum visit the the Brooklyn Museum botanic garden as well ( and maybe stop at the Mister Softee truck parked on Washington Avenue on your way ) .A combo ticket to the museum and garden is $ 23   —    a $ 5 saving over purchasing them separately .I met up with a A combo ticket to the museum and garden and her husband and young son .The garden is great for children , by the adjacent botanic garden   —
