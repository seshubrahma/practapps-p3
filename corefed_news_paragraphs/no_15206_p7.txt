The Democratic Party nâ€™t care about    at the local level they care about being attached to national brands .Astonishingly , at Big donors time when people abhor the buying of elections by the rich , the party at its recent national meeting approved taking in large corporate donations .A    Democratic operative who worked on the 2016 campaign recently told me that when the Clinton campaign was told it needed to invest in local grassroots efforts , which support    the Clinton campaign , it was hostile to the idea .Republicans , by contrast , have assiduously funded local efforts .
