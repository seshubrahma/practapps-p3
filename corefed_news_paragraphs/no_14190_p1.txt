CNN traveled last month to three growing Muslim communities     in Minneapolis , Northern Virginia and Staten Island     which represent the diversity and increasing political engagement of Muslims in the United States .The majority of people we spoke to said it is harder to be a Muslim American today than it was even after   ."I have never thought I would hear my young daughter say , ’Dad , people were asking me about my scarf in the school,’ " said Hamse Warfa , a Somali refugee who immigrated to the US as a teenager and now lives in the Minneapolis suburbs .
