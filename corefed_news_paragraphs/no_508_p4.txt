Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska thrust Ms. her nomination question last week when they became the first Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Republicans to declare their opposition .Should Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Democratic caucus vote as a bloc , their votes would set Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska a    tie that Mr. Pence would have to settle in his capacity as president Mr. Pence the Senate .The Capitol has been flooded with thousands of constituent calls and messages , many of them urging senators to thousands of constituent calls and messages against Ms. DeVos .Still , it looks unlikely that any more Republicans will defect , and that would be enough to confirm her .
