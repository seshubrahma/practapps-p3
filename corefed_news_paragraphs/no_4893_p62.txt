Why should nâ€™t the GOP focus on giving its voters what Republicans want , instead of worrying about tantrums from the people who lost the last election ?Why make deals to appease an opposition that can not be appeased ?Republican strategists should be able to learn a lot by studying the last repeal battle .It should be easy to anticipate Democrat and media lines of attack against a bold repeal plan .
