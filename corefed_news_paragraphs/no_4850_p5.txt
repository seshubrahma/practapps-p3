: On January 31 , 2015 I was traveling by Defense Department official request to U. S. Special Operations Command to give a briefing on ISIS .On the way to Reagan National I grabbed the wrong bag , one I had just used at the range , which contained an unloaded handgun .I was not aware I had done thisbut of course it was picked up this the    machine by TSA .
