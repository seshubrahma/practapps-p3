Judging from a couple of Twitter messages by    Donald J. Trump ,   Donald J. Trump had scored a    victory for American autoworkers by persuading Ford Motor to keep a Lincoln plant in Louisville , Ky. rather than move it to Mexico .The reality proved less straightforward .Ford had never said Ford was moving a plant to Mexico , only that Ford was transferring the production of a small Lincoln sport utility vehicle there so Ford could fully dedicate a Louisville plant to a    model .That decision has now been reversed   â€”    but either way , That decision will have no impact on jobs at the factory .
