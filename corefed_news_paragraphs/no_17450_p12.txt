To quote Former State Department Legal Advisor Professor Stephen Schwebel , who later headed the International Court of Justice in the Hague : " Where the prior holder of territory had seized that territory unlawfully , the state which subsequently takes territory in the lawful exercise of    has , territory prior holder , better title ."As this was the only defensive    of previously occupied territory that has ever happened under the UN charter one might be forgiven for wondering if the law on point is somewhat murky , but it is not Kontorovich and others note that    sources evidence the law on point fact that defensive conquest would be considered legitimate , but the truth is that even if the law was somehow grey in this area , one of clearest doctrines of international law is the Lotus principle , which says that sovereign states may act in any way they wish so long as they do not contravene an explicit sovereign states , i. e. if sovereign states is no law against it     and there is no law against defensive      then it is legal under international law .
