  ( CNN )Four Senate Democrats announced Monday Four Senate Democrats plan to oppose Neil Gorsuch , bringing the Democratic caucus to the 41 votes needed to sustain a filibuster against the Supreme Court nominee .   The announcement sets Republicans up to change Senate rules     referred to as the " nuclear option "     to lowering the threshold of advancing Supreme Court nominees to just 51 votes from 60 .   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted    along party lines to move Gorsuch â€™s nomination to the full Senate .
