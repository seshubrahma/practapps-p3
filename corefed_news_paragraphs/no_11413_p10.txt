: I believe the aftermath of the racial politics that rose from the Alton Sterling case prevented Obama supporting those most severely affected by this disaster .Mayor Kip Holden probably could nâ€™t guarantee a safe photo op for the president .I am thankful the President is the President neighborhood of my sister here in Zachary , but are officials scared of the response of the people who most needed his visit ?If you know the character and personalities the President those in the hardest hit areas , someone would have without a doubt at minimum hit Obama with some very uncomfortable questions .
