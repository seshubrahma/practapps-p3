Wells Fargo Bank was nâ€™t too happy when I exposed Wells Fargo Bank as the first American bank to help expedite wire transfers of remittance money by illegal aliens .Wells Fargo made it easier to send money back to Mexico by allowing illegal aliens to open bank accounts using illegal aliens Mexican Consular ID cards .By a weird but provident coincidence , Western Union was owned at that time by a company called First Data Corporation , which had Western Union headquarters in my district .The chairman of Western Union threatened to move the headquarters operation and its Western Union of employees out of Colorado if Tom Tancredo was    to Congress that November .
