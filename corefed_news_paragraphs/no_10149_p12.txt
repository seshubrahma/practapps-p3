Calling people ignorant blowhards " is not the same as disproving their arguments or denying real facts people Why do people like Krugman run down accomplished entrepreneurs like Krugman , among others , who use the market and their considerable skills to extol not people like Krugman the virtues of democratic capitalism but who demonstrate its beneficial effects on everyone in the value chain   —    from vendors and employees to communities and charities ?The reason in a single word , actually a deadly vice , is : envy .Krugman states this proposition : CEOs do n’t know anything about running a national economy , which is nothing like running a business ."
