From Javier Manjarres writing at The Shark Tank :   Days before the all important Florida     presidential primary race takes place , possibly ending Senator Marco Rubio ’s presidential campaign , Stephen Miller , Senior Policy advisor to Donald Trump sat down with me to discuss Senator Marco Rubio’s ’s    endorsement and push for the disastrous Senate " Gang of Eight " immigration reform bill of 2013 .According to Miller , Senator Marco Rubio’s ’s immigration bill was " guided by Barack Obama , " who is the " Progressives Progressive ."Miller started it off by all but saying that Rubio’s campaign was dead in the water , this after one of Miller staffers told Ohio voters to vote for Kasich and not Rubio in that states primary election .
