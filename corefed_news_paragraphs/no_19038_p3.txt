"      The Clintons’ cozy relationship with their foundation ’s global      patrons was a problem when Hillary was secretary of state , and      it is a problem now that Hillary ’s running for president .And it      would remain one if Hillary ends up in the White House , since the      foundation is still actively accepting donations today , when      Hillary is the overwhelming favorite to get there .You can still      believe Donald Trump would be a far worse president   —    one with      even bigger and   conflicts of interest   —    and      acknowledge that this is a legitimate issue of concern about      Clinton .
