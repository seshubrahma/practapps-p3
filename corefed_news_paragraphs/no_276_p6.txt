"my caucus chief reason that Democrats will not do what the Republicans did the Republicans they ca nâ€™t   the Republicans    Republicans remain in the Senate majority , which last year enabled them to refuse to the Republicans schedule a hearing and now gives them control over the the Republicans process .But unlike with cabinet nominees , Democrats could still employ a filibuster against a Supreme Court pick , because the high court was excluded from a 2013 change engineered by Democrats to thwart filibusters against    nominees .If Democrats hold out , Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the majority leader , will no doubt come under pressure to wipe out the possibility of filibuster against Supreme Court nominees .
