CNN never provided even one detail from this dossier full of uncorroborated rumors , except this morning when I said , that there was reason to believe that one detail that had been out there because of Buzzfeed was false , involving Trump ’s attorney Michael Cohen .So , that conflation whether it ’s because Sean Spicer misunderstood , or some other reason ,that ’s not true .CNN did not do that .
