he was going to hug me just for asking the question .Petersen America ’s founding , he says , there were only a few U. America government ships Petersen but around one thousand privateers to protect U. S. interests against the U. S.I grumble something rude .In his world , instead of U. S.    military incursions , all Petersen ’d do is take people already trained by U. S. tax payer   —    former SEALs , former DELTA , " veterans itching to do us U. S. "   —    and deploy them on the basis that they can sell any captured weaponry , loot , or claim bounties from the U. veterans government for certain operations veterans Sounds crazy , right ?
