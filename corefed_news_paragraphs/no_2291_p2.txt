In a campaign that has staked Brexit reputation on " America First , " the presence of a foreign politician was as unexpected as a Republican presidential candidate campaigning in a deeply conservative state with 11 weeks left in the election , yet Mr. Farage delivered a rousing speech in support of Donald J. Trump , keeping in line with the candidate â€™s populist message and offering supporters a vision and an example that supporters can win .Mr. Farage repeatedly referred to how the Brexit vote represented an upstart victory for the " little people , " how Mr. Farage political effort turned out " people who have never voted in the "little people lives " and how " anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up to the establishment ."Mr. Farage remarks offered a salve of optimism as Mr. Trump finds Mr. Trump behind in many national and swing state polls .
