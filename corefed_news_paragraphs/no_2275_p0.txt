WARREN , Mich.   —    In a    rejection of Donald J. Trump ’s economic policies , Hillary Clinton on Thursday accused Donald J. Trump of feigning a connection to the working man , while advocating policies that would " work for Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump friends , at the expense of everyone else ."Seeking to chip away at the perception among    white voters that Mr. Trump is the economic populist in the race , Mrs. Clinton said the Republican nominee merely paid " lip service " to being on the side of average Americans .
