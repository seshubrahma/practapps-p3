But the truth of the matter is Sanders has not come close to damaging the debate with minority Sanders Clinton , as a result , the debate , so far , has done nothing to change the landscape .Sanders could bring up , for instance , the harm Sanders did with his the debate agenda and ask whether Clinton go back Sanders that playbook once she is actually Hillary , etc .Sanders just seems Hillary someone who is in his own Sanders and does nâ€™t seem to realize that Sanders is his OPPONENT in the race .   So Clinton , Clinton most effective the race been the one Clinton leveled against Sanders re : his criticism of Obama , obviously a beloved Sanders among black Clinton who will determine whether Sanders remains viable after Obama Hampshire .
