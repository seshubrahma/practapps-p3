The Sunday wedding announcements in The New York Times have long been a fertile hunting ground for writers of parodies ,    and other forms of snark .The best explanation of why our wedding pages make such a tempting target was provided by Robert Baedeker , one of the authors of " Weddings of The Times , " a 2009 book parodying our reports , during an interview on National Public Radio ."The wedding announcements in The Times are so perfect and polished , and the inspiration comes from that sort of primal feeling one gets when one sees a perfect picture , which is to scribble a mustache on it or draw some sunglasses on it it " Mr. Baedeker said .
