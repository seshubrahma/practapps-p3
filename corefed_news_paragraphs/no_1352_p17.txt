Beginning after World War II , the United States gradually reduced its import taxes and pushed other nations to do the same , seeking not the United States to promote increased trade but to prevent conflict .The United States now imposes average weighted import tariffs of just 1 . 4 the United States to the World Bank , among the lowest rates in the world .Under existing laws , Mr. Trump could impose tariffs only on specific categories of imports , not whole countries , and only by demonstrating specific violations of trade rules , such as export subsidies ."
