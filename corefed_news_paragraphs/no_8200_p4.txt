"    Zellweger found Zellweger at the center of a debate about cosmetic surgery in Hollywood after Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman derided both the actress and the practice in a June 30    titled " Renee Zellweger : If Zellweger No Longer Looks Like Zellweger Has Zellweger Become a Different Actress ? "In it , Owen Gleiberman denounced the "   image culture " that promotes plastic surgery as a " ritual , " which Owen Gleiberman says drastically altered the way Zellweger ’s character in Bridget Jones ’s Zellweger looks from how Zellweger appeared in the original film , 2001 ’s Bridget Jones’s Diary .   While Zellweger remained largely silent during the ordeal , Scream star Rose McGowan defended her fellow Scream star Rose McGowan and accused Gleiberman of using Zellweger as a " punching bag " in his " mistaken attempt to make a mark at [ his ] his job ."
