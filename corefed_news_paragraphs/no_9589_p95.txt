The left likes to pretend there is some kind of problem with this , but it ’s totally cool with Jesus .   Think about the lessons from Charles women " A Christmas Carol " .   Unlike the entertainments of today women where rich Hollywood liberals bellyache about rich Americans being evil , Ebenezer Scrooge is n’t the Jesus guy because he makes good money .He is the bad guy because he lives a joyless and miserly existence , and does n’t treat his employees well .
