As the unemployment rate has fallen , some employers have raised salaries to retain their best workers and attract new ones .Increases in the minimum wage in many states recently , and increases in the    salaries by big employers like Walmart , some employers and Aetna , are also beginning to ripple through the broader work force .But a    job market remains in place , with workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills .In San Francisco , even the most junior software engineers hired at Sunverge , a maker of energy storage systems for solar electricity workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills , command starting salaries of just over $ 100 , 000 .
