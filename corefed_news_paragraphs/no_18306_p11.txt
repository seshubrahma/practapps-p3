The most important political effect of Thursday ’s vote may then    be that nearly the entire House Republican conference is now on    the record for the proposition that health insurers should be    able to charge patients more if they have preexisting health    conditions    " "    In fairness to health insurers , that ’s how most insurance products    are priced : If your house is located on the oceanfront , you ’re    going to pay more for coverage against hurricanes .But the       unpopularity of medical underwriting ( that is , the    practice of charging people more if they ’ve had cancer , etc . )    reflects a public consensus people health risks are different from    other kinds of risks ; that the financial costs associated with    them are appropriately pooled across the population instead of    stuck disproportionately on people people most likely to need    medical care    " "    Being at elevated risk for cancer is misfortune enough ; it    should n’t also come with the obligation to pay a whole elevated risk for cancer of    extra insurance premiums .
