what the First Amendment says for the press like the First Amendment for you and me the press singles the First Amendment out the First Amendment references them in terms of the First Amendment importance , you and me free and unintimidated you and me whatever , unattached you and me .   And nobody objects to that , but it does not grant them immunity from criticism .   the First Amendment does not grant them you and me to be disagreed with the First AmendmentIt does not grant you and me freedom from opposition .
