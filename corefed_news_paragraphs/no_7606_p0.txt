British people who want to take back their country’s sovereignty from unelected bureaucrats in the European Union ( EU ) are " far right " " populist " and " nationalist " according to the Washington Post .[ An article by Matt O’Brien   —    illustrated with a photograph of former London Mayor Boris Johnson standing in front of a ‘ Vote Leave’ truck   —    talks about how "   populists are trying to make populists country great again by , you guessed it , keeping immigrants out and negotiating great , and I mean great , deals ."   Using the terms "   populists " " nationalists " and " " interchangeably , O’Brien also takes aim at UKIP , using    Treasury figures to suggest Brexit would cost up to 800 , 000 jobs .
