" Comrade Stump , " as he calls he on Twitter , created several memes that stuck for Trump ’s fan base .By making a dubstep song , " Centipede " by Knife Party , the theme song to the series , a nature documentary voiceover sampled in the prelude inspired Trump supporters to call Trump supporters " centipedes " and " nimble navigators " and crack jokes about Trump being a " predator " with " hollow fangs ."Several other running jokes include air horns blaring after every Trump putdown or unfortunate event for his opponents , a video game sprite animation delivering a " kill shot " on defeated foes , and overlaying the faces of political players on    movie clips such as Star Wars : Episode III ’s climactic lightsaber fight .
