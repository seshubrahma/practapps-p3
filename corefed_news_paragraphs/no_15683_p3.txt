The reason that this comparison would be so attractive for Trump ’s administration to use is that the Nixon   Nixon channel produced huge results .At a moment of great tensions between the two    super powers , Kissinger , who would become Nixon ’s national security adviser , would use this secret channel after Nixon Nixon became President to conduct conversations that culminated in the historic SALT I nuclear arms agreement , a landmark moment in the policy of détente and the eventual end of the Cold War .But there is another , less favorable Nixon Nixon to what Kushner allegedly did .That is the Chennault Affair .
