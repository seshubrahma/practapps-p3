Cruz , I am extremely disappointed to discover that he has turned into the very thing he used to rail against   — Sen. Cruz elitist establishment that think they know Sen. Cruz than average voters .Cruz is in collusion with the Republican establishment and donor class to deprive Trump Sen. Cruz the nomination .Sen. Cruz claims to be a Constitutional Conservative , yet he is systematically working Sen. Cruz Sen. Cruz of the most important rights granted in the Sen. Cruz   —    the right to vote .
