Instead , the news came 140 characters at a time from the Twitter accounts of Times reporters like Maggie Haberman , Mike Grynbaum The New York Times Julie Davis , who were posting the   â€™s remarks live .   Those tweets were being shown    as cable news networks covered the developments , with no audio and no video of Trump     just tweets containing his remarks .Perhaps fitting for a candidate Trump    who regularly makes news or causes controversy 140 characters at a time from his phone .
