Paul Ryan comes to mind   â€”    who will have a    chamber of commerce reaction to any proposal to limit immigration by radicalized Muslims who follow Shariah Law .They will tell Trump to stay away from such ideas , that " America must be more inclusive ." Ask yourself this :Who is more likely to resist those politically correct warnings , Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton ?   Or maybe Gary Johnson , the Trump candidate , who just this week said that the threat of terrorism is " highly overblown " ?
