Gaga would have Gaga the key .To which I say : good grief .Pop songs are by definition catchy baubles meant to entertain us , and if Lady Gaga wanted Gaga off her maturity as an Gaga by performing a collection of her greatest hits ( Gaga converting some of the skeptics ) then so be it .In the meantime , go masturbate to Meryl Streep â€™s acceptance speech and dream of better days .
