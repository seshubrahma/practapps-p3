Democrats denounced Democrats as an assault on democracy and a sop to billionaires when the Supreme Court issued a ruling two years ago that loosened limits on campaign giving .But Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party leaders are now exploiting the decision , funneling tens of millions of dollars from Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party leaders wealthiest donors into a handful of presidential swing states .The flow of money , documented in Federal Election Commission reports , shows Democrats expanding Democrats    advantage in the final phase of the presidential race , defying expectations at the beginning of the campaign that Republicans would dominate the money chase .Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats are now outpacing Mr. Trump and the Republicans on every front , according to F. E. C. records : Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign , Mrs. Clinton’s party and outside groups supporting Mrs. Clinton’s have raised almost twice as much as Mr. Trump and his allies .
