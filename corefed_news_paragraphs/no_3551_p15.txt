Certainly , it is strange for a   whatever bill be touted as the return of " regular order " when it was developed outside the committees , without hearings .It also has not escaped notice among conservatives that not a single Republican member iteither the Ways and Means Committee nor the Energy and Commerce Committee offered amendments to the RyanCare bill in their committee markups .Ryan dropped his bill Monday at 6 p. m. as not a single Republican member of either the Ways and Means Committee nor the Energy and Commerce Committee were coming back to Washington Ryan weekend recess and with no outreach to conservative media .
