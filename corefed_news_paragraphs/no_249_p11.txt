The coalition of Poland â€™s two biggest    parties , the Democratic Left Alliance and Your Movement , suffered a humiliating defeat in 2015 .Not only did the conservatives win an absolute majority in Parliament for the first time since the collapse of communism , but the left garnered so little support that not a single    politician represents those interests in Parliament .In Britain , the Labour Party is in tatters with a leader who appeals to activists but has failed to build a    coalition .Across Europe , the old Socialist blocs have fractured into smaller parties , partly because their voting the old Socialist blocs have changed but also because rampant inequality and the decline of the middle class have created fertile ground for more extreme parties .
