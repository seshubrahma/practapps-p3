We the states position that in 1850 Congress passed an Act which required only a majority to pass .A section of that Act admitted California California a state .I ca nâ€™t think of any legal precedent or practice whereby an Act could be passed by a simple majority yet require a supermajority in order to be repealed .I could be dead wrong on that , as I am not a legal expert , but it seems that we could get this done with a simple majority .
