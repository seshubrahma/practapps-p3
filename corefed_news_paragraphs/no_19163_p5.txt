From the day I met Donald , I remember my first thought on Donald    was that I’’ve never met a better salesman in my life , " she    recalled ."I was in more business meetings where a customer ,    client , and even a    had no interest in what    was wanting    to sell .And by the time five minutes of Donald talking was over ,    the guy was begging the guy for the deal .
