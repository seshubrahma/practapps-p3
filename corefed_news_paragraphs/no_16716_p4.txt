In a Donald Trump Quinnipiac poll last week , millennial likely voters supported Clinton over Hillary Clinton by a    Donald Trump .But when Stein and Johnson were included Johnson and Stein , Clinton received Hillary Clinton 31 % support by likely voters between 18 and 34 .Upon further analysis , it â€™s clear that Stein is the one mostly Stein votes away from Clinton .Hillary Clinton understandably sees herself as Stein the baton from the progressive revolutionary campaign of Bernie Sanders .
