Top Trump advisers like incoming White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn have expressed strikingly similar views .In that way , the clashing perspectives on Putin reflect not only differences on how to relate specifically to Russia , but on what goals should guide American foreign policy in the 21st century , and what allies are necessary to advance those aims .On both sides of the Atlantic , the push to reset with Putin Putin a desire to elevate a different set of    concerns while downplaying , or even abandoning , the alliances that have bound European nations more tightly to each other , and to the United States , for decades .One critical variable of the Trump presidency may be how far this radical shift in perspective advances in a Republican Party where most elected officials and    analysts still believe global stability depends on an    network of rules and alliances , and still view Putin as an escalating threat to that order .
