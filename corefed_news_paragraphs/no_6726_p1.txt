Last week ’s arrest of a Jewish teenager in Israel , with dual citizenship in the U. S. proved that much of the antisemitic outbreak was , in fact , fake news .Though there has been a surge in    rhetoric and imagery online , and there has been some vandalism at synagogues and cemeteries , the bomb threats that caused the media sensation were not carried out by white supremacist Trump supporters , but an      journalist and the Israeli teen .Indeed , it is now impossible to know whether the few real incidents of antisemitism were part of a surge , or part of the low level of " background " antisemitism that persists , sadly , even in the U. S. the most tolerant country in the world .Evelyn Gordon of Commentary magazine   —    a publication founded by the American Jewish Committee , with a strong interest in Jewish affairs   —    adds an additional dimension to the story , noting that the teenage culprit was primarily interested in media coverage of the threats .
