There was no better example of this than Randi Harper , a    "   activist " who even set up a charity to combat social media harassment .Yet she herself was a serial online abuser .On Twitter alone , she doxed a debt collector , abused a woman to tears , and repeatedly directed harassment mobs against she opponents .she has yet to suffer any repercussions from Jack Dorsey ’s company .
