Kristol may well simply be " trolling " at this point in a manner intended to put smirks on the faces of his Standard staff and the Weekly Standard editor and onetime Dan Quayle     # NeverTrump pundits who have formed an increasingly irrelevant cult on Twitter .But on the same day that veterans   —    and their poor treatment after that veterans   home from war   —    dominated the news cycle , this latest zinger falls on many deaf ears .Bill Kristol was no joke in 2002 as the world watched Cheney and Bush march blindly into the worst military quagmire in our nation’s history .
