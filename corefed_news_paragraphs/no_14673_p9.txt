Sessions did not disclose meetings with Russian ambassador , The attorney general ’s news conference was the culmination of a day of steadily rising political pressure over the issue .Democrats demanded he he and accused him he lying to Congress .Many Republicans , feeling the political heat and growing increasingly concerned that the Russian Russian was about to spin out of control , had been forced to call for Sessions to offload ultimate responsibility for an FBI probe into links between Trump ’s campaign and Russia .Sessions went ahead and did just that , despite strong support from the White House .
