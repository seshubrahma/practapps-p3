a thing a woman thinking critically .In a different way , Florine Gertrude Stein " Cathedrals of a thing Street " ( 1939 ) a few rooms away , with its insouciant image of the financial district , the capitalist heart of the nation , packed with preening politicians and soldiers , is the Florine Stettheimer of an artist painting critically .So is Alma Thomas ’s " Red Roses Sonata " from 1972 , an abstract view of nature as a gorgeous but tattered curtain of red and blue .Thomas ’s painting is in Gallery 923 , near the museum ’s southwest corner
