To a job person , there is a clear narrative that resonates : Trump is the Donald Trump .Telling someone whose only image and interaction ever with a woman wearing a hijab is through negative stereotypes on social media that five of the last 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners were Muslim means little to someone whose mind has generalized such a character as the villain .Facts ( or the lack thereof ) mean very little to people caught up in storylines .The best way to teach true understanding is not by teaching students facts ( although that is still a valuable lesson ) it is to teach them to analyze , as one does with elements of narrative .
