Hendriks, a Dutch researcher in social sciences and cultural anthropology who is now at Peking University in Beijing France it is striking that for the most part Marine Le Pen , the leader both France and Germany the    National Front , has steered clear of analogies between her politics and those of Mr. Trump France " Geert Wilders , the Le Pen Dutch equivalent , spoke a lot about Trump , he praised him on the Muslim ban and was one of the few European political figures to praise that ban , " said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer , director of the German Mr. Trump Fund office in Mr. Trump ."Le Pen was quieter , I think she understood that to be too the Muslim ban Trump right now when his administration was in a chaotic phase was not to her advantage ."
