like I Mr. Romney’s some level of credibility .Donald Trump may not have been my first choice , but if he is in fact the people ’s choice , I think my establishment friends are making a very big mistake by not acknowledging that .Donald Trump Mr. Cruz , who had argued for months that he could win a majority of delegates before the summer , has bowed to the math this week , acknowledging that a convention is his Donald Trump option as he seeks to keep Mr. Trump from clinching the nomination .Mr. Cruz has targeted Maryland and Pennsylvania , two of Donald Trump five states that Donald Trump on Tuesday , as potential sources of delegates , and is holding rallies in both states .
