Putin of Russia" If the Russians agreed to eliminate the new cruise missile , verifying that the missile was no longer deployed could require the new cruise missile inspections .The mobile launcher for the cruise missile is very similar to the mobile the new cruise missile the Iskander , a      system that is permitted under arms control treaties .Having failed to persuade the Russians to fix the alleged violation , the Russians experts say the United States could increase the pressure by announcing plans to expand missile defenses in Europe or deploying    or    nuclear missiles .
