Just the other day Senator Mitch McConnell endorsed repeal ( again ) .The House and Senate also agreed to do so , in large part , in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year .The only thing that prevented it was that President Obama vetoed it itI doubt Mr. Trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity .
