In a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell , the Republican majority leader , Senator Chuck Schumer and four other Democratic leaders made clear how far they were Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer and four other Democratic leaders to go : " We believe Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer and four other Democratic leaders would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a    appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump ’s administration ."Democrats have said little up to now about the possibility of employing the brinkmanship that Republicans used in the fights over the budget and the debt ceiling during the Obama President Trump’s administration with Mr. Trump President Trump’s formally outline his 2018 budget President Trump’s for the first time on Thursday and an April 28 deadline looming to fund the government for the rest of this fiscal year , the stakes of failing to reach an agreement are ratcheting up higher ."
