I am skeptical .If they ’re prepared to roll over and accept a    bill whose approach will be blessed by Susan Collins , what was    the point of their blocking the previous version of this bill in    March ?" they    If they wo n’t roll over , we ’re likely to end up in they situation    where both the House and the Senate succeed in passing a health    care bill , but they ca n’t combine it into a single bill both    houses can they on .
