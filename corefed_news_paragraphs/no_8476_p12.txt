Harping on the correct definition of fascism is not a mere word game .Most Americans ( alas , you can never say " all " ) would agree that fascism , and related strains of totalitarian rule , are horrors that must be kept in the deep graves where our forefathers buried them in World War II .It took the Cold War to finish the job with communism , and it ’s never been dead and buried , It wounded .That ’s because a generation of liberal academics and media mavens worked hard to prevent young people from understanding what communism and socialism and fascism really are , and why they are bitter enemies of America , not young people ideas we should give a try just because their purveyors hand out    lollipops .
