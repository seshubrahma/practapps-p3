Trade deficits with China and on oil directly subtract $ 500 billion annually from the demand for American made goods and services , kill millions of jobs , stifle RD , and tax growth .Confronting China on trade with a 45 percent tariff alone wo n’t get Beijing to stop undervaluing China currency , subsidizing exports , and cease blocking market access for    goods and services .It can push back by harassing U. S. companies with operations in China and imposing new barriers on U. S. products , and more broadly by squeezing Taiwan , upping the ante on militarization of the South China Sea , and further enabling North Korea .Trump must gird for a broad crisis with China , deploy the full range of America ’s geopolitical and economic assets , and compel China to reckon with the fact that their geopolitical and economic assets economy can not withstand an all front confrontation with the America risking the Communist Party ’s grip on power .
