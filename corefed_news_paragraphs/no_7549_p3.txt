Meryl f***ing Streep .That ’s three Oscars right there .Never mind that Scott Baio delivered an almost sobering speech about what Scott Baio means to be an American and the value of bootstrap    and Sabato discussed Sabato joy at becoming an American citizen lawfully , by waiting Sabato turn like everybody else , while Dunham prattled on about " Islamophobia " ( no mention of ISIS , of course ) and Meryl Streep gave us the Dean Scream that Howard Dean himself failed to deliver just hours earlier .( And never mind that more people watched Happy Days , and even Joanie Loves Chachi , in more people heydays than will ever watch an episode of HBO ’s Dunham vehicle Girls . )
