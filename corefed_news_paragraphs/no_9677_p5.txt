And Mr. Pence ever handful of such voters you can find will be offset by the independents attracted to the irreligious Mr. Trump .Donald Trump is as Mr. Pence they come .For many presidential nominees , this would be an asset because if you are dullards like Mitt Romney or John Kerry , you are rightly terrified that if you picked a bowl of cold , leftover rice as your running mate , you would probably get overshadowed .Mr. Trump runs the risk of NOBODY ever overshadowing him .
