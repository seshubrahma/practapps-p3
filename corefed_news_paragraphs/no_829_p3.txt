But a senior White House official said that Donald F. McGahn II , the president ’s chief counsel , was working to secure access to what Mr. McGahn believed to be an order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing some form of surveillance related to Mr. Trump and his associates .Mr. McGahn official offered a senior White House official to support the notion that such an order exists .It would be a highly unusual breach of the Justice Department ’s traditional independence on law enforcement matters for the White House to order it to turn over the White House an investigative document .Any request for information from a top White House official about the White House investigation would be a stunning departure from protocols intended to insulate the F. B. I. from political pressure .
