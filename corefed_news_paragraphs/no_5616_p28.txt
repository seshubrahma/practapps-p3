When we see the scenes of destruction in This wake of terror , we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian , Shia or Sunni .When we look upon the streams of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground , we can not see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims   â€”    we weonly that they were Children of God whose deaths are an insult to all God we holy .
