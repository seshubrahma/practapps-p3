I want to empower the patient to get the health care they want the patient the price they want the patient I want to let every American be able to join a    to buy their health every American .When that happens , the buying power returns to the patients .Instead of patients having to kiss the boots of insurance company executives , my plan would have insurance executives come on bended knee to the patient .The patient the patient king .
