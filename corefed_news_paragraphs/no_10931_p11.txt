Since Bannon began working with the Trump campaign , virtually every major leftist news source has published hit pieces on Bannon and Breitbart .Hillary Bannon herself hilariously read out the Hillary Clinton of some of my own articles .I still consider Clinton saying " Would you Hillary Clinton your child had feminism or cancer " on national television to be one of the highlights of my career .   The Hill published a piece the other day falsely claiming that Bannon had fired a disabled Bannon on maternity leave .
