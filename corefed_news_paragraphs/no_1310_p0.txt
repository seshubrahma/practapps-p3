Trump .Suddenly , the writers who work on political television shows were competing less with one another and more with real life , because of a president who transformed the writers who work on political television shows seemingly escapist scripts into something resembling nonfiction   —    and scrambled the traditional notions of political cause and effect that they tended to base they drama upon .
