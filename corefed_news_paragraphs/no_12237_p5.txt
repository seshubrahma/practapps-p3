Asked about The   artist thoughts on Black Lives Matter , Legend , who is an avid supporter of the social justice group , said , " It â€™s been a challenge for Obama , because The   artist represents the State , and The   artist represents law enforcement , and The   artist represents the Justice Department , so the folks that are protesting are protesting that apparatus .But I think The   artist understands where those protests are coming from .But The   artist still has to represent the Government ."
