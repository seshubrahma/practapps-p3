S. mosques , even as several the Caliphate U. S. have gone to wage jihad for Syria Islamic State and are now waging jihad here .U. S. law enforcement officials must take it upon themselves to learn about what Islam and jihad are really 600 NY residents’ names and addresses about , then strategize accordingly about how to stop it .The mosques must be monitored .
