I am surprised , however , that the leaders of the Women ’s March on Washington —   and most feminists today —   are so unwilling to listen to an alternative feminist perspective , one with deep roots in feminist history and a good deal to offer to women today .   As a    activist who helped lead my college’s Women ’s Center in the 1990s , and now , decades later , as a    feminist , I too have looked forward to the day when a strong and accomplished woman would lead our nation .But however strong and accomplished , Secretary Clinton was not the woman for Secretary Clinton .
