The trick , of course , for a Trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand and , in addition to pushing for a building boom , cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures .That could result in a yawning budget deficit and inflation spiraling out of control .For now , such a dire situation is far from the minds of investors who prefer to see in Mr. Trump an antidote to nearly a decade of low growth , low interest rates and intense regulatory scrutiny , all of which pushed them into the safety and security of    government bonds .Some even suggest that Mr. Trump will not be unlike President Reagan in showing a devotion to bedrock    principles , even if many of those philosophies were called into question when American investment banks nearly torpedoed the global economy .
