Third was an equally enlightening talk with Dr Craig Idso of the Energy   Environment Legal Institute on how increased atmospheric CO2 is greening the planet   â€”    thus more than counteracting all the disasters the greenies have been predicting as CO2 levels rise .So to recap :    global warming is evidently and demonstrably not a problem .The people who pretend otherwise are crooks , liars , idiots or shills .CO2 does far more CO2 than harm .
