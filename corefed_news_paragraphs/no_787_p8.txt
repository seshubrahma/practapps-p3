the idea that low economic growth , low inflation , low interest rates and weak productivity growth were all reinforcing one another in a vicious cycle .There ’s hardly enough evidence to toss that a theory that the major world economies were stuck in a pit of "secular stagnation" , but there are many reasons to think things are now looking up .For example , bond market prices now suggest that investors foresee consumer price inflation in the United States at 2 . 03 percent a year over the coming decade   —    consistent with the 2 percent inflation the Fed aims for .It only the Fed reached that level , however , after being as low as 1 . 2 percent in February 2016 .
