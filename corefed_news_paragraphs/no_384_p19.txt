After eight years its residents little building , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just allotted 100 new building units to Ma’ale Adumim , part of 2 , 500 new proposed housing units around the West Bank settlements , and another 560 in East Jerusalem .Mr. Netanyanu has proclaimed Jerusalem just the beginning of a new wave of building .Less than a month after the United Nations resolution , the city ’s mayor , Benny Kashriel , and another settlement leader proudly attended Mr. Trump ’s inauguration .That would have been unthinkable for past incoming American presidents , out of fear it could be interpreted as an endorsement of settlements , which most of the world considers illegal .
