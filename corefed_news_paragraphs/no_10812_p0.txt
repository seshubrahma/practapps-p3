Republican National Convention delegates from the District of Columbia who are bound to or supportive of Marco Rubio tell Breitbart News that Republican National Convention delegates from the District of Columbia who are bound to or supportive of Marco Rubio are open to supporting Donald Trump instead .[ Some are making the pitch that Some want Donald Trump to pick Marco Rubio as Marco Rubio vice presidential candidate , but nonetheless the warm comments many of these Marco Rubio delegates are making about Donald Trump —   instead of about Ted Cruz —   is perhaps a sign of a turning tide in the delegate game after Donald Trump captured at least 89 delegates in New York last night .   " I think Ted Cruz —   choosing Marco [ as vice president ] would make me more inclined to support Ted Cruz —   , in a more positive way , a more active role in campaigning because I really love Marco , " said Teri Galvez , a bound delegate from D. C. who the D. C. GOP says is bound to Ohio Gov. John Kasich , in an interview with Breitbart News this week ."
