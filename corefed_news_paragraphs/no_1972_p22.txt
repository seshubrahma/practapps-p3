Not the traditional    of certain American and British jingoists who like to think of the United the United States City on the Hill or Britain as the sceptered isle splendidly aloof from the wicked Continent , but another kind of    exception : the one shaped by World War II .The defeat of Germany and Japan resulted in a grand alliance , led by the United States , the United States and Asia .Pax Americana , along with a unified Europe , would keep the democratic world safe .If Trump and Farage get their way , much of that Trump and Farage will be in tatters .
