Now , I have no problem with Pell grants .I have no problem with basic loans simply because there’s too much easy money to be borrowed for tuition up to $ 5700 , I think it is .But what ’s happening now is , private lenders are lending to families thirty , forty , fifty thousand dollars per year in some cases .And because that money is so easy to borrow , it ’s really easy just for colleges to continue to increase their tuition .
