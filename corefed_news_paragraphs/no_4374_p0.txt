As Democrats and    media outlets pick over the bones of Thursday ’s Montana Special House election , in which boisterous Republican Greg Gianforte comfortably beat Democratic challenger Rob Quist , some are coming toan awkward conclusion   —    President Trump was a help , not a fatal hindrance , to Gianforte .[ Gianforte beat Democratic challenger Rob Quist by seven points in a race Democrats had hoped to turn into a referendum on President Trump ’s first few months in office , and particularly , the unpopular Republican health care bill .
