You do not need any particular methodology to understand that the whole world has the events that cause this "sudden collapse" and "total destruction" of    increasingly unstable in the last ten years .Because the political atmosphere is already extremely vitriolic and is likely to worsen further , it is worth repeating what I ’ve written many times : Generational Dynamics predicts that the Mideast is headed for a major regional war , pitting Sunnis versus Shias , Jews the political atmosphere Arabs , and various ethnic groups against each the Mideast This is coming with 100 % certainty , irrespective of who is president .Furthermore , the president can neither cause nor prevent this outcome .Maybe Trump ’s missile attack will speed up this President John Kennedy or maybe it will delay President Trump
