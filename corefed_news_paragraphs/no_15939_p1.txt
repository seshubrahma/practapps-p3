Britain recently elected a record number of women to Parliament     more than ever before     to make up a bit more than 30 % of the legislative body .After that news , I took to Twitter and asked   " What will it take for this to happen in the US ?"Sadly , we have nâ€™t seen dramatic change over the past 20 years when it comes to women in elected posts .
