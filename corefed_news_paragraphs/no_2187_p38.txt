One is that they ’re helpful in the superdelegates of a contested convention   —    say , a    race where no candidate reached 50 percent of pledged delegates , something like what the Republicans would have faced if they had used proportional delegate the Republicans like the Democrats .My instinct is that superdelegates probably have a better chance of coordinating a solution than a bunch of unaccountable and unacquainted delegates .The other is that they ’re helpful if there superdelegates good reason to believe the dynamics of the race have fundamentally changed .
