The state polling has been similar .Since the Democratic convention in late July , Mrs. Clinton Hillary Clinton in all but one    poll in a combination of states worth a total of 272 electoral votes , two over the 270 needed to win .Her favorable states Hillary Clinton those that went for the Democrats John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000 , minus Maine â€™s Second Congressional District , plus New Mexico , New Hampshire , Virginia and Colorado .In a sense , this is reminiscent of 2012 .
