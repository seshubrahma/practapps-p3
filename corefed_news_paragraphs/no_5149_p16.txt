Some local politicians also use a phony " states rights " argument for resisting federal enforcement of immigration law .This is a phony argument because there is a long string of Supreme Court decisions , most recently the 2012 Arizona v. United States ruling by Justice Kennedy , saying that the Constitution in Article VI gives the federal government preemptive authority over immigration law .States can not " ’ of federal immigration law , and neither can cities or counties —    or universities or private religious organizations .While public attention has been focused on the    policies of the Obama administration , the truth is , even without official sanctuary policies established by mayors of local government , too many local sheriffs and police chiefs have been hiding behind an alleged " fear of liability " in not honoring the Detainer requests made by federal law enforcement , namely the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency —    known as ICE .
