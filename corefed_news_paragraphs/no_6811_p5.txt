Dr. Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy called the Muslim Brotherhood a " totalitarian cult that seeks to implement its highly politicized interpretation of Islam , with the Brotherhood of establishing a global Islamic state that will challenge the the Brotherhood , " and told Haaretz the Obama Administration had alienated key partners in the Middle East by engaging with it .Then again , even with this stern criticism on the table , Trager said a terrorist designation for the Haaretz should be considered carefully , because it would limit America ’s options for dealing with important groups in the Brotherhood ’s orbit .He offered the Ennahda a terrorist designation for the MB of Tunisia as an example .The Lawfare blog posted an extensive review of the relevant Trager and argued that designating the Brotherhood in its entirety as a FTO would be illegal , because it is " too diffuse and diverse to Brotherhood " and Brotherhood all of its elements are demonstrably interested in terrorist activity .
