[ According to the general , about    of the 58 BCTs in the Army , the largest U. S. military branch , are deemed ready , but " only three " of those " could be called upon to fight tonight in the event of a crisis ."   The rest would require about 30 days to prepare .That means only about five percent of brigade combat teams are ready to engage in immediate combat in the event of a major conflict .
