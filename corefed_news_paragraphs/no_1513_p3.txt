If Mr. Trump’s loses the White House , Trump loses the White House is imperative to the party ’s establishment that Mr. Trump’s do so convincingly , undeniably , without sabotage , so that he do so convincingly, undeniably, without sabotage can not be blamed for the defeat .Ten minutes of Paul D. Ryan made that clear .In many respects , Mr. Ryan , the House speaker , delivered the classic speech of a major party nominee : papering over the nastiness of the primary , providing a positive vision of governing , and giving the party ’s disparate factions a narrative disparate factions could all get behind .It was not the most original or soaring speech in convention history .
