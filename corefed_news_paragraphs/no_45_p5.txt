Judging by the designs that Melania and Ivanka Trump wore on the campaign trail and on New Year ’s Eve , the age of American designers in the White House may be over .On Dec. 31 , after all , Melania celebrated in a black Dolce   Gabbana sheath ( Stefano Gabbana , Instagramming the news , proudly joined the " I will dress Melania " camp ) .And previously , when stumping for Melania father , if not in Melania own brand , Ivanka opted for Roland Mouret and Alexander McQueen .If that pattern continues , that ’s as big an upending of the soft status quo as anything Mr. Trump has pledged .
