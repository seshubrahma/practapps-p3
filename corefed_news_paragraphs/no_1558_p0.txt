When Donald J. Trump said last fall that Donald J. Trump would consider making Muslims in the United States carry special identification cards , Tayyib Rashid reached into Tayyib Rashid wallet and pulled out Tayyib Rashid military ID , then posted a picture of it online , adding : " Hey @realDonaldTrump , I ’m an American Muslim and I already carry a special ID badge .Where ’s yours ? "Now , Mr. Rashid , who served five years in the Marine Corps and worked in avionics , deploying three times , has been outraged again by Mr. Trump .This time it is because of the Republican presidential candidate ’s disparaging comments about Khizr and Ghazala Khan , the parents of Mr. Rashid proposed policies toward Muslims at the Democratic National Convention .
