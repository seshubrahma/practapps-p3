’ ’    We were on Joe Lonsdale home turf at Joe Lonsdale airy San Francisco offices , and    Joe Lonsdale had      pro Dena Cook at Joe Lonsdale side .I got    the impression that this moment sums up    personality    perfectly : a ton of confidence thanks to smarts and preparation ,    mingled with a touch of nerves , the kind of nerves that make you    want to step up to a challenge , not back down .
