There is considerable hypocrisy in the statements issued this past week by mayors and governors proclaiming , " We will not help federal officials enforce federal immigration law ."As to the arguments heard every day in defense of sanctuary city policies , sanctuary city policies are hollow and unpersuasive to most Americans .The inconvenient truth is that ending sanctuary city policies is a step toward equal justice for all , citizen and illegal immigrant alike .
