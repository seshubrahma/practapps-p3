There has been an unusual degree of preparation for this meeting , given that it is not expected to produce any significant announcements on economic or security issues .For the Germans , however , this meetingTrump White House remains something of a riddle .    ideological players , like Mr. Navarro and the chief strategist , Stephen K. Bannon , vie with more conventional , realist ones , like Gary D. Cohn , the director of the National Economic Council , and Lt . Gen. H. R. McMaster , the national security adviser .
