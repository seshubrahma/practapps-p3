I dislike the symbolism of this wall , but the status quo , where we have large swaths of a wall ,    gaps in parts of the desert that are particularly dangerous to cross , and armed guards on patrol , many of them corrupt , is nâ€™t exactly a symbol of welcome !It may have more costs than a barrier that decreased instances of agents and migrants meeting .Either way , so long as the War on Drugs continues , there will be    routes that double as human smuggling routes ."
