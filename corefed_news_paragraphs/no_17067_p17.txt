It is equally easy for Traditional Americans to label progressives " those liberals " and not seek to understand their fears or motivations .For both Americas , the instinctive response can be to dig in deeper to the    echo chamber of groupthink those liberals rather than to acknowledge a failure in understanding the " other "     Americans alive today .While Traditional America gloats in a victory lap , the reality is that generational belief trends among America ’s young signal Progressive America ’s future reign in coming decades .The more dramatically Traditional America gloats today , the more dramatic will Traditional America the backlash in four years or eight years , when progressives retake the throne .
