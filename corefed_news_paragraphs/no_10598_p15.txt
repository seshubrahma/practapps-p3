Suffice it to say , if Bush was n’t a bad enough day for the Rubio campaign , it got even worse when their communications director Alex Conant Rubio and puffed it a CNN interview with the Rubio campaign Blitzer that all was well in wonderland : Wolf , Jamie ’s[ Gangel ’s ] report was utter nonsense .Wolf Blitzer did not contact the campaign prior to coming on the show last hour and reporting that the Rubio campaign is 100 percent absolutely false .I think CNN is doing a disservice to voters by airing that sort of reporting without even checking with the campaign .
