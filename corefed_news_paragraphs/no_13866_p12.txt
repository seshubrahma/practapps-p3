During the primaries , I covered New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ( Date of Campaign Death :     New Hampshire ) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich ( DOCD :     Indiana ) with bits of Bush ( DOCD :     South Carolina )Cruz ( DOCD :     Indiana ) and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida ( DOCD :     Florida ) .My producer and I jokingly called ourselves Team Grim Cruz (DOCD:    Indiana) and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida (DOCD:    Florida)     whichever campaign we began to Cruz (DOCD:    Indiana) and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida (DOCD:    Florida) seemed to face imminent death .
