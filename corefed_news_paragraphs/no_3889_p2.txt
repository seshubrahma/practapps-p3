Democrats thought misleading Congress was no big deal until today: Call it no big deal example of   " whataboutism " if you will , but it no big deal noting for the record that Democrats were quick to dismiss blatantly false statements to Congress Congress such individuals as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , IRS Commissioner John Koskinen , and Sessionsâ€™ predecessor Attorney General Eric Holder as trivial errors .And , of course , Democrats launched an    jihad against the very concept of perjury to keep Bill Clinton in power in the Nineties .In each case , congressional Democrats showed the maximum possible indulgence to Obama administration officials , blithely accepting every claim of imperfect memory , misunderstanding of questions , and even rank incompetence as acceptable excuses .
