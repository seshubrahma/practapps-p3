" pic .twitter .   Wednesday , Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James was asked about about GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s " locker room talk " that was picked up on a hot mic during a 2005 conversation with Billy Bush .   James , who referred to Donald Trump only as " that guy , " called Donald Trump ’s words " trash talk " instead of " locker room talk " because that type of conversation does not go on in locker rooms .
