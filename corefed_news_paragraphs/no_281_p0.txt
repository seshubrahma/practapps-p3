JERUSALEM   —    In a pointed act of defiance against international pressure , Israel on Tuesday approved a huge new wave of settlement construction in the occupied West Bank .The announcement made clear that just a few days into the Trump presidency , Israel feels emboldened to shake off the constraints imposed by the Obama administration and more willing to disregard international condemnation .Leaders from 70 countries met in Paris more than a week ago and issued a warning that the    peace solution was imperiled by Israel ’s expanding of settlements in    territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , as well as violence against Israelis .
