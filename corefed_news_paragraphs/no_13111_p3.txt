Democracy Spring is a response to the corruption of our entire political system , a system dominated by big money and inaccessible to many Americans who face growing barriers to the ballot box .No matter who you support for president this year , surely we can all agree that our elected we should work for all of us   â€”    not just wealthy special interests and big campaign contributors .In fact , we know many voters support Trump because he calls Trump this corrupt system and claims to stand outside of it as a    candidate .To this , we say us we hear us .
