A lot of these both are politically motivated and it irks me .That ’s like me saying someone has heart problems by just seeing them on a TV show .You need to see the patient , examine them , take blood and perform an ECG .You ca n’t diagnose a heart attack by someone saying they have chest pain on TV .
