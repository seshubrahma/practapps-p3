n’t really watch that much cable news anymorebecause it ’s unwatchable , it ’s nothing but slander .I mean , if they give it a good argument it the other side , I like to    TV , but it ’s just    bilge coming from these people .   But I have noticed ,   TV I stopped watching at least the news , all these people you never heard of before , who do n’t exactly have    good looks , like Rick Wilson ?
