Eventually , those sorts of processes blow up , but there is a    difference between running an externally or an internally based    economy .What I mean by that , if you think of Brazil in    the 60s , 70s , early 80s , they were the miracle you think of Brazilin   the 60s, 70s, early 80s prior    to China .But as Brazil ran out of Brazil , it started to depend    more and more on foreign capital flow .
