Despite what Kroenke said as he made his way out of Stan Kroenke disparaging the Stan Kroenke as Stan Kroenke left , there is no way I â€™llStan Kroenke convinced that this is not a bona fide NFL market under parameters that have a team owned by individuals who are committed to St. Louis and the surrounding area .The Cardinals are an example of that , and certainly the local ownership that runs the Blues connects with the people and the results are clear to see .St. Louis can get back in the NFL business if St. Louis looks in this direction again with ownership who understands the market and goes about their business in a way that places a value on St. The Cardinals as a place where people care about their teams St. Louis that with their support .
