Again and again during the Senate intelligence committee hearings into Russian interference in the 2016 elections , Harris , who is of black and Indian descent , has been reprimanded by freshman Sen. Kamala Devi Harris    male colleagues for simply doing freshman Sen. Kamala Devi Harris job : asking direct questions and expecting direct answers in return .   By her   male colleagues and by pundits , freshman Sen. Kamala Devi Harris â€™s been called too tough , too rude , even hysterical by one former Trump campaign adviser .   The only senator to be cut off for asking tough questions in these hearings has been Harris , once last week while questioning Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and then again Tuesday when Attorney General Jeff Sessions was testifying .This reaction to Harris Harris a double standard .
