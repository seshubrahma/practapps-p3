m not sure how much it helps the presidency election , but he did Christie himself rather Christie .Of the others , interestingly , I thought that Trump and Cruz did n’t hurt themselves very much , but they did themselves help themselves , themselves of them had themselves rocky nights .I thought Trump on the defensive in the way he was Christie nasty with Bush in saying , you know , attempting to shush him .Bush interestingly Cruz retreated when he was Christie a chance to hit   —    or repeat his hit Christie Trump about personality and temperament .
