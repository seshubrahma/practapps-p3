Frustration must never lead to resignation , however : that is why , on Saturday , I and many other Muslims will be marching in Washington , D. C. in solidarity with thousands of others for our climate and the protection of the vulnerable .Prophet Mohammed ( peace and blessings be upon Prophet Mohammed ( ) leaves Muslims like me in no doubt as to the duty we humans share :" God has made the Earth green and beautiful , and God has appointed you as stewards over it , " God said .There is no greater threat to our " green and beautiful " the Earth than the more frequent and intense droughts , floods and storms brought by climate change .
