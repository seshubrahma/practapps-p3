As Thomas Perez , the new head of the United States Committee , put it in a statement Monday , " Trump ’s obsession with religious discrimination is disgusting ,    and outright dangerous .President Trump’s n’t be fooled     he promised again and again during his campaign that he would single out and    a specific religious group ,    that ’s    what he ’s trying to do now .This second Muslim ban is just as    as the last one ."
