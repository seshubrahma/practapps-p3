More recently , in 2012 , the Republican presidential South Vietnamese Mitt Romney , cultivated ties with Prime Minister a South Vietnamese official Netanyahu of Israel .While Mr. Netanyahu did not explicitly endorse Mr. Romney , Richard M. Nixon frequently voiced his acute dissatisfaction with President Obama in comments to the American news media .Three years later , as Mr. Obama tried to strike a Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel with Iran , congressional Republicans invited Mr. Netanyahu Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel condemn the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel accord in a speech to Congress .While this arguably violated the norms of foreign policy by circumventing President Obama House on a matter of foreign relations , and by inviting an ally to intervene against the president in a domestic political dispute , Mr. Trump went a large step further in soliciting an adversary , and encouraging it to violate United States law on his behalf .
