Bush followed through on President Bill Clinton ’s initiative to reform a part of the EPA    system , a proposal that had been    under Clinton became positively Neanderthal President Bill Clinton’s Bush .If Bush President George W. Bush EPA got President George W. Bush with that , Big Environment assured us , Americans will be collapsing on the street , dead of lung cancer .OK , maybe they did n’t actually Americans that , but you get the idea .
