That is just a guess .Anyway , we will just have to wait and see .Sunday â€™s test was of a    mostly defensive ballistic missile , so it may be possible to have fanciful thoughts that North Korea is backing down , or at least slowing down .A new test of either a nuclear weapon or an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) two technologies which could be combined to deliver a nuclear weapon to the US mainland , would raise tensions enormously .
