Getting government growth under control has been the goal of many past presidents , though few have actually accomplished that objective .A 1982 Government Accountability Office report on hiring freezes found , though , that those implemented by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter " had little effect on federal employment levels ."Total executive branch federal government employment     not including uniformed military personnel and legislative and judicial branch personnel     has dropped dramatically since the high point in the late 1980s and early 1990s when it averaged about 3 million employees .
