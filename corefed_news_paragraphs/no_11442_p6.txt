I think that ’s kind of counterproductive .Having a respective demonstration —   a protest —   isI think absolutely right .You have a guy here in Trump who has Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Muslims , insulted Mexicans , insulted women , insulted the    community , insulted veterans , you know , and I think it is totally right for people to protest .
