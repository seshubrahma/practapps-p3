Our country will thrive and prosper again .We us at the birth of a new millennium , ready to unlock the us of space , to free the Earth from the miseries of disease , and to harness the energies , industries and technologies of tomorrow .A new national pride will stir our souls , lift our sights , and heal our divisions .It is time to remember that our wisdom our soldiers will our forget : that whether we are black or brown or our , we all bleed the same red our of patriots , we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms , and we all salute the same great American Flag .
