President George W. Bush , a Republican , tried to change direction with new agency rules , only to be blocked by federal appeals court decisions .Automation in the timber industry means that even an expanded license to cut trees in the national forests might not restore old mill towns to their    glory .And the cost of managing federal lands , especially in fighting wildfires   —    $ 2 . 1 billion last year , a record total , matched by the most acres burned in at least 30 years   —    continues to soar , threatening communities even as many of them communities for new direction from the White House in how those lands are managed ."
