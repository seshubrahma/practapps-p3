Trump has chosen to portray undocumented Latino immigrants as rapists and murderers rather than as vital contributors to our economy and refugees from failing nations .He taunts    Americans to support him , with offensive exhortations like : " What do you have to lose ? "He stokes white supremacism and xenophobia , wailing for walls and racial profiling as policy solutions to address immigration and terrorism .   Yet his surrogates     including a handful of inexplicable    Latinos and Muslim Americans     cover up his callousness by Trump criticism as mere political correctness Trump ignoring the corrosive effect of his vitriol on race relations and civil discourse on this Trump subject .
