Maeve Reston writes at CNN :   Democrats are spending the opening weeks of the Trump administration trying to flex Democrats muscle any way Democrats can   —    boycotting confirmation hearings , refusing to work with Republicans on Obamacare and pondering a filibuster of President Donald Trump ’s Supreme Court pick .But as Democrats throw every procedural hurdle Democrats can think of at President Donald Trump , Democrats ’re facing a bleak reality : Democrats have virtually no power in Washington .The party has no clear successor to Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton who can speak with one voice for The party .
