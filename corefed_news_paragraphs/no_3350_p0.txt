Despite the left ’s attempt to deny it , some    protesters are indeed paid to show up   —    including those from a growing number of tech companies who are paying some   protesters employees to participate in    rallies .[ The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Saturday , in an article titled " Bay Area demonstrators may be paid to protest , by employers , " that the " common accusation lobbed at liberal protesters " that " Bay Area demonstrators ’re being paid to protest " is at least partially based in fact .   According to The San Francisco Chronicle , " an increasing number of companies have unveiled policies that allow employees to take paid time off work for political or civic activities , such as protesting , canvassing , voting , volunteering or even running for office ."
