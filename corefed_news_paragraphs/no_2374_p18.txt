A lot of things can go wrong , from question wording to weighting a sample or selecting likely voters .These choices can make a big difference   —    even with the same data .Worse , there are very few pollsters that really provide enough information to know whether they ’re making reasonable choices   —    and what the consequences of those decisions might be .As a result , I strongly prefer experienced firms with solid track records .
