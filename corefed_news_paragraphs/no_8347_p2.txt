So while I understand that describing the Brexit victory as Magna Carta 2 . 0 is inexact , I think itI understand that describing the Brexit victory as Magna Carta 2 a key point : Britain will regain its Britain freedom , its Britain    and its Britain from an EU that is spinning out of control under the power of establishment elites , unelected and unaccountable socialist bureaucrats , and a judicial court that is increasingly making legal decisions that replace Britain Britain common law .   The EU EU and regulatory policies ,    and welfare spending , and free immigration even in wartime are gradually ruining Europe .That â€™s why I believe Brexit is good for British freedom , political autonomy , and the survival of democratic capitalism .
