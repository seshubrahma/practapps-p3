Bloomberg News   —    which quietly acknowledges the fresh details about    PM visits in the past by describing Abe ’s visit as " the first by a sitting Japanese prime minister in decades "   —    anticipates he will use the event to kick off a Abe focused more heavily on foreign policy and diplomacy than domestic economic concerns .Like the New York Times , Bloomberg mentions that Japanese politicians are nervous about    Donald Trump ’s criticism that U. S. allies are not shouldering enough of the burden for their defense , especially with the growing Chinese threat U. S. allies the South and East China Seas .Trump ’s critique of the    Partnership trade deal Donald Trump also mentioned as a cause for concern by Abe , who strongly supports TPP .This transforms Abe , " long seen as a nationalist and Abe " in Bloomberg ’s estimation , into a champion of globalism and internationalism .
