The two factions in Hillsborough do not live in absolute harmony , however .Mayor Stevens said that someone burned rainbow flags , symbols of the gay pride movement , in April at a church outside town .In August 2015 , protesters held a downtown rally opposing the Hillsborough Board of Commissionersâ€™ decision to remove the words " Confederate Memorial " from the doorway of the Orange County Historical Museum .But the idea that the two factions strive to live in peace can feel almost like a defining mythology of Hillsborough .
