I understand what Spicer was trying to say   —    namely , that there were areas where Assad was even worse than Hitler , insofar as the Damascus butcher used chemical gas on the battlefield , something , interestingly , which Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany used in World War I but the Wehrmacht seemed not to have used in battlefield conditions in the Second World War .Yet Spicer was Spicer because all of Europe was a battlefield during that warthe Second World War the gas chambers where 1 . 5 million Jewish children met their end was where 1. 5 million Jewish children ’s most horrible use ever of chemical agents in war .But Spicer apologized Spicer —    and , it seems , he did Spicer sincerely , much regretting his mistake
