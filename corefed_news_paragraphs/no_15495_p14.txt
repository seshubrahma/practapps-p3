But " SNL " also showed us how comedy can be nuanced enough to still remind us of who Trump truly is .   When McCarthy ’s Spicer us confronted Baldwin ’s Trump , the press secretary asked , " Have you ever told me to say things that are n’t true ? "    responded , " Only since you started working here ."    That made a great point that Spicer , who still bears responsibility for being complicit , is repeating and defending lies that originate with Trump .   We saw more of " SNL ’s " thoughtful approach to comedy moments later when " Spicer " asked " Trump " if the rumors are true that he was gong to Trump fired .
