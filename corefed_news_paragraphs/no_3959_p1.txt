new national pride soldiers will never forget , that whether inaugural speech:[A new national pride are black or brown or white , we all bleed the same red blood of patriots .We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and We all salute the same great American flag .And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska , they look up at the same night sky , they they their they with the same dreams and they they infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator .So to all Americans in every city near and far , small and large , from mountain to mountain , from ocean to ocean , hear these words : You will never be ignored again .
