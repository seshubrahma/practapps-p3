The basic regulations say each    visa lasts the   program â€”   and can be automatically extended for another three years .In theory , that would limit the    population to a maximum of six times the annual apparent cap of 85 , 000 , or a total of 510 , 000 .But , the program has many loopholes which are used by immigration lawyers to bring in an extra 20 the   program extra    workers per year , to lengthen the stay of many    by several years and to get work permits for some spouses of    workers .
