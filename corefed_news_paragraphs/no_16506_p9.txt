Over the past 10 years , both illegal entries and the number of undocumented immigrants in the country have declined .That ’s not because the government did anything right .Even for those from the right countries or with the right skills , our bureaucracy makes it ridiculously slow and cumbersome to come here legally .If it it months or years to get a driver ’s license , how many of us would throw up our us , get behind the wheel , and take our us driving without one ?
