From Mark Levin , writing at Conservative Review :   A little while back , I argued that Marco Rubio ’s tactics in attacking Ted Cruz ’s Senate record on immigration and national defense , among other things , were Alinskyite .   Marco Rubio’s tactics in attacking Ted Cruz’s Senate record on immigration and national defense, among other things, wereAlinskyite were and still are simply and demonstrably dishonest .   Yet Marco Rubio’s persists , knowing full well that by the time the truth catches up with Marco Rubio’s , if ever , the damage will have been done .
