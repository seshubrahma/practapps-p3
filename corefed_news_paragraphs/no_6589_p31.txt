The Missouri State University Chorale performed an original song ," Now We Belong , " written by Michael Dennis Browne .The lyrics captured the " Deplorable " mood of the day perfectly : Here are the voices of every creature , Here are the calls of every heartHere is the place of strangers’ welcome , We who once walked in strangers’ shoes .Once we were strangers , strangers’ were welcomed , Now we belong and we in this land .
