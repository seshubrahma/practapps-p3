Yes Clinton she can come across as Clinton and combative .Frankly , though , I do not know a single human being who could endure the level of scrutiny she has without having some Clinton of wall up .Her demeanor means it can Clinton hard for her to connect emotionally , Clinton that guarded persona is not the one most recognizable to those who really know Clinton .It is easy Clinton people to misinterpret guarded for shady .
