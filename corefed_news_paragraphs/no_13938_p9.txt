Would you want to be married to a man who has never been moved to tears by his love him appreciation of another human being ?But I am not kidding myself .We have a long way to go in transforming masculinity .There are still far too many men     and , if we take We ’s comments as evidence , women     who insist that real men do n’t cry , that a man with a tissue is really just a " sissy .
