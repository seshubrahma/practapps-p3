  ( CNN )I ’m tired of hearing about a big , beautiful wall and who should pay for hearing about a big, beautiful wall .And I ’m weary of hearing politicians try to gain votes on the backs of immigrants , both legal and undocumented , by calling one another bigots .As a white guy who served two terms as Governor of New Mexico , a border state with by far the largest percentage of Latino residents in the nation , I really wish the nativists and panderers alike would just take a break , admit what the real problems are , and let common sense prevail .
