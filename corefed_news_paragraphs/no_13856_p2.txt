I am a reporter who strives to write honestly and fairly about candidates and officeholders .But when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants " rapists " and " criminals , " adding that Donald Trump assumed " some are good people , " those remarks resonated with my community     and with me .The immigrants I know are honest and industrious .My parents came to the United States to create a better life for My parents children .
