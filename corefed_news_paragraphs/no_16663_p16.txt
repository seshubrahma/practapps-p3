American campuses are in the throes of coming to terms with this complicated reality , and the controversy will only lead to good things in the long run .That is , the conflicts themselves will cause intelligent ,    people to debate what it means to behave in a civil manner .And there will be errors on all sides : that â€™s in the nature of the dialectic .    Eventually , people will ( I hope ) learn to behave in ways that show respect for those on the margins but still allow for a maximum of free speech .
