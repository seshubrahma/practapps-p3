We are motivated , in large part , by the fact that if Trump has a 1 in 30 chance of being president , we We not comfortable with those odds .   But he Trump not running as a fringe third party .He Trump on the Republican ticket and his Trump are far better than 1 in 30 .   More to the point , we oppose him Trump , for example , " he Trump the character , values , and experience to be president " and that he Trump would be the most reckless president in American history .
