Posters "Gilmore Girls" appeared on The New York Times with little dangling paper slips that can be torn off and taken away .But instead of offering yoga lessons or a used sofa , they are simple written compliments   —    and they ’re free .The posters are the brainchild of Anna Sergeeva , 26 , a San Francisco artist .
