the standard of living of people .But I also think it â€™s a       issue in geopolitics too .With all those fledgling    countries in Asia , who really want to stand with us but they live    under all those fledgling   countries in Asia, who really want to stand with us shadow of China and the smaller shadow of Russia .So I    just think it    really important    economically and    geopolitically .
