Amidst the faux outrage over Donald Trump ’s    of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) —   whom Donald Trump’s rejected before , and rejected again later Sunday —   there was a more legitimate controversy the media largely missed .[ In an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday , Donald Trump reiterated earlier claims that the federal judge presiding in a fraud case against Trump University in California could be biased against Donald Trump simply because Donald Trump is Hispanic .   Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel , of the Southern District of California , was nominated by President Barack Obama , and later confirmed by voice vote in the Senate in 2012 without controversy .After attending Indiana University for both college and law school , and before becoming a judge , he served for 17 years as a federal prosecutor in California , specializing in narcotics —   which , theoretically , should endear he to Trump .
