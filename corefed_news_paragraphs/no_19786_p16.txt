It ’s a shame that more people the American film industry n’t see the empty moral core behind the glittering facade .This is a weak argument , as you might expect if you study what is publicly known about Meryl Streep and Donald Trump and ponder the former not having moral standing to criticize the latter .It presumes rather too much about why Streep clapped .And it is a Meryl Streep form of weak It for a social conservative , of all people , to indulge in a moment of convenience .
