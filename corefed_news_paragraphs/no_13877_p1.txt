"Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing , not a bad thing .Only ’stupid’ people , or fools , would think that it is bad , We have enough problems around the WORLD without yet another one .When I am President , Russia will respect us far more than Russia do now and both countries will , perhaps , work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD !
