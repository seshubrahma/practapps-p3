technically , visitors may pay what they wish .I went to a visitors exhibit on sports photography , " Who Shot Sports , " as well as a    exhibit of beautiful Williamsburg housing project murals of the 1930s .If you ’re going to the museum , it ’s worthyour the Brooklyn Museum visit the the Brooklyn Museum botanic garden as well ( and maybe stop at the Mister Softee truck parked on Washington Avenue on your way ) .
