It makes for a relatively fast meal , and It should leave you time to clean up ahead of the first    debate of this election season .( Alternatively , you can roast up some loaded nachos and eat some loaded nachos while watching , drinking beer and taking a shot of whiskey every time Mrs. Clinton says " breaking down barriers " and each time Mr. Trump mentions " the wall .")I â€™d be making plans for the rest of the week , too .
