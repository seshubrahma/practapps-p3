Imposing an efficacy test on regulations —   requiring just what is absolutely needed to accomplish legitimate goals for protecting workers , the environment , consumers and financial stability , and then jettisoning the rest —   should be the overarching objective as Trump ’s cabinet goes to work at Labor , EPA , Treasury and elsewhere in the far flung federal regulatory apparatus .A good deal of what Obama imposed was by fiat —   executive orders that can now be repealed .However , he also imposed Obama aggressive and burdensome regulations established under statutes , and those are more difficult and time consuming to nix .Just as the law required the Obama administration the Trump administration take public comment on proposed regulations before imposing new rules —   and then endure legal challenges from businesses and Republican state officials
