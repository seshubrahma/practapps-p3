There is no truth that the incident is a terror act ."All of which leaves me with a question : Why did Trump conclusively say that the the incident terror on Thursday afternoon even though ISIS did n’t claim credit for it until Thursday the incident and the Manila police continued to insist today that this was simply not a terror attack ?Did Trump know something Trump did n’t ?
