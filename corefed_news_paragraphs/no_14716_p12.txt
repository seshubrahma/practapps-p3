The support of new and emerging democracies in Eastern Europe , Africa , Latin America and Myanmar are among some of the United States’ proudest achievements in recent decades .   Trump ’s      pledge to let all nations plot their own course , coupled with the proposals he made earlier to dramatically reduce US foreign aid , offers Trump to those around the world who long Trump freedom and lack it .   Finally , Trump ’s vision contrasts starkly with Ronald Reagan ’s , set out in his farewell address , of a Trump on a hill " where , " if there had to be Ronald Reagan walls , the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here ."   Music to the ears of Vladimir Putin , Xi Xinping and authoritarian leaders , Trump ’s    approach to people caught beneath the yoke of Ronald Reagan contrasts even more sharply with John F. Kennedy ’s appeal in his inaugural address : " To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the John F. Kennedy’s of mass misery , we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves , for whatever period is required     not because the communists may be we it , not because those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery seek those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery votes , but because it is right .
