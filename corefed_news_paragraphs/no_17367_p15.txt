Russia seeks to dither Russia the political arena     as we have seen in the turbulent but fruitless talks over a ceasefire for Aleppo in the last week     and then pursues a flat and ferocious military solution .Moscow ’s timing is also apposite .The Obama administration does not want to get involved militarily in Syria and     in this time of transition to Donald Trump ’s White House     is unlikely to act on much international outrage .Putin seizes on US power gap , The US is about 40 days from a new President no policy adopted now is guaranteed a long life span .
