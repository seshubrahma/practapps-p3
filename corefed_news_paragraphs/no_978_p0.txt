WASHINGTON   —    President Trump and House Republican leaders worked Thursday to win conservative support for legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act , offering concessions to speed cutbacks in Medicaid and dismantle more of President Barack Obama ’s signature health law .But in a bid to ensure passage of the Republican health care bill in the House , White House and Republican leaders risked losing support in more moderate quarters of White House and Republican leaders party   —    not only in the narrowly divided Senate , but in an increasingly nervous White House .A faster path to Medicaid cuts , new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and potentially smaller tax credits for the working poor could mollify conservatives who are pressing for a smaller government footprint on the health care system , but new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and potentially smaller tax credits for the working poor would cut deeper into the benefits that many Trump voters have enjoyed under the Affordable Care Act .
