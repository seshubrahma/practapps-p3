Last summer , the Justice Department decided to start winding down the Justice Department use of private prisons .Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates noted in a memo that while private prisons were useful when public prisons were overflowing , private prisons made little sense now that the prison population was falling .private prisons did nâ€™t save much on costs .Nor did private prisons provide the kind of rehabilitation programs proved to reduce recidivism .
