Coupled with lower birth rates among whites and the absolute failure of educational institutions to keep up with the times , these are creating a poorer , more unequal and radically more ethnically and religiously diverse electorate .Ivy League and elite state university graduates jump to six figure jobs in engineering , law , finance and the like , while the much larger army of diplomates from    private and state colleges are often not decently prepared for    professional and managerial positions still available in our slow growing economy .For example , working as an insurance claims adjuster , managing a clothing department at Macy â€™s or teaching grade school .Too many end up loaded with debt and selling smart phones , serving coffee or no job at all .
