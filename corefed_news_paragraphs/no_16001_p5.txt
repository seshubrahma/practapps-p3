Yes , I am grateful , but I am also angry today     angry for my family members , neighbors and loved ones .Despite qualifying for deferred deportations under President Obama ’s 2014 directives , they are being forced deferred deportations under President Obama’s 2014 directives remain in the shadows by a partisan lawsuit     and now , in part , by a partisan effort against filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court .To know that the    protections that I celebrated in 2012 are still not available to many whom I love motivates me every day .DACA currently provides me with the ability to live without the constant fear of deportation .
