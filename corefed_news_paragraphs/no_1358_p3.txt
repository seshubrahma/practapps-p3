Former Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida , who retains a strong network of donors , said he would raise money for Mr. Donald J. Trump but was unsure about Donald J. Trump , like temporarily banning foreign Donald J. Trump from entering the United States .For a party that usually rallies around its presumptive nominee quickly , the brutal primary campaign and the questions about Mr. Trump ’s substance and style have Donald J. Trump level of dissatisfaction   —    antipathy that will not fade simply because Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio have ceded the race to him .The journey from denial and resistance to Donald J. Trump acceptance , and even peace , with the Trump nomination may never be complete for some Republicans .
