Democrats will act like crusading heroes trying to prevent the selfish Republicans from killing poor people by taking away their poor people care .Conviction and moral preening will come easily to the other side .If Republicans ca nâ€™t muster a comparable level of moral authority , they Republicans as well skip a political battle they Republicans destined to lose .Part of the price paid for the hasty initial effort to repeal Obamacare was a significant slide in GOP poll numbers on health care a slide helped along by    theatrics at town hall meetings .
