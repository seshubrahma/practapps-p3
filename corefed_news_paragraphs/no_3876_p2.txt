Over the strenuous objections of the dissent , the Fourth Circuit ruled , in a similar manner as their sister Ninth Circuit Court Appeals has in a parallel challenge to the travel ban , that even the Fourth Circuit order is neutral with regard to Muslims in its text ,   statements President Trump and his surrogates made during the campaign turn it into violation of the First Amendment â€™s Establishment Clause .The majority opinion made the executive order mention of the terror attacks in Manchester , England , committed by the Islamist the campaign of immigrants from Libya , a country named in the order as a potential source of terror , on the day before the ruling was issued .Instead , Fourth Circuit quoted " former National Security Officials " saying the executive order served " no legitimate national security purpose " and that " there is no evidence of any new security risks emanating from these countries ."
