So , I think there ’s going to be a lot of    clean    energy industry and all the jobs associated with those industries    in the United States to stay the course , because in fact this has    been a pretty big engine of growth the United States :That may be so , but is there enough of that    pressure to counter pressure from the    based companies    in the U. S. who are probably better represented in ’ ’CB than renewable energy ?Do n’tyou have somebody in the White House    now who ’s going to be The U. S. deal on every front ?
