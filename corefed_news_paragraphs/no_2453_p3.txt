Mr. Zuckerberg statement pointed up how much Facebook struggles to find the balance between Facebook mission to be a    utopia for Facebook 1 . 8 billion users and Facebook responsibility to protect Facebook from all that is defamatory , dangerous ( like terrorist propaganda ) and untrue .But more to the point , it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away .Do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting   —    without basis   —    that Hillary Clinton was involved in John F. Kennedy Jr. ’s fatal plane crash in 1999 should be allowed to stand ?Really ?
