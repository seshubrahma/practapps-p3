And thus the Democrats suffer from continuing vulnerability on the Obamacare issue .   That is , the Democrats and the Democrats program have failed completely to uphold Barack Obama ’s 2008 campaign promise to cut the average family ’s annual healthcare bill by $ 2500 .   Instead , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , the average cost of family insurance premiums has risen from $ 13 , 375 in 2009 ( the first year that Barack Obama was in office ) to $ 18 , 142 in 2016 .   In other words , instead of the promised 20 percent reduction , American families have faced a 35 percent increase .
