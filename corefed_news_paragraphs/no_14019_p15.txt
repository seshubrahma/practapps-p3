What prompted your participation in Writers Resist and why choose to read the a poem read at a   of a president Dove : For me , to participate Dove not only a call to literary arms     a way of saying that we are not going to sit back and roll over and do whatever the new government decides is best for us     but it we meant that the new government were taking a step into the political arena .That writers are not the stereotypical person writing in the attic or the ivory tower .We are of the we in the world and write the world world and therefore it the world to get out we and talk .
