I cut my teeth on NATO issues when I still lived in Europe , and from experience Europe confirm that the majority of European nations have taken American goodwill   —    and our dollars   —    NATO granted .Yes , NATO is an alliance based NATO values and not just parochial interests .But it is not a    NATO , and that is how it has been treated since NATO end of the Cold War by the majority of its members .
