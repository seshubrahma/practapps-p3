We should be empowering parents and local school districts instead of perpetuating the same tired approach that continues to fail our nation ’s children .In many ways , the conference report was worse than the original Senate bill —   removing the few good provisions from the House bill that would have allowed some Title I portability for    students as well as a parental    from onerous federal accountability standards .The American people expect the Republican majority to do better .And our children deserve better , which is why I can not support this bill .
