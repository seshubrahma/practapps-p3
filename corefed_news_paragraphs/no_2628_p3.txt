The reason A 6. 2 magnitude earthquake caused so much damage is that many of the beautiful ancient buildings are composed of unreinforced masonry ( stone ) .many of the beautiful ancient buildings are composed of unreinforced masonry (stone) are the most dangerous buildings to be in during an earthquake as many of the beautiful ancient buildings are composed of unreinforced masonry (stone)have very little sheer strength , and therefore collapse when exposed to lateral ground accelerations .Such buildings can undergo seismic retrofitting , but the process is expensive and I suspect that most buildings in Italy have not undergone such a procedure .
