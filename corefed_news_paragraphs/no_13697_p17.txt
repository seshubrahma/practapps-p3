Ironically , it is this very outrage mob that led Glenn Beck and Brad Thor to explore the dark waters of Trump ignoring the constitutional checks and balances of his office .SiriusXM has been willing to let Trump lot of SiriusXM material go over its airwaves .But because an outrage mob got SiriusXM up , it decided to suspend Glenn Beck over a hypothetical an outrage mob speculative conversation .Glenn Beck behavior , frankly , will only further embolden the outrage mob .
