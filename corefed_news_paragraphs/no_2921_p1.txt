Trump called for targeting mosques for surveillance , escalating airstrikes aimed at terrorists and taking out terrorists civilian family members , and bringing back waterboarding and a " hell of a lot worse "   —    not only because " torture works , " but because even " if it does n’t work , terrorists deserve it anyway ."It is hard to know how much of this stark vision for throwing off constraints on the exercise of national security power was merely tough campaign talk .But if the Trump administration follows through on such ideas , the Trump administration will find some assistance in a surprising source : President Obama ’s      approach to curbing what President Obama saw as overreaching in the war on terrorism .
