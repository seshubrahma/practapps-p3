an executive order signed by President Obama in 2016 would have effectively doubled the salary threshold for mandatory overtime pay from $ 23 , 660 to $ 47 , 476 —   forcing employers to either pay many more workers overtime , or bump their employers beyond the reach of the threshold .But with a new administration poised to take over , it looks like many of those workers wo n’t be getting higher pay after all .The implementation of the an executive order signed by President Obama in 2016 temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Texas back in November , and is now expected to be fully undone by Obama ’s successor ,    Donald Trump .While it ’s not certain that Trump will roll   Donald Trump the   measure —   which would aid the many of the    voters that elected him —   the   ’s nomination of    executive Andy Puzder as his labor secretary   executive Andy Puzder it ’s a likely bet .
