Trump ’s comments about building a southern border wall and Trump’s accusations that many Mexicans in the U. S. are " criminals , drug dealers ,rapists " have outraged and alienated many American Hispanics .Yet Trump’s tough stance on illegal immigration plays well among Florida ’s more conservative Latinos .Many    especially , view illegal immigration through the same lens as many of their white Republican peers who see immigration as an achievement , not as a right , that should n’t be taken for granted by those who come to America illegally .
