hope that Steve Bannon ’s ascendancy expands the sphere of legitimate discourse to include    and religious and racial tests for civil rights .Progressives and others hope that the disgusting image of Nazi salutes at a US political rally will banish Richard Spencer and his ilk to the Richard Spencer corner of the sphere of deviance .My deep fear is that there ’s no single set of Hallin ’s spheres anymore .What ’s consensus to a Trump supporter may be deviant to a Clinton supporter and vice versa .
