A prominent Sheriff from Massachusetts on Tuesday called for leaders of sanctuary cities to be arrested for failing to uphold federal law and endangering American citizens .[ Testifying before Congress , Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson said that if " sanctuary cities are going to harbor and conceal criminal illegal aliens from ICE , which is in direct violation of Title 8 of the U. S. Code , federal arrest warrants should be issued for federal arrest warrants elected officials ."   " Our citizens would be safer if we never stopped enforcing immigration law and if we never formed or turned a blind eye toward sanctuary cities , " he continued .Some legal experts disagree , with one telling Breitbart News that it is not a crime for local leaders to disclose such information if local leaders become aware of it , so local leaders can not be arrested for undermining federal law enforcement under these circumstances .
