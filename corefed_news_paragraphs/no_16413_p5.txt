"This is a straw man , because no one is calling for nation building in the American body politic , including Hillary Clinton , who in her own Hillary Clinton appearance in Scranton , Pennsylvania , specifically said that American ground troops were " off the table " in Syria .Trump also called for an international conference to stop radical Islam and a domestic commission on the same subject .Yet holding future conferences and setting up future commissions are not policy ideas .
