The things we deride we being " thirsty " are the things that lack value in the eyes of the macho ,    American individualist , so they invite American individualist ,    derision .Hunger , for instance , is described as a presence , a motivating fire in the belly , but thirst is derided as a girly lack .Entitlement plays a part , too .
