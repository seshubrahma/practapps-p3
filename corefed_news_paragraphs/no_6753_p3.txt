In that terrible crime , our also witnessed the incredible heroism of Capitol Police .   Special Agent Crystal Griner   —    who I also had the honor of meeting during my visit to the Hospital   —    raced into gunfire , along with Special Agent David Bailey .   They saved the lives of our Members of Congress and prevented that dark day from becoming a tragedy beyond imagination .   They , like so many other courageous police officers , represent the very best of our .our salute They , and our also salute members of Alexandria Police , Fire and Rescue .
