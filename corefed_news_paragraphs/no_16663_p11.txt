I doubt that the US Constitution could have been written without our Founding Fathers " stealing " from Montesquieu and other Enlightenment thinkers .In the globalized world we occupy , we can and should expect all sorts of fascinating acts of appropriation that open up new veins of thought and feeling .Yet it â€™s never appropriate to insult people .You may do so inadvertently , of course .
