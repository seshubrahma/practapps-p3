Do you miss politics ?I always had this philosophy when I was an elected official that I should n’t be a pundit , but now I ’m called upon to be one every once in a while .Notwithstanding the flames I went down in , I ’m pretty good at ’m stuff .Have you thought about running campaigns or being a political consultant ?
