But I also guess that if you polled everyone you know , your choice will not be the same as everyone else ’s .Did you select the brutal murder of five Dallas police officers on Thursday night     a horrific attack that produced the worst death toll for law enforcement in the United States since   ?Or , is the most significant development the shocking killing of two black men by police in separate incidents in Louisiana and Minnesota in the days before , the same killings that demonstrators were protesting against in Dallas and around the United States when the sharpshooter aimed his the sharpshooter at police ?Or , maybe you think this is all a temporary bit of news , and view this week ’s developments regarding Hillary Clinton as the most important story ?
