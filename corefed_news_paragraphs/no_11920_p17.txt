That ’s because , in addition to protecting against crime , U. S. immigration law is supposed U. S. immigration the loss of your job to an illegal immigrant , protect against the sapping of your child ’s school resources , protect against the draining of your hospital ’s resources , protect your tax dollars , and protect your political system and voting franchise ( giving citizenship to illegal aliens and their U. S.   children allows them to citizenship out the votes of    citizenship citizens ) .Under Rubio ’s vision , millions of people could presumably illegally take jobs , petition for government services , fill U. S. schools , receive affirmative action , alter the country culturally , socially and politically , and be involved in substantial criminal activity so long as they do n’t get do n’t get caught millions of people tried and convicted for a    related felony .This principle is a central pillar of the open borders philosophy , which desires the free , uninhibited movement of labor across international boundaries .Rubio ’s amnesty for illegal aliens involved in criminal activity is consistent with the text of the Gang of Eight bill .
