In a remarkable interview with CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer following Thursday night ’s presidential debate , Marco Rubio ’s campaign spokesman , Alex Conant , admitted that the 2013 Gang of Eight bill , which Rubio    and ushered through the Senate , did not secure the border first .[   In the Friday interview , Wolf Blitzer pressed Conant on whether in 2013 Sen. Rubio " called up the [ former ] Florida governor [ Jeb Bush ] and asked the [former] Florida governor [Jeb Bush] for the [former] Florida governor [Jeb Bush] support for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the United States ."Conant dodged the question twice , refusing to directly answer whether Sen. Rubio had called Governor Bush to ask for Governor Bush to endorse the 2013 amnesty bill .
