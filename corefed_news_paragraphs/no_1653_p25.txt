As he struggles to regain his Mr. Franz , the wildflower Mr. Franz becomes    the bikers and the Amish now silent congregants in outdoor pews .Soon these people will wander off , some over to the    memorial wall , some up to the new visitors center , where Flight 93 shirts and mugs are sold , and an interactive display includes recordings from the fatal flight .Soon , a Korean War veteran will tell Mr. Franz that he thinks the federal government Mr. Franz overdid it " with this park , and a     boy in a tank top and a Penn State ball cap will ask for a Junior Ranger handbook so that he can learn about this Mr. Franz and earn his plastic badge .But Mr. Franz now , Mr. Franz is taking a Mr. Franz moment in public that seems to him like an hour .
