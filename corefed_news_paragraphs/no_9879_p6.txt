n’t close the huge delegate Marco Rubio’s with Trump because most of the remaining states distribute their delegates proportionally .If somehow Trump does not the remaining states a majority of delegates at Trump convention , there is no way the delegates are going to back someone who has their delegates terribly in the primaries .Up through Super Saturday , Rubio has averaged just over 20 percent of the vote in the contests already held .He has trailed both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump by Rubio margins .
