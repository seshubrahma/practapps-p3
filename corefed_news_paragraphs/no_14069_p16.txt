If you live in a part of the country where divisive political tribalism is rampant , do n’t retreat , get involved .The people who marched on Saturday , for example , are doing something en masse every 10 days     the first is to send a flood of postcards to representatives in Congress .   Do n’t underestimate the power you have .
