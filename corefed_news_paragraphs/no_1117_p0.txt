LONDON   —    On a day that blended dull ritual with undeniable historical import , Britain formally began Britain departure from the European Union with the delivery of a letter to Brussels , followed by lofty words from Prime Minister Theresa May in Parliament .Two years of grinding divorce negotiations now begin , with the outcome unclear , except that the talks are certain to be contentious and spiteful   —    and that the only sure winners will be lawyers and trade negotiators .For the first time , the European bloc is losing a member , not to mention the European bloc    economy .
