Mohammed bin Salman ’s elevation to     to the throne comes at the expense of his cousin (Mohammed bin Salman) former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz .He had been named to Mohammed bin Salman’s role in 2015 , in what many at the time called a surpriseMohammed bin Salman’s shift , replacing the King ’s    Prince Muqrin as future ruler and bumping Mohammed bin Salman to second in the line of succession .   That move has now been overturned , with Mohammed bin Nayef also stripped of his title and his roles as deputy prime minister and interior minister .
