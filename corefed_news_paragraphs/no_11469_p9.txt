Kasich could win Kasich , and perhaps as many as four , districts .He would need Kasich focus on the more liberal the Bay Area as in beachfront districts in L. A. and Orange County , where he might hope Kasich slip past the frontrunners by presenting himself as an Kasich .Winning at least one or two districts would strengthen his case at Kasich contested convention .In the few districts where Kasich is strongest Kasich he is competing Kasich with Trump , but he is probably Kasich spoiler against Cruz more widely .
