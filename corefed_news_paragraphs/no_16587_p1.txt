Just two months out from Election Day with the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tightening , the former secretary of state â€™s meeting on Friday with a bipartisan group of foreign policy experts and the press conference that followed demonstrated the increasing prominence of national security in the 2016 campaign .   Seizing an opening after a string of gaffes this week left Donald Trump vulnerable , Hillary Clinton told reporters here that the 2016 election is the " most important in our lifetime " that calls for " rational , confident and    leadership ." " No conversation about our national security would be complete unless our acknowledged that the nominee on the other side promises to do things that will make our less safe , " Hillary Clinton said ."
