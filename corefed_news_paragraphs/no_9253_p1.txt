This was a courtesy call and plus I have to tell you , George , it ’s a little mystifying to This that President Obama can reach George to a murdering dictator in Cuba in the last year and be hailed as a hero for doing it and    Donald Trump takes a courtesy call from a democratically elected leader in Taiwan and it ’s become something of a it .I think the American people appreciate the fact that our    is taking calls from and reaching out to the world and preparing on day one to lead America on the world stage ."
