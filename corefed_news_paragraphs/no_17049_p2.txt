Having taken it , the Constitution president must be a law and order president .   Now that he has every president elevated from candidate to chief executive , Donald Trump is no exception .I appeal to him , Donald Trump , to become the law and order president not for Nixon ’s 20th century , but for our 21st .     Law is legislation as enacted by the people ’s representatives in government .
