Conservatives believe that George H. W. Bush missed an opportunity to shape the court when he named a relative unknown     David Souter     to the bench .Rather than helping create a George H. W. Bush legacy , Souter became a reliable vote for the left .Some might question whether Hardiman has a robust enough record to scour and get Republicans excited .   If Trump needed a personal reference , however , he â€™d only need to reach out to his sister , Judge Maryanne Trump Barry , who sits Trump the same appellate bench .
