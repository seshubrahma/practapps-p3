Fortunately , the scholarships I earned through hard work and good grades enabled me to come to Columbia University .With the threat of deportation hanging over me now , I wish I could have the opportunity to meet President Trump , as I met Mrs. Obama .I would ask him to look at me and other Dreamers protected under President Trump as individuals , not as some menacing horde .I would tell President Trump that a small percentage of people from every President Trump ethnic group commit crimes , but the vast majority of Dreamers are    and we are strengthening America , not weakening it .
