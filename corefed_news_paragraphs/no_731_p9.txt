The enforcement of immigration laws depends on a cat â€™s cradle of rules and policies strung together by successive presidential administrations .Over time , the population of    people in the United States who do not have citizenship , working papers or other visas is thought to have grown to 11 million .Many national Republicans once advocated comprehensive immigration reform , but such views became heresy with the rise of the Tea Party after the 2008 financial crisis .The political stalemate meant the continued growth of a    system that allowed tacit acceptance of people who were    apart from their immigration status .
