Iger Iger knowingly and willingly used Iger’s a political propaganda tool , by allowing them to do and say things that caused tremendous harm to their brand purely for the sake of them own personal advancement and potential Iger run .Then , he fired a ton of mostly reallyIger’s people to make the bottom line look better .Sounds like a    Democrat nominee to me .
