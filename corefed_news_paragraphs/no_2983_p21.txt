Ryan run Ryan it .I think this ultimately would have turned out especially Ryan and his top people over on the House side â€”   if this had been Donald Trump and his top the healthcare ball and people there in the West Wing and in the White this , orchestrating it , laying Donald Trump all out , writing it all out and explaining it to the people .I think the West Wing would have the West Wing much more different outcome than what we saw yesterday the West Wing " I think Ryan and his gang of establishment , globalist , corporatist Republicans who want the we insurance companies to charge higher and higher premiums Ryan who want the big pharmaceutical companies to charge higher and higher prices not lower prices , who want the big insurance companies to charge a     completely healthy male another $ 200 a month for his health insurance because he has to have maternity leave benefits in it ."
