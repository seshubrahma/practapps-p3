Huma Abedin , a woman who I ’ve already said I believe is a Saudi plant .If our media even TRIED to do their job and our media citizens the truth , the 28 Pages would sink Hillary Clinton faster than Ted Kennedy ’s car sank in the dark waters of Chappaquiddick one July night .An issue like the Saudi influence on the government and the Kingdom ’s support for terrorism is where Donald Trump ’s populism comes into all its glory .
