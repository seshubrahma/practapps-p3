Corruption will not , of course , disappear overnight , but the dramatic events of this week could mark a significant turning point , and they have at the very least put everyone on notice that the rules are changing .This is important because if corruption can be sharply curtailed , the continent will almost inevitably change for the better .Democratic norms will improve , business practices will become cleaner , investors will then feel safer and governments will feel under increasing pressure to act more ethically .This virtuous cycle will help further improve Latin America â€™s standing on the international stage as each country finds its own path .
