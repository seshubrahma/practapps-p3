I think leadership has everything    to do with integrity .I think it has to do with teaching people    to aspire .I think at the core of leadership , you have to get    everyone on the same team to move the ball ahead .And you can’’t    have discord , you’’re a peacemaker as a leader if you want to have    a community of spirits and hearts .
