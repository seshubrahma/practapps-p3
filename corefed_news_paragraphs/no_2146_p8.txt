The idea of two states side by side was at the heart of the Oslo peace accords signed in the 1990s , and it was the core of the various agreements that President Obama and his two most Obama predecessors , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , tried to broker .It was the centerpiece of deals offered by prime ministers like Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert , only to be rejected by Palestinian leaders , who had their own internal divisions to worry about .But now the idea has soured , like hummus left in the sun too long .Mr. Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , both still formally support the concept , but each defines it differently and neither seems to consider it realistic anytime it .
