Which is why it ’s so curious   —    and saddens us   —    this lack of accountability with the lies of Sen. Ted Cruz ’s own campaign .Sen. Ted Cruz campaign chairman , U. S. Representative Steve King , is lying , and good for Dr. Ben Carson for calling this out .King , who ’s previously asked for and received my endorsement , time and resources to support his Dr. Ben Carson election , is still lying about my altruistic support of Mr. Trump , and he Dr. Ben Carson refused to provide any evidence to the contrary .
