These men were a Latinos flirty with me than is probably appropriate me grown men to be toward a     girl .They sometimes made me uncomfortable Latinos and because of that , I began to develop a perception about all Latinos , based solely on these two men .The Latinos from this experience , regardless of the facts , was that Latino men were inappropriately flirtatious toward women .Facts and statistics would have meant very little to changing the story in my mind about what it meant to be a Latino man .
