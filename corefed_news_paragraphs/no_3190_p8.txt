President Trump ’s January 27 executive order instituting a    freeze on refugee and alien admissions from seven    countries   —    among other needed reforms like returning our refugee admissions ceiling to 50 , 000 annually from Obama ’s recent doubling of that number —    obviously did not anticipate the virulent , hysterical reaction by opponents and the feeding frenzy by the media .But nonetheless , politics and media hysteria aside , his executive order is rooted in the constitutional powers of the president and existing immigration law .Shame on the critics for their deplorable lies and obfuscations shame on the major media for agitating and abetting the misinformed hysteria and shame on the 9th Circuit for its attempted political subversion of the law .Such the 9th Circuit the world we now live in , where a fully lawful order of the president is met with organized and orchestrated chaos .
