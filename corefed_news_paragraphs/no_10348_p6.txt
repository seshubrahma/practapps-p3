Bill Kristol , son of Irving , once held considerable foreign policy influence in Washington and in the Bush administration , serving as one of the intellectual architects of   â€™s failed Iraq War .But the Weekly Standard editor and onetime Dan Quayle     overplayed his hand on this the Weekly Standard editor and onetime Dan Quayle     plot .When his attempts to get the Weekly Standard editor and onetime Dan Quayle     serious candidate failed , he decided not to the Weekly Standard editor and onetime Dan Quayle     , but rather to keep going until the threat became a punchline .Kristol may well simply be " trolling " at this point in a manner intended to put smirks on the faces of his Standard staff and the Weekly Standard editor and onetime Dan Quayle     # NeverTrump pundits who have formed an increasingly irrelevant cult on Twitter .
