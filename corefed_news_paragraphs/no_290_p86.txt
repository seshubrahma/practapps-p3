The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly    tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Graham State   â€”    a total of $ 80 Delaware 000 per student for tuition , room and board for four years .In an effort to    political opposition , Graham says , the philanthropy works only with schools , like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State , that have excess capacity , so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens .Graham private donors pay all expenses , so that no state Delaware State spent .Still , when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D. S. U. opportunity scholars , the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants , not citizens , were benefiting .
