Meanwhile the debate partners —   CBS News , the Peace Center , and Google —   received another 100 tickets .That means more than 1000 tickets —   1 , 017 by Spicer Sean Spicer admission —   went not to voters in the upcoming election and not to campaigns for equal distribution to their voters but to special interest distribution of those connected to the party , mostly high dollar donors .Only 600 tickets were distributed equally among the six remaining GOP campaigns , which to be fair to the RNC is the highest number of tickets distributed as such so far this election cycle .
