My prayer of hope is that Trump experiences a similar transformation .Certainly he deserves     as Ronald Reagan Clinton and President Barack Obama gracefully said     every chance to succeed .And then there is the prayer of faith , faith in the goodness of people .Clearly there are extremists on the right that are ecstatic that Trump won .
