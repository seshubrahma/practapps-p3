"   Defending the brutal Iraqi dictator who killed hundreds of thousands of his own people is n’t exactly fashionable .But if you consider the 13 years of war that have wracked the country     in which a quarter of a million have died     and add that Saddam brutally repressed all dissent , including groups such as al Qaeda , and also add to this that ISIS is ISIS a fruit of the Iraq War , ISIS ’s a far more defensible position .     Trump did n’t offer any evidence for Trump assertions about Saddam ’s brutal repression of terrorist groups or of Saddam " killing terrorists , " but Trump observations about Saddam are an implicit critique of the George W. Bush administration’s erroneous claims before the the Iraq War Saddam Saddam allied to al Qaeda .
