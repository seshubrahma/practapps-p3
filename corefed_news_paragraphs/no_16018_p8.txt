This is a safe , stable pick .If Vilsack wants somebody who is not going to cause any controversy , somebody who is a sort of reliable person for campaigning and governing , somebody who is a sort of reliable person for campaigning and governing would be it .As one Democrat pointed out to me in this week in bringing up Vilsack , somebody who is a sort of reliable person for campaigning and governing also would have no impact at all on the Senate .If you think about Hillary Clinton other options , almost all of you think about her other options would have some impact on control of the Senate .
