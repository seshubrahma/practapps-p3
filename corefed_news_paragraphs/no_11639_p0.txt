Tuesday at a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras , President Barack Obama said the " rhetoric among Republican elected officials and activists and media , " during the presidential campaign   was " pretty troubling and not necessarily connected to facts ."   President Barack Obama said , " When you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders , very unconventional candidates have considerable success , then obviously there ’s something there that ’s being tapped into .A suspicion of globalization , a desire to rein in its accesses , a suspicion of elites and governing institutions that people may not feel are responsive to people immediate needs , and that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity and that can be a volatile mix .
