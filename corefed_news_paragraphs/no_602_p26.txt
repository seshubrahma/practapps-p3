There is no right answer to these questions , not exactly anyway .Some annuities can be useful ( especially the simple fixed , immediate ones and similar products known as longevity insurance ) and in some other cases you may get what you pay for in peace of mind .But many other annuities may cost 3 . 5 percent annually when you add up all of the fees .For about    of that or even less in some cases , you can find a fiduciary adviser who will give you      advice on every aspect of your financial life and put you in solid ( if boring , and simple ) investments that cost a tiny fraction of what many annuities do .
