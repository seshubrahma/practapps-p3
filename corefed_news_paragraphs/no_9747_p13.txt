Is jailing    " unpresidential " for Mr. Trump to tweet out      thoughts on jailing protesters ?Maybe .But it is undoubtedly unpresidential and    and an utter desecration of the values this country    founded on for the sitting president to mark the death of Cuba â€™s murdering dictator with anything short of total condemnation .If only all the people Fidel Castro viciously murdered could have died as peacefully .
