Many media reports are quoting the Southern Poverty Law Center , a    organization , which has provided a description of the Traditionalist Workers Party .For example , Fox News writes : The Southern Poverty Law Center described TWP as a group formed in 2015 as the political wing of the Traditionalist Youth Network , which aims to " indoctrinate high school and college students into white nationalism ."It is worth noting that the SPLC does not seem to acknowledge the rising danger of the " " or "   movement , " which makes no distinction between fringe groups like the Traditionalist Workers Party and ordinary people who attend Donald Trump events .
