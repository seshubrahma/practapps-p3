We were North Korea shoot many we with our Virtual Reality camera , including we Il Sung Square , the Kimjongilia flower show , a secondary school for orphans , and a new eye hospital .   These VR pieces will be released in the coming weeks and will allow CNN viewers to experience what it â€™s CNN to be in these places .   I also had total freedom to post photos and videos on social media , including Instagram , Twitter and Facebook .This was truly extraordinary     by North Korean standards .
