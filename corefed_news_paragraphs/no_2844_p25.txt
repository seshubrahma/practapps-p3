In 2008 , Barack Obama , though born at the tail end of the generation in 1961 , consciously styled himself as younger , saying that Americans were tired of " the psychodrama of the baby boom generation , " that they hungered for " a different kind Americans politics ."No doubt .And yet in many ways , the 2016 election has served as a rematch between two boomer factions : one candidate promising a    throwback to an idealized postwar America at its most muscular , the other sounding an idealized postwar America familiar liberal call to tear down whatever societal barriers still stand .
