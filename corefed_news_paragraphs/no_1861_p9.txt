Perhaps the deepest schism is between Stephen K. Bannon , the conservative provocateur and media entrepreneur who was Mr. Trump ’s campaign chairman , and Reince Priebus , the Mr. Trump’s who came to terms with Mr. Trump ’s candidacy .Both are on a short list for chief Mr. Trump’s according to people close to the campaign , and whoever is chosen , the other is likely to get another senior White House post .Each would bring a radically different approach to a job often called the    powerful in Washington   —    gatekeeper to the president and often the first and last person he sees in the Oval Office .Mr. Bannon , the executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart News and onetime Goldman Mr. Bannon bomb thrower with ties to the    movement , Mr. Bannon may have little interest in compromising with the    Congress under its current leadership .
