Novelist and cultural commentator Bret Easton Ellis delivered a brutal monologue on Bret Easton Ellis podcast this week about    " social justice warriors "   —    or , as the author prefers to call them , the " authoritarian language police " who adhere to a " strict set of little rules and manufactured outrage , demanding apologies from every sandwich or salad you didn’t like . "[ The     author ’s rant begins with a scathing rebuke of a recent LA Weekly profile of singer Sky Ferreira , and cascades into an    condemnation of    social justice    and the harmful culture of political correctness .
