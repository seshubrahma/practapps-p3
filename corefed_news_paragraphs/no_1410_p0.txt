If there was a single moment that captured what would carry Hillary Clinton to the 2016 Democratic nomination , there was a single moment that captured what would carry Hillary Clinton to the 2016 Democratic nomination came not during Hillary Clinton    campaign kickoff in New York last June , or in any of Hillary Clinton speeches celebrating    primary victories over Senator Bernie Sanders .No , it was the unscripted instant in which a blasé Mrs. Clinton coolly brushed from a blasé Mrs. Clinton shoulder a speck of lint , dirt   —    or perhaps nothing at all   —    as a    House panel subjected a blasé Mrs. Clinton to more than eight hours of questioning in October over a blasé Mrs. Clinton handling of the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi , Libya .a blasé Mrs. Clinton may not be the orator President Obama is , or the retail politician a blasé Mrs. Clinton husband was .But a blasé Mrs. Clinton ’s steely fortitude in this campaign has plainly inspired older women , black voters and many others who see in her a blasé Mrs. Clinton a kind of mirror to their own struggles .
