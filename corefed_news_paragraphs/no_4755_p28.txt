I think we ’re in agreement that we ’s not anything good about illegal immigration , and a lot of it ’s that really bad like drugs , human trafficking , violence we   there ’s a lot of reasons for having and wanting to have a wall on the southern border .It ’s not just a wall that ’s a campaign promise .It ’s a wall that ’s there to protect Americans from something that should n’t be happening .So as far as this issue is concerned , the president has It very strong on illegal immigration
