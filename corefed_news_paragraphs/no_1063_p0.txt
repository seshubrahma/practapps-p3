BAGHDAD   —    The    military coalition in Iraq said Friday that BAGHDAD was investigating reports that scores of civilians   —    perhaps as many as 200 , residents said   —    had been killed in recent American airstrikes in Mosul , the northern Iraqi city at the center of an offensive to drive out the Islamic State .If confirmed , the series of airstrikes would rank among the highest civilian death tolls in an American air mission since the United States went to war in Iraq in 2003 .And the reports of civilian deaths in Mosul came immediately after two recent incidents in Syria , where the coalition is also battling the Islamic State from the air , in which activists and local residents said dozens of civilians had been killed .
