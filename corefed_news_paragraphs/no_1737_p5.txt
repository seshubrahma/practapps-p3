The biggest beneficiaries were Florida , which has taken in close to $ 3 . 5 million , and Pennsylvania and Ohio , which have each received more than $ 2 million .In each of those states , the funds from the national party have made a difference , erasing deficits in federal contributions against the respective Republican state parties .The money followed a legal but circuitous route turbocharged by the 2014 ruling in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission , which struck down    limits on the combined amount one person could donate to all federal candidates and parties in an election cycle .Like other candidates for federal office this year , Mrs. Clinton can accept only up to $ 5 , 400 from any one donor over the course of her campaign .
