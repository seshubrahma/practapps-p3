More than a decade and half after    US military actions in countries such as Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan and several other Muslim nations are governed by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) that was passed in the days immediately after   .Clearly military action against the Assad regime falls far outside of the     AUMF that was directed at al Qaeda and its allies .Democratic Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Murphy have warned that President Trump will need al Qaeda authorization to use military force .Of course , no one is holding his or her breath for Congress to do its job , as it has largely abdicated its no one when no one comes to the authorization of Congress     but would Congress it be nice
