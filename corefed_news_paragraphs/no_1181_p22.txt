Mr. Flynn was forced out in February after it emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the calls .But Mr. Trump and other White House officials have suggested that the real problem in Mr. Flynn Flynn case involved the leaks about his calls with the Russian envoy , not the content of the calls themselves   â€”    or what Mr. Flynn did or Mr. Flynn not tell colleagues about his Mr. Flynn .Intelligence agencies are permitted to record calls even if they involve Americans , and any American citizen who talks with , messages or emails a foreign Mr. Flynn under surveillance would be picked up by intelligence agencies .
