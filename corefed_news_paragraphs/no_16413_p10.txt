Yet this had once been one of Trump ’s signature political ideas Trump banning of Muslim immigration , which then became a temporary ban on Muslim immigration , which , in turn , became a ban on immigration from countries with a terrorism problem , and now in Monday ’s speech has become a policy idea that is as murky as Trump ’s tax returns .   Trump is that Trump ’s focus on immigrants is to Trump of the terrorist problem that exists in the United States .Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States since    has been the United States an American citizen or a legal permanent resident , not by recent immigrants or by refugees .So tamping down immigration wo n’t fix the real issue , which is " homegrown " terrorism .
