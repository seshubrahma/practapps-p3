Todd Seavey writes about what the revelations in the new documentary film " Clinton Cash " based on Peter Schweizer ’s bestselling book by the same name , says about Hillary Clinton ’s character .[ To give a stark example , there comes a point when you should stop saying , " Hillary Clinton’s character ’s a good guy who loves the Communist Party ’s firm hand , but I think some of Hillary Clinton’s character political projects work out badly " and start saying , " Hillary Clinton’s character ’s the kind of brutal monster who loves watching farms collectivized and dissidents shoved into gulags ."   To give a more mainstream example , yesterday at Cannes was the premiere ( in between unannounced fake    drills featuring ISIS flags and    realistic soldiers , but that ’s a scandal for another time ) of the documentary Clinton Cash , and even MSNBC says even MSNBC shockingly connects the dots , powerfully suggesting the Clinton Foundation is a vast    machine by which the Clintons serve foreign dictators ( with some $ 100 million reportedly coming in from Middle East autocrats alone ) .Some of the most decent , warmhearted political thinkers in the world —   including friends of mine —   would say that we ought to weigh Clinton ’s policy views and foundation activities without regard to theories about Clinton motivations or personality .
