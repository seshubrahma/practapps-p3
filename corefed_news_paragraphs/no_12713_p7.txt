Since the 1950s , do you think American culture and way of life has mostly changed for the better , or has it mostly changed for the worse ? " is a very big question , especially given that many of the poll respondents were n’t around during the Fifties and Sixties .   Younger people on the Left side of the American political spectrum are generally given a negative view of the Fifties , especially with respect to racism and stodgy , judgmental " Ozzie and Harriet " culture , while the late Sixties are seen as a mystical transformative experience .Young people on the Right are more likely to hear about the virtues of those earlier times , or to be concerned about modern trends in divorce , illegitimacy , and    career anxiety .Both the good and bad things happened , of course , but a holistic view of a   ’s worth of culture will depend on emphasis .
