That ’s where I ’ll caution Clinton and her supporters Clinton     The Clinton     foulmouthed ,    Trump supporters are America but are not irredeemable .A complex set of factors that ca n’t be fully captured by a poll leads to people ’s embrace of bigotry and homophobia and sexism .   And the truth is there are many people who make up Clinton ’s base     Clinton     other portions of the American populace     who could easily be taken in by that kind of rhetoric , given the right circumstances .
