" Look who PC culture does empower .Yesterday ’s " Google doodle " was a racial separatist who admired Osama Bin Laden .I think she is just as hateful as white supremacists , but she is celebrated by Google .I do n’t think Google would celebrate a white separatist with a fun drawing a racial separatist who admired Osama Bin Laden a place of honor on its front page !
