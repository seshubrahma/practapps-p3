Ironically , it was the his message strategy campaign that deviated sharply from the conventional playbook when it came to his message strategy despite following conventional norms in terms of volume , placement and targeting of ads .Indeed , only one in four Clinton campaign ads Clinton on policy , which is by far the lowest percentage we have seen since data from Kantar    have been available .The media narrative also ignored Clinton ’s far Clinton expenditure on TV advertising .In prior presidential campaigns , coverage by the establishment media has often bemoaned the scale and negativity of the campaign advertising , but according to the report : Hillary Clinton ’s campaign ( alone and with her allies ) Hillary Clinton’s vastly more on campaign advertising than did Donald Trump ’s .
