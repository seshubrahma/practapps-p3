On Mr. Letterman night of the second week , Mr. Colbert announced some bad news :Because of an    complaint , he could never use the original " Stephen Colbert " character , or his commentary segment " Mr. Colbert Wørd , " again .Instead , he was bringing on " Mr. Colbert Colbert , " the original character ’s " identical twin cousin Mr. Colbert " and introducing a new commentary feature , " The Werd . "" I can not reasonably argue , " Mr. Colbert deadpanned , " that I own my face or my name .
