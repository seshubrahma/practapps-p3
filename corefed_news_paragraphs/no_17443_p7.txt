The kinds of attacks that we are now seeing might be considered attacks on " soft targets , " such as holiday markets and nightclubs , that usually are not the focus of concerted security operations .   Furthermore , the terrorism is often committed by deranged individuals who have proclaimed their unity with ISIS even if their have little if any direct connection .    As a nation and as an international community we have failed to put into place an effective strategy to combat these threats .we need to rethink we security measures and develop a better way to flag individuals who might be problematic .
