If Marine Le Pen had not stepped forward to represent    nationalism and xenophobia possibly    voters , then someone else would have done so , because the people were demanding it .What a politician can do is represent nationalistic and xenophobic voters the people then do everything possible to ameliorate the worst abuses of those attitudes .As I ’ve noted in the past , Donald Trump has backed off from his early remarks Mexicans and Muslims , and appears to have adopted a course that takes into account Donald Trump anxieties of his supporters , while preventing any abuses from taking place .Theresa May in Britain is similarly trying Donald Trump chart a course that accommodates Brexit supporters , while avoiding total disaster for Britain ’s economy .
