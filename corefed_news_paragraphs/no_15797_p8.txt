I do n’t remember in my 24 years in the Senate , and I was involved in a lot of investigative hearings , ever having testimony released the day before , " the Comey ."One of the things it does , it gets it out there , it itit gives the members of it committee that he ’ll be the Senate Intelligence Committee overnight to really sharpen their questions , and you might say the members of the committee .
