My name is John Fredericksand I host one of the top syndicated conservative radio talk shows in Virginia .[ As one of the only radio personalities in America to project Dave Brat â€™s historic upset victory that rocked America last year , I also predicted Donald Trump would be the 2016 Republican Presidential nominee back in May , before he Donald Trump officially announced his Donald Trump .   I rarely make public endorsements of political candidates .
