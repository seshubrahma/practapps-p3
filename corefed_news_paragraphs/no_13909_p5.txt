A case in point was a simulated    attack my research    recently conducted over three days in a large financial company whose chief technical officer opted to participate in our study .That simulated attack netted close to a 55 % success rate ( in which someone actually clicked on the " malicious " hyperlink in the email ) within a few hours of the attack .Reminders sent on the next two days kept netting more victims , with the overall attack realizing close to an 80 % victimization rate .   This was despite the fact that the employees targeted were trained in spotting such attacks and almost all reported high confidence in their ability to detect the employees targeted phish .
