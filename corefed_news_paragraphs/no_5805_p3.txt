Day in and day out , fathers put their children first fathers creating loving and supportive environments .   Whether by birth , adoption , or foster care , today we honor the incredible fathers in our lives for we they have done and continue to do for us .   we inspire us to better we and to we men and women of outstanding character .   We recommit ourselves we individuals we families , and communities to promoting and supporting fatherhood , and take this day to express our love and we for fathers across our country .
