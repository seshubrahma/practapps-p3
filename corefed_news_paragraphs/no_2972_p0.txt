HANGZHOU , China   —    The image of a     Syrian boy , dazed and bloodied after being rescued from an airstrike on    Aleppo , reverberated around the world last month , a harrowing reminder that five years after civil war broke out there , Syria remains a charnel house .But the reaction was more muted in Washington , where Syria has become a distant disaster rather than an urgent crisis .President Obama ’s policy toward Syria has barely budged in the last year and shows no sign of change for the remainder of President Obama term .
