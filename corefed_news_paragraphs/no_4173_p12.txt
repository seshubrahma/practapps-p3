Here are two of my favorite entries : Do n’t tell me how well your models predict the past .Tell me how many climate models have ever been created , since we started doing this sort of thing , and tell me how many have now been discarded because they did n’t predict correctly .If the answer is " All of the old ones failed and we were we surprised because they were All of the old ones at hindcasting , " then why would I trust the new ones ?and , If skeptics make you retreat to Pascal ’s Wager as your main argument for aggressively responding the climate change , please understand that you lost the debate .
