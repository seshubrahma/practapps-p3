The Republicans waited way too long to speak out about Donald Trump ’s reckless and frightening vision for America   —    waited until it was too late to stop him .I wo n’t be making the same mistake tonight .Tonight will be a huge opportunity to talk about who we are as a people , and what Donald Trump’s of country we want to be .But it ’s going tonight take grassroots support to take this message to working families all across this country .
