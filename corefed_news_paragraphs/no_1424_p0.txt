ORLANDO , Fla.   â€”    A man who called 911 to proclaim allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group , and who had been investigated in the past for possible terrorist ties , stormed a gay nightclub here Sunday morning , wielding an assault rifle and a pistol , and carried out the worst mass shooting in United States history , leaving 50 people dead and 53 wounded .The attacker , identified by law enforcement officials as Omar Mateen , a     who was born in New York , turned what had been a celebratory night of dancing to salsa and merengue music at the crowded Pulse nightclub into a panicked scene of unimaginable slaughter , the floors slicked with blood , the dead and the injured piled atop one another .Terrified people poured onto the darkened streets of the surrounding neighborhood , some carried wounded victims to safety , and police vehicles were pressed into service as makeshift ambulances to rush people to hospitals .
