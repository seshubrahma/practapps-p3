Vietnam is a sadly apt analogy .Indeed , just as they did in Vietnam 50 years ago , US troops in Afghanistan are fighting a costly , intractable , and unending conflict against a relentlessly resilient asymmetric foe .   However , it ’s not a perfect analogy .The Vietnam War provoked impassioned debate back home , but Americans are hardly discussing the war in Afghanistan .
