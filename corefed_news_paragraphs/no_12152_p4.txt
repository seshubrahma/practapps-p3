President Barack Obama said : If all you ’re doing is watching Fox News , and listening to Rush Limbaugh , and reading some of the blogs that are churning out a lot of misinformation on a regular basis, then it ’s very hard for you to think that you ’re going to vote for somebody who you ’ve been told is taking the country in the wrong direction .Obama again said that Donald Trump was not qualified to be president , unlike Donald Trump vanquished election rivals Sen. John McCain and Mitt Romney ."
