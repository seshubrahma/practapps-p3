The leverage that each side has to deploy is limited   â€”    at least so long as neither country is willing to shoot itself in the foot .So , for example , in trying to get more favorable Chinese neither country of American goods and services , the standard menu of carrots Mr. Trump has to offer for compliance is relatively modest .China wants things like United States membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank that it started , and support for its " One Belt , One Road " program to build China transportation infrastructure stretching from Southeast China to Europe .Bigger Chinese goals , like achieving " market economy " status in the World Trade Organization , are likely to be nonstarters unless the country makes major progress on allowing international companies better access to its market .
