The    scenario would be the    withdrawal of insurers from markets and the inversion of risk pyramids , with sicker and sicker patients seeking coverage while they can .Without available insurers or a public option , people without employer coverage or who make too much to qualify for Medicaid might just not have any insurance to buy .If Congress and state governments do n’t actively enforce " rate review " and    ratio rules that give states oversight over large premium increases and mandate that insurance plans spend a certain percentage of premiums on healthcare , insurers could enter markets that do n’t have plans and raise premiums for vulnerable people who need insurance most .Alternatively ,    insurers —   which already profit on the mandate despite providing barebones services that do n’t qualify as full plans —   could continue to fill in the gaps .
