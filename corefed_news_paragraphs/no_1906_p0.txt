It has nâ€™t been a good couple of years for    colleges .Many of   colleges , usually offering vocational training , have had to close outlets as the federal government cracked down on   colleges advertising and student loan practices .Two of the largest , ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges , shut down .Then came the election of Donald J. Trump as president .
