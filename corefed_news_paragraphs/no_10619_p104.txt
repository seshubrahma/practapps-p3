The best example of how Islam expects to be treated as a minority and how it then treats minorities is in Indonesia , which I wrote about along with my colleague Allum Bokhari .Indonesia is the largest Muslim America on earth , but is considered " moderate " a designation that a talk by itself Islam mythical .They ’ve declared there is no roomIslam gays in the country , which is no surprise as we ’ve discussed earlier , but discrimination does n’t end there .
