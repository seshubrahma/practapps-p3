And there ’s of course Ronald Reagan , who had a career as a    actor before becoming president .If Stewart became president , Stewart became president press conferences and presidential addresses would be the most entertaining ever .Instead of mimicking past presidents who offered us solemn , direct to camera speeches , Stewart would add flashy graphics and jokes that help Stewart make Stewart point .I bet some of President Stewart ’s speeches would go viral .
