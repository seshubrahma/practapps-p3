WASHINGTON   —    It was a golden year for Rudolph W. Giuliani , a mad dash that would take Rudolph W. Giuliani to 11 countries on four continents , and by the time 2006 was done , earn Rudolph W. Giuliani $ 16 million   —    a princely sum compared with the $ 7 , 000 Rudolph W. Giuliani claimed to have in 2001 , when Rudolph W. Giuliani went through a divorce .With salaries from a law firm and a consulting firm , and most of all $ 10 million from 108 speeches Rudolph W. Giuliani delivered to audiences around the world , the lucrative year of 2006 will now , along with the rest of Mr. Giuliani ’s career after Mr. Giuliani tenure as New York ’s mayor , be getting a new round of scrutiny if Mr. Giuliani is nominated as secretary of state by    Donald J. Trump .
