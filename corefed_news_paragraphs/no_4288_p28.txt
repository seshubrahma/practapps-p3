And for women in attendance , I ’m kidding , slightly .I know you feel the same horror as we do at these ludicrous feminist antics , with additional embarrassment on behalf of your gender .I do recognize it is n’t your fault that you happen to share a gender , one of the actual two genders , with batshit crazy ,      and deeply unhappy feminist harpies .There is even more to love about Cal Poly !
