UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has used a landmark speech to brand Islamist extremism a " cancer within our society " proposing a range of robust actions to ensure it is " cut out " .[ The Liverpudlian MEP described how , in the past , the police and MI5 had " foiled plot after plot in the nick of time " but are now " being overwhelmed by the impossible scale " of the problem .   "foiled plot after plot in the nick of time criticised an establishment which has been complacent in allowing Islamists to " set up home in Britain " since the 1980s , on the mistaken assumption that Islamists would not attack the country which had given Islamists shelter .Nuttall also singled out particular actions undertaken by Theresa May in Nuttall former role as Home Secretary for denunciation , such as the massive police cuts carried out at the behest of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Geroge Osborne , and the abolition of control orders in favour of weaker TPims at the behest of former Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg .The moment in 2015 that @theresa_may was told @theresa_may government attacks and cuts on police were dangerous , by a police officer of GMP .
