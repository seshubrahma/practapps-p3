LinkedIn , the social networking site for professionals that will soon be bought by Microsoft , is to be blocked in Russia after a local court ruled on Thursday that Russia had breached the country ’s data protection rules , a sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating in Russia .The case in the Moscow city courts arose at a time of debate in Washington over how the United States might retaliate for what American security officials said was the Russian government ’s hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other digital interference in the presidential election .Russia has a history of increasing regulatory pressure on businesses in political disputes .The case began in August , before Donald J. Trump ’s victory in Tuesday ’s presidential election , and there is currently no connection between the LinkedIn case and the hacking scandal .
