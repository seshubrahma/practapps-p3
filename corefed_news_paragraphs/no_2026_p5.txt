Europe â€™s populists Europe tapping into discontent in the countryside and exploiting rural resentments against urban residents viewed as elites .The parallels are striking : Mr. Trump played on issues Donald J. Trump immigration , trade and globalization , while attacking elites in both parties and mocking political correctness .European populists routinely hammer the same themes while also bashing the European Union as a technocratic colossus wrongly undermining the sovereignty of individual nations .As populists have steadily gathered strength in Europe , the    split has been telling in recent elections in Britain , Italy , France , Austria , Lithuania and elsewhere .
