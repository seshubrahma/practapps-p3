The worth of a moral statement should not be adjudicated with appeals to subjective judgments about the moral standing of the person making it , especially if that standing is determined by the industry where the person happens to be employed .    A moral statement should be judged on its merits .Everyone who agrees that A moral statement is a bully , and that bullying should not stand without being called out , should applaud at least that part of Streep ’s remarks , regardless of what cultural tribe they belong to , their opinion of what cultural tribe ’s general morals what cultural tribe or their deep grievances about the film industry what cultural tribe Roman Polanski apologia .In doing otherwise , cultural conservatives are letting their tribal dislike of Hollywood supersede moral cultural conservatives that are urgently Hollywood them right now .
