The    fund that invests in these and similar countries and is the market ’s truest gauge of sentiment toward developing markets is off more than 7 percent since Mr. Trump was elected .It is worth recalling that the    taper tantrum in 2013 , when panicky global investors escaped en masse from most of the major developing economies , was driven by an expectation of higher interest rates and a strong dollar   —    which is exactly what the markets are factoring in right now .A    inflationary surge could also force the Federal Reserve to be overly aggressive in raising rates , a dynamic that no investor wants to see .The trick , of course , for a Trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand and , in addition to pushing for a building boom , cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures .
