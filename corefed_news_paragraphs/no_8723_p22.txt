Why do n’t we win the war with airpower ?we was himself a firm believer in Roosevelt war Roosevelt was a personal friend of Gen. Roosevelt Arnold , the future commander of the US Army Air Force ( the predecessor , of course , to the USAF ) and yet even so , Roosevelt ’s ambition took his breath away .   After all Roosevelt’s in 1939 , we were building only about 3 , 000 military aircraft a year .   Could we really expect to get to 50 we 000 ?
