Karl Marx wrote with approval about suppression of speech during the    radical socialist Paris Commune in 1871 .When Marxist revolution did not sweep the world after Moscow fell in 1917 , socialist theorists trying to figure out why came together in the ( in ) famous Frankfurt School , housed at the Institute for Social Research ( ISR ) .The explicitly Marxist Frankfurt School produced Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin in the 1920s , arguably the forefathers of Deconstructionism premised on the idea that " truth is the death of intention ."
