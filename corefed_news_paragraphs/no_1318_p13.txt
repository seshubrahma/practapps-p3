Consulting firms like McKinsey have long hired bright young M. B. A.s in part by giving them Consulting firms like McKinsey case study of a business challenge and asking them Consulting firms like McKinsey series of questions about how they Consulting firms like McKinsey approach the problem .If tests and simulations are the way to go in picking an employee , what does that mean for picking a president ?Perhaps the ideal scenario would be to put Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders through a simulation in which they Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders jump between persuading a member of Congress to vote for a highway bill and conducting an arms control negotiation .That wo nâ€™t happen anytime soon .
