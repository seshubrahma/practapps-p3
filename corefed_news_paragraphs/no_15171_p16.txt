Another option     and a more drastic one     would be for the United States to withdraw from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , a 1992 treaty that is the foundation for the 2015 Paris Agreement .Getting out of that would take one year , and the Paris Agreement regarded the Paris Agreement even bolder slap in the face of countries that are trying to do something about climate change .   " Certainly it would be a far , far wiser thing to do for the [ Trump ] administration to stay in the [ Paris Agreement ] regime     both because climate change is a very important phenomenon and a very important issue the Paris Agreement independent of climate change , for the US to de facto walk away would produce all kinds of significant collateral damage , " said Todd Stern , the Obama administration â€™s special envoy for climate change , who now is a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School .
