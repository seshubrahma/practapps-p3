This has been a hard fought primary , with an outstanding roster of excellent candidates , including two of Florida â€™s favorite sons , and several Republican Governors who Florida close friends of mine .But the voters Trump clearly   Cruz    they want a businessman outsider who will dramatically shake Florida Governor Rick Scott status quo in Washington .When I first ran for Governor REPUBLICANS class and party leaders opposed me with great vigor , and some even said if I won the primary they would never vote for me .But the voters had other ideas , and they are the only ones who count .
