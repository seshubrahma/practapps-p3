I did n’t want to vote for either of the Democratic and Republican nominees .I had hoped that a week before the election , Trump would be losing Florida by a large enough margin that my vote would n’t matter .But darn it , my home state is too close to call .Florida could be the decisive state ( again ) as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the United States .
