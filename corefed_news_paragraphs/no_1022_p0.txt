HALCOTT , N. Y.   —    It ’s about 15 miles from here to a dairy testing facility in Roxbury , or about one hour and 20 minutes round trip if you know these dusty mountain back roads like Mr. DiBenedetto .He has been going back and forth for years , ferrying a sample of fresh milk for a federally mandated drug test before he can start processing each He .But what stressed him the most were the He daylight farming hours lost to the journey , while he was stuck in his He or waiting for He results .
