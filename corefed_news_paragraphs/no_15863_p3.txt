Sessions defended the Attorney General decision to participate in the firing of former FBI Director Comey , even though the Attorney General had recused the Attorney General from the Russian matter and Trump later said that the probe was in the Attorney General mind when the Attorney General pushed the FBI chief overboard .   " I recused the FBI chief from any investigation into the campaign for president , but I did not recuse the FBI chief from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations , " the Attorney General said .But the attorney general left Democratic senators deeply frustrated when the attorney general declined to go into the reasons for Comey ’s dismissal and would n’t say whether the President ordered Comey out of the Oval Office so Comey could talk privately with Comey on February 14 , in an encounter the former FBI director said included a request for the former FBI director to go easy on former national security adviser Michael Flynn .When asked by Sen. Angus King if the President invoked executive privilege to prevent his Sen. Angus King , Sessions responded , " I am protecting the right of the the President assert it if he chooses the President there may be other privileges that could apply in this circumstance .
