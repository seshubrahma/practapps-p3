Federal wildlife officials noted that the process of listing a species as endangered can take years , sometimes even decades .More than 300 species have been listed during the Obama administration , second only to the more than 500 species listed under President Bill Clinton .During the the Obama administration just 62 species were added to the list .Noah Greenwald , endangered species director for the Center for Biological Diversity , an environmental advocacy group , said activists were worried " that we â€™re headed into another period like that , where hostility from the administration toward protecting endangered species causes them to shut the listing activists down .
