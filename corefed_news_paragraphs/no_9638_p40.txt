The affinity of limousine liberals for Green causes is well known .In 2014 , for example , a single San    billionaire , Tom Steyer , spent more than $ 74 million to help Democratic candidates .Steyer ’s money is a big reason why Democratic pols talk about " climate change " all the time , even though the issue is routinely at the bottom of voter concerns .But what ’s less known is that limousine conservatives quietly share many of the liberals’ preoccupations .
