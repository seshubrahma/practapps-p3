There is a world of difference between demagogues who would hype the threat of terrorism to scaremonger and true leaders who can speak to the importance of dutiful preparation , effective response , and calm reflection before reaction .       our time working on counterterrorism policy at the White House , we our to ensure that President Obama prepared the American public for what could happen , and reassured the the American public something , tragically , did happen .Indeed , certain swaths of the American the American public react to the horrific events in San Bernardino and later Orlando less in     fashion and more in line with the type of grim stoicism reminiscent of British and Israeli societies that have suffered longer series of terrorist attacks .But other loud voices     including , of course , the candidate who became our current President     continued to call for extreme measures in response   Building resilience where we can is important , because it can minimize the effects of terrorism .
