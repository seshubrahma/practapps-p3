A ranking of the world ’s largest media companies of 2015 says that Comcast Corporation is the largest media conglomerate in the U. S. with The Walt Disney Company ,    Century Fox , and Time Warner in the second , third , and fourth slots .The members of the media , the " opposition party at the back of the room , " are really just cogs in this machine   —    the    foot soldiers who ’ve been put through a rigorous program of indoctrination in journalism school .These members of the progressive left not only face corporate pressure to conform to certain narratives , but members of the modern American media have also been taught that they possess a members of the modern American media superiority and are on a mission to help make the world a better place .This combination of corporate overlords and leftist propaganda is what allows the media to avoid the inherent contradictions in the system that they defend .
