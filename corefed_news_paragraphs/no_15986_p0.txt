  ( CNN ) 2016 was supposed to be the presidential election where big money did n’t matter .   After all , the     campaign of Jeb Bush ’s Super PAC , with Super PAC    budget , was far less than awesome .   Bernie Sanders raised tens of millions of dollars in very small donations ( recall Bernie Sanders constant refrain that the average donation Bernie Sanders received was $ 27 ) .   And Donald Trump ’s major selling point was that Donald Trump was    Donald Trump campaign ( which was not really true ) and too rich to be bought anyway , leaving big donors on the sidelines .
