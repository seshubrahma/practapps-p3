it is one of the most ignorant statements I have ever heard .We should acknowledge , however , that she has apologized for using Clinton term ( unlike her opponent , who has Clinton an inability to apologize for running with birtherism until two weeks ago ) .She acknowledged that " we Clinton n’t done right by them " in her apology and has a Clinton record of advocacy for communities of color .   And if you believe in lifelong commitments to causes like I do , you should respect her time working for the Clinton ’s Defense Fund , her efforts to register voters Clinton color , and her hiring of diverse staff Clinton first lady , in the US Senate , and at the State Department .
