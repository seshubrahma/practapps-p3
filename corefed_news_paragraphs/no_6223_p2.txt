D. O. 219 also stipulated that the " Assistant Director , Migratory Birds , in consultation with National Flyway Councils and individual states ,    â€¦     establish a process to phase in a requirement for the use of nontoxic ammunition for recreational hunting of mourning doves and other upland game birds ."This indicated a staggered implementation where the use of traditional ammunition for dove and upland bird hunting would be heavily restricted and eventually eliminated altogether .But Zinke overturned this ban with Secretarial Order 3346 .
