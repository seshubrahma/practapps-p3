While Americans are applauding President Trump ’s    turn from the immigration and border security policies of the Obama years , President Trump should take time to correct a grievous     mistake from the Bush dynasty as well .[ I am speaking about the Justice Department ’s prosecution   —    and I would add , persecution   —    of two Border Patrol agents , Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos .The case is a good lesson in how the vast powers of the federal government can be deployed for narrow political purposes , not the ends of justice .
