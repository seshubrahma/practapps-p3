forgive me , trumpeting , and saying this is why I ’m angry , because the country ’s being misrun , but the anger in Rubio is less that , the anger in Rubio ’s a sense that we could be doing this , we are n’t , and we can do this , if we realize the values that we have and see the world clearly .Rubio ’s done that in every debate , and I don’t think Rubio stumbled once on this ."
