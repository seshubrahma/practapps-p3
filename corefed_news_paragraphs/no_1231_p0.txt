When Mr. Kushner , sought the    security clearance that would give him access to some of the nation ’s most Mr. Kushner guarded secrets , he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign Mr. Kushner officials over the last seven years .But Mr. Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months .They include a December meeting with the Russian ambassador , Sergey I. Kislyak , and one with the head of a Russian    bank , Vnesheconombank , arranged at Mr. Kislyak ’s behest .The omissions , which Mr. Kushner ’s lawyer called an error , are particularly sensitive given the congressional and F. B. I. investigations into contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates .
