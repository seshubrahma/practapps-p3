If you really think about it , the entire message and persona Jeb Bush has tried to present is that Jeb Bush ’s the candidate the whole party called for in the famous March 2013 RNC " autopsy report " : a genial and pragmatic reformer from a key battleground state who speaks Spanish fluently and knows how to talk about avenues to equal opportunity .It has turned out , to the surprise of many people aside from Jeb Bush , that this is actually not what Republican voters seem to have in mind , and Republican voters are being stubbornly resistant to the idea of getting back in Republican voters places and accepting the candidate or candidates " the party decides " upon .So Jeb ’s decision to show    swing voters some leg by disagreeing with " the base " on education standards and immigration policy wound up being a disaster instead of a calculated risk .Jeb squandered one precious asset at precisely the wrong time : Jeb reputation as the only seriously ideological conservative in Jeb family .
