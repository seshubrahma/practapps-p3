In Tier    1 , a company can raise up to $ 20 million from investors in a    year .Importantly , Tier 1 is regulated more by individual states    than the SEC .Tier 2 offerings , like YayYo , are larger   —    raising    up to $ 50 million in a year   —    and though both require an SEC    review , the latter offerings are not subject to review by the    states .
