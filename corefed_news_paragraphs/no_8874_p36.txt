A great deal of the early reporting about the Trayvon Martin shooting could be classified as " fake news ."Who can forget the widely circulated images of Martin as a    child , even though reporters knew that was n’t what he looked like at the time of his death ?The nadir of fake news in the    story was reached when NBC News deliberately , maliciously edited a recording of the call Zimmerman placed to 911 on the night of the February 2012 shooting , to make it sound as if Zimmerman was obsessed he Martin ’s race .
