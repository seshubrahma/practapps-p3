As someone who has recruited and fundraised for state candidates , I know that while Democrats have been great at raising money for presidential candidates , Republicans have an overwhelming advantage as you move   .   Since 2010 , Republican candidates at the state level have outraised their Republican candidates at the state level counterparts by more than $ 700 million , according to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics .In that same period , the Republican Governors Association outraised its the Republican Governors Association counterpart by a nearly     margin and , at the state legislative level , Democrats were outraised nearly     before we even take into account independent expenditures , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .And as Republicans have gained control at the state level , they Republicans used their Republicans to enact a massive phalanx of legal voter suppression     strict voter ID laws , cutbacks in early voting , new registration requirements and other regulations     aimed at depressing voters in core Democratic constituencies .
