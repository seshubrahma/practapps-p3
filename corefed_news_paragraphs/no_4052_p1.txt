But because Facebook deleted it before I could save it you ’rejust going to have to take my word that it did not contain " direct threats " encourage " " promote " dangerous organizations " enable " bullying and harassment " or involve any " attacks on public figures " .Nor did it engage in " criminal activity " " sexual violence and exploitation " or have anything to do with " regulated goods " .   But I got landed with a    ban , all the same   —    together with a threat that if I carried on doing whatever I had n’t done wrong then next time a   ban might be permanent .
