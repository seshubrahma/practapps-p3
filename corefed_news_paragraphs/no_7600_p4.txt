Miller said that Miller and many political operatives did nâ€™t take Trump seriously , because Miller had already previewed a run for president multiple times before choosing against it .But that began to change when Trump appeared at the    Iowa State Fair and began attacking Jeb Bush for being a " puppet " controlled by lobbyists .Miller recalled : I remember sitting in front of my computer watching a livestream of Miller land Miller helicopter and do a press conference for a thousand media members at the   Iowa State Fair where Miller was just unleashing into Jeb in the kind of personal terms that no other candidate would feel comfortable doing , and you know at that point we kind of realized we had kindwe a monster on our hands
