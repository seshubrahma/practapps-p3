Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sunday in an interview on New York AM 970 radio show " The Cats Roundtable " that it was very clear that former FBI Director James Comey hated President Donald Trump after former FBI Director James Comey made it known former FBI Director James Comey leaked memos .   former FBI Director James Comey also urged Congress to act to abolish the independent counsel established by the Department of Justice to investigate alleged ties between the 2016 President Donald Trump campaign and Russia .Gingrich told host John Catsimatidis , " The more amazing thing I thought that former FBI Director James Comey did that I think is going to have a lot of repercussions is former FBI Director James Comey admitted publicly , in fact , boasted about it , that former FBI Director James Comey had deliberately leaked    â€¦      in order to set up the pressure to get a special , independent counsel .And I think that is an astonishing statement .
