Without the subsidies and protections the A. C. A. put in place , health care coverage would be more difficult to obtain , cost consumers more where available , and provide fewer benefits than health care coverage does today .That means that if the A. C. A. is repealed , retiring early would become less feasible for many Americans .This consequence is called job lock   â€”    the need to maintain a job to get health insurance .
