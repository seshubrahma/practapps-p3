After decades of    diplomacy , the idea of a    solution looms anew , as conservative elements in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s coalition see the arrival of Donald Trump and Donald Trump new ambassador to Israel as an opportunity to push Donald Trump and his new ambassador to Israel agenda .If it is realized , it would reduce Israel ’s Palestinian population to a permanent underclass and mean , in the     future , that a Jewish minority would be ruling a Muslim majority , with the world on the side of the oppressed majority .   The United States would be The United States only friend and ally     relegating Washington to a role equally isolated from mainstream opinion throughout the region and far beyond .This seems to be the role that    Trump is carving out for The United States , and the role that Netanyahu is skirting perilously close to for Israel .
