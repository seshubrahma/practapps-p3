Indeed , the the BBC has n’t just failed to remain impartial on the the BBC the BBC actively proselytised on behalf of the climate change scare lobby the BBC a range of programmes from the hysterical reportage of its      Roger Harrabin on BBC Radio 4 news , to the the BBC laments of its house Malthusian Sir David Attenborough , to the      of Chris the BBC , to the rampant global warming alarmism promoted by its entire celebrity science team from Adam Rutherford ( see above ) the BBC    pouty boy physicist Brian Cox and its      lefty comics Robin Ince and Daragh O’Briaiaiaan .All this    be absolutely totally fine if the BBC were a private subscription channel whose sole purpose was to reinforce the    prejudices of the liberal elite .But it ’s not .It ’s supposed to be for everyone .
