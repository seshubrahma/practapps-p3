The first half is trivially true : climate has indeed been changing for the 4 . 5 billion years of the planet ’s existence .But the notion that recent climate change is catastrophic , unprecedented and significantly    is a shaky theory , not a proven fact .And in any case it is beside the point .Even supposing that climate change is all those things , climate change does n’t alter the fact that Paris is a pointless waste of money , especially for countries like the U. S. which are expected to bear the burden of the cost .
