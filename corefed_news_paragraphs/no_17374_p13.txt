I ’m not saying any of this was intentional .Given Hollywood production schedules , " Rogue One " was probably in    for a year before it finally went into production in August of last year .That was two months after Donald Trump announced he   was Donald Trump for President , which , at the time , many people took as some sort of cosmic joke .So it ’s highly unlikely the filmmakers were thinking of Trump when they Donald Trump " the filmmakers One .
