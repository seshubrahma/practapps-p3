Tony Lee :Cole Denver great points about players under the radar who step Dan Leberfeld in Super Bowls .If people had to pick a player on the Tony Lee I ’d choose linebacker Shaq Thompson .He ’s the Panthers ’s version of Arizona ’s Deone Buccannon ( played safety in college and plays linebacker int he pros ) .
