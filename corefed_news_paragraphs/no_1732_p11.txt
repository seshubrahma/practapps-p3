In fairness , it is worth pointing out that only 11 C. E. O.s of the Fortune 100 donated to Hillary Clinton , according to The Journal .Mr. Trump does have support from some businessmen like Jack Welch , Carl C. Icahn and Wilbur Ross , among others .But for a group that has historically leaned Republican , the absence of contributions is    particularly since at least 19 of them gave to the other Republican candidates in the primaries .There is particularly good reason , wholly unrelated to political correctness , that the business community has not rallied around Mr. Trump â€™s economic plans .
