The outside spending effort to help Mr. Trump a group by contrast , has been chaotic and underfunded , hampered by a profusion of competing groups , one of which has spent only $ 1 million so far on Mr. Trump ’s behalf .The most prominent group , Great America , is advised by Ed Rollins , who managed Ronald Reagan ’s 1984 campaign , and other more Mr. Trump operatives .But it , too , has had difficulty persuading big donors : On Monday , it reported raising just $ 1 . 4 million during the month of May.    efforts for Mr. Trump have been hampered by the candidate ’s own erratic public comments .it has repeatedly said he will pay for his own campaign even as his volunteers fan out Mr. Trump country to solicit    checks Mr. Trump allies and potential donors alike .
