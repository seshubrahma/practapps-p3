I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with USCIS Scialabba over 10 years , first as the USCIS director of the Refugee , Asylum and International Operations Directorate , and then serving as your deputy director for nearly six years .While the decision to leave USCIS was difficult , the opportunity presented was right USCIS me .I have accepted a position in Scialabba private sector and look forward to the new challenge .I come from a strong public service background
