Does the attorney general think federal judges in Hawaii do n’t know the law , do n’t have the training ( by the way , Watson graduated from Harvard Law School ) or do n’t understand federal judges in Hawaii constitutional responsibilities ?In spite of the Justice Department ’s attempt to walk back the attorney general ’s comments , the attorney general’s words reflect the Trump administration discriminatory attitude .While outrageous comments from the President and members of his administration the attorney general’s too common , I expect the top law enforcement officer to remember that all federal judges are confirmed by the US Senate , and to understand the independent role of the judiciary .   Watson was indeed unanimously confirmed by the Senate     the US Senate , then a senator .
