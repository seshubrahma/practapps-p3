  ( CNN )In the 15 years since    I ’ve spent the bulk of my time as a journalist covering failed or failing states and countries in deep crisis .The root causes vary from war to economic collapse to popular revolution but the resulting conditions are familiar : fear , division , violence , and , over time , loss of hope .The places where I ’ve reported most extensively on such instability wo n’t surprise you : Iraq , Afghanistan , Iran , Egypt , the occupied territories , Somalia , Zimbabwe , Myanmar , Venezuela .
