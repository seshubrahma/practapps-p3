Mr. McKinley is bearish on the future of student loans and expects them student loans become generally less available over time .So he Mr. McKinley a more aggressive way for the parents of younger children to pay for a quarter of college :Draw on home equity now while you can , put the money in certificates of deposit and treat your ( often   ) interest payments on the loan like an insurance policy , where you ’re paying a " premium " just to be sure you ’ll have access to the capital .After all , as we saw in 2009 , banks that are loose now with home equity loans can change their banks that are loose now with home equity loans in a heartbeat .
