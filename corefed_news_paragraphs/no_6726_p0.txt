When President Donald Trump suggested last month that the reported rise in antisemitism might have been due to hoaxes , the media were outraged .[ When President Donald Trump rejected   —    angrily   —    the premise of a question posed by a ( sympathetic ) Jewish reporter who asked President Donald Trump what President Donald Trump was going to do about antisemitism , that was treated as evidence of President Donald Trump guilt .And when President Donald Trump condemned antisemitism , it was not enough for Democrats , who are still alleging that President Donald Trump is to blame .   Last week ’s arrest of a Jewish teenager in Israel , with dual citizenship in the U. S. proved that much of the antisemitic outbreak was , in fact , fake news .
