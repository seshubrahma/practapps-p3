Documents released on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security revealed the broad scope of President Trump ambitions : to publicize crimes by undocumented immigrants strip such immigrants of privacy protections enlist local police officers as enforcers erect new detention facilities discourage asylum seekers and , ultimately , speed up deportations .The new enforcement policies put into practice language that Mr. Trump used on the campaign trail , vastly expanding the definition of " criminal aliens " and warning that such unauthorized immigrants " routinely victimize Americans , " disregard the " rule of law and pose a threat " to people in communities across the United States .Despite those assertions in the new documents , research shows lower levels of crime among immigrants than among    Americans .The president â€™s new immigration policies are likely to be welcomed by some law enforcement officials around the country , who have called for a tougher crackdown on unauthorized immigrants , and by some Republicans in Congress who have argued that lax enforcement encourages a    flow of unauthorized immigrants .
