Bush did n’t George W. Bush a major scandal until Valerie Plame was outed as a C. I. A. officer that summer . )Another example came during the summer of 2009 , when the death of Michael Jackson helped push the furor over the affair of the South Carolina governor , Mark Sanford , out of the news .By contrast , relatively slow news periods may increase the likelihood of a scandal ’s developing , as with the travel habits of former White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu in 1991 , which became an issue in the months after the end of the first Persian Gulf war , and as with Chris Christie ’s Bridgegate scandal in 2014 .In an article published in The British Journal of Political Science , I provide quantitative evidence suggesting that competition from other news stories can prevent potential scandals from reaching critical mass .
