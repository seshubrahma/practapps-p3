" "    The Department of Justice â€™s Office of Legal Counsel , which serves    as an interpreter of federal law as it applies to the president ,    decided in federal law that the antinepotism statute covered the White    House in the same way as it did federal agencies , thereby    preventing former the White   House Richard Nixon from appointing a    relative to his White House staff ."       However former President Richard Nixon the day after Trump was sworn in , the OLC changed its    decision to exclude White House staff from the OLC statute , saying in White House   that the president " enjoys an unusual degree of    freedom " when selecting his staff , " which Congress found suitable    to the demands of his office ."
