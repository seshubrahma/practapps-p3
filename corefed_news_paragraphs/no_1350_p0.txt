President Barack Obama was talking to me about the problem of political capital .President Barack Obama efforts to rebuild the U. S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis were being hit from left , right and center .And yet , by President Barack Obama own assessment , His efforts to rebuild the U. S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis were vastly underappreciated .
