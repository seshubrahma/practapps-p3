feminism is entirely rooted in lies , distortion , and hysteria .Feminist arguments are absolutely no different .The underpinning of legal abortion in the United States is the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade .Many argue that the entire case is shoddy law , but I am the United States and unlike pundits on both sides of the debate , I wo nâ€™t argue a the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade for your entertainment .
