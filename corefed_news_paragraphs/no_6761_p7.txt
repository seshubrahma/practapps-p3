There is no equivalence whatsoever .The Tea Party showed up at town halls to be heard the " Resistance " is showing up to stop people from being heard .Moreover , they are doing so against The Tea Party background of lies by the Democratic Party , which is sowing fear with defamatory    campaigns warning supporters about a " white supremacist " presence in the White House , complete with the sort of " targeting " imagery the media belatedly complained about after the Tucson mass shooting in 2011 .   There is a path back to political relevance , and perhaps political power , for the left .
