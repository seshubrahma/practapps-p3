Opponents of Trump â€™s plans , though , told the New York Times that the difference between The New York Times and the current Obama is that Trump uses a " broader definition " when referring to criminal illegal Trump .The Obama administration was careful to say that only Obama who had very serious charges or were recent arrivals were priorities for enforcement , but now , everyone is a priority , Mr. Capps said .Under Obama , nearly 90 percent of the illegal Obama deported by ICE were convicted criminals .Trump , on the other hand , takes into consideration illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes , misdemeanors and those who have simply crossed the border .
