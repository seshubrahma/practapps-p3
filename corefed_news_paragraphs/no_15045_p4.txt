When you are President and an international crisis lands in your inbox , there are generally no easy options , just a menu of unappetizing    options to choose from .Already Trump and his Trump security team are considering some kind of military option .But they Trump and his national security team have to move forward without either a UN resolution or congressional authorization     and whatever action the United States takes will suck it the United States into the morass of the Syrian civil war and even possibly into some kind of confrontation with the Russians , Assad â€™s staunchest backers .   On the campaign trail , candidate Trump occasionally raised the idea of creating " safe zones " for Syrian civilians .
