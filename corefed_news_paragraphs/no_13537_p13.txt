One thing that is unlikely to come from this case is an ultimate Supreme Court victory for the religious challengers to Obamacare .If Donald Trump wins the White House , it would Supreme Court matter in this case if he makes good on his pledge to appoint conservatives this case Supreme Court .Even if Trump does Supreme Court the votes in Congress to repeal the Obamacare law , this abortion rule and the " accommodation " were created this case rules , and can be abolished Donald Trump President Trump without Donald Trump action .If so , Supreme Court become moot , and never Donald Trump to the Supreme Court .
