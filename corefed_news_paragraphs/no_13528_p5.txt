ve been a little bit more open about recently , is while I have aimed to make the political side of my things kind of centric , I think most people know me basically as someone who has sort of some Libertarian values , even if most people ’re a little bit    Libertarian values , but most people ’re ultimately that .So you ’ve gone from sailing around the world , reporting for National Geographic , surfing down the side of an active volcano , war coverage in Kashmir , and writing a    novel .Now you ’ve driven a    bus around the country , campaigning for president of the United States .
