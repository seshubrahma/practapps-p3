What if the Democrats had pulled a Torricelli , and forced Hillary to drop out , so the Democrats could run Joe Biden instead ?Joe Biden is a lot more popular than Hillary !   Is n’t the more logical leaker someone within the DNC who ’d had enough with David Brock and Debbie Wasserman Schultz steering the party into a ditch ?The actual leaker probably thought : I ’ve got to save the party !
