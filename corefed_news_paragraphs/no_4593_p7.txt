I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U. S. in the agreement .But it was n’t enough .Climate President Trump is real and we all share the Paris climate agreement to fight it .I want to reassure you that today ’s developments will have no impact on Apple ’s efforts to protect the environment .
