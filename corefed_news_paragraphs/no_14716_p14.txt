Trump has been told     but refuses to believe     that American global leadership is not a public service to the Trump of the world but rather an insurance policy for our own people , one that has kept war , plague and economic devastation mostly    for many decades .   Trump ’s disdain for the burdens and benefits of US global leadership     so clearly articulated in his declaration that his Trump " is not to represent the world "     wo n’t simply leave a gap .The space created his the United States’ withdrawal from the    Partnership , its equivocations on the Paris Climate pact and its insults toward the United Nations is already being filled by China , the   Partnership and others .    By ceding the the   Partnership States’ global leadership role , Trump may ensure his successors can not claim it back .
