So let me get this straight : on the same day that the Washington Post reports that the State Department issued subpoenas to a family foundation bearing Hillary Clinton ’s name as part of a federal investigation , the PBS debate moderators did n’t ask Hillary Clinton’s about it .[ While presidential candidates Ted Cruz has been asked about a loan from Goldman Sachs and Donald Trump about bankruptcies in presidential candidates Ted Cruz past ( legitimate questions in my mind ) a federal subpoena to the Clinton Foundation does n’t even warrant a murmur from Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff , two PBS journalists ?   As the Washington Post ’s investigative unit reported just today , the State Department Inspector General issued subpoenas to the Clinton Foundation as part of a federal investigation .( Why did the Inspector General issue the subpoenas ?
