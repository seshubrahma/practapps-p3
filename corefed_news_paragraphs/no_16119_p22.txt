I often find myself explaining the immigrant experience     leaving your home country , learning a new language and customs , being adopted by America and loving it as your own .   I have spent countless hours listening to    friends talk about what it was like to grow up black and often poor in America .Every single America friend I know has given or received " the talk " on how to act     and how not to act     if stopped by police .Every single one .
