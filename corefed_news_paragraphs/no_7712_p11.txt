I would prefer any of the Republicans to Hillary Clinton .Hillary Clinton is too tainted by acts of questionable integrity , too beholden to powerful business interests that are bilking ordinary Americans , and fighting battles long ago won —   young women now receive 60 percent of college degrees , often earn more than young men , and increasingly are assuming positions of leadership throughout society .Bernie is straightforward and honest .Bernie learned about the dreams of ordinary people the same place I did —   playing stickball on the streets of New York .
