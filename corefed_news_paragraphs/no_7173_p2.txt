So we need to be on offense and defense .And need to look at 2018 ultimately where President Trump could get up to 60   â€”   61 Senate seats , you have the Democrats defending 25 seats , 10 of which are held by Democratic senators in state president President Trump just won and a handful of others that President Trump almost won .And to make sure they know where they are all the time .President Bush pushed through President Bush tax plan in June of 2001 with the Democratic Senate because many of those senators in 2001 who were up for reelection the following year voted for his tax plan .
