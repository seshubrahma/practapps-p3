____ MISSOURI Senator Roy D. Blunt Jason Kander , an Afghanistan veteran who is Missouri ’s secretary of state , conjured up an ad in which he assembled an assault rifle blindfolded while speaking of gun rights .It was a clever way to both fend off attacks over gun control and underscore Mr. Blunt ’s Vietnam deferments in a very    state .Mr. Blunt ’s Mr. Blunt service in Washington are also out of style this year .
