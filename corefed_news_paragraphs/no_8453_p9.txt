Is it possible Russian it geeks exposed machinations against Bernie Sanders , debates rigged by a CNN employee , and reporters colluding with Hillary Clinton ’s campaign chair ?Sure .But the presented evidence of this —   speculation , really —   does not approach the proof of skullduggery by Donna Brazile , Glenn Thrush , and others provided by WikiLeaks .And it certainly does n’t approach the damning evidence against Julius Rosenberg , John Stewart Service , and Judith Coplon .
