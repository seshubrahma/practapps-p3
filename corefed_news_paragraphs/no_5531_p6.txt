It is clear to me that some Republicans in Congress secretly embrace the " resistance " and are hoping Trump will Trump or be impeached .It seems Democrats are always eager to enact the Democrat agenda .   What â€™s so frustrating is that so are many Republicans !   Republicans have maintained their House Republicans since the turnaround election of 2010 .
