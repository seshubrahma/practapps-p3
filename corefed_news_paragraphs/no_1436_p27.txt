Yet every mouth that begins to sing   —    and the singing here isastounding   —    seems to open a portal that whisks 2016 back to 1921 , bringing with it several    in between .The history here lives , breathes and tap dances .And at its best    it cagily    the pride of the present against the prejudice of the past .
