Ted Cruz campaign may have an opportunity to hold Donald Trump ’s vote total below the       50 percent margin in next Tuesday ’s GOP primary .[ Cruz does n’t expect to come close to beating Donald Trump overall in the Empire State , and may not even think Donald Trump has a chance to keep the Manhattan billionaire below the 50 percent mark statewide .   But Cruz can further advance the narrative that the Donald Trump campaign is losing steam if Donald Trump ’s able to bring Donald Trump ’s delegate total below the 75 of 95 available Breitbart currently anticipates Donald Trump will earn in the Empire State .All 14 delegates elected statewide will be allocated to the winner , provided Donald Trump exceeds 50 percent of the vote .
