After settling in Chicago in 1881 , my     Sophia , helped create a " Nickel Club " to help newly arrived immigrant families like hers who were trying to make it in America .   my    Sophia helped organize other women to pool together other women pennies and nickels to buy food , clothes or whatever the newcomers needed .Some of those immigrants came to escape war or religious persecutionothers hoped for economic opportunity others still came in later decades to study at some of the best schools in the world .
