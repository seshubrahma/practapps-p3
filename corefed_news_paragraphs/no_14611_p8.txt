we café mochas .   Atop another    department store stocked with    electronics and appliances , there was an even a food court on the top floor selling everything from Korean food ( very popular with the locals ) to    burgers and fries ( not popular at all ) .   I was surprised to see hundreds of people with food piled high on their plates     not the image of a " hundreds of people " North Korea so engrained in many peoples’ minds given the reports of famine just two years ago .   Of course , you can not extrapolate from life in Pyongyang what conditions are like in the rest of the country .
