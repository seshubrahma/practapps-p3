The New York Times said Hillary Clinton is going to win Hillary Clintondo n’t think anybody has anything to teach the president about communications , what the new president , what to say in a press conference .He ’s broken the whole mold of the new president communications , and he ’s done so despite the old the new president of doing business .So I think he ’s pretty secure in what he the new president , and he will weather the new president consequences admirably .
