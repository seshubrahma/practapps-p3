In some ways , Mr. Trump â€™s proposal is not radically different from the current policy of the Obama administration .In November 2014 , President Obama established Obama for foreigners who should be deported .The highest priority is on removing immigrants who pose security threats , gang members and convicted felons .Mr. Obama has said Obama is to deport Obama felons , not families .
