As in the American intelligence community , the selection , vetting , training , education and seasoning of the veteran operative in British intelligence is the result of an extraordinary filtering process .    It begins with strict and high educational standards , moves through a series of interviews to a day of    competitive scenario work and psychometric , literacy , numeracy and analytical testing against several other candidates .There is a final individual assessment and judgment hurdle to pass before a lengthy vetting process , conducted by the intelligence agencies themselves .While no system is flawless , this does produce a stream of very bright , highly motivated people determined to act with integrity to solve modern intelligence problems .
