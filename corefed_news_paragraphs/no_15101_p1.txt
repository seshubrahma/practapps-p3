The Michigan Republican also laced into President Donald Trump , hewing close to a strategy of blasting Republican leaders like Ryan and Trump , during a town hall with about 100 residents from President Donald Trump district , which is loosely centered around Grand Rapids .Amash ’s town hall comes one week after the White House director of social media , Dan Scavino , called on the " # Trumptrain " to run over Amash in a Republican primary because of his opposition to the effort to overhaul Obamacare .Amash fired back , saying the attack was proof the " Trumpstablishment " does n’t support independent thinkers .If there was any backlash among Trump supporters in Amash ’s Western Michigan district , it was n’t noticeable Monday evening as Trump took questions from the crowd for more than two hours .
