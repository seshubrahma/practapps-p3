The police lines were us thick and also included police on horses .   As I drove through that gauntlet , I was scared not knowing if my car would be a target and they tried to intimidate everyone !I had several protesters my car to my car and threaten me at the stop light right past where the police line ended .That my car and I pumped the gas and drove away .
