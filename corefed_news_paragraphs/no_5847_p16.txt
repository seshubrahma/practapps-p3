First , was this brilliant panel , expertly moderated by John Fund , in which blogger Tony Heller ( aka Steven Goddard ) and lawyer , blogger and EPA scourge Steve Milloy dealt with the basics : the climate data has been rigged by a corrupt , untrustworthy scientific establishment there has been little global warming and what there has been is entirely within natural boundaries the reason that this global scam appeals to so many different interest groups   —    politicians , activists , ( mostly   ) scientists ,    etc   —    is that it caters to such a variety of motivations ( political religious    ) .Second was a talk on energy economics with the fascinating Mark Mills of the Manhattan Institute who explained why renewables are such an inadequate and unnecessarily expensive response to the massively increasing global demand for energy and why fossil fuels   —    especially shale gas and oil   —    are by far the most effective solution for at least the next few hundred years .Third was an equally enlightening talk with Dr Craig Idso of the Energy   Environment Legal Institute on how increased atmospheric CO2 is greening the planet   —    thus more than counteracting all the disasters the greenies have been predicting as CO2 levels rise .
