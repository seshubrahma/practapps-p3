Accusations of voter fraud or election tampering , with no evidence whatsoever , cause unnecessary frenzy and put the focus in a dangerous place : thinking we need to do something to cure election issues that do not exist .

News that Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has requested a recount in Wisconsin , and will likely do the same in Michigan and Pennsylvania , has raised faint hopes among Hillary Clinton supporters that somehow Donald Trump will not become the next president of the United States .   Now that Hillary Clinton campaign has said it Clinton’s campaign participate in the recount efforts , those supporters’ hopes have been lifted even higher .
