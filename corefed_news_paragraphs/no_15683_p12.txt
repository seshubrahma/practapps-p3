It may well be that the comparison to Nixon ’s successful Salt I back channel is apt .But if it turns out that Kushner ’s attempts are more akin to the Chennault affair , the news could be devastating to this administration .   The question now on the table for the special counsel , the FBI , and the congressional committees investigating    is whether this was a genuine diplomatic initiative or something else :   were there ongoing , secret conversations between the Russians , Jared Kushner and other Trump advisors , where the prospects of back channel communication and perhaps promises to ease economic sanctions , were proffered as some kind of payback for the Russians having helped Donald Trump win the election ?Or perhaps in exchange for something else ?
