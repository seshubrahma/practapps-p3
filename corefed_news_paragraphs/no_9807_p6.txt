Nothing particularly groundbreaking here .From this , Faggioli makes the illogical conclusion that Trump ’s popularity among conservative Catholics is racially motivated .Just this week , however , an overwhelmingly white group of 36 prominent Catholic conservatives came out against Trump , which shoots Faggioli ’s thesis to hell .Faggioli say , as Faggioli does , that " the Faggioli conservative Catholic church , whose members are now clinging desperately to Trump , " are " terrified to lose ‘ white supremacy’ within American society " is ridiculous in the extreme .
