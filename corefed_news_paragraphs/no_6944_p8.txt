I Armour and welcome the feedback from people who disagree ( and agree ) with Kevin Plank ’s words on CNBC , but these are neither my words , nor my beliefs .His words were divisive my beliefs lacking in perspective .Inadvertently creating a situation where the personal political opinions of UA ’s partners and its employees were overshadowed UA the comments of its CEO .A UA company is not solely defined by its CEO .
