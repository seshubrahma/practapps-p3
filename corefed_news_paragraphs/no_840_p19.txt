Furthermore , if the economy falters in such situations , the long rally in stocks could end violently .One way to deal with this is to try to take a cosmic view , as I suggested in a recent column , ignoring the market ’s ups and downs entirely and remaining the market for a horizon that lasts decades .That can be accomplished by allocating your portfolio appropriately between stocks and bonds , depending on age and tolerance for risk , perhaps using diversified ,    mutual funds or    funds , in which professional managers do the work for you , merely by tracking broad indexes or by picking a variety of individual securities .If you do n’t need the money for a long while and are able to retain your equanimity in a protracted crisis , you may be able to avoid paying attention to the stock and bond markets .
