The    Divide , Few Western politicians know the first thing about the    rift , which flows from a doctrinal dispute that might seem trivial to modern outsiders .When Mohammed died in the 7th Century , there was a profound disagreement among the early followers of Islam about who should succeed Mohammed as leader .   The heart of the    conflict is that the Sunnis thought the new leader or " caliph " should be elected and chose Mohammed â€™s close friend Abu Bakr .The leader of the Islamic State , who styles himself as " caliph " or ruler of all true Muslims , calls himself " Abu Bakr   " in homage to the first caliph .
