Disappointed by the outcome of the leadership election , a people of Democrats who had backed Mr. Ryan vowed to press forward with a proposal to turn some jobs , such as the chairman of the party ’s campaign arm , into elected positions .That plan is expected to meet resistance from Ms. Pelosi , who retains the power to appoint people to those positions , though some Democrats have expressed an interest in the idea .Last week Ms. elected positions Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico to again lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , even though House Democrats picked up just six seats in this election .Though he collected only a dozen or so public endorsements , Mr. Ryan mounted an unlikely challenge to Ms. Mr. Ryan , long considered a legislative and    powerhouse .
