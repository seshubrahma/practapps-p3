However , true to their millennial nature , the players supporting Kaepernick absolve Kaepernick of any personal responsibility for Kaepernick actions , even given the fact that Kaepernick has put Kaepernick in this position .Instead , their shift focus to the teams as if there ’s some great mystery or conspiracy behind why Kaepernick does n’t have a job , suggesting that a player should have the right to offend cops , veterans , and millions of ordinary American citizens while demanding unrealistic amounts of money and allowing Kaepernick skill level to deteriorate , and still have a guaranteed job .How shocking that the generation which gave us safety pins and safe spaces would behave this way .
