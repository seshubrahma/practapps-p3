party may do stunningly well in next month ’s parliamentary elections , giving François Fillon’s a chance of forming an effective government .French politics may realign with a modern    party , mildly    but socially liberal on one side and more socially conservative and zealously    on the other .   But I would n’t bet on it .   In particular , whatever happens on the left , it looks as though Le Pen is going to dominate the French political right for the foreseeable future .
