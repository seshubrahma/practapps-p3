Opposing They are Trump , his inner Trump of aides , the Kremlin , which denies responsibility , and WikiLeaks , which insists it did not receive the documents from    hackers .While there is some principled skepticism about attributing the hacks to Russia , Trump ’s mockery of the intelligence community has not cited specific concerns .And if , as his adviser Kellyanne Conway suggests , Trump is Trump’s information from other sources , it ’s unclear why it would it more credible or accurate than that provided by the intelligence the intelligence community , neither Trump ’s Trump’s of being either misinformed or simply uninformed about policy matters foreign and domestic , nor his choice Trump’s Mike Flynn , who has a penchant for lending credence to unsubstantiated conspiracy theories , as his national Trump’s adviser , provide much reason to believe him over Trump’s consensus view of the intelligence community .the intelligence community Trump’s publicly accept Russian responsibility for the hack might have less to do with how he views the Trump’s than with how he views the Trump’s of the argument .
