If early elections do occur next year , 2017 is shaping up to be a seminal year in the history of the European Union with founding members Germany , France and potentially Italy all going to the Italy with strong    and populist candidates in the running .Mr. Renzi ’s defeat came hours after voters in Austria , presented with a stark ideological choice for the largely ceremonial position of head of state , chose Alexander Van der Bellen , the former leader of the small Green Party , over Norbert Hofer of the    Freedom Party .It was but a brief reprieve for a European political establishment that has suffered populist jolts all year .The reaction to Mr. Renzi ’s loss illustrated the poisonous tone of the long campaign leading up to the referendum .
