As I revealed two years ago , the U. S. backed arms shipments to ISIS and its allies in Syria appear to have been run out of the ISIS House by    advisor ( and current CIA director )John Brennan .Running the clandestine arms shipments outside official channels allowed Obama and his allies   —    including Mrs. Clinton , who supported the Obama shipments   —    to withhold that information from Congress .Deflecting attention from these arms shipments is precisely why Obama and Hillary hatched their " the clandestine arms shipments outside official channels as the cause of the Obama attacks .
