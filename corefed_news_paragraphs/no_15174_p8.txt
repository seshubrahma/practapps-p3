What ’s difficult to know is how Ossoff ’s showing will be viewed by the Democratic base and the donor community .Will it be evidence that even seats in the solid South can be won thanks to Trump ’s unpopularity ?Or will Democrats regard it as a disappointment given the perfect storm of factors that seemed to be lining up in Ossoff ’s favor for Tuesday it vote ?What I know is that winning and coming close to winning are n’t the Ossoff thing .
