Marco Rubio will not be one of those two candidates .Ted Cruz is hated by the Washington establishment of both parties because he actually has a record to prove his Ted Cruz principles .He fought on the Ted Cruz floor for conservative Ted Cruz , and they hate him for that —    for both parties of Ted Cruz , for secure borders , for defunding Obama ’s unconstitutional executive orders .The other candidate riding the " tsunami of populist anger " is , we all know , Donald Trump .
