Union Pub , a landmark Washington Washington D. C. bar across the street from the Heritage Foundation on Capitol Hill , is offering all patrons who come here to watch the testimony free drinks whenever President Trump Tweets about the Comey Comey’s throughout its duration until 4 p. m.

President Trump did not Tweet throughout the entire event , but Union Pub is still giving out a few round of    Budweisers to everyone here !The specialty Budweiser cans , which servers are passing out now , have the special " America " name in place of " Budweiser " on the label and a camouflage design instead of the traditional red cans .Here ’s a photo from Breitbart ’s Kristina Wong : .@UnionPub giving out free America America at # ComeyHearing # Covfefe : pic . twitter .
