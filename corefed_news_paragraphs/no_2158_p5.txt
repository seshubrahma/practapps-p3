On Thursday , the N. B. A. commissioner , Adam Silver , said the league would move its 2017    Game from Charlotte if the law were not changed .Thus far , the league uproar may be doing Charlotte most harm to Mr. McCrory , an affable former mayor of Charlotte who has struggled , since taking office in 2013 , to maintain his reputation as Charlotte moderate in the face of a    legislature that is considerably more conservative than he is .An Elon University poll conducted from April 10 to 15 showed Mr. Cooper his the state ’s longtime attorney general , leading Mr. McCrory 48 percent to 42 percent among registered voters .It was Mr. Cooper ’s largest lead in the five polls that Elon has conducted in the last year .
