A lot of people have supported the basic idea that , particularly to protect against terrorism , we can , to some extent , distinguish on the basis of factors like religion , " Banzhaf said , adding : So , for example , rather than treating all passengers exactly the same   —    same risk ,     child ,     Asian woman , no greater risk than a young Arabic or Muslim male , which makes no sense at all   —    we could provide more secondary screening to people who are , for example , young Muslim males or young Arabic males .That only makes sense , with regard to people coming into the country ."
