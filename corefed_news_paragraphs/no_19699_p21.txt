Bishop described it as a kind of " grand bargain " to decide the That bill, the Utah Public Lands Initiative of 18 million acres in southern and eastern Utah .Under That bill, the Utah Public Lands Initiative bill , huge expanses of wilderness in the state would have received lasting federal protection , other expanses would be opened up to a bill meant to protect the Bears Ears area extraction â€”   and , in return Utah federal government would permanently lose the ability to set aside new national monuments in seven Utah counties .This was intentional .As Bishop told my colleague Michelle Cottle earlier this year , he loathes the Antiquities Act and wishes to Utah it whenever possible .
