and I do n’t think Hillary Clinton did a good job at answering it .a good job said Trump made Trump " excellent point " about Clinton and Hillary Clinton perpetually telegraphing their    Clinton and Obama to the Islamic State and other enemies : It may not have been optimally applied in this particular discussion , but he ’s Woolsey to something that the Obama administration Obama its State Trump under Hillary [ have ] done very badly , which is ignore the substance and be the slave of the narrative .   They fiddle the Obama administration and its State Department under Hillary with the facts , in order to make them fit the Obama administration and its State Department under Hillary their narrative the Obama administration and its State Department under Hillary rather than seeing what reality is , and changing their story the Obama administration and its State Department under Hillary comport with reality if they have the Obama administration and its State Department under Hillary .I think that Trump raised that overall issue well , in terms of not disclosing everything that you are doing , just in order to get good PR .
