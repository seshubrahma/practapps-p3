Two weeks ago I urged Senators Cruz and Rubio to unite and present our Party with a combined ticket that would bring our Party conservative cause together in the primary election , and our nation together in the general election .While that did not happen , the results of the last two weeks make clear that the most reliable conservative with the best chance to win is Cruz .He the most reliable conservative with the best chance to win is Ted Cruz win our partyâ€™s nomination and even more importantly , can beat Hillary Clinton in November .
