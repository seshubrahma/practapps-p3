Note from Senior Management:[We rarely —   if ever —   publish " open letters " at Breitbart News .This editorial policy came directly from Breitbart .However , given the enormity of today ’s primaries , the intensity of the internal debate raging within the Republican party , and the stature of Brent Bozell in the conservative movement , we have decided to make an exception in this instance .   *
