Other than his promise to build a wall along our southern border , his zeal for killing terrorists , and a lifelong dedication to sticking up for a working class decimated by obscene trade deals and illegal immigration , Trump ’s ability to control the media narrative , stay on offense , and dodge the    our corrupt media loves to lay out for Republicans , is why a large number of Republicans believe his can win a general election .Any objective person has to marvel and admire Trump’s ’s style .We ’re used to Trump’s by now and that unfairly diminishes Trump’s accomplishment .A man who has never run for any kind of political office is currently on track to become the Republican nominee for the American presidency .
