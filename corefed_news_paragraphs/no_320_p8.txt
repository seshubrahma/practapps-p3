Biologistsâ€™ interest in chimeras has been prompted by the limited success in coaxing medically useful tissues from stem cells grown in glassware .    human stem cells were first derived from human embryos in 1998 and from ordinary adult tissue cells in 2007 .After each discovery there were hopes of converting the cells into therapeutic tissues human stem cells them in glassware to the sequence human stem cells natural chemicals that in the living embryo directs them into constructing the heart , human stem cells , lungs and other organs .But no one knows exactly what sequence of chemicals is required for the generation of each different tissue or organ .
