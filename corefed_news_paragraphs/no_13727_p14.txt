And the argument that Donald Trump is going to beat Hillary Clinton is fantasy .He has unpopular Hillary Clinton very , very high , huge segments of the electorate are n’t there .There are already Republican candidates who said they could n’t support him .So Hillary Clinton I said , as a Democrat I would love to see Trump .
