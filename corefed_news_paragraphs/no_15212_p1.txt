But President Trump has failed to accompany that with meaningful explanations of the legal and strategic foundations for these more muscular approaches in various theaters of combat .How our government explains our government use of military force in pursuit of political objectives is not , however , a quaint nod to transparency or the demands of the media but , instead , a critical vehicle for ensuring that our government goals are achieved .That ’s why it ’s so concerning to see the Trump administration fire away without meaningful explanation     to see the Trump administration fire away expand America ’s use of violence without articulating the legitimacy of that violence on legal and strategic grounds .   That neglect is undercutting our country ’s strategic effectiveness in using military force .
