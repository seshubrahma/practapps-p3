Jason Chaffetz authority to reverse Washington ’s laws .While the measure never went to a full House vote and ended up becoming a law in the District residents are still unhappy with the authority Chaffetz sought to exercise and the fact that he has Chaffetz he wants Chaffetz aggressively step up congressional oversight in Washington .Washington response , some DC residents are giving money to Damian Kidd , a Republican lawyer from Utah and currently Chaffetz ’s only primary opponent .
