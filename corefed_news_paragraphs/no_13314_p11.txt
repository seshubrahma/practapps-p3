Almost everybody , whether an existing citizen or a new immigrant , needs government subsidies to afford health insurance now , thanks to ObamaCare .Another way of looking at the fairness issue is that immigration restrictions and law enforcement tend to poll worse when they ’re personalized   —    not immigration restrictions and law enforcement discussions about law enforcement , but personalized stories about individual people and families who will suffer , if immigration laws are enforced .That only works when the people who suffer from open borders immigration are    and rendered invisible , much the way ObamaCare can only be presented as a " success " if everyone harmed by it is completely ignored .Discussing individual ObamaCare who are pushed out of jobs by madcap immigration policy puts a personal face back on the victim , which brings that issue of fairness back in play .
