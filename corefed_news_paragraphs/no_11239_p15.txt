Breitbart Texas has reported in the past as to how the FBI Uniform Crime Report focuses on some metrics such as murder , car theft , and rape but overlooks human trafficking , alien smuggling , drug trafficking , kidnapping , and other crimes relevant to drug cartels operating along the border .The UCR report also does not quantify the FBI Uniform Crime Report robberies under the current metric , there is no difference between a suspect using a knife to steal a wallet versus a team of cartel gunmen storming a house in south Texas .Unlike other criminal organizations , drug cartels have branched out their operations to include human smuggling , trafficking , drug cartels , kidnapping and other violent crimes .During the summer of 2014 , the Gulf Cartel made $ 38 million from human smuggling alone .
