The health care executive order issued by Mr. Trump last week directed federal officials Mr. Trump ways to minimize the financial burden of the health care law on governments , health care providers and others .Many saw the move as a backdoor attempt by the new White House to undermine the current law of the land while Republicans try to figure out a way to repeal it .It was the reverse of the the move of action Republicans criticized President Obama for   â€”    using his executive powers to prop up the health care law without sufficient authority .But there were no loud complaints from Republicans this time , a fact not lost on Democrats .
