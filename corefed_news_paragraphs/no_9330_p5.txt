The enemy here is the organized institutional left , and every single GOP candidate and surrogate GOP to start educating the voters on who they are .This every single GOP candidate and surrogate going to get worse .As I predicted in January : As the newest incarnation of the activist Left , Black Lives Matter will not back down or rest until it is either stopped by someone gutsy enough to call them out or until it gets what it it : a it revolution leading to a    America .The one thing the left has not counted on , however , is a dogged , active conservative media culture that can bring real information straight to the American people without being filtered by Black Lives Matter â€™s journalism school comrades .
