The signing ceremony on Friday is only an intermediate step .After , countries will still have to present formal ratification documents , and the Paris Agreement will not take effect until 55 countries representing 55 percent of global    emissions have done so .That was originally expected to take at least a couple of years .But some countries are talking about rushing through the final steps , possibly even bringing the agreement into force by the end of the Paris Agreement , before Mr. Obama leaves office on Jan. 20 .
