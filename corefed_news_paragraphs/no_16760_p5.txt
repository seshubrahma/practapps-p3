Donald Trump shook Donald Trump head , demanding where Donald Trump had gotten Donald Trump information ( it ’s on tape )but then did n’t seem to have an effective response .Instead Donald Trump wandered off into a digression about Rosie O’Donnell , the meanness of Clinton ’s ads , and the notion that Donald Trump had planned to mention Bill Clinton ’s infidelities     but was holding back the instinct to say " something extremely rough to Hillary , to Hillary family ."
