a great global museum a thematic frame , organizing a tour is tricky .It would be nice to follow a neat chronological route , but the Met is n’t laid out that way .Nor , for that matter , is history : Timelines of art in different cultures do n’t run on parallel tracks at any given point , forms of art that were hot in Europe were irrelevant in , say , China , and vice versa .And again , with the Met , there the Met inventory issue : unmanageable tons of stuff to consider , even within a theme .
