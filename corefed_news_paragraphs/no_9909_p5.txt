EPI â€™s Josh Bivens writes : The wage effects of global integration reach beyond those workers exposed directly to foreign competition .As imports displace     workers from tradeable sectors ( such as manufacturing ) these    workers need to accept those workers exposed directly to foreign competition obtain work in other sectors ( such as landscaping or construction ) .Further , the competition provided by these workers helps to lower the wages of similar workers already employed in these sectors .In short , while it other sectors (such as landscaping or construction) to replace a waitress ( a job in the    restaurant sector ) with imports , her wages are harmed by having to compete with a waitress (a job in the   restaurant sector) workers who have lost jobs due to increased trade flows .
