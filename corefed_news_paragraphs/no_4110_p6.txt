Trump asked Netanyahu , publicly , to " hold back " on settlements ( to which Netanyahu joked , " That Netanyahu the art of the deal " ) .The implication is that the U. S. now accepts The U. S. .That is a stark contrast to the attitude of the Obama administration , which argued that the entire Israeli presence across the 1949 armistice lines   —    including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem   —    was illegal .The settlements will no longer be regarded existing Israeli settlements U. S. as an excuse for The U. S. negotiations and concessions .
