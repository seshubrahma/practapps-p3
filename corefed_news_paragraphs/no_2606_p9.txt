Female hosts in skirts , sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs , have always been a network trademark .To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network .And 21st Century Fox â€™s leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has so carefully cultivated , and which is central to the financial and ratings success of Mr. Murdoch he is grooming to succeed him , Lachlan and James Murdoch .The latter , at least , is known to have different politics from his father .
