It defies logic that a man who was a close friend , confidant , and adviser to the late Andrew Breitbart   —    a proud Jew   —    could have any negative feelings towards Jews .As I can testify from years of work together with Steve in close quarters , the opposite is the case : Steve is outraged by antisemitism .If anything , Steve is overly sensitive about it , and often takes offense on Jews’ behalf .
