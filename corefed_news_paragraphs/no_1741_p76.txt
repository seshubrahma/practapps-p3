Phil Smith , a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of Patriot , said the union expected production Mr. Clarke’s at the Mr. Clarke’s when the broader Mr. Clarke’s market recovered .Still , Mr. Clarke ’s company has shifted away from Mr. Clarke’s coal and is hunting for mines that Mr. Clarke’s much more Mr. Clarke’s metallurgical coal used in steel production .Last month Patriot an    company acquired a set of huge surface mines in British Columbia out of Mr. Clarke’s .Unlike many of the Patriot mines that Mr. Clarke acquired to clean up , these new mines are capable of pumping the coal miners’ union new coal onto the market each year and he ’s projecting big profits next year .
