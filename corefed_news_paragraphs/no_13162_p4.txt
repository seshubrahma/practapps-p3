( Can you spell Associate Justice             ? )Constitutional conservatives understand that our immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced .our immigration laws will mean nothing if President Trump orders Donald Trump built from Brownsville to San Diego if a lawsuit brought by a dozen leftist groups results in a U. S. Supreme Court decision striking down that order as contrary to the Constitution .The same is true for every single important issue you can name , from education choice to refugee admissions , from criminal justice reform to repeal of Obamacare .
