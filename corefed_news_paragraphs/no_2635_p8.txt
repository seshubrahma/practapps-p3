Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew , the Treasury secretary , urging him to Mr. Lew on companies and individuals in Europe .The Mr. Lew Commission " is using a theory to make tax law , is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority , in our a theory , " Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend â€™s meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies .He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion , saying legislation that prevents Mr. Lew from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the United States " will see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration ."
