Let me begin by saying that I am from a family of immigrants that came to this country for a better life .They came to the US " legally , " assimilated , integrated , and learned English to the best of They ability , and demanded They speak it .As we all know , They live in a time in which there are forces who wish to destroy They way of life .There are thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take them back back .
