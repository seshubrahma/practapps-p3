Neither of this year’s    candidates was a national figure at the time he was selected , unlike many past nominees .Neither has set off a media feeding frenzy like previous nominees such as Geraldine A. Ferraro , the first woman on a major party ticket , in 1984 or Sarah Palin , who became a lightning rod for critics in 2008 .Mr. Pence and Mr. Kaine are both white men in Mr. Pence and Mr. Kaine late 50s , with solid governing résumés , but little reputation beyond Mr. Pence and Mr. Kaine home states .
