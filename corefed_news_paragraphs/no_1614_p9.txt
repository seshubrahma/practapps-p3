I think that pulling off the swimmers from the plane makes our image of a third world banana republic worse .Yet , what about using your prominence to falsely accuse our police of criminal behavior when you were the ones acting criminally ?We have a serious crime problem , under which all of us suffer .We I see rich Americans destroying our property and We lying about it to make our property look worse
