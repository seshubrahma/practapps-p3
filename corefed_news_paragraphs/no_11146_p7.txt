Upon the completion of a significant continuous section of the security fence in 2003 , Israel already saw a marked decrease in the number of suicide bombers able to penetrate Israeli cities .About 95 % of the barrier consists of a    fence backed up by    surveillance systems and not the concrete barrier routinely shown by the news media .The concrete barriers are usually only located in areas where the wall intersects with Israeli communities and roads , including areas of previous Palestinian shooting attacks .Trump has numerous times pledged to build a wall along the nearly 2 , 000 mile U. S.   border to stem the flow of illegal aliens and criminal drug traffickers .
