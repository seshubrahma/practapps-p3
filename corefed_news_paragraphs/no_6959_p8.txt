Today the same leftist " open internet " LARPâ€™ers who championed internet freedom only two years ago have branded    frogs as hate symbols .Former presidential candidates even argue that conservative speech is not constitutionally protected .To keep the Internet truly free and open , Americans that support true internet freedom need to make Americans that support true internet freedom voices heard .This is the most important battle of our generation .
