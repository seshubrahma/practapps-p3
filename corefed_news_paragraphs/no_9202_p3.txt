"I ’ve noticed this in the military and it ’s it , Eric Prince is the founder of Blackwater and a very good guy and he says Eric Prince one of the reasons this   is happening is that there are too many layers of management in the military the military ’ve become like every other government bureaucracy and these people have go to find something to do .And the upper management who are always on the lookout for political favours and promotions do n’t have to appeal to active service types , they have to the upper management who are always on the lookout for political favours and promotions to politicians .So the changing fashions of identity politics have a huge impact on the military in the military you would never expect , because the people who run this stuff , the people at the top are sucking up to politicians all the time .
