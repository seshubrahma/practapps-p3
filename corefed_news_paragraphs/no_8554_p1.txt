[ From Vox :   The media ’s coverage of the 2016 race did n’t win the election for Donald Trump , but The media did n’t help .Back in September , Gallup presented the findings of an important research project that , in retrospect , ought to have prompted a lot more soul searching among members of the press .What they did was , over an extended period of time , survey people and ask they what they were hearing about the two candidates .The answer is that with regard to Hillary Clinton , they heard a lot about email .
