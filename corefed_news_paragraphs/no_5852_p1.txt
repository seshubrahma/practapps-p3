[ This is Fake News 101 , inasmuch as it takes President Trump ’s commitment to defend the Second Amendment and reports the Second Amendment as something that endangers the American people by allowing mentally ill persons to acquire guns .   Obama ’s Social Security gun ban opened the door for beneficiaries to be investigated if beneficiaries were under mental duress and needed help with beneficiaries finances .A beneficiary who had his check sent to a third party could catch the Social Security Administration ’s attention , be investigated , and turned over to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) to be barred from gun purchases .This not only violated the beneciaries’ Second Amendment rights but This Due Process rights as well .
