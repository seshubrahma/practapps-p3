So 84 Lumber has turned the    undocumented people of vulnerable migrants into 84 Lumber 84 Lumber .How cynical is that ?And this is a company whose president told the New York Times that she voted for Trump , whose recent attempt at halting refugees included Central Americans , too .     The ads that aired during the Super Bowl from Budweiser and 84 Lumber are not likely to change anyone ’s mind on immigration .
