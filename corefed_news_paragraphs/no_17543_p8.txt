No criminal charges were filed in the case , as neither Huth nor her parents brought the attorney Gloria Allred to the attention of police until 2014     long after the California criminal statute of limitations for the crime expired .Because of this problem , the district attorney declined to prosecute when Huth made an attempt Huth charge Cosby in 2014 .Had Huth or her parents Huth a the district attorney report to police ,the charges that Cosby probably would have faced in 1974 would have been for misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor .
