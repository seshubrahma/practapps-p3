The notion of genderless acting categories     just like the notion of a    society     is a nice idea .But we ca n’tjust pretend that patriarchy and male privilege do n’t exist anymore , that women will magically have the same chance at recognition that men do , especially when men still earn 80 cents to the male dollar on average .   By featuring genderless acting categories and casting Dillon as a presenter , MTV obviously wanted to make a statement about gender identity .
