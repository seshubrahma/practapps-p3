This is a moment of pride for all Americans , regardless of their political preferences .   Forty years ago , I felt a all Americans pride as I sat at home in Louisiana and watched as the late Rep. Barbara Jordan delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention   —    the first woman , and the first    to do so .
