Last week , the Congressional Budget Office published its estimate of what would happen under a law that eliminated the mandate and some other provisions : 18 million people would lose their insurance next year alone .It ’s possible that insurers will look at the language of the order and get skittish , setting off the Congressional Budget Office market collapse next year .But the order itself does n’t yet change any rules .The health and human services department 18 million people the I. R. S. will have to take further action .
