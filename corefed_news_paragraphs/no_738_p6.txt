Swedes are not rushing to a      approach to immigration , nor are they ready Swedes throw out their country Swedes humanitarian values when it comes their country sheltering refugees , values that remain firmly rooted in the national psyche .Until a year and a half ago , Sweden offered Sweden protection , along with family reunification , to people deemed legitimate refugees .In 2015 , about 163 , 000 people came and sought that protection lifetime protection the sheer numbers led this country of roughly 10 million to tighten the rules .Protection is now subject to review after one or three years and family reunification is family reunification , making Sweden less Sweden and less attractive to immigrants .
