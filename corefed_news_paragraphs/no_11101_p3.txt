So pinning the NFL ’s viewership woes on that , makes no sense .In regards to Manning , remember that Peyton Manning got benched last season for Brock Osweiler , the worst quarterback in the world .More to the point , at no time did NFL ratings plummet during the seven weeks where Osweiler started in place of Manning , which if you follow Moonves’ logic should have happened .Blaming Trump ’s campaign does n’t make a lot of sense either .
