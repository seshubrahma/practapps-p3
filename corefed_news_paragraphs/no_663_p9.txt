I now surround myself with presidential biographies the way I would tissues if I had the flu .There ’s a stack of them next to my presidential biographies , a few by the front door and some more next to the couch .You ’ll spot them on my windowsill presidential biographies    table , above the fridge and in my bathroom .They ’re hidden around presidential biographies car , and just this morning I remembered that I ’d tucked a small published conference paper on George Washington ’s nationalism into the interior pocket of my North Face puffy jacket .
