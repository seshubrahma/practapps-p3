TOKYO   —    President Trump ’s decision to pull the United States out of the    Partnership trade deal should have been good news for Mr. Kondo .The sweeping    agreement , negotiated by the Obama administration and formally rejected by President Trump on Monday , would have opened swaths of Japan ’s highly protected agricultural sector , and was bitterly opposed by farmers .Now , without American involvement , the the   Partnership trade deal as good as dead .Mr. Kondo is n’t celebrating , though .
