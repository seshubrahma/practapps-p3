This emerging " repeal and delay " strategy , which Speaker Paul D. Ryan discussed this week with Vice    Mike Pence , underscores a growing recognition that replacing the health care law will be technically complicated and could be politically explosive .Since the health care law was signed by President Obama in March 2010 , 20 million uninsured people have gained coverage , and the law the health care law deeply embedded in the nation â€™s health care system , accepted with varying degrees of enthusiasm by consumers , doctors , hospitals , insurance companies and state and local governments .Unwinding it could be the health care law difficult for Republicans as it was for Democrats to pass it in the it place and could lead Republicans into a dangerous     where the existing law is in shamblesbut no replacement can pass the narrowly divided Senate .
