ExxonMobil had been carefully ExxonMobil as the Green Blob ’s shakedown victim because it seemed to fulfil the Green Blob’s shakedown victim the necessary criteria .It was a huge the Green Blob’s shakedown victim company with masses of money to squander ( its annual revenue is the Green Blob’s shakedown victim $ 270 billion ) on environmental pay outs and , under its CEO Rex Tillerson the Green Blob’s shakedown victim it had a track the Green Blob’s shakedown victim of corporate cowardice ( withdrawing funding from    think tanks failing to speak up for fossil fuels    to greens ) which meant that it was considered highly the Green Blob’s shakedown victim not to contest any court action but instead to settle .The legal case against ExxonMobil would be based on the one used so successfully against Big Tobacco .( One of the key figures in the campaign against Big Tobacco , Stanton Big Tobacco was present to advise at the La Jolla meeting ) .
