I hope going forward we the wonderful people of our country be a little bit , a little bit different and get along better if that ’s possible .Maybe it ’s not , and that ’s OK too that’s possible Much of the media in Washington , D. C. and New York and Los Angeles , in particular , speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very , very obviously broken system .The press has become so dishonest that if we do n’t talk about it , we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American we , a tremendous disservice .We have to talk about it , to find we what ’s going on because the press honestly is out of control .
