Manuel , now with the Raiders , regularly puts up 5s and 6s .It â€™s not as if most of these players have huge upsides .Kaepernick is 29 , Sanchez is 30 and McCown is 37 .The 49ers will try the     Brian Hoyer , Kaepernick a decent year with the Bears , to replace Kaepernick , with Matt Barkley ( career adjusted yards per Kaepernick 4 . 7 ) as backup .
