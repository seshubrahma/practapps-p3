Democratic candidates on the fence about whether or not to run in 2018 would have taken the Ossoff victory as a sign that the national environment was beginning to tilt heavily in their side ’s favor .Now none of that will happen .Sure , it is still possible for Democrats to retake the House in 2018 .As the May 2010 special election in Pennsylvania ’s 12th District proved , a single race is not necessarily all that predictive .
