Thanks to the Mount Washington Observatory , it can see what it ’s like to take a walk in 110 mile per hour winds .He should have been wearing a hood .   His hair had a few    though it made for a great wind blown look .   And though he might need a little first aide , he wo n’t need any pomade to flag down a He style that stays frozen even in His hair kind of wind .
