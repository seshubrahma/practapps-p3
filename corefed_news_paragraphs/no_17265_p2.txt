In 1991 Cazeneuve became a councilor in the Cabinet of Thierry de Beaucé , then the secretary of state for international cultural relations , according to Cazeneuve biography on the Interior Ministry website .   Cazeneuve was elected a member of parliament in 1997 and has since served as minister of state for European affairs and minister of state for the budget , before being appointed interior minister .Valls’ resignation has given way to a Cabinet    with Bruno Le Roux , a ranking socialist in the French National Assembly , nominated as interior minister in Cazeneuve ’s place .If Valls wins the Socialist nomination , Valls will likely face Francois Fillon of the Republican Party and Marine Le Pen of the    Front National in the first round of the presidential election next spring .
