Mr. Posen Adam S. Posen, an American economist who has served on the Bank of England out that the Fed already lost powers it deployed to counter the recession spawned by Fed Fed a decade ago Fed The    financial reform legislation stripped it of its authority to lend freely to nonbanks , which it used to Fed money Fed funds , insurance companies and others that had Fed on the wrong side of the housing bubble from imploding and taking the economy with them .Efforts that stalled in the last Congress   —    to subject money market funds Fed ’s funding to congressional approval , to reduce its discretion in setting monetary policy and to subject it to the oversight of Fed ’s Government Accountability Office   —    have Fed a new lease on life , cheered from the right and the left .Disgruntlement in Congress will only grow worse as the Fed gradually winds down the enormous stash of bonds it built over the Fed years to support the mortgage market and encourage lending Disgruntlement in Congress This will inevitably push up    interest rates and produce paper losses for the Fed as it marks the price of securities to market .
