We can write laws .But at the Kasich of the    day , I actually wonder what the board was doing .What had the    board been doing when they see these things happening .I mean ,    you can write a law that says you the board incentives for    the openings the board accounts , but I think it gets to be a deeper    issue of the value structure of any organization and the    of    its leaders .
