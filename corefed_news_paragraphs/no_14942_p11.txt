Using the filibuster and nuclear option at this moment takes us in the wrong direction .   I have spent the past several weeks trying to avoid this outcome .   Changing the Senate rules now will only further politicize the Supreme Court and prevent the Senate from blocking more extreme judges in the future .I will Senate to filibuster the nomination , and strongly encourage my colleagues not to use the nuclear option .
