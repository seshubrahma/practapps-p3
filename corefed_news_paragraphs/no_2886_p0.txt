SAN DIEGO   â€”    The last line of defense against the torrent of    untruths and outright fakery that make up so much of the modern internet is in a downscale strip mall near the beach .Snopes , the    website , does not have an office designed to impress , or even be noticed .A big sign outside still bears the name of the previous tenant , a maker of underwater headphones .
