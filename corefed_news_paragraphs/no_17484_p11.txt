Once our teacher took us out our the weekend our a Russian campsite .We slept in wooden bungalows our crossed frozen rivers and lakes on skis , visiting picturesque villages where    babushkas greeted us with warm smiles .our still remember the muffled sound of falling snow and the blinding white scenery .   The school was divided in two parts : the elementary and middle schools were in one block while the high school was within The school on the other side of Moscow .
