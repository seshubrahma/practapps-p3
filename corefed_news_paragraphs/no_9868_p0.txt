From the New York Post Editorial Board :   In all the Democratic convention speeches seeking to " humanize " Hillary Clinton , something went curiously missing : Hillary Clinton work with the family charity .You ’d think Hillary Clinton , Bill and Chelsea would want to use the national stage to tout how Bill and Chelsea family ’s $ 2 billion foundation is " helping improve the lives of millions of people across the world , " as it boasts .You ’d think we would ’ve heard from some of the beneficiaries of the " partnerships between businesses , NGOs , governments and individuals " finding " solutions that last ."
