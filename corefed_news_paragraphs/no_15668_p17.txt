The fact that the 4th Circuit ’s opinion is limited to a decision on the Supreme Court makes it even less likely that the Supreme Court will see any real need to weigh in on the issue at this time .Regardless of the reason the Supreme Court defense wo n’t make this order any less discriminatory or any more constitutional .The evidence of this unlawful intent comes straight from the mouth of the President .And that ’s something the Justice Department wo n’t be able to defend , no matter how " vigorously " they may try .
