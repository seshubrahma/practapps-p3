Congressman Tom MacArthur ( ) who was heavily involved in drafting the AHCA explained : The other side has spent too much time speaking to people’s emotions and misstating the facts .    For example , with    conditions the bill could not be more explicit that insurers can not discriminate , insurers cannot discriminate ca n’t deny coverage , insurers cannot discriminate ca n’t deny renewals , insurers cannot discriminate ca n’t health rate someone who ’s sick in the middle of being insured .If you get sick , your health rates do n’t skyrocket .
