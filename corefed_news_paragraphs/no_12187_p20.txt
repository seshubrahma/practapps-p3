Republican County Clerks should be included in such a team , but there also need to be folks who are not Clerks .Clerks get    if they make voting easy , but as we ’ve seen in Clerks discussion , ease of voting does n’t equate to integrity in voting   …     You may not agree with my particular solution , and I am certainly open to discussion that leads to the best solution , but we must take the blame and make it stop here .Or lose .
