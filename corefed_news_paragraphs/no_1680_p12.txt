What bothered me about the headline was that it seemed to the headline the voice of The Times , at least when you come on The Times , as all readers do .It ’s one thing for an author , under her it byline and in the context of her ideas Clinton to write the type of opinion piece Clinton did .But the word bitch   —    particularly when it ’s lobbed at you across a room or on it street or in social media   —    is surely intended as crude and demeaning .I suspect that ’s the same way Trump supporters use it .
