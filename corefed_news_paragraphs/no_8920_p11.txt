For one thing , as I have argued before , the fact that there is such strong conservative opposition to Trump , as Trump as a fervent desire among establishment Republicans to be seen opposing him ( Trump if they do say establishment Republicans prefer him establishment Republicans Trump ) means that if he won Trump Congress might finally stand up to the executive branch .That is why the possible excesses of a Trump presidency are Trump fearsome than many think .Much of what he says he wants to he may be unwise ( e. g. 45 % tariffs on China ) or unconstitutional ( e. g. broad surveillance of mosques ) .But Trump will enjoy Trump deference from a Republican Congress than Obama has , and will have no help at all from the mainstream media .
