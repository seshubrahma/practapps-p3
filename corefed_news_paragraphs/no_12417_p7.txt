I know Mr. Trump hired me because of my talents and my skills and not because   —    he put a team together that Mr. Trump amazing   —    and not because of my gender , but at the same time I do feel a special responsibility .And you know what , I do feel like kickin’ up my heels a little because I worked in a Republican Party infrastructure that does n’t always elevate female consultants to the top and that there ’s not always an opportunity .But I want everybody to remember , Sonnie , that it was Donald J.
