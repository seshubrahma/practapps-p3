Martin ’s article mentions various initiatives : state attempts to    set up retirement savings options for people without access to    people at work ; longtime 401( k ) critic Teresa Ghilarducci ’s idea    for a mandatory savings plan , in which the money would be    collected by the government and managed by financial pros ; and    Marco Rubio ’s now    plan to open the federal    defined contribution system to people who do n’t work for the government .
