If Handel prevails , polls suggest Handel margin will be similarly narrow .Some Democrats will be quick to note that Tom Price , the congressman whose departure to join the administration created the    vacancy , won    last year by more than 20 points .Others , however , will suggest , given the national spotlight , that comparing Ossoff ’s performance to Clinton ’s strong showing would make for a more accurate assessment .Democrats are also sure to argue that , win or lose , requiring the GOP to dedicate gobs of money to defending a district that House Speaker Newt Gingrich once called home should be cause for hope .
