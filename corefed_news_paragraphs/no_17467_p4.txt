The context of the the speech after the US abstention at the Security Council over a resolution criticizing Israeli settlements     really did drive much of its content .Israeli settlements     spent a fair amount of time defending the US action at the United Nations , rejecting charges that the United States had colluded with others , while laying out the case for why the US has the United States supportive of Israel .But the central portion of the speech was a harsh attack on the settlement enterprise and why they undermine the prospects for a    solution .And even though Kerry conceded , rightly , that they are not the they or even main obstacle to a    solution , and while he did identify numerous Kerry of bad Palestinian behavior , the level of detail on the settlement question left the clear impression that addressing the settlement enterprise was a priority .
