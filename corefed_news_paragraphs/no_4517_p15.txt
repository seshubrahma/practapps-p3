As long as campuses are churning out students who hate free speech and free markets , what hope is there for libertarian policy priorities ?If libertarians want to live in a free society , they ’d better get ready libertarians tread on their opponents .At my libertarians Berkeley show last week ,    set college property on fire , smashed up bank windows and ATMs , jumped on people ’s cars , and looted downtown stores , including the    liberal Starbucks .They also assaulted dozens of my fans , who were falsely accused of being " Nazis .
