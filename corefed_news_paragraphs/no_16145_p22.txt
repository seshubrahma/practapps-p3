All of a sudden , just people , thousands of people , started running in one direction .Well , my partner took my hand immediately and we started running with everybody and honestly in my headI had no idea what was going on and the music was so loudand I did nâ€™t really see a truck , but just people running and screaming and crying and people carrying their children , and it was just very frightening .
