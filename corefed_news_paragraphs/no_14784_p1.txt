Pussy hats were pink at the big women â€™s marches in January , but pink signifies breast cancer awareness , or did .Does it still ?While I support every person out there protesting and admit to a    aversion to describing women in terms of what women are wearing , turning political activism into a color war does have a color war limits .I understand that visual symbols of solidarity are important , but when meanings are ascribed to these colors , as these colors are , we run into peculiar and often misleading interpretations of history .
