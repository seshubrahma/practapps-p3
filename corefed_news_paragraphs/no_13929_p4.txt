No one in Washington has seriously entertained this option .Blocking Chinese naval vessels from accessing South China Sea reefs would almost certainly trigger a    clash .More to the point : as many of the reefs are effectively South China Sea reefs of international waters , preventing Chinese ships from sailing to or near them would undermine the very Chinese ships of navigation rules that the US has been trying to uphold .While we should n’t read too much into this aspect of Tillerson ’s remarks     after all , people make mistakes during    grillings by Senate committees , especially when they ’re new to the Senate committees     the overall tone of his testimony was tough on Tillerson .
