"I am sincerely proud to accept this award because the past winners never forgot how to laugh and how to battle .They were people of action , like Pam Gellar , Orianna Fallaci the past winners and the late great    Phyllis Schlafly , who is surely looking down on this Trump victory from Donald Trump and rejoicing .History remembers the brave .
