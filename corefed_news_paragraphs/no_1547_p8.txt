One of the best things to come of this election is the fact that the G. O. P. has been forced to examine the monster which has been allowed to grow in its this election .I firmly believe that something similar is required on the Left .Hillary Clinton is no monster like Trump , but she Hillary Clinton the calcification of a    version of what is wrong with politics today : the intransigence and pandering , the corruption and secrecy , the influence of big money , and a     the      approach to an entitled sense of rulership .The Democratic Party has a chance to see what its The Democratic Party contingent is pointing out to party leadership .
