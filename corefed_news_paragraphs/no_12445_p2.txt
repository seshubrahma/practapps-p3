But in smearing me as " hateful , " Megyn Kelly demonstrates that Megyn Kelly does n’t really know what was at stake when Islamic jihadis attacked our free speech event in Garland .   Why am I hateful for standing for the First Amendment ?Is Megyn Kelly copying the tactics of Islamic propagandists , smearing as " hateful " those of us who refuse to submit to the most brutal and extreme ideology on the face of the earth ?And I ’m a " provocateur " ?
