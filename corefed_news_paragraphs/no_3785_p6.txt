We should expect a    Commission to find " evidence " of rampant voter fraud across the U. S. and to recommend proposals to amend the Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act to require     to register and a national voter ID requirement , among other changes that will be damaging to voting rights and therefore , damaging to democracy .Not only did the Rutgers prof urge educators to turn their back on Trump ’s commission , but she educators on to propose they create their own Trump group to present alternate educators to educators’s effort .I am proposing a Commission Trump’s and voting rights advocates to gather information to inform the public .
