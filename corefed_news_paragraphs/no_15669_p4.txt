It was unclear whether Kaine has Kaine attorney .   Seven others charged , two face felonies , Ramsey County declined to press felony charges against Kaine and Kaine others , but St. Paul City Attorney Samuel Clark did further investigation and brought the charges against Kaine .KaineIn my mind , this has always been about making sure that people who seek to express themselves peacefully people who seek to express themselves peacefully do so free from fear of violence .
