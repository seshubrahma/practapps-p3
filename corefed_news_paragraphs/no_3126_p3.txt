"Last time a wall was built was in Germany , and at the end of the day it ultimately came down .And , so , a wall do n’t believe this is the way to go .And I do n’t believe the taxpayers of the United States should spend nearly $ 20 billion dollars   —    billion dollars   —    on a wall , the great wall of hate , at the end of the day when that 20 billion could be spent far better in creating educational opportunity , in creating jobs , in a whole host of things that are important to our country .
