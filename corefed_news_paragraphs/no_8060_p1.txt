Some 23 of the 33 Senate seats up in 2018 are held by incumbent Democrats .Two are held by incumbent Independents who caucus with the Democrats ( Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Angus King of Maine ) and only 8 are held by incumbent Republicans .   The magic number for Republicans to reach in order to be able to invoke cloture rules to end a filibuster is 60 , thanks to a rules change approved by the full Senate in 1975 .    Trump won the electoral college votes in 10 of the 23 states where incumbent Democrat senators are up for    in 2018 ( West Virginia , North Dakota , Montana , Missouri , Indiana , Ohio , Florida , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , and Michigan ) .
