I wo nâ€™t say anything about modern slavery involving a lot of child sex trafficking , which is pizza for another day .The real reason is that slavery in America is used to control American politics and continue to drive a wedge between the races , for the political and financial advantage of a small group of    progressive elites .Although there have been divisions within leadership of the black community since the slaves were freed , modern race relations can be traced back to the sixties .Much of America changed in that era .
