WASHINGTON   â€”    Stephen K. Bannon has great admiration for a provocative but disputed theory of history that argues that the United States is nearing a crisis that could be just as disruptive and catastrophic as the most seminal global turning points of the last 250 years .This prophecy , which is laid out in a 1997 book , " The Fourth Turning , " by two amateur historians , makes the case that world events unfold in predictable cycles of roughly 80 years each that can be divided into four chapters , or turnings : growth , maturation , entropy and destruction .
