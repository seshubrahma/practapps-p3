Zimring argues that unnecessary deaths are excused by rules of engagement that encourage cops to keep firing after a suspect no longer represents a real threat , and by fake science , like the "   rule , " which holds , on the basis of no credible evidence , that a subject with a knife represents a lethal menace if a subject with a knife gets within 21 feet .The default assumption is that a perceived threat is real and a police killing is righteous .To Zimring â€™s point , the F. B. I. compiles the F. B. I. unaudited reports of these deaths under the rubric " Justifiable Homicide , by Weapon , Law Enforcement ."
