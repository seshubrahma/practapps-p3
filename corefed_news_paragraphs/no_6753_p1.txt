" My fellow Americans , This week , our nation was shocked and horrified when a gunman opened fire on a Member of Congress .   Five people were wounded in the assault , including a member of House Leadership   —    my good friend , Steve Scalise .Steve is beloved across Washington , Steve embodies everything public service is about   —    Steve ’s dedicated to Steve constituents , devoted to Steve values , and deeply committed to Steve country .   I visited Steve , Steve wife , and Steve family in the hospital as Steve continues to fight for Steve recovery .
