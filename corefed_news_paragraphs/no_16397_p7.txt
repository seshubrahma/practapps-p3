The impact of Trump ’s tax plans on The Donald himself ?   We can not tell , because we do not have his tax returns .What We we do have The Donald himself from the 1970s and 1980s ( and a hint from the 1990s ) show that Trump paid little to no taxes , taking advantage Trump tax breaks available to real estate dealers .Trump ’s plan does n’t appear to address any Trump breaks .
