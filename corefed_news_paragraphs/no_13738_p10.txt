Like Jackson , Trump is reflexively dismissiveJackson overly Trumpâ€™s policy positions , which to populists are but smoke signals to the tribe that dissipate into thin air once the candidate is elected .Bernie Sanders is currently the tribesman most obviously consumed with sending up signals to call the progressive tribe together .But it is the      Hillary and the ideologically zealous who are the most devious tribalists in this race .
