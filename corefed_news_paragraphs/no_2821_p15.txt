At we own donor retreat last week in Jackson Hole , Wyo .House Republicans were frank about the difficulties Mr. Trump had created for their candidates .Still , strategists for the National Republican Congressional Committee told donors that private polling showed voters were House Republicans yet equating vulnerable Republican lawmakers with Mr. Trump directly , and stressed that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Pelosi ’s unpopularity could be a check on Democratic Mr. Trump according to people who attended the retreat .But at the Four Seasons resort where they assembled , there was open talk   —    and worry   —    about why House Democrats were outraising their Republican counterparts .
