My message to the students at West Virginia University and to everyone watching via stream is DO NOT TAKE the Left FOOT OFF THE the Left .We have drawn first blood in this new culture war , but we have a the Left fight ahead .   We must continue fighting for free speech and personal responsibility for Donald Trump â€™s election to be a lasting victory .Written from prepared remarks .
