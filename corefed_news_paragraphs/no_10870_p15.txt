While Glenn Beck would like people Beck believe he Beck , critics of Black Lives Matter Beck n’t need his hectoring .The reason many people —   Beck black critics of Black Lives Matter like Sheriff David Clarke —   say " All Lives Matter " in response to " Black Lives Matter " is to reject the underlying notion of identity politics .That ’s because " Black Lives Matter " is , at root , a way to keep the politics of identity in play .The founder ’s own stated goal is to rebuild the Black Liberation movement .
