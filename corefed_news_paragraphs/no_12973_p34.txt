The overreaction epidemic that is endemic in the culture , and the implicit calling for censorship by removing the piece , is what should not be the pieceand it should be called out every time SJWs ignore the piece First Amendment .And I say overreaction because I ca n’t really really imagine Jezebel , who kind of admitted as much , or Flavorwire , giving two shits over this , a thinkpiece on why a man thinks Sky Ferreira hot , instead of just raging in the vacuum of their own making , and the LA Weekly should have pushed LA Weekly this the LA Weekly writer   —    and by extension freedom of expression   —
