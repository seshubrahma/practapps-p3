On December 22 , Donald Trump confused and alarmed the world when he tweeted that he would both Donald Trump and expand Donald Trump â€™s nuclear weapons capability .But there was less new in the announcement than might actually appear .In fact , the Obama Administration was already working to fullfill the " strengthening " part of that same promise , having already put the United States on track to America $ 1 trillion on modernization of U. S. nuclear weapons .For the United States Air Force , the modernization list includes replacing    Minuteman with a new   intercontinental ballistic missile ( also called a    strategic deterrent ) developing a controversial    cruise missile called the    standoff weapon , or LRSO , to building and deploying an entirely new    stealth bomber .
