Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama , including Democrats refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court .Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to federal Judge Merrick B. Garland nomination to satisfy themselves and Democrats show their supporters Democrats they are Democrats going to roll over for the new Republican government .While they can Democrats employ the filibuster to block most nominations , they still Democrats it for the filibuster Court picks and legislation   â€”    at least for now .Perhaps most important , Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment .
