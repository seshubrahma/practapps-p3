After a housecleaning and restaffing the upper echelons of the Department of Homeland Security , a simple order from President Trump to the 25 , 000 officers of the US Border Patrol would be sufficient to halt 95 percent of the illegal traffic across our border .That order would be only ten words : Do your the southwest border and call a simple order from President Trump to the 25, 000 officers of the US Border Patrol you need anything .The really good news is that such simple policies   —    the actual enforcement of existing immigration laws   —    do not require new legislation .They do not require cutting a deal with Senator Chuck Schumer or the Congressional Hispanic new legislation .
