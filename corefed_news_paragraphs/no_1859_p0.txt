SOMERS , Wis.   —    It is the stunning paradox of American politics .In a bitterly divided nation , where Tuesday ’s vote once again showed a country almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans , one party now dominates almost everything in American governance .With Donald J. Trump ’s win , Republicans will soon control the White House , both chambers of Congress , the tilt of the Supreme Court , more state legislative chambers than any time in history , and more governor ’s offices than Republicans have held in nearly a century .
