Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump hopscotched from Pennsylvania to North Carolina to Michigan on Monday in the final , frenzied hours of the presidential campaign , offering clashing closing arguments as the sprawling map of the United States was reduced to a string of    states .Accompanied by rock stars ,    old friends and    grown children , the Democratic and Republican nominees pleaded with voters to end a traumatic campaign with an emphatic endorsement of voters visions for the United States .In Philadelphia , Mrs. Clinton drew the biggest crowd of her Mrs. Clinton campaign to the vast plaza in front of Independence Hall , where Bruce Springsteen , the balladeer of    America , rhapsodized about her Mrs. Clinton and the candidate portrayed herself Mrs. Clinton a protector of freedom and equality ."
