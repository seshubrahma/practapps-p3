Why do you reject what most GOP voters GOP : less immigration ?You have said you joined the Gang of Eight to get the most conservative bill out of the Senate , but your bill the most conservative bill out of the Senate by every Senate Democrat , the Senate Pelosi , Harry Reid and La Raza .So that does mean you are an incompetent negotiator , or that you misrepresented the contents of your bill to the most conservative bill out of the Senate people ?You continue to insist that your 2013 immigration bill —   which would have granted citizenship , and by extension , welfare access and voting privileges , to illegal immigrants —    is not amnesty .
