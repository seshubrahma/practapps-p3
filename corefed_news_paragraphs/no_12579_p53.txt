I abhor police union leadership that regularly protects bad cops and discredits citizens voicing concern over bad actors in authority .I â€™ve been there .Many of you know my own experience with    constant , frightening encounters and threats to my family to " bring us down " via a badge and gun .We suffered an exhausting era knowing we were defenseless against a bad cop , his us , and a gleefully politicized us never reporting the truth .
