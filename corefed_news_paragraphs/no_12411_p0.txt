Sam Clovis ,    of Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign , reviewed Sunday night ’s second presidential debate on Monday morning ’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow .[ " I thought we did really well , " said Sam Clovis ."I thought the first 15 minutes or so were pretty much as predicted , a little rocky , to be honest , but I think from that moment on , I do n’t think there ’s any question who was in charge , and I think charge really had Mrs. Clinton on the defensive for most of the rest of the debate .
