"   The ballot in California this year alone was four pages long .To put this in perspective , if you mark 2006 for the start of Colin Kaepernick â€™s legal voting lifetime and factor in an average of three pages of ballots a year , Colin Kaepernick missed at least five elections and at least 15 pages worth of referendums , propositions , and ballot initiatives that could have effected issues Colin Kaepernick claims to care about .For anyone who views those pesky California ballots , referendums , and initiatives as inconsequential , remember that California voters once removed a sitting governor at the ballot box .
