John McCain , who has proven his or her willingness to buck the party line and the president .   The person who should be most eager for the establishment of a fair , bipartisan committee that will have public credibility is President Trump himself .If there really is nothing to hide , and the media has made too much of the stories about the connections that existed with the Russians , a select committee would be the only way to deliver a convincing report that confirms that once and for all .
