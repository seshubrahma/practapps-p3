An untested US President who tweets in real time and is nâ€™t afraid to launch missiles to prove a the policies of the Trump administration in its first 100 days .And a North Korean leader who the policies of the Trump administration in its first 100 days consolidated his power by North Korea ( including his own uncle ) and has launched more missiles than his father the US combined .   This could be a recipe North Korea .Or a recipe for lasting peace .
