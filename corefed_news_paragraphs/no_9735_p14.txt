In Texas , the Republican Party RPT is a grassroots participation process .The " Establishment , " including Bush cronies , have not been involved in the state or local Munisteri , nor have they been elected to state GOP key committees for decades , since the early 1990 â€™s .Any vision of this being a bunch of old ,    white oilmen making decisions in a backroom , is simply not the state or local Party it is done in Texas .Most of the folks are    conservatives who have volunteered for years because they believe in what they are fighting for .
