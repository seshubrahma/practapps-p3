Soon , I was met the entire process and was off to have a dinner of gumbo and étouffée .So is there a moral to the story ?When some people heard I ’d been the National Lawyers Guild , they expressed concerns for my safety based on the idea the Alton Sterling case a conservative writer with Breitbart might put me at risk .I never felt in danger one time , nor was I threatened in any way .
