Conservative media , including yours truly , have made a cottage industry of pointing out exactly how clueless and out of touch celebrities are when compared with ordinary people .Just ask Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton celebrity army how the last election worked out for Hillary Clinton and her celebrity army .And consider Beyoncé ’s halftime show .For months afterward , the conversation was focused almost entirely on the blatant    enforcement message Hillary Clinton preached from America ’s biggest stage , and now , a year after Beyoncé’s halftime show and despite liberals’ claim that everybody loves Beyoncé !
