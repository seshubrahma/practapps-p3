The Vietnam War provoked impassioned debate back home , but Americans are hardly discussing the war in Afghanistan .The Vietnam War ’s completely off the radar .The Vietnam War ’s high time we talk about the war in Afghanistan , and especially with the Trump administration considering a new policy that would escalate US military involvement .Escalation would be a mistake , and it would Escalation prolong a conflict that ca n’t be won .
