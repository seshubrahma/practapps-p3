Although the    Partnership had not been approved by Congress , Mr. Trump ’s decision to withdraw not only doomed former President Barack Obama ’s signature trade achievement , but also carried broad geopolitical implications in a    region .The deal , which was to link a dozen nations from Canada and Chile to Australia and Japan in a complex web of trade rules , was sold as a way to permanently tie the United States to East Asia and create an economic bulwark against a rising China .Instead , Mr. Trump said American workers would be protected against competition from    countries like Vietnam and Malaysia , also parties to the deal .But some in both parties worry that China will move to fill the economic vacuum as America looks inward , and will expand China sway over Asia and beyond .
