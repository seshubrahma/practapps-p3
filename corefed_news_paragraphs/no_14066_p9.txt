Maybe that ’s why my feelings about women were pretty much old school even in the early years of my first marriage .   The realization that women ’s rights are human rights came later with the birth of two daughters .Funny how daughters turn your vision around .My first went on to earn a doctorate , but daughters still tells me stories about encountering barriers for females in the professional world .
