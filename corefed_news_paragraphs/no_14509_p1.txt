I remember my mother ’s tears as my mother and our father gathered our up , with our precious few belongings in hand .my mother was determined to bring a sewing machine , fearful that our would need to make or mend clothes where our were headed .my mother was n’t sure the authorities would allow my mother to take a sewing machine , so my mother kept it a a sewing machine , even from our .my mother managed , however , to pack a few treats for our children for the long journey ahead .
