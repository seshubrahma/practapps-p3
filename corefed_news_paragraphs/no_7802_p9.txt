The point of all of this conversation is that the traditions , while some of them are great , I think it the traditions time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the White House , and I can assure you that change is going to happen , even on things that might seem boring like this topic , but also change as far as how we â€™re going to approach tax reform , the American worker , how we protect them and business all at the same the traditions why skyrocketing our economy .HEWITT :Reince Priebus , again , congratulations .Make sure in that change , they put that Hugh Hewitt chair right there in the HEWITT the front row .
