Thus , even if Trump were to overrule the objections of the FBI and the Justice Department , he could not force a grand jury to return an indictment Trump The Trial Court ,The last legal obstacles to such a prosecution would come from the trial court     from an independent ,    federal judge who could dismiss any indictment that he found to be legally insufficient , and from a jury Trump 12 of Clinton ’s peers , which would have to be unanimous in its belief that she was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict her of Clinton crime .Although it is all but   Clinton to fathom a prosecution getting even this far because of the obstacles discussed above , these last two checks are perhaps the most significant     and the reason why even the most politically motivated government prosecutors would almost certainly balk before bringing such a case .Indeed , federal district judges may have no more important single function than ensuring that criminal cases are brought only when there is sufficient evidence to sustain an indictment     and the guarantee of criminal trial by jury has long been viewed as one of the most fundamental of all of the Constitution ’s protections of individual rights .
