It was thanks to Kim , who taught me how to stand upright on the ice , that I did n’t break my neck .And when I had the chance to spend the night at my American friends’ houses , it was big time for me .   The school wanted us to learn about Russian culture and traditions and to feel integrated despite the many barriers .Russian language teachers taught us Russian to make papier maché Matryoshka dolls and bake delicious blinis       pancakes .
