"Lady Elizabeth party for the Rolling Stones ended with the police showing up as guests were drunkenly throwing unopened bottles of Dom Pérignon into the Thames , but generally Lady Elizabeth ’s events are known for their calm elegance and thoughtful touches .At a    dinner for Lady Elizabeth’s events people last month hosted by royalty at the cavernous , drafty Victoria   Albert Museum , Lady Elizabeth marched over to " my little Indian caftan man on Lady Elizabeth’s Road " and bought a load of white pashminas to drape on each chair .She hid    bottles underneath cushions .
