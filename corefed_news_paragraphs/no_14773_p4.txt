The story     of a possible connection between computer servers     is a strange tale because there are no specific allegations of wrongdoing and only vague technical evidence .      Internet data shows that last summer , a computer server owned by    Alfa Bank repeatedly looked up the contact information for a computer server being used by the Trump Organization     far more than other companies did , representing 80 % of all lookups to the Trump server .    It â€™s unclear if the Trump Organization server itself did anything in return .the Trump Organization     servers actually communicated .
