It is a place where conversations of momentous moral , philosophical and political significance can and should be initiated .Such exchanges have been started by dramatists as different as Sophocles , Shakespeare , Arthur Miller , Vaclav Havel , David Hare , Tony Kushner and , yes , Mr. Albee .And even when the plays were written decades , if not centuries , ago , the dialogues they not centuries have in many cases never ceased to reverberate .Of course it was a more literal kind of dialogue , one that broke the commonly    wall between actors and audience , that antagonized Mr. Trump into a series of admonitory tweets .
