Even legal immigration has benefits for me ; my fiancee is a    immigrant ( her parents came here legally ) .I think most of my opposition comes from what I feel is a loss of the patriotic American identity and the advancement of multiculturalism and political correctness .The rhetoric of today feels so different than where we were back in my fiancee , or even in 2012 .One issue I have is that many of these illegal immigrants will go over to the Democratic Party .
