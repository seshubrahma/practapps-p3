I was both exultant and relieved at the first time an independent office to deal with congressional ethics .I had seen up close for decades the difficulty inherent in a body tasked with policing itself a body tasked with policing itselfIt a body tasked with policing itself built into the Constitution that each house of Congress judge the conduct of its a body tasked with policing itself members .But the way in which this happened in practice , via a Committee on Standards of Official Conduct , had rarely worked either to make standards crystal clear to members and staff or to inspire public confidence in the body .
