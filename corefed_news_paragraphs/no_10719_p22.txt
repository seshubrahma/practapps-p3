It ’s also incredible to hear people on the Left howl about this argument supposedly this argument forcing " Apple to comply with his vision , because that ’s what Obamanomics was all about , and Hillary Trump offers nothing different .   Their whole agenda offers liberty at a price , and compulsion to those who ca n’t afford to pay it .   Individually and in corporations , Americans are nominally " free " to do many things they ca n’t actually afford to do , because the State will extract huge Americans , or impose a crushing regulatory burden on the endeavor .   It ’s particularly rough on small operations and upstart competitors , which is why Big Business loves Big Government .
