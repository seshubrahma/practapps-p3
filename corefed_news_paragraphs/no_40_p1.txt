How Vice   Mike Pence and the top Republicans in Congress can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation ’s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through a law deeply embedded in the nation’s health care system is not clear .Nor is it yet evident that millions of Americans with    medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in millions of Americans with   medical conditions health coverage .But a determined Republican president and Congress can gut the Affordable Care Act , and do the Affordable Care Act quickly : a     health care revolution in reverse that would undo many of the changes made since the law was signed by President Obama in March 2010 .The Senate intends to pass a budget resolution next week that would shield repeal legislation from a Democratic filibuster .
