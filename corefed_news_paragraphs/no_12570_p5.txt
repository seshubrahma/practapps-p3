Federal law in 18 U. S. C. § 922 ( g)(4 ) is one of these    laws , providing that no one " who has been committed to a mental institution " can own firearms .In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed an    law advancing Second Amendment rights , including 18 U. S. C. § 925 ( c ) which empowers the Justice Department to restore gun rights if the attorney general finds a particular person to be safe and sane .But Congress stopped funding that program in 1992 , canceling out that    protection for America ’s 90 million gun owners .    So    2007 Congress passed Congress new law empowering states to set up their own review process to restore gun rights .
