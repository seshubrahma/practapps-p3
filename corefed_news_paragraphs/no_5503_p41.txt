What would be the policy upshot of such a chat ?   As an answer , here ’s one scenario that we ’ve seen this case : The career legal staff tells the thin layer of political appointees at an agency that the plaintiffs have a strong case , and so it ’s best to settle .   the EPA career staff for maybe a few    tweaks , give the plaintiffs what they want .   After all , the careerist could be saying the plaintiffs have a strong case the politicals , if you choose to fight , it could get really messy , and , in the plaintiffs , you the plaintiffs likely still lose .
