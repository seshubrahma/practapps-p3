Imagine if his original wishes for his inaugural parade had n’t Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors vetoed by the military and this speech were played back endlessly around Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors world as tanks and missile launchersrolled Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors downtown DC .President Trump this message with that of Obama ’s farewell address , framed as a call not to arms but to President Trump and Russia a President Trump of quiet strength , not preening brawn of optimism based on innovation and partnership , not economic conquest and military might .   the world is to say that I share what millions of others feel : this day is less inaugural speech than a    the end of a chapter , not the beginning of one .
