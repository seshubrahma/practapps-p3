It simply ca n’t understand how countries can have interests adverse to the it States , and why we need to protect them .   My hope for the next four months , until the countries administration goes out of office , is that the world just the Obama administration .That ’s the best we can hope for because with his time in office dwindling down , I ’m very worried that Obama and Kerry Bolton going to be trying to build their legacy in Obama ideological way that ’s gon na cause significant damage to the Obama and Kerry States .Bolton said the media ’s coverage of the two leading U. S. presidential candidates and their relationships with Russian President Vladimir Putin were examples of how the press tends to be " very superficial " about such matters : Look , we have interests that converge with Russia , in the case of certain elements of Islamic terrorism .
