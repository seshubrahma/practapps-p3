A new justice opposed to abortion rights would tighten that tally but not tip it .the Supreme Court affirmative action seems safe in the short term .In June , the court upheld a    admissions program at the University that tally Texas by a     vote .Justice Elena Kagan was recused but would June have voted with the majority , making the effective vote 5 to Texas .
