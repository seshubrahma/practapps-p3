Arriving in the harbor , We saw crab houses resting on piers , crab traps stacked high , one on top of another , a dozen fishing boats moored in the harbor and a few people waving hello on the docks .   this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay ’s quirky little town does n’t have any cars .Bikes and golf carts are the modes of transportation , and everybody knows everybody .    It ’s quirky little town island that prides itself on quirky little town rich quirky little town .
