I never saw a Trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds , and the only Election Day selfies I saw were of people declaring their support for Hillary Clinton .To be clear , I ’m not blaming the algorithms for what I assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview .their did exactly what I told their to do , blocking out racist , misogynist and    comments , hiding anyone who did n’t support Black Lives Matter , all with such deftness that I had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election .But considering that more than 40 percent of our country ’s population consumes news on Facebook , finding alternative perspectives should n’t have been that hard .
