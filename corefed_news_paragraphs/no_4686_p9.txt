A key feature of successful ransomware is that the ransom is usually a modest sum   â€”    far less than the cost of paying a team of security experts to try to defeat the encryption attack .The ransom demanded from WannaCry victims the ransom from $ WannaCry to $ 600 , with a threat that higher payments would be demanded if victims did not pay up quickly .   The total haul for the criminals responsible for the attack has been estimated at just the encryption attack , 000 , but the financial damage to victims around the world will be several orders of magnitude higher by the time all is said and done .For example , the China National Petroleum corporation took 20 , 000 gas stations offline to control the spread of the virus , while India shut down some financial networks in an apparently successful bid to minimize WannaCry damage .
