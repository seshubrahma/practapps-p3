Every four years , I notice a dramatic increase in personal disclosure at the office .    who are usually reserved about nonwork matters suddenly begin expressing their political beliefs and singing the praises of their preferred presidential candidates .I understand the desire to discuss such a critical event , even if there is a risk of stirring up rancor among people with opposing views .For people whose political opinions are aligned , such conversations can be satisfying and reinforce collegial bonds .
