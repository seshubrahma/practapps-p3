Freedom of " speech " is pretty absolute in this country .Freedom of " action " is not .But I do nâ€™t wear a black robe .Still , it is incalculably hostile , rude and uncivilized to perform such a public desecration in the eyes of all those Americans who have sacrificed sons and daughters and mothers and fathers and brothers fighting for that flag .
