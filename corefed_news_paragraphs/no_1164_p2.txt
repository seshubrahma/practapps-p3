â€”    for Judge Gorsuch .That leaves Republicans , who hold 52 seats in the Senate , five Democratic votes short of breaking any filibuster mounted by Democrats .If the Republicans do not have enough votes to break a filibuster , they the Republicans invoke the    nuclear option , allowing them the Republicans eliminate the a filibuster Supreme Court nominees and hold a floor vote .Judge Gorsuch could then be confirmed by a simple majority .
