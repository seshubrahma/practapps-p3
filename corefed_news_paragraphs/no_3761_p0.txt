As more and more details emerge concerning Friday ’s Ramadan attack on a busload of Christians on pilgrimage , the more it becomes evident that these 29 martyrs died solely because these 29 martyrs were Christians .[ Survivors of the attack said that the ten masked Islamic State militants did not merely open fire on the bus full of Christian pilgrims on the ten masked Islamic State militants way to the Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confesor , but that the victims were made to descend from the bus and asked one by one whether the victims were Christians before being shot by the assailants .   According to one of the chaplains of the group , Father Rashed , as each pilgrim came off the bus the victims were asked to renounce the victims Christian faith and profess belief in Islam , but all of the victims —   even the children —   refused .Each was killed in cold blood with a gunshot to the head or the throat .
