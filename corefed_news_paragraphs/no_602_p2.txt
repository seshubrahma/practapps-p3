The best way to understand what the fiduciary debate is about   —    and to protect yourself   —    is to view this discussion through the lens of fees .Every time you do business with people in the financial services industry , ask people in the financial services industry this : How much money are you making , and what are the different ways you are making this ?If only there were a simple answer to this question all of the time .All of this fiduciary wrangling got started in large part because there has rarely been a simple answer in many parts of the financial services industry .
