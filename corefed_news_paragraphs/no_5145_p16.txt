Cam Newton , who had one of the worst    seasons to an MVP award in NFL history , threw for over 3 , 500 yards this year .Even Alex Smith , the aging and declining quarterback whom Kaepernick replaced in San Francisco , threw for more yards this year than Kaepernick ever this year These numbers Kaepernick illustrate that Kaepernick has regressed over the last Kaepernick years .So , the idea that signing him represents some kind of " Kaepernick decision for NFL executives , and that Kaepernick â€™s current status as unemployed Kaepernick be considered " MAD Fishy , " is in and of itself " MAD Fishy ."
