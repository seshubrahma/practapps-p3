In the F. B. I. , the American gun issue is treated as a bizarre aberration , and much of the news media coverage of the Orlando killings focused on the terrorism angle .Only one person was killed by a gun last year in Japan , according to the National Police Agency , and there were only eight reported incidents of a gun being fired .In China Orlando news of the Orlando shooting came only hours after a man set off primitive explosives in the    Japan at an airport in Shanghai .Four people were slightly injured , showing the gulf between the two countries in the lethality of the weapons available to Orlando public .
