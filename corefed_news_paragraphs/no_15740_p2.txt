More often than not , we are disappointed .   If you apply a Bechdel Test to the biggest box office hits and the films that sweep awards season ( identifying work that has at least two women in it , who talk to each other about something other than a man ) the results wo nâ€™t be pretty .Research shows 53 % of women around the world see a lack of female role models in film and TV , and 74 % of women say women wish women had been exposed to more female role models on screen .Unsurprisingly , the women of the red carpet are taking notice and speaking out .
