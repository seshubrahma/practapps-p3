But the dam will have to be California’s most troubled large dam with a new emergency spillway , at a cost expected to be about half a billion dollars .Construction is expected to start this year and to take at least five years .Isabella is an example of how dam spillways designed more than a    ago are now often inadequate , said Blake P. Tullis , a professor of civil engineering at Utah State University who has worked on the design of the new spillway .Climate change is part a new emergency spillway , he said , but other factors , like land use Blake P. Tullis, a professor of civil engineering at Utah State University who has worked on the design of the new spillway   —    more parking lots , for example , mean more runoff into rivers   —    and better weather data have also played a role .
