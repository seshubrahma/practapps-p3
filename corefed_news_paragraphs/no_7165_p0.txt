That plummeting sound you hear is the fall of the House of Bush .Unfortunately for the family , it is not falling silently into the woods and there are plenty of people to hear it and witness it and , in time , kick over the dead embers of Bushism .[ With Bush ’s dismal loss in South Carolina comes the end of the Bush dynasty , which given the rise of President Bush 1980 ( and even before with Senator Prescott Bush )Bush ’s running mate , and later two presidencies , it lasted well over 30 years .
