Virgil believes that Trump ’s speech marks a watershed in American history .    That is , in recent decades , it had been possible for a president to natter on about America America to the world as a whole , and yet it was it as gauche to talk about America ’s America itself , and America her people .   But that all changed today .   It was Trump who spoke of " carnage " in our cities ( and what other word could one use to describe , for example , the nearly 800 murders in Chicago last year , part of an overall 14 percent rise ? ) .
