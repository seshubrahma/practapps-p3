"I find Donald Trump difficulty respecting someone who lacks respect for anything other than his own ’brand’ ( except when Donald Trump comes to foreign strongmen for whom he seems to have a strange Donald Trump ) .The ’brand’ of the president is the USA , and our country should not be treated like some failed casino , failed airline , or fraudulent university ."
