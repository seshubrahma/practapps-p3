Is the tap the reason you cast yourself in the dance ?That was a big factor .I always really loved tap as an art form , and in this piece of music there was one section that is highly percussive and intricate .I felt the only way to express that through movement was using    techniques , and for me it was less about the sounds we were making and more about the physicality of the movement .
