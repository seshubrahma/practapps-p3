It is , still , a reasonable question whether any of that will change , even as Bill O’Reilly faces the biggest challenge of Bill O’Reilly long career to Bill O’Reilly status as big dog : a burgeoning advertiser boycott of Bill O’Reilly show in reaction to the report in The New York Times that Bill O’Reillyand Bill O’Reilly employers have shelled out $ 13 million to five different women to settle allegations of sexual harassment or verbal abuse against Bill O’Reilly .After all , O’Reilly is still the most potent audience draw in cable news , with an average of almost 4 million viewers a night .That has     until now     resulted in the biggest pile of advertiser cash any cable news host has generated , well over $ 100 million every year .
