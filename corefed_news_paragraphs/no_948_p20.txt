But , even though school was closed , elementary students in Petersham , Mass. a town of 1 , 200 in the central part of the state , did not exactly have a snow day .Instead , they had homework   —    books , activities , worksheets and even a science experiment   —    intended to allow them to make up the day of school without being there , and , thus , to prevent the school from having to add a day at the end of the year .The idea emerged after they winter of 2015 , when the district had 10 snow days .Tari Thomas , the superintendent school for a consolidated school district that includes Petersham , said the district experimented with sending older students home with online coursework to complete on laptops ( although that was not the case on Tuesday , because the students had already used up the five days of online learning the district allowed for the year ) .
