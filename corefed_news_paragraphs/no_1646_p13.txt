To Gavin MacFadyen , a WikiLeaks supporter who runs the Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of London , the question for Mr. Assange is It where the material comes from , but whether it is true and in the public interest .He noted that intelligence services had a long history of using news the material to plant stories , and that Western news Mr. Assange often published " material that comes from the C. I. A. uncritically ."Recent events , though , have left some transparency advocates wondering if WikiLeaks has lost its way .
