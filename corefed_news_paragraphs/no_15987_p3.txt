However , after weeks of rancorous argument , and with days to go until voting on June 23 , Britain is wrestling with a disturbing prospect : if voters elect to leave , it will be xenophobia , as much as rational facts and forecasts , that will have carried the day .   If I had to identify a point at which the tone of debate started to deteriorate , it was when former London Mayor Boris Johnson , de facto leader of the Leave campaign , compared the European Union ’s ambitions to those of Hitler , the continent ’s ultimate bogeyman .   The inflammatory analogy signaled a shift in tactics from those in favor of Brexit that has since come to dictate their campaign .After the first few weeks of canvassing , Johnson ’s " Leavers " were lagging behind .
