The rest of us were supposedly paying an exorbitant cost for this " " through taxes and higher insurance premiums .Imposing a government regulatory scheme that forces everyone to buy insurance makes sense to many    Americans , at least in theory .The Obama White House President Obama    as a uninsured people hidden tax " of at least $ 1 , 000 a year on every American insurance customer .How else could we possibly alleviate the    crisis , without tossing uninsured sick people onto the streets ?
