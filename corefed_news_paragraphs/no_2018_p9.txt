The backlash , in a state with one of the South â€™s most vigorous liberal contingents , was perhaps inevitable .In 2013 , progressives began a sustained series of protests in Raleigh , the state capital , called " Moral Mondays " that galvanized opposition and drew news media attention with numerous acts of civil disobedience .Mr. McCrory , who often seemed caught in the middle of these two forces , suffered his biggest blow beginning in March , when he signed the law his known as House Bill 2 , or H. B. 2 .The law nullified local the law commonly known as House Bill 2, or H. B. 2 establishing    protections for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people , and it required people in publicly the law commonly known as House Bill 2, or H. B. 2 buildings to use restrooms that corresponded with the gender listed on their birth certificates , which local government ordinances establishing   protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people saw as an attack on transgender rights .
