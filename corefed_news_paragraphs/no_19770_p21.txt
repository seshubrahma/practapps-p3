I feel some my support sadness stating these thoughts .Liberal democracy is , in theory , a very appealing system .Yet looking at the economic ruins of Greece and the rest of Southern Europe , the    in the US , and the lack of sensible ideas being put forward by the political center , I no longer believe that it is any different from Marxism Leninism   —    a system doomed by its own optimism in human nature and it is any different from Marxism Leninism  —    too rigid for    success .
