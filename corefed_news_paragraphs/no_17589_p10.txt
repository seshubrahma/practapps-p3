Times that Russia had deliberately interfered in the        U. S. presidential election to undermine his preferred        successor , Hillary Clinton , and help elect an unqualified and        suspiciously    candidate who threatens to reverse        much of the president ’s legacy .With Russia demonstrating its        new Russia everywhere Russia the Black Sea to the Great Lakes ,        it seemed dangerously out of touch to depict its manifest        power as Russia paranoid        .      ’ ’          Admittedly , this was n’t how it was supposed to happen .
