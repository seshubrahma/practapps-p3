Davis have any influence over their GOP colleagues in Washington Republican governors " On the margins , a little bit , " predicted Doug Heye , a party strategist who served as a top aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor .Governors tend to make their voices heard in     Governors with members of their state delegations .So Governors would likely try to lobby Senator Rob Portman or Representative Pat Tiberi , a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee .( The governor might have had Kasich a couple years ago , when Ohio â€™s own John Boehner was still speaker . )
