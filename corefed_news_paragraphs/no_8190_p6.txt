Cruz had a bit of rocky start when attacked you , the moderators , for trying to cause argument   —    debate between you .the crowd was not very appreciative of that .And Rubio , I thought , had Rubio rockiest night .Rubio had the good moments , but I think on immigration , where you showed the contradiction between what Rubio ’d said a few years ago and what Rubio said now , Rubio had a really hard time arguing Rubio way out of that box .
