We have 30 or so on the Congressman Rep. Brooks .At the time of the shooting I would guess somewhere Congressman the neighborhood of 20 to 25 , but it is hard to tell because it is early in the morning and we do have work early in the morning us and sometimes after people have gotten their at a shooting at a GOP baseball team practice during batting practice , they then leave rather than continue to field or try to get a second round of batting practice .So some of the congressmen had started to leave us we still had , I the morning ,    at an absolute minimum , maybe people high as   .And of course people had another dozen or so staff members who help with our team .
