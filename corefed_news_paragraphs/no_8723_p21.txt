Recalling his FDR memories of the previous FDR , Roosevelt demurred he did n’t want to invest Roosevelt much in cannon fodder .   It was better , he thought , to keep relatively Roosevelt men on the homefront , building war machines with their hands , as opposed to relatively more men on the homefront into battle , feeding the war machine with their bodies .   In lieu relatively more men on the homefront all that infantry , the President suggested , why do Roosevelt settle for just 60 infantry divisions —   and then build 50 , 000 airplanes ?   Why do n’t we win the war with airpower ?
