Lefty celebrities have long been preaching to the choir , but they are increasingly galvanizing the other Lefty celebrities when their chatter is rerouted into an Lefty celebrities conservative echo chamber .A study last year by the Bowling Green State University professors David Jackson and Melissa Miller found that celebrity political statements were highly polarizing to a sample set of Ohio voters , and that no celebrity   —    not Trace Adkins , not Ted Nugent , not even Oprah   —    was likely to inspire net positive votes for his or her candidate of choice .These Melissa Miller aggregators make sure that any leftist celebrity ’s political reach will be neutralized by a backlash from people who do n’t idolize and agree with them .
