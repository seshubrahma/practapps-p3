She added , " When the intelligence community would respond to a request to identify an American , that would come back only to the person requested it , brought back to them directly .To me Those people putting these stories out or to whoever might have requested it , on occasion , it this is important .It was not then typically broadly disseminated throughout the nation security community or the government .So the notion that some people are trying to suggest that by asking for the identity of an American person , that is the same as leaking it is completely false .
