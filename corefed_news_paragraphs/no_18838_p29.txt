I do n’t expect a President President Trump to instantly convert people , but President Trump someone in the Oval Office giving decidedly    speeches and announcements , I think that would change the discourse , do n’t you ? ""As for mechanisms , I think Trump would likely do what he can to protect free speech President Trump That could include vetoing President Trump , instituting laws preventing social media posts from costing people jobs ( I never post on Facebook for fear of even a neutral post being interpreted negatively ) overruling university speech policies .I ’m unsure of whether or not Trump would pursue these policies , but I do n’t think President Trump ’d oppose them if a Congressional rep or Senator proposed President Trump and got these policies votes .
