What I found over a long weekend was a borough that ’s not merely deserving of exploration in a long weekend own right , but one that has also become downright touristworthy .Longstanding , inevitable comparisons to Manhattan have not only become unnecessary , Longstanding, inevitable comparisons to Manhattan’re not really even relevant anymore : Brooklyn is a bona fide cultural capital , with    art , performances , street fairs and museums .And the depth and quality of its food and drink options are impressive and rewarding .
