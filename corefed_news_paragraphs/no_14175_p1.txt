The Department of Homeland Security was left making a legal analysis on the order after President Donald Trump signed a legal analysis .A Border Patrol agent , confronted with arriving refugees , referred questions only to the President himself , according to court filings .Saturday night , a federal judge granted an emergency stay for citizens of the affected countries who had already arrived in the US and those who are in transit and hold valid visas , ruling valid visas can legally enter the US .Trump ’s unilateral moves , which have drawn the ire of human rights groups and prompted protests at US airports , reflect the President ’s desire to quickly make good on the President’s campaign promises .
