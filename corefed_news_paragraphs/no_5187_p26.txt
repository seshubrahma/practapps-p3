A long time ago when labor unions had a real purpose , Democrats fought for things we value now , like a 40 hour workweek and ending child labor .As you might guess , I would n’t mind child labor coming back because I do n’t like kids much , but even I know GENERALLYwe are better off with kids going to school .Liberals have lots of theories for why working class whites abandoned them .
