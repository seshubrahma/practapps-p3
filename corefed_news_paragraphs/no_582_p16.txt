The Obama team saw that approach as appealing in theory , but too Obama in practice so many Americans had become accustomed to receiving health insurance through their employer that it did nâ€™t seem feasible to make a wholesale health insurance to a new and , perhaps , more efficient system .In other words , decisions that lawmakers made decades or even a century ago have essentially locked us into ways of doing things , as the cost of changing looms more heavily than the potential benefits of trying something different .And people who have much to fear from a change tend to be louder than those who have something to gain , a central dynamic that tilts policy in the United States toward    conservatism .All of this is frustrating for anyone who believes that the existing system , whether for corporate taxes or health care , is broken and needs radical reform .
