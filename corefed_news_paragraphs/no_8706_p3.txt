Trump gets wiped out , Ted makes it Trump , I do n’t know if he Ted beat her Trump not , but at least we the GOP’s a fighting chance .Yet Trump Trump the standard bearer .It Trump not about 2016 , it Trump about losing the heart and soul of the conservative movement .I ’m not going to stand behind a guy that gets David Duke ’s support .
