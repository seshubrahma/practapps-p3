The other anecdote is Cruz â€™s last visit Cruz Southern California , just a couple of weeks ago .Two rallies , one in Orange County and one San Diego County , were announced at 9 p. m. and by 8 a. m. the following morning both had sold out , with thousands of attendees .Yet these rallies had only been advertised internally , to Two rallies, one in Orange County and one San Diego County and local party activists .By contrast , Trump has had no organization to speak of in California , only hiring a staff person a couple of weeks ago .
