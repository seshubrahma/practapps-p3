[ Read a review ] 3 .‘ MOONLIGHT’ Bathed in blue and anguish , Mr. Jenkins ’s elegiac film traces a single life across three chapters .There ’s much to love and admire about this haunting movie , including its lapidary visuals .Here , every moment   —    light flooding a darkened room , an oceanic baptism and a halo of shampoo crowning the head of an abandoned child   —    speaks more eloquently than most of an abandoned child   dialogue , though the words are very fine , too .
