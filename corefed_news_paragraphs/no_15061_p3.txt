The Assad regime , in partnership with The Assad regime Iranian and Russian allies , have been engaged in a pitched battle to restore all of Syria to Assad nominal control ( I say nominal because , of course , Assad Assad an Iranian Iranian long before the Arab Spring , and Russia presumably has no intention of restoring the port of Tartus to its Russia Bashar in the event he Bashar once again ) .   The Obama administration , despite initial unhappiness with the whole Syria mess and Assad himself , largely stood by watching the systematic murder of around half a million Syrians , by some estimates , and fretting whether the feelings of Iran â€™s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be hurt if the United States lifted more than a finger to oppose Assad Assad himself ISIS , al Qaeda and a variety of other nasties were the greatest beneficiaries of Western indifference and now control major swathes of Syria .   The Syria Syria is a mess of almost epic proportions , and even the limited strategy pursued by the Obama administration did much to empower Iran , Russia , al al Qaeda other enemies without advancing the goal of stabilizing Syria .Syria in the conflict , before Russians were on the ground , Jack Keane and I twice laid out in The Wall Street Journal options that might have shifted the balance of power in favor of    Syrian forces not aligned with terrorists .
