CLINTON :Well , you know , remember , I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation , and the way men who sometimes get off the reservation behave , and how men who sometimes get off the reservation speak .I ’m not going to deal with men who sometimes get off the reservation temper tantrums , or men who sometimes get off the reservation bullying , or men who sometimes get off the reservation efforts to try to provoke me .’
