They are descendants of the " Boys on the Bus " generation , whom Tim Crouse made famous in his unforgiving account of " pack journalism " as it existed camera people and network "embeds" the 1972 presidential campaign .Today ’s pack is distinct in fundamental ways : There are many more women and minorities in the group ( as in , there are more than almost none )there is considerably less drinking , and no one smokes and while reporters 40 years ago paid their dues and scrapped like hell to cover a presidential campaign , many of today ’s cast members are in their first journalism jobs .They are competitive but collegial reporters 40 years ago Their tech savviness is astounding ( actually it made me scared ) .
