I have one foot in the immigrant world and one foot in the nativist world , so I can see both sides .I know what it ’s like to be poor , speak a foreign language , not fit in , feel uncomfortable , et cetera .it did n’t stop me from fighting every day of my life to achieve success .I never hated America .
