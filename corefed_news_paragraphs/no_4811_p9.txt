I asked Señor Hernandez , what exactly do you do here ?He was quite candid and informative and not the least Señor Hernandez apologetic .Hernandez ’s job was to direct and coordinate a large Señor Hernandez enterprises of transport and educational activities aimed at assisting and encouraging Mexicans in physically moving north across Mexico and entering the United States .I was struck by both the grandiosity and bravura of that official Mexican government operation —   directed by a cabinet official .
