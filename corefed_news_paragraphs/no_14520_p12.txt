Scott that Coretta Scott King ’s words should have been allowed in the Senate are the SenateBut none of that removes the sting from his support of Trump and policies that might take us backward on racial equality and civil rights .It ’s fine to demand a more civil dialogue when discussing our leaders , but wrong to elevate that demand above more pressing concerns     because the truth is , no matter how many unwarranted insults Scott has to endure , he ’ll still be Scott US Senator , one of the most powerful people in the world , while the    on the wrong end of policies by Trump and Sessions must endure real suffering .
