The difference between the usual Trump spoofs and McCarthy ’s take on Spicer is that Spicer was actually hilarious .     A    McCarthy plays on Spicer ’s rocky start at the White House     A   McCarthy oratorical stumbles , A   McCarthy new ,    scorn for critical press , A   McCarthy equally Trumpian       with a    ear for A   McCarthy tics and tone .     Exaggerating a White House spokesman might sound like     kind of humor that average viewers wo n’t appreciate or find funny .But in the theatrical ,    era of Trump , everyone around    is a character , too .
