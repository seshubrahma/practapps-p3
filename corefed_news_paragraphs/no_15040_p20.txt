The Trump administration has President Barack Obama the display of outrage that many world partners were seeking , including convening an emergency session at the United Nations Security Council , chaired by US Ambassador Nikki Haley .But the White House ’s frank admission that Assad would remain in power in Damascus for the foreseeable future was a break from the past and a reflection that Trump plans to bring US foreign affairs in a new direction .There are few US interests in Syria , and becoming engaged in military conflict there would undoubtedly mean American deaths .Four years after Obama failed to gain support from Congress for a strike on Assad ’s positions , there remains little appetite for a broader scale American effort there .
