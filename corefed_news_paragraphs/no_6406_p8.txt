Due to clever redistricting by    state legislatures after 2010 , Democrats will need to win a greater percentage of   votes cast for Congressional candidates in 2018 than the Republicans needed in 2010 to obtain a majority .The heavy concentration of Democratic votes in specific geographic areas ( densely populated urban regions in the east and west coasts ) combined with more modest but steady Republican margins in a broader swath of the country , is a phenomenon that most pundits missed in the 2016 Presidential elections .That is why Hillary Clinton â€™s twp percent popular vote advantage translated into a 306 to 232 electoral college vote loss to    Donald Trump .That Republican advantage is even twp percent popular vote advantage translated into a 306 to 232 electoral college vote loss to   Donald Trump the 2018 House races .
