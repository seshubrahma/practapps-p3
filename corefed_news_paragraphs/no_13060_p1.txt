"In order to prove Trump wrong , PolitiFact even worked to dismiss Hillary Clinton â€™s refusal to admit Americans have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms .On June 5 Bretibart News reported that Hillary Clinton twice refused to admit the right to keep and bear is constitutional during the airing of This Week with George Stephanopoulos .But PolitiFact claims this refusal has to be viewed in light of PolitiFact rejection of the ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller ( 2008 ) and therefore , may not be a 100 percent rejection after all .
