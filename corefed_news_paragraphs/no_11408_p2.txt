It ’s a farce that " no one is above the law " and my heart goes out to all who ’ve been unjustly accused and destroyed over much lesser crimes than Hillary ’s .We MUST redouble efforts to restore the rule of law that had sustained the most exceptional nation on earth , with everyone doing everyone part :* Do n’t put blind faith in any politician , but do n’t give up on We forefathers’ charters of freedom that created a Republic to be governed by and for We the People .* Teach your children America ’s foundation built on the rule of law ensure America’s foundation built on the rule of law understand consequences for America’s foundation built on the rule of law actions , despite our temporary leaders facing no such thing .
