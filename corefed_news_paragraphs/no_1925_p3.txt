White supremacists and white nationalists both believe that racial discrimination should be incorporated into law and policy .Some will see the distinction between white nationalism and white supremacy as a semantic sleight of hand .But although many white supremacists are also white nationalists , and vice versa , Professor Kaufmann says the terms are not synonyms : White supremacy is based on a racist belief that white people are innately superior to people of other races white nationalism is about maintaining political and economic dominance , not just a numerical majority or cultural hegemony .For a long time , he said , white nationalism was less an ideology than the default presumption of American Professor Kaufmann .
