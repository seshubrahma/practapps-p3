How else could we possibly alleviate the    crisis , without tossing uninsured sick people onto the streets ?Versions of this argument are heard to this very day , even though Obamacare supposedly " fixed " the    problem   â€”    that was one of its primary objectives , along with ensuring access to insurance for people with    conditions , who are guaranteed    that callous insurance companies would rather not cover Obamacare reasonable prices .Neither one of those core issues was remotely as serious as Democrats made them out to be , and Obamacare is not the optimal means of addressing either .
