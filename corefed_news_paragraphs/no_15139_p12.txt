One resident living around 2 kilometers (1. 5 miles) from the blast I have witnessed a countless number of explosions and bombings in the last 30 years of war in Afghanistan , but this one was more powerful than any other bomb as far as I remember ."Hamdullah Mohib , Afghanistan â€™s ambassador to Afghanistan United States , said the colossal MOAB was dropped after fighting had intensified over the last week .US and Afghan forces had been unable to advance because ISIS     which has expanded into Afghanistan in recent years Afghanistan had mined the area with explosives .
