" It ’s hard to believe that , at the time , Elena actress Elena Verdugo supporting role was the most visible and recognizable Latina character ever on seen American TV .   It would take 28 more years before another actress , Eva Longoria , would have that distinction , as Gabrielle Solis on ABC ’s " Desperate Housewives "     although actresses Sonia Manzano , Rita Moreno , Lynda Carter , Constance Marie and Jessica Alba also had prominent TV roles during that time .   Although the struggle to include more Latinx characters and story lines to television content has long been documented , the solution has always been to create programming that affords emerging talent an opportunity to build their emerging talent , either behind or in front of the camera .    At times , that opportunity has been the strongest when members of two different marginalized groups work together .
