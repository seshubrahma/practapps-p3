We someone is here illegally and is apprehended just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before Congress that President Obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down , not to enforce the law .That is wrong .Federal immigration law enforce the law , and for everyone who says Federal immigration law ca nâ€™t possibly do that , I would note that in eight years , Bill Clinton deported 12 million people .In eight years , George W. Bush deported 10 million people .
