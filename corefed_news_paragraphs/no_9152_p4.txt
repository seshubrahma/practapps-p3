Just recently Ryan Kansas voters heeded the call and handed Tim Huelskamp a pink slip .Huelskamp was a prominent # Tim Huelskamp Republican who staked his campaign on opposition to the controversial billionaire only to be defeated by a    Republican .So why should Trump endorse Ryan now , especially when establishment Republicans are on the ropes ?Why not go all in on defeating Ryan ?
