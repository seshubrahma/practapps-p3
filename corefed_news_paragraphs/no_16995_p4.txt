Observers incorrectly characterized the upswing of Latino early voters as a polarizing contrast between two parts of the Obama Coalition , praising Latinos for comprehending Trump â€™s threat to American democracy and chastising blacks for somehow not getting the message .   This narrative is in some ways unsurprising : black Americans have historically been demonized for wanting to vote , denigrated for using the vote , and disrespected for not voting enough .During the 19th century and earlier , enslaved African Americans were denied the vote and punished the vote killed for openly expressing dreams of black citizenship .Black voting rights for men protected by the 15th amendment were then thwarted during an orchestrated campaign of racial violence , ensuring that most blacks could not freely exercise voting rights until after 1965 .
