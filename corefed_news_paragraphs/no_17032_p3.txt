" The Law , Taking the most important point first , there simply is n’t sufficient evidence to suggest that former Secretary of State Clinton actually broke the law     which , for better or worse , does not make it a crime simply to communicate about classified information over an unsecured medium .Nothing on that front has changed since FBI Director James Comey ’s July statement and subsequent congressional testimony .Although a President Trump could always overrule the FBI FBI issue of White House interference     the fact that the original investigation ended the way it did provides the original investigation powerful evidence of the absence of a smoking gun and a potentially insurmountable obstacle for even more    government officials to overcome .Perhaps those who believe Clinton ’s actions should have been illegal will push Congress to reform the relevant laws     including the Espionage Act .
