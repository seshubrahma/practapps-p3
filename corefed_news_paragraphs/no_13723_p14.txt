For example , a recent poll asked respondents , " In general , do you think immigrants in the United States help create jobs , take away jobs , or have no impact on jobs ? "    percent of Midwestern respondents picked the " take away jobs " answer , while only 16 percent picked " create jobs ."The    gap   —    almost a consensus   —    was much wider than the other regions .
