This Senate confirmation process begins with partisan payback in the air .That is on top of what was evident last February when Scalia died suddenly at a remote Texas hunting resort : The Supreme Court is deeply divided and every vote matters .A single justice among the nine can tip the balance on civil rights , criminal law and corporate regulation .Rarely has there been a moment in American history of such widespread national discord , internal court divisions , and the opportunity for a new    justice .
