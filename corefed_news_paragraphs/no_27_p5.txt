Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing : a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated " earmarks " as long as the money went to public entities .Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending , and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a Mr. Ryan so soon after Mr. Trump â€™s election would not send the Mr. Ryan signal .But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year .The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative the Office of Congressional Ethics the California Democrat who was then the House speaker .
