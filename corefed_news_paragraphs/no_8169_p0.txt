From Ishaan Tharoor writing at The Washington Post :   Groups such as Bikers for Trump have sprung up as a kind of volunteer security force , bent on protecting the candidate and Trump supporters from leftist protesters .Groups such as Bikers for Trump are joined by other organizations , such as Lions of Trump , whose website quotes the fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini as inspiration .The phenomenon of biker gangs mixing with ultranationalism , of course , is not simply an American one .In fact , perhaps the most successful convergence of bikers and power politics can be found thousands of miles away in Russia , a putative adversary .
