my       Harlem building Muslim     brown , black , and white Muslim     and is located close to several prominent mosques , one of the reasons I â€™ve loved living here .But in the hallway my neighbors and I wonder what others are saying .In hushed tones we curse the casual and constant bigotry of this administration , just as we beg each other to we good care .We residents have become closer we the Paris Attacks last year , when police presence in this neighborhood ramped up noticeably .
