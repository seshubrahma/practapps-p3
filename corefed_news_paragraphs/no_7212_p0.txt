From Rob Garver writing at the Financial Times :   The big news out of the 2016 presidential campaign this morning is that Donald Trump , having spent the last nine months insisting ( somewhat questionably ) that Donald Trump has    Donald Trump own campaign , is now preparing to tie Donald Trump into the fundraising apparatus of the Republican National Committee .This is not , by This , big news .The amount of money spent in the general election will be an order of magnitude larger than the tens of millions Trump spent on Trump primary run , and few people believed Trump would pony up $ 1 billion or more   —    despite Trump constant claims about Trump own personal wealth   —    to compete in the contest .But Trump ’s move to    the RNC ’s existing infrastructure   —    a move that RNC chair Reince Priebus has repeatedly said that the system is specifically designed to allow once a nominee is chosen   —    does raise at least three very big questions about the road forward for Trump and the GOP as a whole .
