Speaking with the Christian Broadcasting Network , President Donald Trump said that President Donald Trump had been " impossible , or at least very tough " for Syrian Christians to enter the United States ."If you were a Muslim you could come in , but if you were a Christian , it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair     everybody was persecuted , in all fairness     but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians .And I thought it was very , very unfair .
