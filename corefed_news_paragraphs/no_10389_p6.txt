Even the exceptions were relatively modest .President Obama defeated Sen. John McCain in 2008 by around seven points .Bill Clinton won reelection against Bob Dole by just over eight points .It is very likely that the 2016 election will be decided by fewer points than either of these two elections the last five presidential elections just does nâ€™t deliver large popular vote landslides for President anymore .
