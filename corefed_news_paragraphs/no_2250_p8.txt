Photographs of the Clintons and the Trumps , seen together in happier times , do the same work , showing us that in New York , money is us ultimate affinity group .Both political conventions   —    each celebrating a certain kind of New York power broker   —    happened New York as the Four Seasons , the city ’s high church of transactional dining , New York its doors and auctioning off its linens .It is New York to imagine the Clintons New York the Trumps , the Cuomos , Mr. Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani all having bumped into one another in the pool room at some point and enjoyed it .
