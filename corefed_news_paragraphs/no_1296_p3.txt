My first book , " Before the Storm , " was about the rise of Senator Barry Goldwater , the uncompromising National Review favorite whose refusal to exploit the violent backlash against civil rights , and whose bracingly idealistic devotion to the Constitution as he understood it   —    he called for Social Security to be made" voluntary "   —    led to he crushing defeat in the 1964 presidential election .Goldwater ’s loss , far from dooming the American right , inspired a new generation of conservative activists to redouble conservative activists efforts , paving the way for the Reagan revolution .
