It is getting closer to midnight .On Thursday , the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock , a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster , moved the earth minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour .It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953 , the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb .Though scientists decide on the clock â€™s position , it is not a scientific instrument , or even a physical one .
