Now , I was nâ€™t smart enough or fit enough or talented enough to attend one of our service academies .But I have attended plenty of commencements at the Naval Academy in Annapolis , at West Point and at the Air Force Academy , watching as good friends     andtheir sons and daughters     threw those caps into the air .   I even wrote a speech or two for my bosses to give at some of those ceremonies .
