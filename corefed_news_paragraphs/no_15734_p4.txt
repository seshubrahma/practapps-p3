Philippine authorities have insisted since the start that the rampage at Resorts World Manila , which left 37 people dead , was the work of a single gunman and was not at all related to terrorism .    Hours after Trump called    a " terror attack , " ISIS claimed responsibility in a statement that insisted " Islamic State fighters " had carried out the killings .But that claim of responsibility did nâ€™t seem to gibe with the facts ( a lone gunmen ) or the repeated assertions by Manila police that the incident had nothing to do with terror .   " They can always claim whatever They want to claim , " Oscar Albayalde , police chief for the Manila area , told CNN .
