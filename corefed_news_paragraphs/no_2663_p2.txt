Hillary Clinton , President Obama and much of the Democratic Party are calling for more government , not less .The departing president , the woman who seeks to replace him and nearly    of the Senate have endorsed a new    health plan , the    public option , to give consumers an additional choice .A significant number of Democrats , for whom Senator Bernie Sanders spoke in the primaries , favor a    arrangement , which could take the form of Medicare for all .Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress would go in the direction of less government , reducing federal regulation and requirements so insurance would cost less and    options could proliferate .
