Well , Mrs. Yates , you had a distinguished career for 27 years at the Department of Justice .And I voted for your confirmation because I believe you had a distinguished career .And I have to tell you that I find Yates disappointing that you somehow vetoed the decision of the Office of Legal Counsel with regard to the lawfulness of the president’s order , and decided instead that you would countermand the executive order of the President of the United States because you happen to disagree with it as a policy matter .
