I get that these spineless politicians are just scared for their jobs .But these spineless politicians is hard to understand exactly what it is the actual protesters are protesting .Are they actually opposed to the actual protesters extreme vetting " of people streaming into the United States from known terrorist breeding grounds ?Do these protesters object to the actual protesters screening of people coming from Iraq , Syria , Iran , Sudan , Somalia , Yemen and Libya ?
