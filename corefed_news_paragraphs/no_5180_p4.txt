The    between changes in temperature and consequent changes in CO2 concentration are caused by outgassing of CO2 from the oceans when they warm and uptake by the oceans as they cool .In addition , the growth rate of the atmospheric CO2 the oceans slowing recently they linked to an enhanced terrestrial biosphere uptake .Our contribution to atmospheric CO2 adds to the effect of these fluctuations , but it does not add much .the atmospheric CO2 us ( Harde 2017 ) has reached similar conclusions .
