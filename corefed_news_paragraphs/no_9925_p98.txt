Rubio allies and mainstream media writers who do n’t want to concede that Trump won the Hispanic vote in Nevada are endlessly talking about Tuesday supposedly Trump of Latino voters .But if Rubio had received 51 % of the Hispanic vote , would these same people be pointing to the Trump small sample size " — Nevada or would they be pushing the narrative that Trump ca Florida Sen. Marco Rubio even win minorities in his own party ?Bottom line :Trump won nearly half of the Latino vote on Tuesday .
