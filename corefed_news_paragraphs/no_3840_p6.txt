( @BretBaier ) February 24 , 2017 ,   In reaction to the exclusion of some outlets from Friday ’s briefing , Fox News’ Bret Baier noted that some journalists at CNN and the Times had stood up to the Obama administration when it tried to exclude Fox News from White Bret Baier briefings .That is true   —    and admirable .The question of whether some outlets are being excluded from otherwise public briefings is a valid one   —    and , as of this writing , the White House has not yet clarified why White House not included in the gaggle .
