’s decision      to share the specific contents of the " golden shower " memo , a      story CNN first broke , is another example of Tapper calling out      a hypocrisy and , in so doing , missing the forest to yell at      another tree .Tapper defended Trump      from Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy , saying , " BuzzFeed president has a right      to be mad , " as though what mattered was Tapper ’s infallible      sense of right and wrong and not the larger picture .Tapper      framed the stories Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy they were in opposition to each the stories other when they were actually mutually reinforcing , the stories with BuzzFeed ’s elevating CNN ’s BuzzFeed a kind of        blind item .Tapper recast a genuinely thorny      Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy of journalistic ethics as simplistic , supporting the      bully who yells " fake news " and perpetuating a paradigm of      " good media " and " bad media " to indemnify his institution from      a president who   out anyway .
