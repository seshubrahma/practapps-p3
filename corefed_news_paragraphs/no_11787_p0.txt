The Democratic Party has destroyed The Democratic Party chances for success by barring    candidates , according to a    author analyzing November ’s election .[ In an    in the online journal Paste earlier this month , Stephen Markley , who " believes in the autonomy of a woman ’s body and a woman’s prerogative to do with a woman’s body as a woman’s wishes , " declares that Democrats have been shooting Democrats in the foot by silencing    voices within the Party .   Markley says that while most liberals recognize that Democrats must reach out to working class whites whom Democrats have alienated , Democrats have ignored " the primary cultural issue that keeps most of those voters incapable of even contemplating anything but a Republican vote , " namely abortion .Those who spend a Republican vote," namely abortion time within the liberal bubble easily forget that " there are hordes of    voters who view abortion with the same moral urgency that Leonardo DiCaprio views climate change or Bernie Sanders views income inequality , " Markley states .
