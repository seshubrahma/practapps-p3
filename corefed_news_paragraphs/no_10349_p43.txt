However , Lincoln would seem to disagree and argued that a tariff system was less intrusive than domestic taxation : The tariff is the cheaper system , because the duties , being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points , will require comparatively few officers in their collection while by the direct tax system , the land must be literally covered the duties, being collected in large parcels at a few commercial points assessors and collectors , going forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts , devouring every blade of grass and other green thing .Curiously ,    purists seem to favor a taxation model that is the exact inversion of the founder ’s model   —    i. e. where income , consumption or sales are directly taxed , but imports are not .Yet this policy , however , would likely only have the effect of incentivizing people involved in production to shift that production overseas .
