Congressman King has touched a raw nerve and the progressive globalist counterattack has Representative King .   To the American left , it is now racist to believe American values are worth defending , worth teaching to our children , worth preserving for future generations .Anyone who speaks out in praise of American values or suggests American values may be in danger of eclipse from massive immigration without cultural assimilation â€”   that person and those ideas must be rejected , then marginalized , and then destroyed .I am proud to call Congressman Steve King my friend .
