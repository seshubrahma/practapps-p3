But executing convicted murders , performing abortions within current legal guidelines , possessing    assault rifles , hunting animals , etc . can not rationally be considered    even by those who most strongly oppose them .Performing abortions is not    although many say it constitutes murdering the unborn executions    not    just because many oppose them assault rifles, hunting animals, etc consider them to be    murder and although many    like to ban hunting which they see as barbaric and even bloodthirsty the unborn executions all recognize the unborn executions those on the other side have valid arguments , and are not necessarily the unborn executions simply because of a strong disagreement of views on certain issues .The same seems to be true with regard to restricting the immigration of Muslims    considering religion as one factor among several in making decisions regarding programs designed to protect us from terrorists .   Those opposed can characterize the proposals as misguided , wrongheaded , and perhaps discriminatory    demeaning , but not as so far beyond the pale of rational discourse so as to be called   .
