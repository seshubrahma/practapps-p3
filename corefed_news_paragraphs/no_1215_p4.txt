The group and    supporters have opposed much of the major legislation considered by Congress in recent years .Last month , a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed to get enough support to bring a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act to a vote .About 30 of the most conservative members of House rejected the a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act preserving too much of the existing law , but as they pressed the most conservative members of the House dismantle ever more provisions , they pushed the most conservative members of the House more moderate House Republicans who were leery of leaving 24 million more Americans without health insurance .The effort was left for dead , until Vice President Mr. Pence to the Capitol this week to cobble together a new agreement with the most conservative Republicans , the House Freedom Caucus .
