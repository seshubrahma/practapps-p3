It ’s not asking too much .the forthcoming Trump administration ’s longtime solution for the illegal immigration issue has been to deport criminal illegal aliens first , then focus on enforcing    so that remaining migrants must return through the country ’s naturalization process .The Times thinks otherwise , requesting that illegal immigrants be allowed to not only stay in the country , but they illegal immigrants be given ‘ sanctuary’ on every university campus in the state : Whether or not administrators label a university a " sanctuary " campus is not the central issue here .The word is largely symbolic .
