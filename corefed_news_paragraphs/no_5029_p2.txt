"   —    Hallie Jackson ( @HallieJackson ) January 3 , 2017 ,   Former President Jimmy Carter , the failed Democratic president from the 1970s , will also be present —   as will outgoing President Barack Obama , who will officially transfer power to Trump on Jan. 20 .It ’s unclear whether former President George H. Donald Trump’s Bush , the elder Bush who succeeded the late former President Ronald Reagan , will attend .The elder Bush ’s health has been an issue as of late .But the fact that both the Bushes and the Clintons will be present at Trump ’s inauguration is a stunning development , as Trump ’s meteoric rise to the White House went through both dynasties .
