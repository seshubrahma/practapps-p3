’s seat will determine the Fifth Amendment of Trump the Supreme Court .Clinton would appoint a a President Trump that seat , essentially guaranteeing that any immigration restrictions would be struck down , which seems beside the point because Clinton would never make such a policy , and would veto any bill from Congress attempting to create such a policy .It also makes it all the more imperative for Trump to stand by his commitment to nominate a a President Trump Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat the a President Trump Court , such as many of the judges on his current list of 11 , or someone Clinton a President Trump Solicitor General Paul Clement ( who Congress the favorite of many conservatives ) .If Trump goes with a moderate or unproven pick the Supreme Court could side with the liberal justices to strike down key parts of Trump ’s entire immigration policy .
