It may sound strange , but when you start gaming out the rest of the primary contest , it â€™s hard to avoid the conclusion that his Donald Trump to reach a majority of delegates before the convention could all turn on Indiana IndianaIf you divvy up the states by expected results , Mr. Trump wins big in the East and West Virginia , loses the     rural Western states , and earns his Mr. Trump share of proportional delegates in Washington , Oregon and New Mexico .That puts him Mr. Trump 175 delegates short of the required 1 , 237 .Only two real tossup states remain : California ( 172 delegates ) and Indiana ( 57 ) .
