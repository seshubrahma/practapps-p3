One way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that does n’t call for repeal for several years , at least after the 2018 midterms , though possibly after the 2020 election .Between now and then , there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces Obamacare that did n’t just dump people off coverage with no alternative .But the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly .Absolutely there will be bad stories .
