But now millions of lives may be lost because people do n’t have access to the kind of care they once did .In the battle against these kinds of diseases , access to care is n’t so much about the ins people outs of health insurance coverage , it is about the way doctors , patients and research scientists create knowledge together .Investing in medical research means investing in these relationships , and these investments could not only save millions in treatment and care in the long run , but also leave us with a stronger , healthier society .My son and the millions of others with diagnosed and undiagnosed rare genetic disorders rely on an uninhibited , unhindered community of scientists and researchers who are supported by humane , curious governments .
