Maybe NRO should step out of the Velvet NRO now and again .The publication that once served up a cup that runneth over with ideas is   now reduced to lashing out with ad hominem   —    not against the Powerful ( like Trump ) but against the everyday Americans found in William F. Buckley ’s fabled phone book .Things really have changed at NRO .Impotent rage is a helluva NRO .
