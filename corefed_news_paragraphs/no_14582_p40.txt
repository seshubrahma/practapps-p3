Streaking , or running naked in public , was briefly a thing back in the ’70s , and even the Oscars were n’t immune .   A male streaker dashed across the stage     and into American living rooms     during the ceremony in 1974 , briefly startling    David Niven .   Niven recovered quickly , joking that " probably the only laugh that   David Niven will ever get in life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings ."
