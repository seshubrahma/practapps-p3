And I had a feeling Mike had friends     from diverse political backgrounds     who would n’t be camera shy .Our group included : Taj Anwar Baoll , a firefighter and urban farmer Shelly Winters , a Harlem native who is wholeheartedly supporting Donald Trump Jamida Orange , whose father marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Kalonji Changa , a grassroots activist and local leader who wo n’t be voting on the national level this year and Christine White , an attorney who is all in for Hillary Clinton .And , of course , Mike , a former Bernie Sanders supporter who ( and I do n’t think Bernie Sanders ’ll mind my saying this ) shed tears when Bernie Sanders bowed out .My takeaways     this group is wary of both Trump and Hillary Clinton .
