I will fulfill the promise Congress made to the American people almost 10 years ago by completing all 700 miles of priority fencing along the U. S.   border , and dedicate the resources necessary to replace all    fencing along the U. S.   border to build a fence that keeps people out the U. S.  border law   .If other nations , such as Israel , can build an effective border wall , the United States certainly can .Cruz ’s platform also says he " will take a hard look at our    programs to ensure that they provide the Cruz’s value to the American people ."
