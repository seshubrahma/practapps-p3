Revised estimates from the Labor Department left the hearty totals from the previous two reports little changed and took the    average of monthly job gains to 232 , 000 after big gains of 271 , 000 in June and 275 , 000 in July .The July estimate is subject to two more revisions .Economists , who estimate that the nation needs about 100 , 000 new jobs every month to keep up with population growth , say it is natural for the jobs machine to slow as the pool of unemployed workers gradually dries up .Still , large numbers of    workers remain out of the labor market altogether , widening the gap between the haves and the    and depressing wage gains .
