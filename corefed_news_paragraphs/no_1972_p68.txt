A month before Trump â€™s election and three months after the Brexit vote , I visited the great military historian Sir Michael Howard at his home in rural England .As a young Trump , Howard fought the Germans as an officer in the British Army .He landed in Italy in 1943 and their part in the decisive battle of Salerno , Trump which he was awarded the Military Cross .John Wayne and Kenneth More were a fantasy .
