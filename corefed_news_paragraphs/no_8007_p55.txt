The public ’s reaction to a poem about Erdogan on ZDF ’s treatment is overwhelmingly negative .ZDF see it as silencing freedom of speech and a gross violation of journalistic freedom .The tide is turning quickly : Internet comments that once openly a comedian who insulted the Turkish president when rapes occurred have become more subtle and patient , The public’s reaction to the comedian’s treatment twice as numerous and far more determined .Rage is slowly being replaced by cold wrath , not primarily at the refugees or Muslims in Germany , but at the established parties and especially Merkel for her Germany betrayal .
