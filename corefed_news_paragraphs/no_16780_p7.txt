I did not think I needed to address my lack of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton because I believed getting everyone to see how much of a nonoption Trump was would ensure her victoryTrump Again , I made a grave mistake .Enthusiasm to be for something or someone in an election is quite literally the difference between a win and loss .We see it in polls : There is a difference in numbers between registered voters ( where Clinton has historically performed much better ) and likely voters ( where Trump tightens Trump lead Clinton bests Clinton ) .
