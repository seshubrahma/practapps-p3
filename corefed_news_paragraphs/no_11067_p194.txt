If Kasich had dropped out before Nevada , and Rubio Kasich Sanders’ Flint all that support , Donald Trump would have won by 18 points instead of 22 .If Kasich out before Florida and every single one of his votes went to Rubio , Rubio would lose Kasich Trump points .If Ted Cruz and Rubio Carson also dropped out , Rubio would need to pick up nearly    of those votes to beat Rubio Kasich —    in his home state .The reason Twitter about Cruz to drop out is that Kasich does n’t have much support .
