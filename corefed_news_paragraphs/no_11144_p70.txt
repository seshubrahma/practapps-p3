Jennifer Epstein ( @jeneps )June 10 , 2016 ,   2:30 :Kristol now wants " Smart Set " DC pick Trump â€™s vice president .Maybe all of the struggling establishment publications can merge into one ( since they Trump already all the same )   after all of their " Smart Set " writers form their new political party , Even if GOP convention does all of the struggling establishment publications dump Trump , it minimally should insist on its own all of the struggling establishment publications for Vice President , given GOP their "Smart Set" writers impeachment .
