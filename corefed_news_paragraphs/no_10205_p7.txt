For his part , Zogby , one of the leading advocates of the    BDS movement in the U. S. has equated the " plight of the Palestinians " with the Holocaust .This comparison is grossly offensive to the memory of the millions of innocent people murdered by the Nazis and reveals a willful ignorance of history , blinded by hatred of Israel .These are the people who a willful ignorance of history, blinded by hatred of Israel be writing the platform for the Democratic Party .What hope does Israel have of receiving fair Israel in such an environment ?
