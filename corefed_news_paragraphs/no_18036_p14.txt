Where the loss comes from also is n’t clear the $103 million loss some tax experts    told CBS News that    could be lingering from the huge      Trump CBS News in a 1995 tax filing that was released by The New York    Times during the campaign ." ’    About $ 32 million of that is the    sale of assets taxed at    a lower rate , which leaves another $ 16 million to be taxed at a    regular rate .So that means that with all the losses folded in ,    Trump is claiming he earned $ 16 million
