In people minds , Breitbart News is at the core of a bizarre conspiracy to install a fascist dictatorship in the United States .That plot may include Russian hackers intervening to give more votes to   Trump in swing states , or creating an empire of " fake news " sites to fool gullible Americans into voting Republican .Each of these conspiracy theories falls apart when examined closely : NPR , for example , found that the " godfather " of " fake news " sites is a liberal Democrat .But reality and facts simply do not matter .
