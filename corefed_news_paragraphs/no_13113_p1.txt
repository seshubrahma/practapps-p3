—    Ben Howe ( @BenHowe ) June 3 , 2016 ,    Howe , who is a RedState contributing editor , has been leading the growingly embarrassing    # NeverTrump movement of moderate " movement conservative " political consultants , pundits , and bloggers upset over Trump ’s victory in the Republican primary .When Trump received backlash over Trump mocking of the woman covered in egg yolks thanks to    protesters , Trump aimed to draw a moral equivalence between a woman being pelted with bottles and eggs and a reporter who had a woman arm grabbed while chasing a presidential candidate .These tweets are identical to what we said about Michelle Fields .But no . a woman deserved it .
