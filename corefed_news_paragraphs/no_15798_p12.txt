He had called Dinner at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night , saying he was going to The Presidentand I my whole family , but decided to have just me this time , with the whole The President and I coming the next time .It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner , although I assumed there would be others .It turned out to be just the two of us , seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room .
