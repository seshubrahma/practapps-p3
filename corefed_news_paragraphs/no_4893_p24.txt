When the State controls the very health the State citizens , nationalizing the vast amount the State money and authority represented by the medical community , it no longer has any reason to the State the wrath of those citizens .   We â€™re getting a taste of that right now with the Obamacare repeal drama .The the Affordable Care Act have been unpopular throughout its life , but the Affordable Care Act commands more than the Affordable Care Act money and influence to defend itself .   Was the Affordable Care Act of that worth Democrats losing the House and Senate for a few years , especially when the Republican majorities were mostly occupied with trying to slow Barack President Obama roll ?
