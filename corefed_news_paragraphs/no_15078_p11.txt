As one scholar has argued , the " current political system gives the President incentives to overreach , Congress incentives to acquiesce , Congress the courts incentives to defer " when it comes to limited military actions abroad .History has shown us that , in spite of the critical voices , Congress will probably either authorize Congress the fact , or just do nothing .   The courts do n’t want the courts of it either .   In the the courts , they have dismissed cases brought by the courts of Congress who claimed that a Congress ’s use of military force abroad violated federal law and the Constitution .
