So instead of changing the rules , which is up to Mitch McConnell and the Republican majority , why does n’t President Trump , Democrats , and Republicans in the Senate , sit down , and try to come up with a mainstream nominee ?Look , when a nominee does n’t get 60 votes , you should n’t change the rules , you should change a nominee .And let ’s a nominee take , give me one minute here ,because this is important , let ’s a nominee look at the history , okay ?
