I do nâ€™t think all Muslims are Islamic supremacists .They Islamic supremacists believe their Islamic supremacists is the best , and they Islamic supremacists entitled to believe that .But their Islamic supremacists to impose it , and specifically this code , this brutally repressive ,          shari doctrine , is not a protected practice .That is a seditious activity in the West , and certainly in our country , where they Islamic supremacists trying explicitly to supplant our Constitution .
