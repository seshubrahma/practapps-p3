That changed in the 1960s , when black voters moved en masse to The Democratic Party after Lyndon B. Johnson showed he was willing to lose Lyndon B. Johnson South in order to pass the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction .Southern Democrats abandoned the party The Democratic Party Republicans , and Richard Nixon won the presidency in 1968 on a Southern strategy of stalling forward movement on civil rights .And the party of The Democratic Party considered anathema to black progress .In the intervening years , modern Democrats have been far more likely to support social programs that help the poor , who are disproportionately black , and to support civil rights policies .
