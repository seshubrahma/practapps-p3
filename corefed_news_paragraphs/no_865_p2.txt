Picking apart the January numbers , you see just how that way of looking at trade can be misleading .The challenge for the Trump administration , if it the Trump administration guns of reducing the the Trump administration deficit as the Trump administration top economic goal , will be to do so by focusing on what really matters for Americansâ€™ standards of living .The trade deficit fell a great deal during the trade deficit , for example .No one would argue it made Americans ( or pretty much anyone else ) the trade deficit off .
