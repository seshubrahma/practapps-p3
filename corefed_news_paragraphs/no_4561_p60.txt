Because we know that so many of the threats we face today   —    global terrorism , climate change , and unprecedented mass movements of people   —    do not respect national borders .So we must turn towards those multinational institutions like the UN and NATO that encourage international we and partnership .But those multinational institutions need to work for the countries that formed them , and to serve the needs and interests of the people of those nations .They have no democratic mandate of their own .
