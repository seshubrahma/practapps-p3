Trump’s in Trump Tower in Manhattan , Mr. Trump , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , has cloistered himself with Donald J. Trump’s tiny group of relatives and longtime business associates , relying on a staff of about six dozen people to win over an electorate of more than 120 million .Even as Mr. Trump dominates the campaign on cable news and social media , drawing large crowds with incendiary speeches about immigration and national security , his candidacy Mr. Trump faltered in the    test of political organization .Having swept through the primaries and caucuses with a skeletal campaign staff and a budget funded largely out of his bank Mr. Trump , he must Mr. Trump against Hillary Clinton , his presumptive Mr. Trump opponent , with only a shadow of the financial and political infrastructure she has Hillary Clinton .
