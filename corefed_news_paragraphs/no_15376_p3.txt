But on Monday , when some people took offense at what they some people " " jokes about President Donald Trump , there began a # FireColbert campaign on social media .   I find it ironic that these people would start a campaign to fire a public figure for what , in their these people , were lewd comments , when citizens of the United States , and people all over the world , for that matter , just lived through the presidential campaign of one of the lewdest , most misogynistic , insulting , undignified men we ’ve ever seen .Remember the debate over penis size between Trump and Marco Rubio ?How about when Trump Trump comments about Carly Fiorina ’s face ?
