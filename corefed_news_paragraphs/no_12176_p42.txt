The problem is that being Speaker is a big job , even if one were not trying to manipulate and senior GOP aide all the time .Can we find an ‘ honest broker’ to just follow the Constitution and the Rules of the House , to allow the will of the people to be represented by House ?A lot of conservatives thought Daniel Webster could do that job a couple of years ago .To defeat Ryan , they need Ryan find an alternative candidate willing to step up to the plate .
