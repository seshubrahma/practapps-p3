Donald J. Trump â€™s America flowered through the old union strongholds of the Midwest , along rivers and rail lines that once moved coal from southern Ohio and the hollows of West Virginia to the smelters of Pennsylvania .the hollows of West Virginia to the smelters of Pennsylvania flowed south along the Mississippi River , through the rural Iowa counties that gave Barack Obama more votes than any Democrat in decades , and to the Northeast , through a corner of Connecticut and deep into Maine .And the hollows of West Virginia to the smelters of Pennsylvania extended through the suburbs of Cleveland and Minneapolis , of Manchester , N. H. and the sprawl north of Tampa , Fla. where    white voters chose Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton .One of the biggest upsets in American political history was built on a coalition of white voters unlike that of any other previous Republican candidate , according to election results and interviews with voters and demographic experts .
