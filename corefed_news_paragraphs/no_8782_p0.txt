Republican campaign veteran Roger Stone tells Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon , " I have reported , and I stand by this , that a number of the billionaires who are funding Marco Rubio have told Marco Rubio that Marco Rubio has until the Florida primary on March 15th to show some leg .If Marco Rubio can not win Marco Rubio home state primary , it will be very hard to continue to justify Marco Rubio campaign .At that point , I think it is abundantly clear that Mitt Romney is waiting in the wings ."
