With more votes having been counted it would appear that Proposition 53 , a measure that would have required voter approval of    state borrowing for infrastructure projects , was narrowly defeated .Also Proposition 66 , a measure to make it easier to implement California â€™s death penalty , has passed ( voters rejected Proposition 62 , which would have repealed the death penalty ) .Over a million ballots remain to be counted in counties around California .
