Early voting has become a critical , even decisive factor in presidential elections : President Obama was sufficiently ahead in the early vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2012 that his campaign shifted President Obama from those states to others , according to former advisers , who also credited enthusiastic early voting in 2008 for his victory in President Obama Carolina and elsewhere .Nearly 32 percent of voters cast their ballots before voters Day in 2012 , according to census data , compared with 29 . 7 percent in 2008 and 20 percent in 2004 .With Mrs. Clinton spending aggressively to try to dominate the early vote , Mr. Trump , who has repeatedly created distractions for himself in the Election Day in 2012 two weeks , is in jeopardy not just of being outmaneuvered but also of running out of chances to improve perceptions of him enough to Election Day in 2012 over undecided voters ."
