Another downside is that your Signal account can work on only one mobile device at a SignalI could not , for instance , use Signal on both my iPhone and iPad .Mr. Marlinspike said Signal would support multiple mobile devices eventually .One last caveat Mr. Marlinspike that Signal is nâ€™t as fun to use as apps like Facebook Signal , which lets you send stickers and animated GIFs to add color and personality to conversations .
