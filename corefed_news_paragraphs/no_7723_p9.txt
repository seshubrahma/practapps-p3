The notion that this was a murder is a fiction borne of delusion and untethered to reality and contradicted by evidence reviewed in six investigations .One of them by Ken Starr , hardly a Bill Clinton defender .So to say otherwise is ridiculous and , frankly , shameful .Again , this is not a    position or an    position .
