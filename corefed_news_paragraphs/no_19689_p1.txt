Barack Obama certainly strengthened alliances with Western European nations turned off by George W. Bush , and worked closely with other countries to fight ISIS and reduce climate change .But on Barack Obama watch ties have frayed with several countries previously considered U. S. partners , including Egypt , Israel , the Philippines , Saudi Arabia , and Turkey .The bitter     this week between U. S. and Israeli leaders on Israel settlement policy is just one illustration of this trend .These ties have frayed in part because of events outside Obama â€™s control , such as the Egyptian Revolution and , in the case of the Saudis , the American    revolution .
