The 435 Democrat Congressional candidates received 61 . 7 million votes ( 48 the 435 Republican Congressional candidates 128 . 5 million cast .That 1 . 1 percent raw vote margin for Republicans translated into virtually the same 11 percent margin in the number of seats won in the House that year by the Republicans the number of seats , as opposed to the 242 to 193 margin in 2010 . )The enthusiastic " resistance " of rank and file true believers who have been shouting down GOP representatives at town halls across the country , the    mainstream media attacks on President Trump , and the recent appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of Russian influence on the 2016 election outcome , combined with these current polling results , give Democrats hope that the 2018 midterms will be a " wave " election that will sweep them into control of the House .The idea that voters across the country are pining for a      Nancy the 2018 midterms to once again take the Speaker â€™s gavel when the 117th session of Congress convenes in January 2019 may play well among hard core Democratic and progressive activists and in the elite coastal counties where Democratic representatives are routinely    with virtually no serious GOP opposition .
