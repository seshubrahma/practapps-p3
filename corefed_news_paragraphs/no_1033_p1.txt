By the afternoon the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey , had systematically demolished the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey arguments in a remarkable public takedown of a sitting president .Even a close ally of Mr. Trump , Representative Devin Nunes , Republican of California and the House Intelligence Committee chairman , conceded that " a gray cloud " of suspicion now hung over the White House by the end of the day ’s hearings .The testimony of Mr. Comey and that of Adm. Michael S. Rogers , Mr. Comey National Security Agency counterpart , will most likely enervate and distract Mr. Trump ’s administration for weeks , if not longer , overshadowing good news , like the impressive debut of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch , Mr. Comey Supreme Court nominee , on the first day of Mr. Comey confirmation hearings Monday .But it ’s the obsessiveness and ferocity of Mr. Trump’s ’s pushback against the Russian allegations , often untethered from fact or tact , that is making an uncertain situation worse .
