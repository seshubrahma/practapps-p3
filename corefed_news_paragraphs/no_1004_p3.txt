"Mr. Trump came to office without a clearly articulated philosophy for using the military to fight terrorist groups .Mr. Trump had promised to be more aggressive in taking on the Islamic State   —    even suggesting during the presidential campaign that Mr. Trump had a secret plan   —    but had also signaled a desire to rein in the notion of the United States as the world ’s peacekeeper and claimed at various points to have opposed the ground invasion of Iraq .Now , surrounded by generals who have been at the center of a    shift to rely on Special Operations forces to project power without the risks and costs of large ground wars , he is choosing to maintain the same approach but giving the Pentagon more latitude .
