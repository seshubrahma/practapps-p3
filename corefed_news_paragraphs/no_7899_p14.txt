Independence Party —   also a Leave campaigner —   and an actual leader of the populist movement who has been banging the drum on the issue for 25 years .Trump struck a similar note in his New York City speech exposing Clinton Trump Come November , the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security , betrayed their prosperity , the American people sold out their the American people .They will have a the American people to vote the American people a new agenda with big dreams , bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people .
