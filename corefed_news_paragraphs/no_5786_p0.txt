Actor Ed Helms is set to produce and host a new comedy special titled The Fake News with Ted Nelms for Comedy Central .[ Deadline Hollywood reports that the actor â€™s special will focus on a number of fake , satirical news stories presented by an absurd looking ,    news anchor played by Helms , who is perhaps best known for his roles in the television seriesThe Office and the raunchy comedy The Hangover .   TFN will reportedly take on the guise of a legitimate news station , not unlike CNN or   news , but will deliver ludicrous stories in a deadpan comedic style .
