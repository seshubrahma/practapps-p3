The good thing about playing an interview slow and loose , especially when you ’ve caught your subject on a free day , is that you can slide into the type of      conversation only possible with truly friendly people .Not to say that Pitt is n’t Pitt on his guard when Pitt comes to discussing touchy subjects like income inequality and whitewashing in Hollywood .Hollywood there ’s a casual intimacy to the few hours we ’ve spent together , shooting the breeze with a rapport so easy that I keep turning the recorder back on after I assume the interview is over him talking about Pitt under the spell of New Orleans , or being a " sucker for an underdog story , " or how " Beasts of the Southern Wild " is an amazing film that broke his heart .
