If Trump was sincere about healing divisions , Trump could have worshiped at Mother Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston , where a man who police said wanted to start a race war admitted killing nine churchgoers , including the pastor     my friend and state senator Clementa Pinckney     and talked about racial reconciliation .   But Trump did none of those things .And since then , Trump also declined invitations to speak before the National Urban League , the NAACP and the National Association of Black Journalists .   To date , Trump ’s only major pronouncement has been the need for a " civil rights agenda for our time , " but Trump’s has failed to offer one , except a call to fight crime and expand charter schools .
