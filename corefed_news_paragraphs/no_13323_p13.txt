During Wednesday ’s town hall , Rubio recounted the personal experience of someone he apparently knows as evidence Rubio the alleged systemic racism in some of America ’s law enforcement .I personally know someone who happens to be a police officer and a young    male who told me that he ’s been pulled over Rubio , eight times in the last few years and never gets a ticket .What is he supposed to think ?Rubio gets pulled over , Rubio no reason , never gets a ticket .
