but you have to go even further back in the history books to find a success story .Since 1900 , only two men who were trailing after the first ballot at their convention eventually won the nomination and then the nomination on the third after   Harry Truman (who had decided not to run for another term) House : Woodrow Wilson , who needed 46 ballots to win the Democratic nomination in 1912 , and Warren Harding , who clinched the Republican nomination on the 10th ballot in 1920.’ ’Exactly which ones will be freed and when depends on a rather complicated set of state party rules —   which , like the national ones , are not written in stone —   but by the New York Times’ count , the number of unbound delegates would grow from 5 percent during the first round of voting to 57 percent in the second , and then to 81 percent in the third .Even those are rough numbers , though , since states can unbind their delegates if the candidate Even those were assigned to vote Even those withdraws from the race or fails to meet certain vote thresholds on the convention floor.
