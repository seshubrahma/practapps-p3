I was supposed to be a sounding board for ideas , with a trumped up job title .In reality , I served as an extra member of his security team ( though his team were and are absolutely fantastic his security team the record ) .So Mr. Trump , like Mr. Farage , has been portrayed as the progenitor of violence , despite the fact that Bernie Sanders supporters shut down his rally in Chicago last night .And Bernie Sanders the fact that someone tried to jump Mr. Trump on stage in Ohio today .
