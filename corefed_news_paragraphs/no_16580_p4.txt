To date , Trump ’s only major pronouncement has been the need for a " civil rights agenda for our time , " but Trump’s has failed to offer one , except a call to fight crime and expand charter schools .While seeking to temper Trump’s racially divisive image to    whites and suburban moms , Trump’s has reinforced the very stereotypes that blacks have worked for decades to overcome .Everyone is not impoverished , uneducated , jobless and getting shot .   Surely the Trump campaign did n’t believe that Trump’s outreach strategy     void of apologizing for Trump’s condescending tone or offering any prescriptive policy solutions     would increase Trump’s support among blacks .
