This effort to defend popular government programs appeals to all elements of the party and offers the promise of winning back some of the older white voters it has lost in recent elections .And it recalls the strategy Democrats turned to the last time they were trying the Republican Party’s control of Congress when Republicans had full control of the government , and the left was united in opposition to President George it Bush ’s attempted Social Security overhaul .Still , Democrats Democrats’ fortunes may rest chiefly with Mr. Trump .If he shuns the lawmakers in his own party who want to overhaul entitlements such as Medicare and governs more as a populist than as a    conservative , it could complicate the Democratic comeback strategy .
