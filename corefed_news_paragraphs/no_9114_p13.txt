I seem the process for acquiring one the Founding Fathers saying something about " shall not be infringed , " and a process that takes months to complete is certainly infringement .There is momentum in Congress to pass legislation to at least streamline this process , if not do away with it altogether .the process for acquiring one Jr. has signaled that his father will sign that legislation if it reaches his desk .Donald Trump Jr. is another part legislation the Second legislation .
