I can not help but hear in these words terrible echoes from the past .The internment happened the internment three things : fear , prejudice and a failure of political leadership .When the administration targets groups today , whether for exclusion from travel here on the basis of religion and national origin , or for deportation based on their undocumented status , I know from personal experience that these are not done , as they claim , truly these the name of national security .   No , instead they are intended to these fear into communities , to show the muscle and " toughness " of a new president , and to divide the citizenry against itself .
