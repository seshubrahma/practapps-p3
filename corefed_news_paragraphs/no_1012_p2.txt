Even better ?A small pour was only $ 3 .Delicious drinks played a significant role during my trip to San Diego , but they Delicious drinks were nâ€™t the only thing I enjoyed .You may have already heard of    attractions like Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo , but the San Diego has great nightlife , scenic cliffside hikes , and boardwalks and beaches as welcoming as you will find anywhere in the country .
