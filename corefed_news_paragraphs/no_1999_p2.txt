Years before Mr. Flynn met Mr. Trump , his Mr. Flynn tenure running the Defense Intelligence Agency foreshadowed some of the same qualities he Mr. Flynn exhibited more recently as he Mr. Flynn plunged into politics and controversy as a key campaign adviser to Mr. Trump , who shared his Mr. Flynn to usurp what he Mr. Flynn as Washington ’s incompetent and corrupt elite .Many of those who observed the general ’s time at the the Defense Intelligence Agency him Mr. Flynn someone who alienated both superiors and subordinates with his Mr. Flynn temperament , his Mr. Flynn to brook dissent , and what his Mr. Flynn considered a conspiratorial worldview .Those qualities could prove problematic for a national security adviser , especially one who will have to mediate the conflicting views of cabinet secretaries and agencies for a president with no experience in defense or foreign policy issues .Traditionally , the job has gone to a Washington veteran : Condoleezza Rice , for instance , or Thomas E. Donilon .
