@charliespieringHowley February 20 , 2016 ,   There are many more examples of Rubio ’s campaign credentialing Rubio News Breitbart —   who are credentialed not just by the White House , but also by the U. S. Congress and have been covering campaigns ranging from those of Rubio ’s mentor , former Florida Gov. Jeb Rubio to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Rubio billionaire Donald Trump to Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and more —   than there are room for on the pages of Breitbart News .In fact , Bush , Rubio ’s mentor , Rubio literally did an interview this week in South Carolina with Breitbart News in which he said at the end of it :" Thanks for your coverage of our campaign .
