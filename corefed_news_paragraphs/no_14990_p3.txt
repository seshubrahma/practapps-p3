I could n’t have been the only one who caught what looked like a snarl on President Donald Trump lips when President Donald Trump looked in her direction during President Donald Trump February speech to Congress .Last week President Donald Trump blamed the Democrats     and implicitly her     for the GOP ’s failure to replace Obamacare .And on fundamental issues like tax cuts for the rich , undermining Planned Parenthood and denying climate change , turning toward Planned Parenthood will likely be a complete   .But here ’s a secret : When it comes to passing legislation that ’s in the best interest of the American people and reflects the priorities of the House Democratic Caucus and candidates , Nancy Pelosi will work to deliver the votes , no matter who ’s holding the speaker ’s gavel or sitting in the Oval Office .
