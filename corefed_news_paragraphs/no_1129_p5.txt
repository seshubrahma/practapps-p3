More a chat ’n’ chew between Tony    actresses getting the chance to share a Broadway stage for the first time in " War Paint , " one of a    new musicals debuting in a mad cram before the season ends .Dressed in a confusion of stretchy black clothing and scarves , the two women were sharing a sofa in the upper half of a sleek duplex at 663 Fifth Avenue , where the flagship of Elizabeth Arden ’s signature spa , the Red Door , moved five years ago from the florid former Aeolian Building two blocks north .They had refused treatments and the two women instead efficiently slurping vegetarian soups .In " War Paint , " which is now in previews and opens at the Nederlander Theater on April 6 , Ms. Ebersole , 64 , plays Miss Arden , née Florence Nightingale Graham : the entrepreneur who made cosmetics , long associated with prostitutes , acceptable and desirable to the American middle and upper classes starting in the 1910s .
