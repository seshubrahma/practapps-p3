voting allows me to select leaders who will work to right past and present wrongs , ensure that their Muslims and immigrants     and rights are upheld , and create a more equitable America .    All across the nation this fall , millions of my fellow Americans are also putting their millions of my fellow Americans into action .That â€™s not helplessness .
