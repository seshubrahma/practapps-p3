Mook Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook ," I think what ’s very disturbing about this entire situation is first that there ’s a foreign power , aggressively breaking in to data systems trying to apparently influence the out come of the campaign , but then we saw the other day that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made comments to actually encouraging more of this behavior , more espionage in the race .I think every voter needs to take note of thisand I find it very frightening that any presidential campaign for any reason is encouraging this kind of behavior .
