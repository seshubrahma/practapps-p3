Just look at the number of requests for       visas as proof .Last year , some 233 , 000 visas were requested , far exceeding the 65 , 000 cap that was set back in 1990     before the internet age changed our labor and skill needs .   Meanwhile , Trump has called the    a waste of time , misrepresenting and mischaracterizing the program along the way .He ’s argued that the visa program actually outsources Trump jobs as opposed the program , which is what every academic study     including this one from the Journal of Labor Economics     says is reality .
