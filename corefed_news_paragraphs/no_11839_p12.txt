Somehow , I doubt they would Progressives outraged if Trump threatened to deport the Westboro Baptist Church .This , despite the fact that the Westboro Baptists have n’t killed anyone , whereas a Muslim , Omar Mateen , carried out the greatest act of homophobic violence in U. S. history .The Left , of course , think Orlando was a tragic incident of workplace violence , enabled by toxic masculinity and a lack of gun control .I ’m comfortable with people who are uncomfortable with gays , as long as they do people who are uncomfortable with gays want to kill us , maim us or us us off us .
