One of my first stops was Williamson , a decimated coal town in West Virginia .Williamson, a decimated coal town in West Virginia had a sports bar , which offered beer for $ 1 on Thursdays , and a biker bar where , Williamson, a decimated coal town in West Virginia was said , patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke .Both were filled with Trump voters , little surprise since Trump had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the Obama administration ’s environmental regulations and cheap natural gas .In Williamson , I also saw how Trump ’s message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him Trump winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core Republican constituency .
