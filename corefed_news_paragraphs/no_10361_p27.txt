Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama is one of approximately one elected officials I completely trust to protect Americans from the cheap    rich   —    which is why Trump needs to keep him in the Senate .The same consultants who would have told Trump to never , ever mention immigration are telling him now that he needs a Christie , a Newt , a Corker , Trump Rubio   —    or a woman .( Because that Trump how Margaret Thatcher emerged .No one had Trump heard her Trump until the British Conservative Party decided it needed a woman on the ticket ! )
