Hernandez ’s reasoning is one of ideology , not facts .It advances Hernandez’s reasoning narrative that lauds the appearance of compassion towards immigrants but never truly confronts the policy ’s substance or how    can hurt the very audience that sanctuary cities are said to help .Had Hernandez done Hernandez , she would    realized that sanctuary cities are the policy equivalent of a dead end .Nothing moves forward .
