My husband , a The    French Nancy captain in The    French U. S. Army Reserves , and I had started Evangelicals for Mitt the year before [ 2006 ] and   —    through a series of coincidences and opportunities   —    I ended up helping Ann Romney on a writing project .In my normal life , I was a     Mitt of two , so life consisted of car lines , lunchboxes , and afternoon volleyball games .
