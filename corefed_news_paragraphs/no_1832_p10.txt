I went to 10 rallies in six states , traveling more than 6 , 000 miles ( that ’s nine flights in four days ) .After all that , I did n’t get closer than 30 yards from either candidate .The view was often better on television .Yet as they galloped down the home straight of this bitterly contentious race , the trip revealed less a snapshot of America than a measure of its temperature .
