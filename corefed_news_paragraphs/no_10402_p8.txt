After quoting Prof . Posner , Law Professor Eugene Volokh , of the UCLA School or Law , adds that following :   " I would add that , in Kleindienst v. Mandel ( 1972 )the Supreme Court applied the ‘ plenary power doctrine’ to the exclusion of people based on their political beliefs , despite the Free Speech Clause .The cases that Posner is referring to , together with Kleindienst , suggest that the exclusion of people based on their religious beliefs is likewise constitutional ."
