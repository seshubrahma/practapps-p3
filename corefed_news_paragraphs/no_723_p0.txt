OXON HILL , Md.   —    In an administration hardly five weeks old , Stephen K. Bannon ’s reputation has taken on almost mythic proportion as a    populist , emerging power center , man of mystery .When Mr. Bannon , President Trump ’s chief strategist , appeared in public on Thursday for the first time since Mr. Bannon , it was to deliver , in the president own combative way , a message of soothing reassurance to the conservative activists gathered here for their annual assessment known as the Conservative Political Action Conference .Do not believe the " corporatist globalist media " that was " crying and weeping " on election night and is still " dead wrong " about what the Trump administration is doing .
