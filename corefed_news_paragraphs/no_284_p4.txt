Maybe the political air is turbulent but the country ’s tectonic fundamentals remain solid .Maybe American politics and geopolitics rest on a foundation as immovable as the rivers and plains of the country itself .For those who feel disoriented , and also ( perhaps especially ) for those who feel triumphant , Robert D. Kaplan ’s small but magisterial new book , " Earning the Rockies , " is a tonic , because it brings fundamentals back into view .With only 180 uncrowded pages of text , this is a book that can be read on a     flight , but fully digesting this will take much longer .
