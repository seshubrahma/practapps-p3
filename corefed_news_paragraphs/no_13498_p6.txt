And they fail to realise how putting a spotlight the U. S. administration, and the wider   cabal an already morally questionable institution like the United Nations   —    replete with its Human Rights Council with the likes of the United Nations   Arabia chairing it   —    brings the UN itself , not Israel ’s    policies , into question .So expect a resurgence of the American Sovereignty Act and an invigorated USexit movement in the next few months .There are of course a few reasons for the U. S. to maintain the United Nations on its home turf   —    not least the U. S. fact that the New    organisation allows the U. S. to spy on almost every the U. S. world from the comfort of downtown Manhattan .
