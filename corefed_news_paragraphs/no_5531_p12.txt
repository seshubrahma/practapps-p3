When you have both houses of Congress and the White House , there is no excuse for the Congress   —    even when you do n’t have a    60 votes in the Senate .Besides the various parliamentary rules that can be employed when you have the majority on every committee as well as the floor , the sausage factory model of legislation is always available .A good example is the Republican enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 .
