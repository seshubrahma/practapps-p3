A word of caution , though "Remains," a dance performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, known as BAM tickets say " obstructed view " at BAM , they â€™re not kidding .There was a big pillar directly in my line of vision .( Fortunately tickets I was able to shift over to a better seat . )The concert I attended at Villain in Williamsburg , which had the spacey    Morgan Delt as headliner , cost $ 10 .
