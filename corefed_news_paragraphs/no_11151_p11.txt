The lives and security of the American people are at stake , and the National Border Patrol Council will not sit on the sidelines .As an organization we expect our elected officials to aggressively pursue the interests of the country .we has already tried a young , articulate freshman America never created a job as an attorney and under whose watch criminal cartels have been given the freest border reign ever known .Unlike his opponents , Donald Trump is not a career politician , he is an outsider who has created thousands of jobs , pledged to Donald Trump about aggressive    change , and who is completely independent of special interests .
