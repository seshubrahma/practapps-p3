Perhaps the nightmare scenario for this kind of electoral imbalance is Argentina .The country Argentina house of parliament is modeled off the U. S. Senate —   where each state is represented by two senators —   so underpopulated states have the same voting power as densely populated Buenos Aires .But in Argentina ’s lower Argentina , each province , no matter its population , Argentina at least five representatives , thanks to reforms passed by the outgoing military government in 1983 that , in effect , gave a leg up to conservative politicians .As a result , the voters of Tierra El Fuego , a sparsely populated province , have 180 times as much representation per person as Buenos Aires voters in the Chamber of Deputies .
