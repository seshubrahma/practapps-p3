The Republican bill is expected to eliminate the subsidies .This would make insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans and sharply reduce the number who buy their own health insurance .With many fewer people buying coverage , the insurance markets are likely to become increasingly unstable .Many insurers will stop offering policies , and the remaining customers are likely to be sicker than current Obamacare buyers , a reality that will drive up the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it , and force more people out of the markets .
