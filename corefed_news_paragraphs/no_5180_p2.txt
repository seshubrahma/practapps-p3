The opposite has been repeatedly demonstrated .Ice cores have revealed that changes in CO2 concentration follow , rather than precede , changes in temperature .During the last deglaciation , the latest    records show atmospheric CO2 lagging temperature by 50 to 500 years .Our enterprises and industries return to the air some of the CO2 that was formerly present there , and some warming may be expected .
