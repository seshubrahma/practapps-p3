[ " Today ’s admission by the Obama Administration that Obamacare is an unaffordable disaster should come as a surprise to no one , and this only reaffirms the American public ’s belief that the entire program was one big lie , " Trump stated in a press release on Tuesday , adding :   Not only are they now willing to admit that health insurance premiums under Obamacare are going to skyrocket by 25 % they still are n’t telling us the truth !Rates are going to go up much higher , maybe as high as 80 % or even 100 % in some places due to the lack of competition .According to Fox News ’s Bret Baier , several key swing states are seeing increases greater than 50 percent : " Here ’s the reality   —    Americans were lied to when us were told us could keep us doctor , us were lied to when us were told us could keep us health plan , and us were lied to when us were told this would lower health care costs , " Trump continued , adding : And to make matters worse , the architects of ObamaCare , Jonathan Gruber and Hillary Clinton , KNEW the architects of ObamaCare, Jonathan Gruber and Hillary Clinton were telling us lies , because the architects of ObamaCare, Jonathan Gruber and Hillary Clinton ’re trying to move us toward a    system where the healthy pay for the sick .This , my friends , is the rigged system .
