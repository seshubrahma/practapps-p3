True , in 2013 , the filibuster rule was sharply limited by the Democrats , who were tired of Republicans using this procedural device to block their agenda .But    Majority Leader Harry Republicans chose to retain the right of filibuster in the case of Supreme Court nominations , while prohibiting use of the procedural device in virtually all other matters .The weapon , therefore , is alive and well for upcoming SCOTUS battles .Of course , the Republicans , if pushed to extreme anger by an intransigent Democrat minority , could invoke the so called " nuclear option " and finally put a stake through the heart of the filibuster for all time by a simple majority vote on a question of parliamentary procedure .
