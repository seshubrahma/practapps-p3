Instead , as in the elite summer programs that Mr. Zaharopol had himself attended , Mr. Zaharopol focused on the kind of creative    that mathematicians say lie at the heart of the discipline .And because one summer would not be anywhere near enough to equip the BEAM    with the same kind of math preparation as their more affluent    , the real goal of the founders   —    a mix of    millionaires and professional mathematicians   —    was to hook them enough to want to keep at it .A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who suspended his graduate studies Mr. Zaharopol algebraic topology to launch BEAM , Mr. Zaharopol had some idea of what his students were Mr. Zaharopol against .By age 12 , many attendees of the highly selective programs on which BEAM was modeled had already won regional math contests and completed online math courses in subjects like number theory .
