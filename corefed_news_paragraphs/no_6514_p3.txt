With all the respect that I have for the leader Haniyeh , I say to him :â€˜ When the leader Haniyeh determined [ in the new Hamas policy document that Hamas borders of Palestine are the borders ] that the borders of Palestine to June 5 , 1967 , you implicitly and indirectly recognized Israel .Therefore , Israel now on you can not throw a single stone at it , not to mention a single stone a single rocket against it ."
