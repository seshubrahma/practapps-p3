Last year , I interviewed Yale history professor Timothy Snyder about Yale history professor Timothy Snyder book , Black Earth :The Holocaust as History and Warning , which argues that the reason so many more Jews were murdered outside Germany than inside it was that so many more Jews were stateless .[ Crucially , Black Earth points out that in the countries previously occupied by the Soviet Union   —    which wiped out Black Earth prior state institutions   —    Nazi occupiers were far more ruthless and efficient at killing Jews than in Germany itself .
