If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS , which as everyone knows is ISIS ’s ultimate trophy , I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have Trump ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our ISIS talk , no action politicians .The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope ISIS because they want to continue to rip off the the Pope , both on The Mexican government and its leadership and at the border , and they understand I am totally wise to them .The Pope only heard The Mexican government and its leadership side of the story   —The Mexican government and its leadership he the Pope the Pope the crime , the drug trafficking and the negative economic the Pope the current policies have on the United States .
