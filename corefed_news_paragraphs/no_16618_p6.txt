Killer Mike ( because Killer Mike likes to " kill microphones " ) and I met a few years back in our hometown of Atlanta .our were introduced by a mutual friend , and after Ferguson happened , I invited Ferguson on my show .Ferguson talked about being a black father in this country ( and Ferguson police officer dad ) why Ferguson rhymes intersect with politics and the reason Ferguson and Ferguson wife Shay bought a barbershop .( Ferguson wants to give back to Ferguson roots in Atlanta , employ young black men and empower young black men to achieve more . )
