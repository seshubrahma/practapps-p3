BEIJING   —    The missiles were being prepared even before the two men finished dinner , disrupting the carefully choreographed proceedings .The American attack on Syria on Thursday unraveled China ’s well laid plans for a summit meeting that would present President Xi Jinping as a global leader on par with President Trump , at once stealing the spotlight from Mr. Xi and putting Mr. Xi in a difficult position : choosing between condoning the kind of unilateral military action that China has long opposed , or rebuking Mr. Xi host .Mr. Xi dilemma was also acute because China has generally sided with Russia in defending Syria ’s president , Bashar    and because it worries that Mr. Trump might be prepared to order a similar strike on North Korea , Chinese and Western analysts said .
