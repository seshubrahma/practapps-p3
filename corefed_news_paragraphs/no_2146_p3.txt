To borrow an analogy , there is a blue , or more    Israel that thought Mr. Kerryâ€™s offered painful but necessary truths in the spirit of friendship that indicted the failed leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .And there is a red , or more conservative , Israel that thought the secretary of state was delusional and insulting , divorced from the harsh reality of the only real democracy in the Middle East struggling to preserve itself the Middle East a hostile neighborhood .Just as in the United States , many Israelis cling to their many Israelis facts , retreat to their many Israelis media outlets , advance their their own media outlets narratives , and basically just talk with people who think like they their own media outlets .The result is a politics that is almost as internally divided as the relationship with Palestinians is externally .
