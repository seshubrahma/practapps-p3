It just did nâ€™t feel right .But a podcast is superflexible as a format , and it needs a a   documentary .It needs somebody to tell the story thoseAnd so it was a way for me to show that it was coming from a place of love and a podcast from a place of a podcast concern , and show my point of view without a podcast it about me .
