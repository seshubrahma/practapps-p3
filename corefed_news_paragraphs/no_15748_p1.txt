The week started with Kathy Griffin and a severed head , and ended with Bill Maher and a word too offensive to print .   For comedians , what defines " too far"     and , more importantly , the optics around it     can land the optics around it     in hot water or even end the optics around it     careers .Kathy Griffin and a severed head are Bill Maher the first comedians to push the envelope or cross a line .
