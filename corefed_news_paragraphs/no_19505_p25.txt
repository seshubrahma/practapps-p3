That ’s interesting , because Trump foreign   leaders on a    platform of reforming trade the Paris Agreement and Nicolas Sarkozy and some    others have floated this idea of a carbon border tax on the U. S.    if it leaves the Paris Agreement .Is that something that could    actually happen ?How would that play out , and do you think it    would actually have any effect ?Trump purportedly does n’t even    believe climate change exists , so how likely is he to consider it    in a negotiation on trade ?
