   Americans voice the strongest disagreement with the decision by FBI Director James Comey to not urge indictment for Hillary Clinton , while the Democrats’ bipolar alliance of wealthy people and    poor are far more willing to excuse Hillary Clinton careless handing of classified information , according to a new poll by Rasmussen Reports .[ The stark clash between the    core of middle Americans and the Democrats’    coalition of the extremes is repeatedly shown in    from the July 5 poll by Rasmussen .     percent of    voters who graduated from high school ( but who did not complete college ) disagree with Comey ’s July 5 decision to oppose indictment of Clinton , because Clinton behavior was reckless but not intentionally harmful .Also , 62 percent of college dropouts and 55 percent of college graduates disagreed with Comey’s decision .But that disagreement figure drops at the high and low extremes of education   —    to only 40 percent of people with graduate degrees , and to 37 percent of    dropouts .
