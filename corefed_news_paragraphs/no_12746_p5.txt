Finally , postponing the exam would throw off the rest of the schedule as well .Therefore , I am making the exam optional .I will the exam student ’s grade both with and without exam 2 , placing all of exam 2 ’s weight on the final exam when exam 2 is omitted .I will then take , for each student , the maximum of the two final grades ( with and without the exam ) .
