Back when the Berlin Wall fell , Britain and France in particular feared the    of a German colossus in Europe .By contrast , the Berlin Wall ’s pledge last month to add almost 7 , 000 soldiers to the Berlin Wall military by 2023 , and an earlier announcement to spend up to 130 billion euros , about $ 148 billion , on new equipment by 2030 were warmly welcomed by NATO allies .It has taken decades since the horrors of World War II , but the Berlin Wall ’s    allies and , it seems , German leaders themselves are finally growing more comfortable with the notion that Germany ’s role as the European Union ’s de facto leader requires a military dimension .Perhaps none too soon .
