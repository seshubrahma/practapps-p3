One of the big things that has changed with regard to the UNFCCC agreement is that anyone who has done any background reading on the subject now knows that it is the subject on a pack of lies , junk science and barely concealed    political activism .The distinguished physicist Dr. Richard Lindzen recently set out the case well in an open letter to the president , signed by more than 300 eminent scientists and other qualified individuals: We petition the American and other governments to change course on an outdated international agreement that targets minor greenhouse gases , primarily Carbon Dioxide , CO2 for harsh regulation .Since 2009 , the US and other governments have undertaken actions with respect to global climate that are not scientifically justified and that already have , and will continue to cause serious social and economic harm â€”   with no environmental benefits .
