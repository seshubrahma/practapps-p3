This needs context .In 2017 , premiums for the benchmark plan increased by 22 percent on average across the states that use the federal marketplace or have their own the federal marketplace , according to the Department of Health and Human Services .Some places had higher increases ( 116 percent in Arizona , the only state with a    increase ) and some lower ( 9 percent in Wyoming ) .That â€™s much higher than the 7 percent increase in 2016 and 3 percent increase in 2015 , but looking at premium increases alone does not fully capture what people are paying .
