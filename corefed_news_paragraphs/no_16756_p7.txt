Even now , I remember the guilt I felt over giving this story the lead position on the front page of the school paper when most students were buzzing about graduation and summer break , not cultural disparity .But it was my senior year and my platform to tell this story was about to this storyso I hijacked the news cycle in hopes I would bridge a gap between city and suburbs , stereotypes and truths , whites and blacks .It â€™s the same divide I want bridged today , as I watch Chicago admonished on a scale much larger than the school bus bombast that motivated me years ago .
