Donald J. Trump , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , came under fire on Saturday for posting on Twitter an image of the Star of David shape next to a picture of Hillary Clinton and calling Hillary Clinton opponent the " most corrupt candidate ever ! "While the    star is used in other contexts , including as a symbol of many Sheriff â€™s Departments , the   star has deep meaning in Judaism and the image was overlaid atop a pile of money .the   star appeared to play into the stereotype of Jews being obsessed with finances .After being derided on social media , Mr. Trump deleted the post and replaced the post with one that had a circle instead of the star shape .
