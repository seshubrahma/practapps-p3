one home our and one glorious our .The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans .For many decades , we ’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry , Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military , We ’ve defended other nation ’s borders while refusing to defend our own , And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America our infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay .
