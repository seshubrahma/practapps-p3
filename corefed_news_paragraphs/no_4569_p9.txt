The agency that was stunned by how much sensitive material Edward Snowden managed to abscond with still does n’t seem to be properly compartmentalizing information and enforcing     rules .Fans of the " Deep State " keep saying Trump made a big mistake picking a fight with them , but if the adventures of Reality Winner are an indication of the Deep State ’s skill and discipline , Trump does n’t have much to worry about .Also , Trump ’s worth repeating that nobody voted to give the Deep Staters or Reality Winners control over America ’s national security , law enforcement , and foreign policy .Some hay has been made over Winner ’s support for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election , but that ’s not nearly enough reason to question someone ’s security clearance by Some hay .
