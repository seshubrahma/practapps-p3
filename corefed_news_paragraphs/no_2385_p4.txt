The authorities had not announced any arrests as of Monday afternoon .The sense that the attack did not reflect the spirit of Hillsborough was shared on Monday by liberals and conservatives , who said that this town of 6 , 000 people , about 40 miles northwest of Raleigh , had found a way to peacefully manage the cultural and political tension that had come to define it .it is a tension between a    Southern conservative faction and a crowd of mostly    artists , authors , tech workers and foodies   â€”    a mix of people who have reimagined Hillsborough in the past 15 years or so , bringing art galleries , good restaurants and good coffee .Today , it is the kind of North Carolina hamlet where the butter beans come in a thoughtful $ 27 dish of tortelloni with kale butter and pecorino .
