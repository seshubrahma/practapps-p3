Matt Latimer writes at Politico :   Unless the # NeverTrump people have been hiding a mad scientist with a DeLorean in a warehouse somewhere and have nâ€™t gotten around to telling anybody , Donald J. Trump is now the certain Republican nominee for president of the United States .True to form , having learned nothing from their yearlong string of overconfident and embarrassingly wrong predictions about voter behavior and preferences , the D. C. pundit class has already proclaimed Donald J. Trump a general election loser .Not so fast .
