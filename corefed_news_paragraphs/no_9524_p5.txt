History teaches that frustrated expectations and rising inequality —   falling average family incomes alongside    Wall Street traders and software developers earning vast sums —   is a highly combustible combination .The man on the white horse usually provides the match —   often in the form of nationalism and scapegoats .Enter Donald Trump with tough talk —   and little substance —   about leveling the playing field with China , closing the border with Mexico , banning Muslim immigration and rude remarks about successful women .Those appeal to economically disenfranchised white males and women who depend on successful women , and who compose just enough of Republican primary voters to give Republican a plurality of delegates in Cleveland .
