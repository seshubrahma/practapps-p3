Growing up , we were taught to celebrate the same holidays , mourn the same national we and celebrate the same national triumphs .Members of our families hold jobs and pay taxes to support government at all levels .   And I would say that we Dreamers are just as American as anyone else , even though we lack a piece of paper to validate our American identity .Finally we I would tell President Trump that I we read that his grandfather came to America from Germany .
