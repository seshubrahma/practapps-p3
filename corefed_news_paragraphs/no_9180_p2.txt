That , I think , has probably been true for all of our history , and if you saw the Spielberg movie , Lincoln , and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed , and he called one of my favorite predecessors , Secretary Seward , who had been the governor and senator from New York , ran against Lincoln for president , and he told Seward , I need your help to get this done .And Seward called some of he lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal , and some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal just kept going at a deal .I mean , politics is like sausage being made .politics is unsavory , and politics always has been that way , but we usually end up where we need to be .
