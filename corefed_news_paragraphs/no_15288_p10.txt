When a violent video uploaded by a murderer , weary of seeing such violence online , ask tech companies to " fix this , " the challenge for each platform is , in a sense , simple : to implement this consensus as effectively as possible .This is in part a resourcing challenge , with greater investment allowing more rapid review and reaction once a video is flagged by a user as requiring priority consideration for removal .It is in part a technical challenge , with the potential for automated review , informed by machine learning , to accelerate a company â€™s responsivity .   All in all , the basic approach is to restore a gatekeeper , at least for a video so horrific as to merit gatekeeping .
