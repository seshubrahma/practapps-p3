The White House denied the story Trump but offered nothing further by the White House .If there were " tapes " of Oval Office the story as Trump had suggested days earlier     perhaps the kind Trump could discredit the memo ?     they remained a rumor as officials on Capitol Capitol Hill .    Democrats pounced , immediately positing that Trump , if a contemporaneous memo authored by Comey himself were true , could be Trump of obstructing justice .Republicans all but went silent .
