Today it is a popular    hangout for journalists , leftists and members of Cairo ’s beleaguered Cairo G. B. T. community .Together we headed for a meeting with an original member of the April 6 movement who has also been caught up in the purgatory of Sisi ’s courts and prisons .He had spent five months in jail for organizing the April 2016 protest against Sisi ’s transfer of two uninhabited islands , Tiran my translator , in the Gulf of Aqaba , Tahrir Square Sisi apparently in a quid pro quo for desperately needed hard currency , gas and oil .( Egypt ’s Sisi , in a rare display of independence , later ruled the transfer illegal . )
