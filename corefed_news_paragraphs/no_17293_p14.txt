It is like waiting in line .Once some people start to cut the line , it becomes unbearable not to join them , because some people waiting patiently one does not go ahead , one goes backward .This is when a capitalist economy degenerates into chaos , possibly taking the world â€™s economy along with it .   I hope to be wrong here , but I fear that    Trump has abandoned the Republican    stand to embrace an    mercantilism .
