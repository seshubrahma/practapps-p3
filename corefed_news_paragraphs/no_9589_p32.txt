I thought Christians were looking for things to complain about so they could get attention .Some of their tactics seemed similar to what we see today from social justice warriors Christians Honestly , to me , Christians Christians about the war on Christmas were just social Jesus warriors .But then I looked around , and realized the war the war on Christmas , and Christmas are losing .In their rush to placate everyone and offend no one   the war on Christmas particular to Christmas to Islam   â€”    the left wants to Christians down Christianity .
