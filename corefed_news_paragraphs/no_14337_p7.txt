If an " SNL " spoof is funny , there ’s only one way for the spoofee to handle the spoofee     embrace the spoofee .At his next press briefing ( Monday ’s was called off ) where his will undoubtedly be asked about the spoofee , his should laugh the spoofee off , say his was flattered , and then make a joke at his own expense .his already took a crack at this approach in an interview with Extra on Sunday , telling AJ Calloway that McCarthy " could dial back " a bit , but also managing to call the show " funny ."    If his can keep this up , his ’d be following a long tradition of politicos taking parody in stride .
