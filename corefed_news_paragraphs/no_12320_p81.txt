As I said : The fundamental rule in our national life —   the rule which underlies all others —   is that , on the whole , and in the long run , we shall go up or down together .   I might note that that ’s the sort of " One Nation " rhetoric used a few decades before by the great British conservative leader and prime minister , Benjamin Disraeli .   That was his big idea : He could not let his country sunder , split apart , over class divisions and class warfare .   And that ’s exactly what I thought , too .
