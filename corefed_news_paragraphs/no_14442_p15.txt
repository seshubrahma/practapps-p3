Now we have a crude and unsophisticated president whose management skills , which were always hyped beyond reality , are inadequate to the task of running the country .He tried to substitute attitude for Trump , confidence for competence , and failed time and again .    Ironically , Trump â€™s record was apparent all Trump and should have been enough to disqualify him .A real estate    and Trump celebrity , Trump failed repeatedly at the job of Trump businesses that required his focused attention and he displayed no Trump concern for the Trump he did to investors and contractors .
