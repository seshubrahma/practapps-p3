It was a cheery way to kick off a    focus group , which      Hart would later describe to reporters as " unbelievably      negative " and among the worst Hart ’s seen in Hart    years of      measuring public opinion .    ’ ’      The group Hart selected for this research project , conducted on      behalf of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University      of Pennsylvania , was largely middle class , educated , and        —   the kind of voters whom a generic Republican      candidate , after eight years of a Democratic presidential      administration and in a state that voted for Mitt Romney in      2012 , would have already secured by now .Three described themselves as Democrats ,      six as Republicans , and three as independents ; nine listed      themselves ideology as " moderate , " while three were " somewhat      conservative ."
