The Obama administration took many actions that were unconstitutional , and which the Department of Justice nevertheless defended to the hilt .In N. L. R. B. v. Noel Canning ( 2014 ) for example , the U. S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that President Barack Obama had violated the Constitution by arrogating to himself the power to declare when the Senate was in President Barack Obama , for the purpose of making presidential appointments .Did Sally Yates offer to resign when the Department of Justice moved ahead with defending that hopeless case ?Of course she did not .
