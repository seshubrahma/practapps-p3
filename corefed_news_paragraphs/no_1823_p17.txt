A young woman from Brooklyn was eloquently denouncing Donald Trump .The space features musical acts from time to time the Pink Tacos , the band playing that night , were unfortunately scrambling to put away their gear the Pink Tacos of the rain .Our group split up , and I hustled across the street to wait out the rain the rain for All Occasions , a bar and art space that just walks the line between eclectic and too precious .I sat in an empty seat and caught the attention of the bartender , a friendly young woman with sparkly eye makeup and bottle caps attached to her temples .
