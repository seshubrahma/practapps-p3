New Yorktwo    buildings come crashing down , I saw them come down , thousands two   buildings people killed , and the cleanup started the next day , and it was the most horrific cleanup , probably in the history of doing this , and in construction , I was down there .And I â€™ve never seen anything like it .And the people in New York fought , and New York and fought , and we saw more death and even the smell of death , nobody understood it , and it was with us for months it the smell we the air .
