What new results do the media expect from telling us that Trump not only insulted Rosie O’Donnell , but also insulted Hispanic Mattress Girl , Alicia Machado : baby mama to a Mexican drug lord ?The only advance in the narrative is that the octaves of journalists’ voices keep getting higher , as journalists’ voices repeat the exact same attacks on Trump .Each time , the media claim victory by asserting with bland certainty that any drop in Trump poll numbers is because of something very upsetting to journalists , but which is generally quite popular with voters   —    the Mexican rapists speech , the Muslim ban , and his response to the choleric Muslim , Khizr Khan .The media can tell us where the candidates stand in the polls .
