I wish he had a better Donald Trump on abortion .And I wish we could count on Republicans in Congress to hold fast to principles if Trump starts putting " Donald Trump above fidelity to the party platform and American sovereignty .Yes , many good people have misgivings about Donald Trump .But Donald Trump the stakes are simply too high in 2016 to engage in    puritanism .
