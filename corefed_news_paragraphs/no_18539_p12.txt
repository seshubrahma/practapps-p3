If you look at service between the Eastern US and the West    Coast , flight times today are much longer than they were 20 or 30    flight times today ago , and it’’s not because the airplanes are moving slower   —      it’ ’s because we confine ourselvesit’ a fraction of the we    airspace because we simply don’’t have the ATC we to    be able to support taking full advantage of that .
