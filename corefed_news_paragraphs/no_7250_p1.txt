The Daily Mail notes : The magazine ’s views have continually clashed with the ideological principles in which Clinton has Clinton her political Clinton , including articles embracing    homophobic ,    and    views .One article , published during Huma Abedin ’s tenure , claimed that many Americans have a ‘ distorted and negative view’ of Islam , Muslims and Arabs   —    ranging from perceptions of ‘ poverty , filth , the desert’ to ideas that ‘ their ‘ sport’ ( other than sex , of course ) is to destabilize Western economies and ruin the world in order to master it’ .The piece from 1999 also alleges that there are deep ties between the upper echelons of U. S. politics and      suggesting that Jewish people have been able to ‘ work the system’ and are ‘ greatly aided by the American memory of the Holocaust’ and Israel serving as America ’s ally in the Middle East .Other articles in the journal reportedly blamed the U. U. S.    terror attacks , and featured retrograde views on the status of women and    families .
