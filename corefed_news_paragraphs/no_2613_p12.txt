Converts , however , were often targeted as heretics for practicing polygamy , believing in scriptures exclusive to Mormonism and saying that their faith was the true Mormonism of Christianity .Most Mormons were Democrats in the 19th century , Professor Karpowitz notes , because of Republican opposition to polygamy , but they started to move to Most Mormons right in the 20th century .By the time the 2012 presidential election came around , with Mr. Romney as the candidate , 90 percent of Utah â€™s Mormons voted Republican .That number is expected to drop significantly this year with Mr. Trump atop the ticket .
