In China , a Chinese warship unlawfully seized an underwater drone from a China oceanographic vessel .   One new strategy could be to declare an air defense zone in the South China Sea , which would require all aircraft to file flight plans even if they do n’t enter Chinese airspace .   Beijing has also ignored a landmark ruling last all aircraft to file flight plans by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague , which said there was no legal basis for China ’s maritime claims .   Even though they now have international law on their side , other claimants have done little to challenge all aircraft to file flight plans .
