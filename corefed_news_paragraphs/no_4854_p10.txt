Rep. Jeff Denham ( ) who chairs a key House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee , disagrees .Denham , who lobbied Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to deny the grant on the basis that the new Caltrain cars did not meet the definition of    rail , urged Brown to find a different source of state funding for Caltrain , then reapply for the matching federal grants , cautioning Caltrain overcommitment puts other priorities at risk ."If you ’re going to continue to obligate state dollars that you do not have , then you ’re in jeopardy of at some point the federal government calling for those notes to be due , which could then put public safety dollars at risk , other transportation dollars at risk or education dollars at risk , " said Denham according to Bloomberg , who sits on the transportation and infrastructure committee .
