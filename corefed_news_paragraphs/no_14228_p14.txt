The Middle East today is a giant petri dish affording an ideal habitat for jihadis to survive .Ungoverned spaces , crumbling Arab state authority in places like Libya and Syria , Shia dominance and exclusion and repression of Sunnis is creating a ready made grievance narrative that allows ISIS to recruit fellow Sunnis .Eradicating ISIS and other jihadi groups would require a Middle ISIS that is stable , inclusive and reasonably well governed , something that ’s just not in the cards .   In short , there ’s no more winning the war against jihadi terror than there is winning the war against mental illness , drugs , crime or bigotry .
