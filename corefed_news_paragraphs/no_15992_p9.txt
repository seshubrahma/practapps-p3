I grieve that a terrible act of terror in Orlando immediately became an ideological " tug of war " in a fight for political territory .   I grieve that people are being left behind economically , and fear for their futures .   I despair that people have lost hope in what nevertheless remains the greatest nation on Earth .Yet , there is hope .
