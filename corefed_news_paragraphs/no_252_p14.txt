After some collaborations with big companies like Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer , Cellectis started Calyxt , to explore opportunities for using gene editing for foods .Dr. Choulika said he considered G. M. O.s safe , but that the Dr. Choulika techniques like those used by Calyxt would be more acceptable to consumers .Often in Calyxt M. O. s , the inserted genes came from unrelated species , like the bacterial genes that were added to cotton so that it would exude a toxin to repel bollworms ,a mixing of species known as transgenesis .
