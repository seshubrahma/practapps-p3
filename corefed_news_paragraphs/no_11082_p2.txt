The petition continues this petition We also believe that Saints’ decision to allow the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to perform at the upcoming presidential inauguration of Donald Trump DOES NOT reflect the values of Mormonism and does not represent its diverse 15+ million members worldwide," the petition, begun by one Randall Thacker, states official LDS organization performing at a presidential inauguration gives the perception that the LDS Church and its diverse 15 + the LDS Church members worldwide support an incoming president ’s agenda , values and behaviors .   Performing at other government events would not be a concern (e. g. national holidays such as July 4th ) .As members and friends of The Church of Jesus Christ of    Saints , we strongly urge the Church to stop The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints and especially for an incoming president who has demonstrated sexist , racist , misogynistic , and xenophobic behavior that does not align with the principles and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ
