Tommy Vietor , a former national security spokesman for Mr. Obama , said that if Democrats were conventionally cast as the " mommy party " and Republicans as the " daddy party " in American politics , then " Trump is the crazy uncle and Hillary Clinton is the only person you trust to watch your family for a week ."Mr. Trump has also cast doubt on American participation in NATO and spoken warmly of Vladimir V. Putin , the Russian president and strongman Trump in recent days , he has feuded with Robert M. Gates , a highly regarded former defense secretary , and found himself mocked by another respected national security figure Trump former Secretary of State Colin Powell , who called Mr. Trump " a national disgrace and Trump international pariah " in private emails released by Donald Trump .Whatever doubts many voters still have about Mrs. Clinton â€™s trustworthiness , most appear to consider her better suited to manage foreign policy and threats to the American people .
