Zelizer , the Princeton historian who organized the gathering , said before the proceedings .The purpose of the    event , which broke down the Obama presidency into topics including inequality , counterterrorism , immigration , the Supreme Court and race , was to offer what Mr. Zelizer called a historical " first cut , " by scholars who had " lived and felt " the events of Obama ’s terms in office .( The 15 papers , after revisions and editing , will be published in a book by Princeton University Press in about a year   —      by the standards of scholarly publishing . )The mood among the overwhelmingly liberal group   —    in contrast to how some participants recalled a similar gathering in 2008 to assess the presidency of George W. Bush , in the giddy days after President Obama ’s election   —    was decidedly grim .
