And so it is with Russia and the United States .Russia has an interest in not getting along with the United States , which is going to frustrate any American administration , like it or not .America ’s main interest overseas is in maintaining liberal ( small " l " ) systems of trade , investment and navigation that allow American companies to flourish , and in spreading associated values of liberal ( small " l " ) democracy that help keep the peace .Russia ’s main foreign policy interest is to overcome the geographic disadvantage of largely being cut off from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans by maintaining a network of client states with better access to either .
