A week ago , it would have seemed wildly unlikely to most people that Donald J. Trump , not Hillary Clinton , would be the candidate more likely to provoke a    shift in how we think of and talk about sexual assault .But since the release on Friday of a recording in which Trump essentially admits Trump has a habit of sexually assaulting women , a series of stories involving the Republican nominee seems to be doing just that .Consider the story of the former People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff , whom Trump reportedly pushed up against a wall and kissed in 2005 .Stoynoff chose to move on with Stoynoff life rather than speak publicly about what Stoynoff says Trump did to Stoynoff .
