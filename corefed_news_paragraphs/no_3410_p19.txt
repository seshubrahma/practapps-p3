If Democrats did n’t believe they had a reserve army of immigrant voters for Clinton , they might have nominated Biden or Sanders to instead Democrats ordinary Americans to their side .Amusingly , if those Democrats did n’t exist , American voters’ incomes would be higher   — ordinary Americans and fewer would have been angry enough to shift their votes to the GOP ’s candidate .   To sum it all up , everything about Clinton ’s nomination American voters’ incomes campaign stinks to high heaven .That ’s why Democrats should try to reform their own corrupt party before they lose again in 2020 , if only because they ca n’t overthrow the Constitution Democrats persuade the military to Democrats their next candidate .
