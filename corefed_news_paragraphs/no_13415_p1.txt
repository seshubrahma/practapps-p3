That ’s why I am glad to see    Trump is considering House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul to be Trump Secretary of Homeland Security .   Trump is the best pick .We need someone like House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul —   a lifelong Texan who knows every inch of the border —   to secure We territory once and for all and protect American sovereignty .
