The overall result is a big disparity among states : Some have seen a flood of new charter schools , while others have barely seen a trickle .States such as Arizona and Colorado instituted    regulations that helped fuel States such as Arizona and Colorado growth , while other states have much stricter rules : Iowa , where local school boards maintain control , has only a small number of approved charter schools .Currently , 43 states and Washington , D. C. have charter school laws .Congress set up funding during the Clinton administration to aid in charter school development , and Arizona and Colorado also make use of those funds , as do other states like California .
