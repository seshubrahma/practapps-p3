I ’ve also heard countless excuses from those not voting in this year’s elections .There ’s the familiar reasoning about not having time to register , or the registration process being too difficult ( there is some truth to this , especially in marginalized communities ) .   But there are also a new set of excuses from    especially those around my age .
