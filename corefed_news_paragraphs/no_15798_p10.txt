Creating written records immediately after     conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward .This had not been my practice in the past .I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person ( and never on the phone )     once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time , briefly , for him to say goodbye in late 2016 .In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions .
