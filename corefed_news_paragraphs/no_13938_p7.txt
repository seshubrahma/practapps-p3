What makes someone a " real man " ?Who do we want our sons we be ?And who do we want we and husbands to be ?Is the only " real man " an alpha male , one who denies his own vulnerability     sometimes denying it so forcefully that he mocks his denigrates ( or maybe just sneers at ) those he sees his less than perfect , as too vulnerable , as insufficiently tough and guarded ?
