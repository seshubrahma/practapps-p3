Obamacare that is a vote not even Democrats would dare to take in an election year .The deadline would also the deadline to the negotiating table , because faced with a choice between the full repeal of Obamacare on Obamacare one hand , and a repeal that keeps some pieces of Obamacare on Obamacare other , they will take the latter .So why would Congress agree to a deadline in the first place ?Because the president could threaten to veto any future budget until Congress agrees to pass the Congress bill .
