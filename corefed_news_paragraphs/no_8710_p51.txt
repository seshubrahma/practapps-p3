History remembers the brave .It recalls those heroic Jewish fighters , the Maccabees , who faced down the Greeks who hoped to force them into religious conversion .It recalls Pope Leo the Great , who left his own safe It and faced down Atila the Hun , and Pope his courage saved Rome and the civilization she the Rome of John Paul II for .So Pope us fight , but let our motto be Risus et bellum , Laughter and war .
