But as for myself Señor Hernandez would worry if my candidate were endorsed by the Señor Hernandez Hernandez characters of the world , and I am delighted that Señor Juan Hernandez is apoplectic over the plans announced by President Trump .   What lies ahead for U. S.   relations ?Your guess is as good as mine , but if Trump persists in his plans , Mexican bluster and outrage will be President Trump by a President Trump pragmatic accommodation .   The border will continue to be a point of conflict , but Mexico may come to realize that the end of the remittance cornucopia was inevitable .
