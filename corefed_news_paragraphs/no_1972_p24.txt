My the democratic world Netherlandsthe   allies was freed in 1945 , six years before I was born , by British and North American troops ( with the help of some very brave Poles ) .Those of us with no direct memories of this had still seen movies like " The Longest Day , " about the Normandy landings .John Wayne , Robert Mitchum and Kenneth More and his bulldog were our liberating heroes .
