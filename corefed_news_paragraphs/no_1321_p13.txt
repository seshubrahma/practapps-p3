It is true that DAPA and DACA also entitle beneficiaries to work permits , welfare benefits and the like , but the immigration law itself authorizes the executive branch to confer those benefits on anyone whom it decides not to deport , for whatever reason .Many critics have cited the " Take Care " clause of the Constitution , which , as you say , directs the president to " faithfully execute " the laws .But if Congress deprives the president of the resources necessary to deport everyone , then the president faithfully executes the laws by executing the ones he can afford to execute the president law as in ethics , " ought " implies the president can ."
