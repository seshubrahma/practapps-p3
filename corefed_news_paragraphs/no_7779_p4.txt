Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap .Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs .Forget your goddamned gypsum , and , if he has a problem with that , forget Ed Burke , too .The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious , selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles .
