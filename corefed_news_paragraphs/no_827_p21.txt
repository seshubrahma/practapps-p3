P. growth in China of 6 . 5 percent and a U. S. growth rate of 3 percent , China ’s military spending would be expected to surpass America ’s around 2040 , said Bonnie S. Glaser , the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and China in Washington .Among the issues that Chinese military planners must deal with is how to handle the retrenchment of 300 , 000 personnel announced by President Xi Jinping in 2015 , part of an effort to streamline the P. L. A. into a modern fighting force .
