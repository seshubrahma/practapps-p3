Now every black person has to choose , but I your friends   rather be ignored and left alone by Republicans with all my rights intact than to surrender my rights and trust any form of government to look out for what ’s best for me , my family , my community or my country   …      So when you say : " Now , what we ’ve been doing is looking at the data .And we know that police somehow manage to deescalate , disarm and not kill white people every day .So what ’s gon na happen is we ’re going to have equal rights and justice in we country , or we will restructure their the country and ours .
