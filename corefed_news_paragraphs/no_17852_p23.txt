Tapper Tapper’s confidence is Tapper’s altogether      uncharming element of his confrontational style ( see Tapper’s " no "      to Bannon ) though it can wear thin .His recent contretemps      with Tapper’s over that website’s decision      to share the specific contents of the " golden shower " memo , a      story CNN first broke , is another example of Tapper calling out      a hypocrisy and , in so doing , missing the forest to yell at      another tree .
