I can not watch idly as the country is forced to face a " lesser of two evils " election , where corruption , illegality , and untruths are the order of the day .I can not be silent while my party ’s candidate employs belittling and dehumanizing language to my fellow citizens of Asian , African , and    descent     in addition to women and the disabled     day after day .All of us deserve better .If the Democratic Party offered a respectable alternative , I would n’t be telling this story .
