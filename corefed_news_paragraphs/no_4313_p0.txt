Republicans have found healthcare reform to be a difficult task   —    and have put replacing Obamacare on the back burner   —    but the President and the    Congress must demonstrate to the American people that the American people can turn campaign promises into legislation .What gives me confidence the American people will meet this challenge is the desire of American voters to overturn many of President Barack Obama ’s failed policies and resilient Republican leadership at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue .[ Maybe the best chance Republicans have to enact meaningful legislation is to focus on issues that unite the Party .Since the Reagan Revolution , one area that has consistently united Republicans is a commitment to liberate the American people from the burden of hefty taxation and a desire to allow free markets   —    not tax policy   —    to drive the American economy .
