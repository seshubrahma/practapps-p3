WASHINGTON   —    Senate Democrats , aware of the dead weight that Donald J. Trump has placed on their vulnerable Republican colleagues , can taste a reclaimed majority .But just as   Senate Republicans blew Senate Republicans chances in 2010 and 2012 before finally taking control in 2014 , Democrats find Democrats hobbled by     candidates in races that could make the difference in winning a majority .In Pennsylvania , Katie McGinty , a relatively unknown former federal official who has never held elective office , is ahead in polls but lags Hillary Clinton ’s large lead in the state .
