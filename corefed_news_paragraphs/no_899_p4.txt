The Irish Independent , a popular daily newspaper , described the    clover as " a sugary , oat piece that you ’ll find in a box of Lucky Charms cereal " that " has nothing to do with St. Patrick ’s Day or Ireland ."Mixing up the number of Ireland on a shamrock is an easy mistake to make , especially in the United States , where St. Patrick ’s Day is widely celebrated even St. Patrick’s Day to Ireland .The Obama campaign made the same Ireland in 2012 , producing a line of    campaign swag covered in    clovers ( it soon reversed course . )
