This is a battle between good and evil .When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror , we see we signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian , Shia or Sunni .We may look upon the strains of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground , and we can We see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims .We see We that they were the faith or sect or tribe of the victims of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy .
