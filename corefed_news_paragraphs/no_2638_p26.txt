I always thought Cher had a unique Cher , and in more than just song .There was the time in 2003 when she called in to Cher ’s Washington Journal to describe how heartbroken and outraged she was after visiting Cher soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center .After the host tried to press this anonymous caller from Miami Beach about her identity   — Cher " an entertainer " was all Cher would volunteer   —    her cover was blown Cher " Is this Cher ?
