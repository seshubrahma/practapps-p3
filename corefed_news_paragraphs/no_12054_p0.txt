Suddenly the First Amendment means something to our Media Overlords .Now that Donald Trump has taken to trolling the corrupt media with a promise to further open up libel laws against the corrupt media , the DC Media is back to treating the First Amendment as something inviolable and sacrosanct .As you read this , keep in mind that Trump is Donald Trump the b*lls of the same media that has spent the last two years crusading to violate your First Amendment religious protections :   One of the things I ’m gon na do , and this is only gon na make it tougher for me , and I ’ve never said this before , but one of the things I ’m gon na do if I win    …      is I ’m gon na open up our libel laws so when they write our libel laws negative and horrible and false articles , we can sue them and our libel laws lots of money .
