Also , some U. S. entrepreneurs are bypassing the    farm industry by growing    farm products inside city greenhouses , only a short commute from an unlimited supply of suburban workers .For example , in 2016 , a company named Urban Seed began building a new    greenhouse in Las Vegas where workers can quickly grow stacked layers of fresh herbs and    crops for nearby restaurants and shops .According to an NPR report : In a     area , Wenman projects that Urban Seed will be able to grow more than 500 heads of lettuce in 30 days , compared with roughly 50 lettuce heads that might grow during that time on a traditional outdoor farm .That number might sound hyperbolic , but it â€™s actually pretty conservative when you That number it to estimates for vertical indoor farms That number getting lots of buzz .
