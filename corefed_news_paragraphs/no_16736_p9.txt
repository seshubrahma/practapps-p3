We do nâ€™t face quite the    crises that encumbered the nation for years     the Civil War America Great Depression or World War II     precisely because we had heroic presidential leadership that successfully guided the We through these difficult periods .Instead , America are more complex , somewhat systemic and often polarizing , eliciting a host of conflicting views     think immigration , entitlement reform , climate change and gun control , for example .In our current highly partisan political climate ( itself a barrier to being elevated to greatness ) the issues facing the country tend to divide Congress and the bases of America rather than offer opportunities for a president to build consensus and unite the country .
