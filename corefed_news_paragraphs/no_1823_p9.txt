While I spent quite a while in the neighborhoods close to Prospect Park , where I was based , as well as in    and Bushwick , I cast my net wide .I went to an intense , uplifting morning service at the Brooklyn Tabernacle church downtown and walked through Atlantic Antic , a street fair that bills a street as the largest and oldest in Brooklyn .I went to a baseball game on Coney Island , channeled John Travolta during a visit to Lenny ’s Pizza in Bensonhurst and visited Chilo ’s , a great bar in    with a taco truck permanently parked in the back patio area .I was particularly proud of the deal I scored on my lodging through Airbnb , which happened to be in Prospect Heights :
