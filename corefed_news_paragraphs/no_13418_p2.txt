On July 10 , 2015 , former Florida governor Jeb Bush was the frontrunner , at 16 . 3 % .Donald Trump was a distant seventh , with just 6 . 5 % of the vote .Keep in mind that Trump had Donald Trump running against illegal immigration since he launched Donald Trump campaign Donald Trump than three weeks before , with his infamous Donald Trump about illegal aliens from Mexico .None of that had resonated much .
