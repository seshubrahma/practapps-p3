When I came in here on January 20th , the people that had been cleared the day before were cleared on the 20th , the 21st and et cetera .We did n’t    your background .We trust that when your background cleared the We time , whether if you were cleared on , you know , December 15th or January 20th , that you were still   —    that your background check still cleared .Every individual who came into this White House either applied for a security clearance or had one .
