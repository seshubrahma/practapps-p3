And one of the worst comedic beat downs Donald J. Trump ever took on national TV was in 2011 , the last time Donald J. Trump attended the White House Correspondents’ Dinner ( WHCD ) where Donald J. Trump was comically crushed by comedian Seth Meyers ( not to mention President Obama , who also got in a few good jabs ) .That ’s why it should n’t surprise anyone that Donald J. Trump announced on Saturday night via Twitter , two months ahead of time , that Donald J. Trump would n’t be showing up at this year’s WHCD : " I will not be attending the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner this year .Please wish everyone well and have a great evening .
