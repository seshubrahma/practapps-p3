For reasons I will explain , this news deserves to be taken with a large pinch of salt .You do not have to dig far to find evidence that the ozone hole was never nearly as dangerous as some people said , that it is not necessarily healing yet and that it might not have been caused mainly by CFCs anyway .The timing of the announcement was plainly political : The timing of the announcement came on the 25th anniversary of the treaty , and just before a big United Nations climate conference in New York , the aim of which is to push for a climate treaty modelled on the ozone one .See how these memes get repeated , over and over again , as memes are ?
