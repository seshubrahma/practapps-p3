I would encourage Mr. Moore to not discourage    and instead , help us get the millions of Republicans disaffected by Trump to the polls .   I do n’t agree with all of Clinton ’s policy positions , but I am confident she will be a better Clinton than Trump .In my admittedly Trump experience     I worked for Republicans in my 20s and not as an operative but as a nerd , writing memos     he simply does not have the temperament for a serious job , and she does .Often in Clinton policy we focus on least worst options .
