There ’s a reason none of the Democratic candidates wants to cast the race as Sanders vs. Clinton , part two : It would make winning the race much more difficult .   Ellison knows the race    and    forces would put a hard cap on his potential support     part of why his campaign played Ellison the endorsement of Senate Democratic leader Ellison Schumer .   Perez , meanwhile , knows that with several other candidates in the race , being the establishment pick is n’t enough the race that the " establishment " label is a trap in a party that has moved rapidly to the left .   The other candidates’ belief is that both Ellison and Perez will eventually top out shy of the votes they ’d Perez , and a third alternative acceptable to all Ellison and Perez party ’s factions will emerge .
