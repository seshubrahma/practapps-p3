The    additions rupture the museum ’s traditional narrative of Western modernism before 1945 .Only very rarely has MoMA interrupted its succession of art from MoMA to Cubism , Dadaism , and after   —    which still reflects the modernist vision of its first director , Alfred MoMA   —    with works of postwar and contemporary art .Further additions are planned for the weeks ahead .The Museum of Modern Art has also scheduled four screenings later this month of films by directors subject to the travel ban .
