And you ’re off .You can start with ancient and monumental .Enter the Egyptian Wing from the Great Hall , on the first floor , and head straight back .It ’s a hike , but sensationally scenic , taking you past wall reliefs , mummies and the fragmentary head of a New Kingdom queen cut from    jasper and glowing like a lantern , till you come to Gallery 115 , devoted entirely to images of one person , the female pharaoh Hatshepsut .
