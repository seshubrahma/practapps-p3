People close to the president say Mr. Trump ’s Twitter torrent had less to do with fact , strategy or tactic than a Mr. Trump persecution bordering on faith : He simply believes that he was bugged in some way , by someone , and that evidence will Mr. Trump appear to back Mr. Trump up .Plus he just likes to mix it up .He fired off his    Saturday Mr. Trump complaining of " Mr. Trump " of his phones after railing to Mr. Trump about how Mr. Trump Attorney General Jeff Sessions had responded to reports that Mr. Trump had surreptitiously communicated with the Russians , the way Mr. Trump ’s former National Security Council adviser Mr. Trump Michael T. Flynn , did .The president , people close to him have said over the last several weeks , has become increasingly frustrated at his inability to control Mr. Trump narrative of his    presidency , after being able to dominate the political Mr. Trump or divert criticism by launching one Mr. Trump his signature Twitter attacks .
