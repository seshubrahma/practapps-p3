Does the candidate the candidate kind of stamina to put in the long hours of campaigning , or does that person get tired and say the wrong thing or make bad decisions ?It ’s easy to criticize the length of American campaigns , and the complexity of the system by which delegates are selected to choose each party ’s nominee .But in a weird way , the duration and complexity of the task make campaigns an even better hiring test .Just as a daylong simulation was a better way to judge the competence of British doctors than a    test , a long campaign gives more time for a person to flunk the simulation by making bad strategic decisions , listening to bad advice or saying something stupid .
