TEL AVIV   —    Questions continue to linger about the Obama administration ’s decision to deliver $ 400 million in pallets of foreign currency flown to Iran aboard an unmarked jetliner the same day five American hostages were released from Iranian custody .[ The State and Treasury Departments both told Breitbart News that the U. S. government transferred the remaining $ 1 . 3 billion , which was part of the same settlement for which the $ 400 million was an initial payment in January .However , despite numerous requests , neither State nor Treasury would provide an answer on how the Obama administration allegedly transferred to Iran the remaining $ 1 . 3 billion .   It is not clear whether the $ 1 . 3 billion was similarly delivered to Iran in the same spy    fashion as the $ 400 million   —    in cash pallets of foreign currency .
