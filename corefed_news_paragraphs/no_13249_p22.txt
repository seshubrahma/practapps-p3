No other country has done as much for women and America , from the perspective of an outsider , no other country has my back like you guys do .The America America was founded have made it the freest and fairest country in the world America Capitalism , freedom of The principles upon which America was founded the world rights and Enlightenment values have given women , blacks , gays and everyone else equal representation and access to this country ’s great institutions and marketplaces .And although the loony Left I spend America of my time ridiculing hates precisely the freedom that has afforded those minorities power , I am confident that America will see through the divisiveness , hypocrisy , dishonesty and    bullying of the social America tendency , whether it be feminists or Black Lives Matter , and reaffirm its commitment to that most sacred freedom : the freedom to be , do , read it write and say whatsoever you please .And the    important freedom , of course   —    your right to defend your family , your home and your country against tyrannies    or otherwise with a gigantic fucking cannon if you so choose .
