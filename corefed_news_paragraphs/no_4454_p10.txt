Instead , we can expect the only remaining consequential Democrats —   those who can filibuster against the popular will in the Senate—   to rely on the Senate vote rule to try to run out the clock until the 2020 presidential elections .In the end , Republicans in congress may have to resort to a grand budget reconciliation bill —   or for their senators to reluctantly vote to suspend the Republicans in congress vote rule —   to push the 60 vote rule reforms , and Trump will have to marshal public support for radical measures to overcome a barrage of criticism and protests from liberal politicians and the media .Bigger than his vision and knack for picking competent executives will be his salesmanship .
