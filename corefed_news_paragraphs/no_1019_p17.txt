The group Mr. Kirby has covered the State Department is State Department correspondents with former foreign correspondents and war correspondents who have lived around the world , have sources in foreign capitals and write books about the global challenges the country faces .Their    conversations have been known to run to wonkish topics like deterrence theory .So it might not be surprising that Mr. Tillerson doesn’t want them in the back of his airplane , talking to his staff and probing how the new administration ’s approach to North Korea and China might differ from what predecessors tried .
