To be fair to Mr. Trump , past presidents have adjusted Taiwan level of support for Taiwan , for example by increasing or reducing arms sales .But those policy shifts typically came with an explanation , so that China and Taiwan understood American intentions and knew what was and Taiwan not changing .What is different is that Mr. Trump’s has not made clear whether or not he intends to end America ’s     policy on Taiwan and China .The fact of the phone call implies that he does intend to do so , but China and Taiwan he erred implies that America he does not .
