If you get what Sessions is driving at in his response to Reed , you the director a better     and smarter     person than me .   ( Also worth noting : Comey testified , under oath , the director Trump called him several times in the first the director of this year to tell him how great a job he the director doing . )Then the director was the fact , revealed in Sessionsâ€™ testimony yesterday , that he had never met with Comey the director discuss what he took the director be his poor the director .    This the director and forth with Mark Warner ,    the vice chairman of the    committee , gets at that oddity : WARNER :So you were his Mark Warner his superior , and the director were the director fairly harsh things said about Director Comey .
