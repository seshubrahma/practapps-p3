In many American metropolises , gentrification has turned the term " inner city " on its head .   The old image was of a poor , blighted ghetto The old image is of an affluent    playground .The old " white flight , " back in the 1950s , 60s , and 70s , was about whites moving to the suburbs , mostly fleeing crime .The new " white influx " has been about whites , as well as other Americans , feeling that , in an era of reduced crime , it was safe to head back to the concrete canyons .
