A perfect chaser ( or appetizer ) is an order of tacos al vapor ( steamed tacos ) from the restaurant Salud across the street ( three for $ 6 on Thursdays ) .Believe it or not , I have nâ€™t been able to account for all of the excellent beers I sampled on this trip .Mikkeller , Alesmith , the list goes on and on .I recommend heading to San Diego to experience it yourself
