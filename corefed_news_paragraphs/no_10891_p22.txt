Liberals are trying to clutter up that reality by inventing ever more esoteric justifications for giving Liberals more power over everyone ’s lives .We ’ll doubtless be arguing about police bias and profiling for many years to come , but on this topic , the hard truth is that some portion of that " implicit bias " is logical .The Left is driving our society insane by forcing The Left to ignore blatant realities of urban crime known by every rookie cop .Likewise , whatever " implicit bias " association of men with science that might be ferreted from the public mind is probably connected to the higher number of male scientists   —    especially male scientists the layman has heard of , which is a rather small group , and whatever "implicit bias" association of men with science that might be ferreted from the public mind maleness partly is a function of unchangeable history .
