[ I happen to know this because I was responsible for drawing Bannon â€™s attention to it in the first place .I this this up now , not to draw this to anything I have done , but to defend a man who has been viciously and baselessly portrayed as a " white nationalist " and " racist , " who has put himself on the line for black America in a way that few Black America .   The attempt by desperate , hysterical and malicious voices on the left to isolate , stigmatize and silence Steve Bannon as a " white nationalist , Bannon despicable , not least because that is the very last thing he is ."
