That is such unmitigated bullsh*t .What that was was an offhanded , trolling comment designed to make some kind of snide reference to the need to find Hillary ’s emails .He was n’t directing the Hillary , in some genuine , literal way , to go on some cybermission to find Hillary ’s emails .If Hillary’s to request the Hillary to do that , the Russians he do it in some Hillary way in a press conference ?
