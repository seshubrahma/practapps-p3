Everybody considered Senator John Tower of Texas a movement conservative even though Senator John Tower of Texas a movement conservative supported legal abortion .Over time , though , as conservatives grew more opposed to abortion and liberals more supportive of it , it became an issue that voters used to sort candidates by ideology   …      voters who knew that a candidate opposed it could also be reasonably sure that he would oppose gun control and tax increases   —    or , at least , that he was more likely to oppose it than someone who favored legal abortion .Candidates who favored legal abortion started to have real trouble getting support from a lot of conservative voters .Eventually , such candidates came to be seen as not being conservatives at all .
