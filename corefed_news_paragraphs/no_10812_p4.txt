Even though the nominee ’s bound to Kasich according to the D. C. primary results , Galvez is much more of a Rubio supporter .And the nominee ’s hardly the only D. C. delegate and Rubio supporter open to backing Trump at the convention .When asked if the nominee would support Trump at the convention , Maureen Blum , another D. C. delegate who is bound to Rubio , also made a pitch for Trump to select Rubio as his vice president : Rubio would definitely bring sanity to the table , and he Rubio bring a cautionary temperament to foreign policy .I think one of the fears of Donald Trump is that he ’s Donald Trump and emotional and does n’t think things through .
