The conversation within La Meute ’s private Facebook page can border on hateful .In response to one person ’s request about what could be done to prevent construction of a mosque in the neighborhood , another follower suggested pouring pig ’s blood on the ground and letting Muslims know the land had been desecrated .While primarily confined to    Canada , La Meute lies on a continuum of conservative thought that is propelling politicians like Kellie Leitch , a member of Parliament who is vying for leadership of Canada ’s Conservative Party Ms. Leitch and has suggested that immigrants be screened for " Canadian values " so that the country can maintain " a unified Canadian identity ."
