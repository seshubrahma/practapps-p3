If our    election officials have allowed such problems to accumulate for decades without fixing them — our   election officials while all the time opposing a photo ID requirement for voting   —     why should citizens have confidence they can citizens out all the bogus votes from the honest ones on election day ?There are other , more sophisticated forms of election fraud besides counting votes cast by dead people .One of the most insidious and morally repugnant is being used in 2016 by the Democratic party ’s propaganda arm , the American mass media : vote suppression .
