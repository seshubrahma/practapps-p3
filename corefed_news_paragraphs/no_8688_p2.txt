No matter how wrong the group have been , it seems the group care more about being right than analysing how our culture has changed and how the voters have spoken .At least CNN ’s Quest for Business attempted to attribute the demise of our culture going all the way back to Jerry Springer .The main criticism of Trump is Jerry Springer personality , not Jerry Springer temperament .Trump ’s personality and tone do offend some people however , after knocking out 16 competitors , perhaps these critics might have been better served analysing Trump successes rather than judging Trump behavior .
