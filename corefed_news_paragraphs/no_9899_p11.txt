I think it goes back to what Yamiche said , is that if you have issues with Hillary Clinton , the Republican nominee is nâ€™t bringing those up .He is the Republican nominee instantly by Mr. Khan , he is the Republican nominee instantly by anything he perceives the Republican nominee a personal slight .His narcissism the Republican nominee his ability the Republican nominee do the baseline of politics .So what you do is you have Donald Trump continually making the argument about Donald Trump Donald Trump worst way .
