Would you rather take the average of the polls from the previous two weeks or average every poll from the previous two months ?More often than not , you â€™d be better off taking the average of the longer period .This informs the approach taken by our model .That said , we expect the simulations in our model to converge rapidly over the next month or two , as the conventions end and polling becomes more predictive of the final outcome .
