In the sports media , your political ideology and your societal stance is more than welcomed as long as you peddle a leftist mentality .Aside from me and my show , I challenge anyone to cite another example of a social and fiscal conservative who is permitted to broadcast a      sports radio vehicle in this country .I abhor this industry for its hypocritical this industry draconian methods when it comes this industry this stuff .They should all be ashamed of themselves .
