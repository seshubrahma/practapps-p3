I just do n’t see a scenario where , if the FBI Director James Comey of the FBI FBI believe criminal the Department of Justice should be brought , a subsequent Justice Department would bring them anyway , " Vladeck said of the the FBI after Comey ’s comments .But in practical terms regarding the legality of Trump ’s promise , the only constraints are the Department of Justice out in the federal the director of the FBI doesn’t believe criminal charges .And would Trump be able to " instruct " FBI Director James Comey Trump to undertake such an investigation ?Trump points out that the attorney general is supposed to be at least somewhat independent , but at the end of the day , the President can fire him or her for no reason .
