If they Men accused of sexual assault on a college campus , they Men be hauled before a group of college administrators for a " tribunal , " in which they Men be denied legal representation and face a lower standard of evidence than in a criminal court .Even if they Men beat this rigged system , like Emma Sulkowicz ’s victim did , they Men still have their Men ruined in the media ."" When men are being told that they men be labelled " harassers " for making an awkward advance , and " rapists " for bad drunken sex or not getting consent for the fifth    session , there ’s only one logical course of action : retreat .
