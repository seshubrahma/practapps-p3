There is a museum exhibit in their honor at Etajima , an island off Hiroshima the Japanese aviators and others who died in the attack that once served as the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy , a Japanese equivalent of the United States Navy ’s training academy at Annapolis .For decades , politicians have been reluctant to make any statement resembling an apology for the attack , which many in Japan argue was the natural outgrowth of an    oil embargo that would have starved the Japanese empire .There are still arguments over the role of Emperor Hirohito in the decision , and that of military officials who had argued at length about the wisdom or dangers of directly drawing the United States into the war .In 1990 , a year after Hirohito ’s death , notes were published based on Emperor Hirohito with him shortly after Japan ’s surrender .
