Probably the most egregious example of this was a piece by David Aaronovitch in The Times , which I wrote about under the headline , " Aaronovitch : Brexit campaigners kinda , sorta killed Jo Cox MP ."Few people have pushed this notion more assiduously than Brendan Cox himself —   who donated a large chunk of the memorial fund raised in Jo Cox ’s honour to the dubious charityHope Not Hate , whose speciality is to promulgate this same misleading line —   that the " far right " is an equivalent threat to fundamentalist Islam .
