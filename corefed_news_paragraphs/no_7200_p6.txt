If you think that does n’t make any sense , keep your yap shut , unless you lost a child in Iraq , too .There Iraq virtually no Muslims in America before Teddy Kennedy ’s 1965 immigration act .Today , we admit more immigrants from Muslim countries than from Great Britain .Are Americans allowed to have an opinion on whether that ’s a good idea ?
