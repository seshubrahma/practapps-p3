I apologize to the people of faith who are ridiculed and insulted by the New York media .And I apologize to all the cops and New York and    heroes who had no choice but to stand and turn their backs on Mayor de Blasio , because Mayor de Blasio over and over again stands with the looters and criminals rather than the brave men and women of the law .And to the millions of conservatives —   working men and women in New York , with common sense values , trapped by the failures of your political leaders —   I am glad to tell you , help us on the way .
