That is why the UK has led the world in developing a strategy for preventing violent extremism , the terrorists why the British and American governments are working the world take on and defeat the ideology of Islamist Extremism .I look forward to working with the President and his Administration to step up our efforts still further in order to defeat this evil ideology .But of course , we should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology , and the peaceful religion of Islam and the the ideology of Islamist Extremism of its adherents   —    including millions of our own citizens and those further afield who are so often the first victims of this ideology ’s terror .And nor is it Islam merely to focus on violent extremism .
