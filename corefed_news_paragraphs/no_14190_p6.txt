Trump has repeatedly seized on these moments to question the loyalty of all Muslims .Trump did so as recently as the second presidential debate , when a Muslim woman asked Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton :" With Islamophobia on the rise , how will you help people like Trump deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over ?"   Trump and Democratic responded by calling for " extreme vetting "     and for Muslims to police one another .
