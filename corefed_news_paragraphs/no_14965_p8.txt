Imagine , then , the reaction of these key partners to news that the Trump administration remains    on a policy that     call it whatever politically correct phrase you like     amounts to a ban on their these key partners .   Imagine the frustration in    intel services that , being familiar with the problem of terrorism , understand that the vast majority of terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists in the West are authored not by terrorists who infiltrated Western countries , but rather by citizens of those countries who    ( as looks to be the case with the recent attack in London ) .    Again , the White House ’s policies may cause these important liaison partners to be more circumspect with what they these important liaison partners to share in the future , which could have disastrous consequences .The Trump administration is still young , and many of our these important liaison partners showing great patience and taking a wait and see attitude     but such attitudes will not last forever .
