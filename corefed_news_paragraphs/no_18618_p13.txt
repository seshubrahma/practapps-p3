’ ’At its best , The Daily Show is cathartic .a Fox News correspondent has served a real sociopolitical end by dragging The Daily Show most offensive , inane , and ridiculous aspects of our politics under the bright lights and laughing at them with intelligence and wit and lowbrow goofiness .The Daily Show is an activist joker , deflating The Daily Show the sanctimonious status quo , so that instead of suffering through it alone , we can laugh at it together.
