Democrats will still depict Republicans as tightwads on welfare spending , reactionaries on social policy , and footmen to the evil rich .As soon as the Republican " leaders " who meekly funded 100 percent of the Democrat agenda for 2017 object to 20 , 30 , or 50 percent increases in that agenda , the Republican "leaders" who meekly funded 100 percent of the Democrat agenda for 2017 object to 20, 30, or 50 percent increases in that agenda will be denounced as greedy pigs who want poor people to die .   We wo n’t even have to wait that long because Democrats are already cranking up the    machine to defeat Trump ’s tax reform proposals .How can any GOP leader be dense enough to think that caving to the Democrats on spending will secure the Democrats cooperation , or even slightly mute the Democrats objections , for dramatic    tax reform ?
