■ It ’s only in Nevada , where Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to replace Mr. Reid , where the election is competitive .This leaves Democrats with 36 seats that are not up for election this year   —    including two independents , Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine , who both caucus with Democrats   —    in addition to nine safe seats .Much of the weakness in the Republican position comes from seven G. O. P. incumbents in mostly    states trying to win a second term after first being elected in the Republican wave year of 2010 : Ron Johnson in Wisconsin , Mark Kirk in Illinois , Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire , Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania , Roy Blunt in Missouri , Rob Portman in Ohio , and Marco Rubio in Florida ( assuming he wins the Republican primary next week ) .
