JENNIFER GRAY , AMS METEOROLOGIST :   In the U. S. flash floods kill more people than tornadoes , hurricanes or lightning .A flash flood creates a rush of moving water that can sweep a grown man off his feet , a car off the a grown man , and even your entire home off its foundation .When the ground become the road saturated that water can no longer seep into the soil , it begins to run off quickly into the soil and streams and this causes a rise in water and a flash .
