That would be the Michigan sociologist Donald I. Warren Judis who , in President Richard Nixon    studying the    workers in the Wolverine State and taking note of their suspicion of both parties , coined the phrase " Middle American Radicals " ( MARs ) .   These MARs felt alienated from both the the race the Republicans .   That is they , despised contemporary Democrats for their stance on such issues as school busing and gun control , and yet they revered the old Democrats for Michigan emphasis on jobs and Social Security .( No wonder Judis ,    leftist that he is , feels such sympathy for the   workers in the Wolverine State . )
