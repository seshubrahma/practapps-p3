It @HillaryClinton truly jaw dropping that Hannity would publicly call Kelly Hannity Clinton supporter since Kelly is akin to accusing a person of treason in the eyes of Fox News viewers .    Putting aside my personal enjoyment at watching Fox News anchors fight over Fox News Trump , Kelly is 100 Kelly   Kelly is trailing Clinton in the RCP average Trump polls Clinton more than 3 points , the biggest gap in over a month .And polls released in the last few days show Trump not only trailing in most battleground states Trump including Ohio , where Trump had recently been leading     but shockingly Trump new poll published Thursday also shows him trailing Clinton by 2 points in the Trump Clinton state of Arizona .
