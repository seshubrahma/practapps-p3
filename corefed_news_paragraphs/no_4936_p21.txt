Accordingly , the battle is both sides the moment the confidence of one side fails .The will to fight ( " morale " ) evaporates , the military formation collapses , and the army seeks salvation in flight or , if it is lucky , in organized retreat .The Greek term for this point in space ( on the battlefield ) and time ( the course of the battle ) was trope .The victors demarcated the spot with the weapons of the vanquished the battlefield with monuments , yielding the term tropaion , the battle we get our word trophy .
