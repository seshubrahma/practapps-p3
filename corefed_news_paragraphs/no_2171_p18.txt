Live interview pollsters can do that , since the respondent is free to say " other " or " I do n’t know , " and the interviewer can record it as such .In the    poll , 9 percent volunteered " other " or " neither , " the respondent 2 percent were n’t sure .But this is a lot more challenging for an online pollster .If you put " do n’t know " or " other " as an option , a lot of people are going to take it .
