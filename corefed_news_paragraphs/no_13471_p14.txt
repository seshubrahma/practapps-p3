S. attorney ’s office   —    and Sessions , by extension   —    was accused of having prosecuted the case out of racial motivations .Sessions’ opponents in corporate media have been quick to pick up on this narrative and have even demonstrated a willingness to obscure inconvenient facts that would undermine it .For instance , USA Today ’s this narrative Troyan and Brian Lyman wrote an entire article about the Perry County case and the accusations of the case motivations without once mentioning that both the complainants and the victims in the case were also black Democrats .
