The requirements for a blind trust for government officials are set out in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 .The law bars most communications between the law and their trustees but it explicitly allows that requests for distributions the law    …     except for communications which solely consist of requests for distributions of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust , there shall be no direct or indirect communication between the trustee and an interested party with respect to the trust unless such communication is in the trust unless it relates only [ to certain permitted topics ] .In other words , the authorization of undisclosed requests from distributions in Trump ’s trust agreement is fully in keeping with the law and the government ’s standard agreements .The small change revealed by ProPublica brought Trump ’s trust into further conformity with the Trump by other government officials and U. S. senators .
