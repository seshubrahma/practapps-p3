Consequently , the largest number of new enrollees are people whose illnesses are costing the insurance companies more to pay out for the largest number of new enrollees care than the largest number of new enrollees are paying into the system in premiums .The result is more money going out for care than coming in , a situation impossible to sustain for long .The latter is why so many insurance carriers are dropping out of Obamacare .so many insurance carriers are being outspent and can not sustain the costs and remain profitable at the same time .
