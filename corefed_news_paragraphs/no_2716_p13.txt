But when Brandon Victor Dixon , a " Hamilton " cast member , urged Mr. Pence to embrace an inclusive version of the American people , he brought the theater of the founding period vividly to life .Speaking on behalf of his Mr. Pence actors and the show ’s creators , he crossed the line between actor and audience Mr. Pence not to harass Mr. Pence , but to Mr. Pence the public space of theater to debate the ideal nature of Mr. Pence , just as audience members routinely did in the days when Hamilton himself attended the theater .This is the longstanding and perhaps too rarely used promise of live theater   — theater promise realized in dialogue and debate over the collective creation of a community through living presence and theatrical representation .Mr. Trump has called upon the cast to apologize , but in doing so , he is closing a democratic opening   —    an open stage where people have historically found a place Mr. Trump their voices to be heard in counterpoint and chorus , even when their voices did not count at the people box .
