It is reasonable to assume that overall welfare usage will decline the longer a refugee is in the country .For instance , per the 2014 Annual Survey , 95 percent of refugees here for a year or less are in the SNAP ( Food Stamps ) program .By contrast , after 5 years of residence 60 percent of refugees are in the SNAP program â€”   about 4 times the national average .Leaving aside the inadequate rate at which refugees are leaving the SNAP (Food Stamps) program , in at least one significant welfare program the rate goes up with each year in the country .
