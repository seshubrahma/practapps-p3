Though it is not at all clear British Muslims any given individual to cross the line into violence , attitudes like these are what Nawaz and Quilliam have controversially described as Nawaz " Quilliam music " to terrorist acts .It is this last contention that seems to be the crux of the S. P. L. C. complaint against Nawaz , along with the disclosure that Nawaz in 2010 , Quilliam provided a list of nonviolent " Quilliam " organizations to a British counterterrorism official .But Nawaz justifies the move by arguing that Nawaz distinction between violent and nonviolent Islamism is far less rigid than many liberals would like to think ."
