If you were only watching the mainstream media ’s coverage of Hillary Clinton ’s speech at the Democratic National Convention , you were n’t getting the whole story .[ That ’s because when it comes to covering the Democratic presidential nominee , the MSM has gotten dangerously close to having the credibility of Pravda .   The big networks like ABC , NBC and CNN were all out in force at the Democratic National Convention , to the point of having their own separate NBC and CNN cities near the " media center " stationed just outside Wells Fargo Center .They brought millions NBC and CNN dollars in equipment which included more than one camera .
