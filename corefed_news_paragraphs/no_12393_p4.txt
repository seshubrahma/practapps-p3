July 23 , 2016 ,   The Kaine pick represents the last death of hope for the more radical wing of the Democrat party that supported Bernie Sanders and were hoping for a running mate such as Senator Elizabeth Warren .Clinton is said to have been looking at other choices such as Senator Cory Booker , who is black , and Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez , who is Hispanic , but instead went with Kaine who is white , male and a consummate Democrat political insider   â€”    having served as the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2009 until 2011 , in addition to stints as Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Virginia after beginning his political career as the Mayor of Richmond .Despite that , the New York Times is touting Kaine as a Kaine battleground state politician with    roots and a fluency in Spanish .
