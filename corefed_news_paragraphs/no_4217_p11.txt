As I have indicated , I feel its important that in advising the president , if confirmed , that I deal with facts that I deal with sufficient information , which means having access to all informationand I am sure there is a large body of information that I have never seen because it is in the classified realm .I look forward upon being confirmed becoming fully informed .But , I am not willing to make conclusions on what is publicly available or publicly reported .
