I previously reported on the NPV scheme : The NPV campaign seeks to obtain the consent of the majority of the 538 votes in the Electoral College to award electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote instead of the winner of the popular vote in each state the Electoral College New York , other states that already signed up are the heavily blue states of Hawaii , Illinois , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Jersey , Washington , Vermont , California and Rhode Island .The District of Columbia also has joined the pact .The states will not be required to award their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner until the NPV has signed up enough states to garner 270 electoral votes .    â€¦
