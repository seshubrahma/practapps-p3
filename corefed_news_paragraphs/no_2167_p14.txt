Mr. Rubio become a plausible contender in his own right John Kasich like Mr. McCain in 2008 .In the end , John Kasich Kasich was strong enough only to block a viable mainstream candidate , leaving Mr. Cruz as the sole remaining candidate to defeat Mr. Trump .This , to me , is a " World War I " black swan advantage for Mr. Mr. Kasich   â€”    parts of it were foreseeable , but not the totality of what ultimately happened .The failure of a broadly appealing candidate to break out left Mr. Trump with one rival : Mr. Cruz .
