Grueling and sordid or not , it has placed this presidential election, of all things of sex , power and gender at the center of the national conversation , not off in the peripheral space typically reserved for women ’s issues in media .It is one thing to be a passive reader of the news about Cosby , or the trials endured by young women on college campuses it is another for the public to consider their electoral choices in light of those kinds of issues .Oddly enough , there is , right now , outrage about the unwanted groping of women among both Republicans and Democrats   —    different men , different victims , but same idea .Is there any bipartisan issue more relevant , or more emotional , than this one ?
