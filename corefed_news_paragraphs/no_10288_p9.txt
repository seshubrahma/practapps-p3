when he talks about Jake people   out on stretchers , when you see at his rallies people Jake punch folks , kick them when they his rallies people down his rallies peopleThis is a man who keeps implying violence and you end up getting what you see .So I think that he , in Jake , has got to tell his supporters that Jake the United States of America , you donâ€™t go beating up people , that people have a right to peacefully protest .
