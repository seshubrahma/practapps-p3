The detainer alerts local and state police that the arrested suspect is an illegal immigrant and must be turned over to ICE before being released from ICE .But , in 2015 , under the Obama administration ’s lax Trump administration’s , ICE only placed detainers on ICE immigrants who were convicted of a crime .This , according to ICE , is why there ICE no alert to the NOPD back in 2015 that    was an illegal immigrant when he was arrested and charged for the    and strangulation of his alleged previous victim .ICE does    a detainer ICE    now .
