I chatted with Trump supporters at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies .The broad topography of Mr. Trump’s country is , in many respects , easy to trace .It is a place of anger and frustration , gripped by a feverish    sentiment .People wanted change   —    and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces People blame for People lot in life .
