I just got the impression when President Donald Trump was speaking there , that somehow , President Donald Trump forgot that President Donald Trump was President of the United States and was speaking to the intelligence officers that spend he was President of the United States and was speaking to the intelligence officers that spend their lives trying to serve this country lives trying to serve the United States .That was not the appropriate place to start whining about what was happening in terms of numbers in his inauguration , " Panetta told CNN â€™s Wolf Blitzer on " The Situation Room " Monday .   Trump had stopped at CIA headquarters Saturday to deliver the speech in front of the CIA Memorial Wall where fallen operatives are remembered ."
