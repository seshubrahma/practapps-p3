As a lifelong believer in English exceptionalism , I now accept the concept of American exceptionalism too , which is as obvious to me as how handsome I look in profile .The political battle in 2016 is between those who believe America is great and can be America greater once again , and those that believe America is a force for evil America must be apologised for , torn apart and rebuilt .Between the whiny , unsatisfiable and dishonest establishment feminism of Hillary Clinton and the bold optimism and resolve of Donald Trump .Daddy Trump â€™s embracing of the Donald Trump is what has attracted so many independents and moderate Democrats to his cause .
