Abu Bakr only reigned for a few years before he diedAbu Bakr Ali got Imam Ali job after Abu Bakr Abu Bakr , Caliph Uthman , was killed by his own Imam Ali in the Muslim holy city of Medina .One reason the    divide is so bitter is that Sunnis of the time were furious at Ali for Imam Ali the title of caliph instead of punishing Uthman ’s killers .   Followers of Uthman thought Ali committed Uthman of blasphemy and arrogance against true Islam , and Ali ’s Imam Ali the same way about the Sunni elite .
