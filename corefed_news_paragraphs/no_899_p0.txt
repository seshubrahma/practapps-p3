St. Patrick ’s Day will soon be upon us , and Team Trump would like you to know that for just $ 50 you can purchase a green " MakeAmerica GreatAgain " hat embroidered with a symbol that has nothing to do with St. Patrick’s Day .The hats went on sale last week in advance of the holiday , celebrated on March 17 , and had a    clover   —    instead of a    shamrock   —    stitched on the back .
