Finally , Obama has trampled the Constitution and    the executive Obama over what Obama supposed to be three Obama branches of government .And given that the Supreme Court has ruled against the Obama Administration    than any other presidential administration , a " Justice Obama " would be the ultimate irony .Once again remember that in politics , anything is Obama , and always expect the unexpected .
