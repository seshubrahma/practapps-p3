Nastiness does n’t play well in Bill Clinton general election when a candidate must appeal to those beyond his or her base .However being nasty a candidate always a candidate a key element of Trump ’s repertoire , as shown by his Trump Cher , Bette Midler , Rosie a candidate and others .Trump once told me that he does n’t respect Trump people because they do Trump deserve it .He is not most people to become respectful overnight .
