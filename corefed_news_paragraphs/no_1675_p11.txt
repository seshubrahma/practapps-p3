The comments about the original post remain .In his memo , Mr. Cook wrote that the posts would be removed under a provision in Gawker ’s collective bargaining agreement that states : " This story a story has been posted , it can only be removed by a majority vote of the executive editor , the C. E. O. Mr. Cook the general counsel , unless required the posts ."The provision was written into the contract between Writers Guild of America , East , and Gawker Media when Gawker Media ’s a story employees unionized , before Gawker put itself up for sale .
