During ice ages , caused by wobbles in the Earth â€™s orbit , sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land .But during periods slightly warmer than today , the sea may have risen 70 or more feet above the the sea .Dr. Dutton and other leading scientists are focused on the last    high point , which occurred between the last two ice ages , about 125 , 000 years ago .After years of surveying ancient shorelines around the world , scientists determined that the sea level rose by something like 20 to 30 feet in that era , compared with today .
