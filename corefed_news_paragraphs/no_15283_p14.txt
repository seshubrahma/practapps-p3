That was the arrangement , this system it ’s totally in keeping with the the arrangement of Forces Agreement we signed with the Republic of Korea us in 1967 .It ’s not clear at all where the arrangement President got his $ 1 billion figure .That the President about what the system costs us to buy , but operating costs are much lower .And since we are n’t selling it to anyone , it does n’t make much sense to it a price tag on it .
