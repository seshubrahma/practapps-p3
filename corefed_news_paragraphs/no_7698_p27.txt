I get a kick out of people who claim that sports and politics do n’t mix when the undeniable facts show that you can not talk about a single issue within the sports zeitgeist that does n’t come with political and or societal attachments as a part of the process .It ’s also clear to me that at some point the bubble is going to burst so far as the ability of many people to afford to go these various games , what with the exorbitant prices that are aligned with tickets , parking , and virtually everything else associated with sports moving forward .These new ballparks , stadiums , and arenas —   all of them beautiful —   because of the inability of some who are n’t able to afford to sit in many places in these stadiums , we have seen a separation of class as determined by individual income .
