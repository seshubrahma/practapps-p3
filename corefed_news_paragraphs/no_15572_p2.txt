I frequently write about my objection to political violence and censorship in America , and we have plenty of examples of both .   We we our we leader with a tendency toward authoritarian responses to criticism .    We we our we    individuals who want to shut down debate .       is worrisome when an American professor allegedly violates the Constitution by calling for " muscle " to get rid of journalists .It is even worse when Americans physically attack other Americans for their Americans views .
