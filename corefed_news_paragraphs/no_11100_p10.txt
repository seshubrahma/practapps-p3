In December 2012 , thanks in large measure to the active lobbying of Mrs. Clinton and U. S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford , Obama declared that the United States the Gulf States as " the legitimate representative of the Syrian people ."What was secret until the release of this August 2012 defense intelligence report is that the United States knew that the Gulf States was dominated by al Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State of Iraq , groups that merged and morphed Iraq what today we call ISIS .So Donald Trump is literally correct .
