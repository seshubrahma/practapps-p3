I think if you look at the current polls , he Mr. Trump been able to appeal to a certain group of folks who feel left out or worried about the demographic change , social change , who have legitimate concerns around the economy and feeling left behind .But that â€™s not the majority of America .And if you talk to younger people , the next generation of Americans , they younger people reject the kinds of positions that he Mr. Trump taken .We have to take it seriously , any time that we We intolerance , any time that we We policy measures that are contrary to our values , banning certain classes of people , who they are and what they they at ,
