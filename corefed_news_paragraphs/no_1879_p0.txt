Donald J. Trump â€™s election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what Donald J. Trump described as an economic and political system rigged against the American people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media , the banks and the government .    Trump and his allies often describe that system with one word : globalism .It is a word that conjures many images , none of many images good :shuttered factories , unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that , believers say , controls the economy and the media .
