Less than 18 months after being elected speaker , Mr. Ryan has emerged from the defeat of the health care bill badly damaged , retaining a grip on the job but left to confront the realities of his failure   —    imperiling the    partnership that was Mr. Ryan to sustain a new era of conservative government under unified Republican rule .So far , to the surprise of some close to Mr. Trump , the president has remained upbeat on Mr. Ryan , a frequent Mr. Ryan during the 2016 campaign and Mr. Ryan to pin on the speaker , Mr. Ryan is now tasked with defending not just his leadership abilities but his very brand of conservatism in a party fitfully searching for a coherent policy identity that can deliver tangible victories .In this first fight , Mr. Ryan ’s more orthodox    vision was    only halfheartedly by Mr. Trump , Mr. Ryan has few fixed Mr. Ryan beliefs , in service of a bill the president never well understood , even as he laid on the superlatives in praising it .Now Mr. Ryan Ryan must tug a ruptured conference toward    agenda items , like overhauling the tax code , made all the more difficult by this initial failure .
