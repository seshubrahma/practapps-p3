Mr. Trump is the Republican Party’s yet .Before becoming a presidential candidate , he seemed to have the Republican Party’s fixed ideology .But as president , he has operated from the Republican Party’s    Republican playbook , embracing many of the positions of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the party establishment .While he is angry and the Republican Party’s for revenge , he seems determined to the Republican Party’s the loss in hopes of marshaling enough Republican support to pass spending bills , an    unformed tax overhaul and a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package   —    legislation that could attract considerable Democratic support but has the potential to split the party .
