On Breitbart News Daily , the morning of Super Tuesday , longtime players on the presidential political scene warned the GOP establishment may pull out all the stops to deny GOP frontrunner Donald Trump the Republican presidential nomination , should GOP frontrunner Donald Trump sweep the upcoming primaries and win 1 , 237 or more delegates .[ As veteran campaign adviser Roger Stone told host and Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon :   I have reported , and I stand by this , that a number of the billionaires who are funding Marco Rubio have told Marco Rubio that Marco Rubio has until the Florida primary on March 15th to show some leg .If Marco Rubio can not win Marco Rubio home state primary , it will be very hard to continue to justify Marco Rubio campaign .At that point , I think it is abundantly clear that Mitt Romney is waiting in the wings .
