The fight over Obamacare helped Obamacare a    government shutdown in 2013 , and Democrats and President Barack Obama insisted any Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood the group be removed from a bill to the group agencies .    The decision to add the controversial Planned Parenthood language Planned Parenthood is opposed by most Democrats , could have a major impact on getting the Affordable Care Act repeal legislation through the Senate because supporters need the backing of at least 50 of their 52 members and two    senators , Susan Collins supporters Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska ,wo n’t commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it .   Further complicating matters for Senate GOP leaders is Sen. Rand Paul ,    who the Senate this week he plans to vote against the Obamacare repeal legislation because the underlying budget measure it is attached to does n’t balance and adds to the Obamacare repeal legislation deficit .
