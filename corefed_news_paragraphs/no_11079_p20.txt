There could be some civility in this discourse .It is a political discourse , this discourse .There could be some discussion of policy and all that instead of personal ugliness .So I am not engaging anymore because I see no hope , I do see hope where the people who are thinking to vote for this candidate , I think it is plenty clear , his surrogates will not admit this candidate
