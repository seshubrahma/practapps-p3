Panthers offensive coordinator Mike Shula , the former Alabama quarterback , needs to take a page out of Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin ’s playbook and Denver creative ways to utilize tight end Olsen in the second half like Ben Roethlisberger did with O. J. Howard Ben Roethlisberger Clemson in the college football title game .Panthers ends have been successful finding soft spots in Denver ’s Ben Roethlisberger .Carolina did not go deep once in the Ben Roethlisberger half .Why have    on the field if you are n’t going to at least try Greg Olsen    Alabama to either when Denver is stopping the run and the underneath throwing game ?
