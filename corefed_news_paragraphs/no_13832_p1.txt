Later in the day , the Senate voted    to begin debate on a budget resolution that would help pave the way for repeal of President Obama ’s signature policy .But do n’t be fooled .debate on a budget resolution that would help pave the way for repeal of President Obama’s signature policy is not yet over , and what appears to be merely a question of timing is about much more than that .As a result , Republicans will have to tread a careful path that balances a desire to abandon Obamacare as soon as possible with the need to respect the reality that the complexities of changing the system will persist well beyond any    bill signing ceremonies .
