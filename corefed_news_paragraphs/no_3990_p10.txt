In the past , U. S. companies have created affiliates with American universities in order to get around the cap on    visas for private companies , which is set at 85 , 000 foreign workers a year .Between 2011 and 2014 , companies like Dow Chemical , Samsung , and Monsanto successfully used the    visa loophole to hire more foreign workers by partnering with universities .The    visa has not only been criticized by Trump , but also Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who has blasted the visa for years in the U.The   visa as a way for giant corporations to profit off the displacement and firing of Americans .
