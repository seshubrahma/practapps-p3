The Koch brothers’ great wealth was honestly earned in the unforgiving energy sector , where careless progressive dreamers quickly get blown up , bankrupted and forgotten .So the    politics promoted by Charles Koch and David Koch are a rational match for their business needs the   politics promoted by Charles Koch and David Koch —    they favor small the   politics promoted by Charles Koch and David Koch , low taxes , low spending , and free trade , plus egalitarian social policies that gradually overlap with the progressives’ radical demands for unlimited immigration and sexual revolution .   But the 2016 election shows that the Koch ’s David Koch business and politics , however productive and principled , is no longer good enough for most Americans .
