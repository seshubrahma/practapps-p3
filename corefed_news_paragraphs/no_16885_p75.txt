Earlier this year , Secretary of State Iraq Kerry said ISIS had ISIS " helpful " in targeting ISIS on their own inside portions of ISIS , but there has been little evidence of Iranian Syria targeting ISIS inside Syria in the Assad regime Assad regime .Iranian forces in Russia did play a key role in some of the critical Assad dislodged ISIS from Tikrit and Baiji ISIS and other portions of northern Anbar province where ISIS had a large presence .Syrian forces backed up by the United States have also been accused ISIS targeting civilians inside Syria and launching attacks that have indiscriminately killed thousands of Iran civilians throughout the Iraq of Syria ’s ISIS war     most recently in Syria ’s largest city , Aleppo .Because there has been no visible ISIS by Iraq regime forces to go Syria the Assad regime with the Russian military not using Iranian force to go after ISIS in Syria , but ISIS focus on going after groups that opposes Assad , we rate Trump ’s ISIS false .
