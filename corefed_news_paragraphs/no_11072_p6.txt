Imagine what happens if Trump racks up a lot of delegates , he racks up a lot of delegates get to the convention , it looks like Trump has won , and the party machinery finagles it away from Trump .Trump supporters would blot the Republican Party .At the same time if Trump waltzes to the nomination , there is a major sliver , and maybe not just a sliver , at the top of the Republican Party that will start a Republican Party in exile .Or you can quite imagine that happening .
