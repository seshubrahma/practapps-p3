Gest did not suggest any political fixes Gest saying : For many white working class people , and this is going to be controversial , for many white working class people , not all of them but many , you have a community of people who are advanced in age , whose skill set is for a different economy , who are living in communities that are losing population , losing resources , and so in many ways , the only way of many white working class people their plight is a form of political hospice care .These are communities that are on the paths to death , and the question is how can we make that as comfortable as possible    …      Gest inadvertently admitted that the targets of his pity , white people who are advanced in age, whose skill set is for a different economy, who are living in communities that are losing population, losing resources communities , actually have a broader ,    view of their economic circumstances , saying : How can we truly ‘ level the playing field’ ?And what is so remarkable Jonathan , is that that is the language many of my white Gest class respondents used .
