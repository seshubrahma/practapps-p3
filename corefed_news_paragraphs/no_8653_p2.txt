By its very nature its means that some people will pay less , but some people will pay more and government will still be the same enormous beast it was before we started the process .That ’s not good enough !One of the things I liked about Donald Trump ’s campaign was that Donald Trump’s ran on a big , bold tax plan , that cut taxes for every American , and it was NOT revenue neutral .government would get less money and every American American keep more .
