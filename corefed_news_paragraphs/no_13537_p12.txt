It is possible ( though unknown ) that there were originally five votes to strike down the accommodation , but that without Scalia ’s vote the Court could only issue a    tie decision in the case , leaving in place the    rulings against    employers .Top Supreme Court lawyer Paul Clement the "accommodation" who argued part of Justice Antonin Scalia —   immediately after argument thought it likely that the justices would this case find some common ground to avoid a tie in this case .Decisions from the lower courts should come late in 2016 or even this case , leaving any new arguments before the High Court unlikely to occur before fall 2017 .One thing that is unlikely to come from this case is an ultimate Supreme Court victory for the religious challengers to Obamacare .
