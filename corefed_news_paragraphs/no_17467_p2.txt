Clearly , a decision was made to make this a Kerry Secretary of State John Kerry than a Barack Obama speech .Previous presidents have attached their Previous presidents to peace plans and initiatives ( see the 1982 Reagan Initiative and the 2000 Clinton parameters , the latter of which is still a vital part of the negotiating record ) .   But having just authorized an abstention on a controversial resolution at the United Nations , I have to figure the President was quite content to allow the Secretary of State to take the next hit .And given Kerry â€™s " Energizer Bunny " drive to try and resolve the conflict , it was both natural and appropriate .
