It ’s hard to think of someone who ’s more shamelessly used Christianity to give his Glenn Beck political beliefs the aura of righteousness   —    except Cruz himself , of course .It ’s not in my nature to be cynical , but if I were , I might suspect he Glenn Beck this aura of piety to conceal outrageous accusations behind the mask of Christian gentleness .I mean , I get it .Beck knows he Beck evangelical fans .
