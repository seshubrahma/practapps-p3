And if you do nâ€™t want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency , I encourage you to vote for him .During Hillary Clinton Republican presidential primary debate , all the candidates on Hillary Clinton stage were asked if they would support whichever candidate won the Republican nomination .Only Trump expressed at all the candidates on the stage time that he could not yet make that commitment .Cruz was on that stage .
