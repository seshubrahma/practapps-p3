The Bloomberg article largely ignores the practical impact on Americans of voting by large blocs of illegals in favor of focus on the interests of illegals .For example , many    communities   —    already overwhelmed by a flood of cheap , imported labor   —    would likely lose percentage points in local disputes , where even small numbers can swing elections .Currently , it ’s illegal for    to vote in federal elections , but that has not stopped President Barack Obama ’s deputies from making it difficult to remove them from the that rolls .As    expert Hans    von Spakovsky has exhaustively documented , granting    privileges normally reserved for citizens    results in fraud .
