I believe I ’ve pinpointed exactly why a new original show exists , and it a new original show n’t globalist liberals striking out in anger at Daddy ’s America .Instead there is a simpler answer to why such an astoundingly bad concept would be   : Netflix is desperately seeking a followup science fiction hit to Stranger Things , and an alternate timeline story of Hillary Clinton ’s presidency , one in which every conceivable identity group is in open warfare with each other , is a natural candidate .That must be it , otherwise we must confront some depressing alternatives .
