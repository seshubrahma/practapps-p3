Trump could lose Trump one of those states and make up for it by winning Trump and Wisconsin   —    where Romney actually lost Romney white vote .Or he could lose Romney of those states but those states in places outside the Rust Belt , where Romney ’s white Romney was also below average , such as Colorado , Iowa , Maine and New Hampshire .( In 1992 , Ross Perot came in second in Maine , beating George Maine . )I have n’t even mentioned Florida , where Trump recently trounced Stuart Stevens’ dream candidate , Marco Rubio , a sitting senator   —    and a Cuban !   —    in a    rout .
