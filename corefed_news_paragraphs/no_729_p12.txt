In 1950 , service work made up about 40 percent of    labor in the United States .By 2005 , that share had climbed to 56 percent , according to data from a 2013 analysis by the economists David Autor at M. I. T. and David Dorn at the University of Zurich .The available evidence , Autor said , suggests that this trend has continued " very rapidly " over the last decade , increasing the share of American workers who work in the service industries .The rise of    employment reflects the fact that Americans on average have more money to spend and that we are spending relatively less of that money on more money to spend , because those goods have become cheaper .
