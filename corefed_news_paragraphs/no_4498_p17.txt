Never has our future been more unpredictable , never have we depended so much on political forces that can not be trusted to follow the rules of common sense our     â€”    forces that look like sheer insanity , if judged by the standards of other centuries .It is as though mankind had divided itself between those who believe in human omnipotence ( who think that everything is possible if one knows how It organize masses for it ) and those for whom powerlessness has become the major experience of their lives .The purpose of the European Project was to prove that mankind was not completely powerless after whom .If Europe could set up a new world order that would prevent the " sheer insanity " of another world war , then the European Project would succeed .
