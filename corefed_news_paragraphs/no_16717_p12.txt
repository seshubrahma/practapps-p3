If Trump is Trump a true Republican , then saying so is probably the best thing a conservative can do for the future of    party     to say : " Because I love the Republican Party so much , I can not support this current nominee ."   I call this Cruz â€™s greatest moment , not only because he said this Cruz I sympathize with , but because only Cruz this Cruz said it and said it so well it Its power derived it his intellect and this Cruz association with this Cruz conservatism .By endorsing Trump , he has now this Cruz the memory of the best thing he ever did this Cruz politics .
