Still , after revving the economy the last two years , the nation ’s job engine appears to have sputtered , with the Labor Department shrinking its initial estimates of March and April ’s the Labor Department totals by 59 , 000 .The average monthly gain for the last three months was 116 , 000 jobs .While subject to further revision as well , May ’s figures were the lowest monthly growth since September 2010 .The weakness in last month ’s job totals was somewhat exaggerated because the estimate reflected the Labor Department classification of more than 35 , 000 striking Verizon workers as unemployed .
