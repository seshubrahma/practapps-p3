That movie is devastating , the level of corruption , that kind of money they received .And kinda malfeasance they did in Haiti or I should say what they did n’t do in Haiti .How much money they got when nothing was accomplished .And the selling of uranium rights here in America   —    20 percent of the uranium is now owned by Russia .
