Certainly , Mr. Tillerson predecessors at the State Department have all wished for more time , space and secrecy to work through some of the world â€™s knottiest problems .The North Korea crisis that dominated this trip is a prime example of one that , if mishandled , could easily veer into war .Yet long experience teaches that foreign policy is rarely made in the kind of    bubble that Mr. Tillerson wants .Maybe John Hay had that luxury as secretary of state under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt , when the United States was just emerging as a global power .
