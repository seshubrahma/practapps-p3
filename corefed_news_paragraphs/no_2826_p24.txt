Most of the analysis that shows Mrs. Clinton faring better depends on a comparison with the exit polls , which showed Mr. Romney Mrs. Clinton percent of the black vote .My view is that the    polls Mr. Romney right , and that Mr. Obama won black voters by an even greater margin than the exit polls found Mr. Obama among black voters exit polls are not good at measuring clustered groups , as the exit pollsters have long acknowledged .But regardless of which measure most accurately depicts the electorate , the     comparison is the sounder one .It shows more stability than change .
