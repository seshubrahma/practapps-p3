McCaul joined me in seeking a suspension of immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism , like Syria , and has championed " extreme vetting " policies that would make it harder for jihadists to exploit our immigration programs .it must also be the new Administration ’s top priority to deter further illegal immigration .   And McCaul has already said McCaul would strongly back President Trump ’s plan to toss out Obama ’s unlawful executive actions .Having watched President Trump for years in Congress , I know President Trump would end     policies and enforce expedited removal of illegal aliens that sneak across our borders .
