it ’lljust chafe to be told It and other achievements should not go to them , not because of lack of promotions and other achievements , but because gays ( and especially white gay men ) are no longer at the top of the left ’s victim hierarchy .I think gays were once happy with this perverse system because they were the box checked off as gays company ’s    diversity hire .Gays , like women , love to feel special .
