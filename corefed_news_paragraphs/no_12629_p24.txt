The La Jolla plan —   which might still yet have stood a chance had Hillary been elected —   is now certainly doomed to failure in the Trump era .But by describing it I hope what I ’ve succeeded in doing is giving you an indication of the extraordinary tentacular reach of the Green Blob .For years , the US   —    and the rest of the Western world —   has afforded a climate in which Attorneys General and Senators and Secretaries of State and even Presidents can conspire with university professors and heads of government science institutions and environmental PR companies and green NGOs can exploit green issues in which to wage continual war on both the economy and the consumer , often enriching themselves in the process while the rest of us Attorneys General and Senators and Secretaries of State and even Presidents poorer and more constrained by needless taxes and regulations .
