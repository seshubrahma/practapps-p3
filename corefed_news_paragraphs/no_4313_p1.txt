Since the Reagan Revolution , one area that has consistently united Republicans is a commitment to liberate the American people from the burden of hefty taxation and a desire to allow free markets   —    not tax policy   —    to drive the American economy .   While much of the focus on tax reform has been on the corporate side , another problematic area has that has gotten far less attention is the use of tax incentives to support the " green " energy business .In my opinion , there are no worse examples of tax policy then these incentives because these incentives adulterate the free market and often direct massive profits to the wealthy and politically connected .One tax policy that is ripe for fixing is the Solar Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) .
