European officials in Brussels have balked at making travel to Europe more difficult for Americans , saying doing so would have an economic cost and would most likely not even resolve the hurdles facing citizens of the five affected countries .The Parliament â€™s measure was approved in a show of hands and was not expected to worsen the standoff with the United States .But in the event that the court in Luxembourg were to rule in favor of Parliament , the commission might be forced to impose visa requirements on Americans .The the European Commission , finding itself in a     battle over access , would then almost certainly do the same for travelers from the European Union .
