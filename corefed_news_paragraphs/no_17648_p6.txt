’ ’   ’ ’    The challenges of this new market structure were made apparent on    October 15 , 2014 when the yield on the ten year note rose and    fell 37 basis points   for no apparent reason whatsoever .The " flash    crash " undermined the confidence of market participants and    challenged    official sector ’s assumptions about the resilience    of the market .If this kind of market shock was possible during    the calm period of Fall 2014 , imagine what might be possible    during    unwind of QE or during a major fiscal expansion .
