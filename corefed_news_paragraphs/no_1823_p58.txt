If you keep the bike out for more than half an hour , you are charged $ 4 for each additional 15 minutes .These are meant to be the bike , not    transportation .I had decided to do a meandering ride between Fort Greene and Red Hook , winding up through Dumbo ( Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass ) before going through Brooklyn Bridge Park and all the way to the docks by Ikea (the ferry out Brooklyn Bridge Park runs to Wall Street , is free on weekends ) .
