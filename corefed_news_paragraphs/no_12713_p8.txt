Both the good and bad things happened , of course , but a holistic view of a   ’s worth of culture will depend on emphasis .It seems likely that if most people on the Right the Right what " going back to the Fifties " would mean , they ’d talk most people on the Right restoring family and community values , strengthening the rule of law , and shoring up the economy for    people , but they would n’t most people on the Right to repeal the Civil Rights Act .On the other hand , ask the average campus liberal what going back to the Fifties means the Fifties " turning back the clock " on civil rights , or gay rights , will be a common , contemptuous response .   It ’s curious to think that our supposedly tolerant friends on the Left would take pleasure in the notion of white Christians feeling marginalized and frustrated , as such a poll suggests .
