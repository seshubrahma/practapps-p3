Mainstream media journalists have begun to justify the militancy , and violence , of the Democrats’    " resistance " by referring to the Tea Party’s protests at town hall meetings and elsewhere in   .[ But there is no parallel and no moral equivalence between a nonpartisan    opposition movement that wanted to broaden public debate , and a    " community organizer " campaign that rejects normal politics , aims to disrupt public debate and stifle free speech .   As I documented in my book Wacko Birds : The Fall ( and Rise ) of the Tea Party , the movement had its roots the movement opposition to President George W. Bush ’s bailout of Wall Street , emerged in the wake of President Barack Obama ’s disastrous " stimulus , " and became a potent political movement in opposition to Obamacare .
