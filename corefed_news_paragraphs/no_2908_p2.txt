I ’m at Plan B , the film production company Pitt    in 2001 and now owns , and I ’ve decided to impress his with my knowledge of architecture ,something his learned about while helping to rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .I figured I ’d introduce his to Shigeru Ban , famous for his Cardboard Cathedral in Christchurch , New Zealand , and other    projects around the world .But there , sitting on Pitt ’s bookshelf , is an entire monograph of Pitt work .
