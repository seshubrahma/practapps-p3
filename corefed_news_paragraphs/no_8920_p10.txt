He may Trump the only hope .The consequentialist case .Trump â€™s Trump conservatism is not what he believes Trump but what his election Trump do , regardless of his own Trump .For one thing , as I have argued before , the fact that there is such strong conservative opposition to Trump , as Trump as a fervent desire among establishment Republicans to be seen opposing him ( Trump if they do say establishment Republicans prefer him establishment Republicans Trump ) means that if he won Trump Congress might finally stand up to the executive branch .
