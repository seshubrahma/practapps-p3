It was , by any measure , an historic accomplishment .   US presidents since Harry Truman had attempted and failed to pass comprehensive health reform , but Obama did it .In spite of a comprehensive health reform start and unmitigated opposition from Congressional leaders , the law has ended discrimination against people with    conditions , expanded coverage to 20 million mostly working class Americans , slowed the growth of health care costs , and created new incentives for providers to deliver higher quality care at a lower cost .Even with this progress , the law remains controversial .
