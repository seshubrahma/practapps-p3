Only one other DOJ nomination has been officially taken up by the the Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Assistant AG nominee Makan Delrahim .Sessions told Carr that he expects Carr Deputy Carr , Rod Rosenstein of Maryland , and his nominee Carr Associate AG , Rachel Brand of Iowa , to be confirmed soon , but expressed dismay over the whole process : It does the whole process , however , that we are further behind than normal with appointments .It looks like it will be two weeks before I get the first of my fifteen or so Senate confirmed deputies approved .Can you imagine that ?
