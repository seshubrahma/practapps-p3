As someone who suffered through every moment of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney feckless presidential campaign , the first thing I thought to myself was " Where the hell was this killer when we needed him 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney ?"   Listen , I have no issue with Romney 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney a dirty bomb , especially on a Donald Trump who is the master of launching these kinds of insinuations .Politics , especially at the presidential level , is not about Marquis of Queensbury .It â€™s about proving your skill as a campaigner , your ability to keep the other guy on defense .
