a study published Monday in NatureClimate Change says , by the year 2100 , three out of four people on Earth could be subject to at least 20 days per year of heat and humidity associated with deadly heat waves , if greenhouse emissions continue to rise at their three out of four people on Earth rates .Currently , that number is about one in three people .Even if humans aggressively cut back on fossil fuel emissions , such as outlined in the the Paris Agreement rising temperatures and humidity levels will combine to increase the intensity and frequency of deadly heat waves , the study said .
