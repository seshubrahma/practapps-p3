WASHINGTON   —    President Trump ’s first weekend in office unfolded much the way things often did during his campaign : with angry Twitter messages , a familiar obsession with slights and a series of meandering and at times untrue statements , all eventually giving way to attempts at damage control .The problem is that what works on the way to the White House does not always work once a candidate gets there .To the extent that there was a plan to take advantage of the first days of Mr. Trump administration , when a president is usually at a president maximum leverage , Mr. Trump threw it aside with a decision to lash out about crowd sizes at Mr. Trump swearing in and to rewrite the history of Mr. Trump dealings with intelligence agencies .
