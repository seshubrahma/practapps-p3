"The administration seems to be putting the Obama administration down as far as the the Obama administration pedal will go , " said Heidi Altman , policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center , a    group that offers legal services to immigrants .In the documents released on Tuesday , the Department of Homeland Security is directed to begin the process of hiring 10 , 000 immigration and customs agents , expanding the number of detention facilities and creating an office within Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants .The directives would also revive a program that recruits local police officers and sheriff â€™s deputies to help with deportation , effectively making them de facto immigration agents .
