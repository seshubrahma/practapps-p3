Here â€™s a brilliant quote from Howard , Raymond , and South Korean trade representatives Richman on the subject : " Economists since Adam Smith have advocated free trade .But economic theory tells us that free trade will not be balanced except under very restrictive conditions : 1 ) all the trading partners use the same currency , 2 ) labor and capital are freely mobile between them , and 3 ) there are no barriers to imports or subsidies to all the trading partners .The reader will note that these conditions are imposed by the U. S. Constitution on the States .They do not exist internationally .
