" For me personally , it ’s resistance against what San Francisco has been , and what I see the country becoming , in the form of    culture .That ’s where it ’s almost impossible to have polite or constructive political discussion .   Disagreement gets you labeled fascist , racist , bigoted , etc .It can provoke a reaction so intense that you ’re suddenly an unperson to an acquaintance or friend .
