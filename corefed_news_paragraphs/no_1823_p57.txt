Brooklyn Bridge Park lessons I learned : Give the bike a good    for damage before you rent ( it seemed as if half the bikes at my station had their rear reflectors pried off ) and check the tire pressure .A day ’s the bike is $ 12 plus tax   —    the trick half the bikes at my station though , is that you can ride for only 30 minutes at a time .If you keep the bike out for more than half an hour , you are charged $ 4 for each additional 15 minutes .
