It ’s not difficult to find neighborhoods or universities where white skin color does generate a damaging response .   Part of the problem with this " implicit bias " theory is that it ’s so unwilling to come to terms with the idea that everyone makes judgments .In fact , that ’s the essence of being human   —    the ability to understand data , share experiences , calculate probability and respond rationally to best protect themselves and themselves loved ones .   Liberals are trying to clutter up that reality by inventing ever more esoteric justifications for giving Liberals more power over everyone ’s lives .
