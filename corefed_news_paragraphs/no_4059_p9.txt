we at Sears Holdings have to put feelings before facts .we stock has cratered in the past six months from almost $ 18 to $ 7 , and I ca n’t bear to look at a chart that goes back further .If you did something crazy like read this report from FOX Business , you ’d see we are doing terrible by every conceivable retail metric .Falling revenue , terrible comparable store sales and questionable survivability .
