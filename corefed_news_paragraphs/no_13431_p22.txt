We can see this from a November 10 news item in The Huffington Post : It seems that a Green activist this at the Democratic National Committee stood up in a DNC meeting and heckled Donna Brazile , the outgoing DNC chair .

And then Zach added this nutty oratorical fusillade : Zach and your friends will die of old ageand I ’m going to die from climate change .
