Last year , we in New York had a chance to listen and watch as Carmelo Anthony , a basketball star in the middle age of his career , embraced the struggles of Baltimore , his his hometown , and the battle for gun control .Here in Santa Clara , Kaepernick has undergone a similar metamorphosis , speaking and donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity .He his out of the shower Monday night and slipped a shirt over his his and tattooed torso .He his in the locker room , his his in neat cornrows , as reporters surrounded him his a bristling thorn bush of microphones and cameras and recorders .
