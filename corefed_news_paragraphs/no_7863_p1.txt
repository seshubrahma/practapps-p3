it is the sickening display of a school yard bully .We ’ve never seen this in politics before .I notice that somebody tallied up in the debate Saturday night that the word ‘ liar’ was used 22 times .We do n’t use that word where I come from , because when you make that kind of allegation , We look back at We founding fathers , for example , and realize that Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations , and now We have Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations hurled out as if making allegation somehow makes it allegation and makes it allegation .
