It happens to JJ DiMeo , who has cerebral palsy ( as does Micah Fowler , the actor who plays him ) during gym class , and he is quick to use his    device to tell everyone that he is not interested in being him to or pitied in him way .By the end of him episode , he has found a    team for people with disabilities where this February episode is real , and so is him contact   â€”    he ends up with a smashed face , just as nondisabled hockey players sometimes do .The message , him always on this show , is served with a brash brand of mirth .
