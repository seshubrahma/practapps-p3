I also want to mention something about the events this evening in Chicago .This is a sad day .Political discourse should occur in this country without a threat of violence without anger and rage and hatred directed at each other .We need to learn to have disagreements without being disagreeable , to have disagreements while being respecting human beings on the other side .
