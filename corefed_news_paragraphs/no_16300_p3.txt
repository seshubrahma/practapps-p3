But there is a whole other supposed injustice being perpetrated against the Trump campaign     the presidential debate schedule , which Trump claims Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have tried to rig so that two of the three debates coincide with NFL football games .     Has the schedule long been established , as it always is , by a bipartisan commission in conjunction with both parties ?Or is Hillary Clinton an evil genius bending the debate schedule to Hillary Clinton    will ?   Obviously the former .
