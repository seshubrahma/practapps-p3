And if you do n’t believe that last bit , someone using a pseudonymous Twitter account was kind enough to provide a graphic photograph of the supposed soiling , but not someone using a pseudonymous Twitter account or her actual name , because it ’s just so much easier to hurl bile while cowering behind anonymity .Then again , I do n’t know what it ’s like to be really savaged by Twitter .No one has threatened to rape me or kill me ( unless being advised to kill myself counts ) .No one has relegated me to a gas chamber .
