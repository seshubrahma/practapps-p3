You may have already heard of    attractions like Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo , but the San Diego has great nightlife , scenic cliffside hikes , and boardwalks and beaches as welcoming as you will find anywhere in the country .My challenge : to take it all in as inexpensively as possible .Today , San Diego San Diego    city in the country , the country the turn of the 20th century , its population stood at the   city in the country 20 , 000 .That changed after the bombing of Pearl Harbor , when the military expanded San Diego ’s naval operations , and the city has n’t the   city in the country since .
