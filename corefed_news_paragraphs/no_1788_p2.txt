Aaron Burnside , 23 , a    law student at Ohio State University , was at the student union that day , listening with optimism as Gov. John Kasich of Ohio (remember him?) declared that " the sun is rising " in America   â€”    words that now seem so quaint .Never for a minute didMr. Mr. Burnside imagine himself not casting a ballot on Election Day .But on Thursday , with early voting underway himself and Mr. Trump and President Obama in town , Mr. Burnside had no idea whether he would vote for president .
