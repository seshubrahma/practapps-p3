Polls consistently show Donald Trump is running behind Hillary Clinton .After Labor Day , if Trump wants Donald Trump find any solace , he needs Donald Trump look to some of the races     most of which were more competitive at this point     where the polls tightened by early September and candidates were able to mount strong comebacks .   Some examples that have been frequently cited include Harry Truman against Thomas Dewey in 1948 , Hubert Humphrey against Richard Nixon in 1968 , Gerald Ford against Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Ronald Reagan against Carter in 1980 , though in two of these cases the comeback did not produce victory .At this point in the 2016 campaign , odds are that only something big will be able to dramatically shift the campaign and throw the    race in a different direction .
