While I speak fluent Spanish , many Dreamers have little or no ability to converse in the language of the countries of their birth .Deporting us to homelands we barely remember or do n’t many Dreamers at all would be an enormous us .I would go on to tell the President that while we do n’t have the papers stating we are American citizens , we live the same lives as our neighbors we were born here or we legally .Growing up , we were taught to celebrate the same holidays , mourn the same national we and celebrate the same national triumphs .
