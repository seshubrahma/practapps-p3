Tragically , Wednesday â€™s morning routine ended with a vicious act of hate and violence designed to divide us .    Shortly after 7 a. m. a man consumed by hate opened fire on Republican members of Congress as they practiced .Rep. Steve Scalise , Rep. Roger Republican members of Congress staffer Zachary Barth , Matt Mika and Capitol Police Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner were all wounded in the torrent of gunfire , but not before Bailey and Griner , along with the Alexandria Police David Bailey , fought back .      Meanwhile , other members who were not injured rushed to the sides of those hit to offer medical assistance until help arrived .
