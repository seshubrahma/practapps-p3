[ If A daughter wants a pony and bats A daughter eyelashes at me , I ’ll be off in a trice to buy A daughter a herd .Baby unicorn ponies , if that ’s what Baby prefers .With jewels inlaid in Baby unicorn ponies, if that’s what she prefers spiral horns and maybe some magical attachment that plays the collected works of Taylor Swift while A daughter rides .   So I totally get where President Trump is coming from when I read reports that , under the influence of Ivanka and President Trump husband Jared Kushner , President Trump has toned the phrasing of an Executive Order so that it no longer includes derogatory comments about the utterly useless and pointless climate deal signed in Paris in 2015 by Barack Obama .
