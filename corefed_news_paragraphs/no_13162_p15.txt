In politics , our arms are our votes .Those votes will not be cast for mythical perfect candidates , arms candidates that our have won our votes have won , but did n’t .We have to vote for one of two candidates who have a chance to take that oath of our on a cold day in January .For myself , when I cast my ballot , I will not be asking whether Donald Trump ’s immigration policies are 100 percent in tune with my own .
