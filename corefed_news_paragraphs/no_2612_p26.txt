Mr. Trump is proposing a new tax deduction , meaning parents people would not pay taxes on a portion of their income used for child care expenses .( The tax code currently allows a married couple people set aside up to $ 5 , 000 in pretax income for child care expenses , or to claim a credit that reduces taxes owed on up to $ 6 , 000 in child care expenses . )While he did not provide details , his new deduction would likely benefit a narrow group .The government lets all Americans reduce taxable he by a fixed amount .
