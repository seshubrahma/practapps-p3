This is what occurred when Presidents Nixon and Bill Clinton , each in their own way , abused the Presidents Nixon and Bill Clinton of the presidency .In the end , democracy teaches that America is bigger , much bigger , than any president .   Most important , we can all play a role in bringing our nation together , in healing the wounds of a divisive election .We can do this by listening our those whose pain we feel , and those whose our we have yet to feel .
