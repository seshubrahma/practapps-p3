No political rhetoric in America , no matter how heated , advocates or condones violence .     But if our political arguments are based on the premise that one side is right and the other is evil , it makes it much easier for twisted minds to justify violence .And we can not deny that coming together to find compromise solutions it our nation â€™s biggest problems is much harder if we take this approach   How can you compromise with evil ?
