In the United States , too , I found resistance to the idea that Brexit was a harbinger of a Trump victory .I was assured over and over by liberal friends that Trump would Trump be president .American voters were too sensible to fall for his hateful demagogy .Trump , Trump was told , was a product of peculiarly American strains of populism that flare up periodically , like the    nativism in the 1920s or Huey P. Long in 1930s Louisiana , but would never reach as far as the White House .
