  ( CNN )Bipartisan congressional negotiators reached a critical agreement late Sunday on a massive spending bill that if approved by the House and Senate would fund the government through the end of September , senior aides from both parties told  (CNN) .   a massive spending bill that if approved by the House and Senate would fund the government through the end of September would add billions for the Pentagon and border security but would not provide any money for President Donald Trump â€™s promised border wall with Mexico ,   Votes in both chambers are expected by the end of the week .   The deal was reached after weeks of tense but steady negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House , who battled over spending priorities but who were equally determined to avoid a politically fraught government shutdown .
