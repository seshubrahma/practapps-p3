[ A wide variety of entertainers ( I use the term loosely ) and other    Americans announced during the    to the election that the election would leave America if Donald Trump won the presidency .   It has become something of a standard campaign ploy for the Democrats they the Democrats think they the Democrats shock voters into choosing their voters by posing the question : " How can America survive without Alec Baldwin ?"Of course this election the stakes were even higher .
