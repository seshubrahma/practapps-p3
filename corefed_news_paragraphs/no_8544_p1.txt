ve been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years .And I suspect that there ’s not a president in our history that at some point has n’t been subject to protests .So I would not advise people would feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign, I would n’t advise them people be silent .
