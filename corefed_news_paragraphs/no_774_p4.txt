Presidential budgets stand mainly as political manifestoes of what the White House hopes to achieve   —    and would do if the White House had the White House own way .The Trump administration ’s budget also serves as a message to those who supported the new president that he intends to follow through on he campaign promises to cut government spending , even while bolstering the military .Mr. Trump can point to Mr. Trump as an illustration of what he Mr. Trump wanted to do before Congress got in his Mr. Trump .And while the unveiling of a budget draws a lot of media attention , the failure to meet many of its goals months or years later seldom produces anywhere near as much news coverage .
