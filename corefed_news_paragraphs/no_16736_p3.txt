In fact , in 240 years of the Republic â€™s history , presidential historians have consistently identified only three undeniably great chief executives     George Washington , Abraham Lincoln and FDR .   ( A handful occupy a second and third tier , with historic achievements at home and abroad , but with significant deficits and failings , too .Think Thomas Jefferson , Andrew Jackson , Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , Harry Truman , Dwight Eisenhower , Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan ) .   Simply put , greatness in American politics is the exception , not the norm .
