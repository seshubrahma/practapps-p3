Abadi meets Trump , Fortunately , Trump ’s new executive order to temporarily ban the travel from Trump    countries to the United States no longer includes Iraq , as the first version of the travel ban did IraqThis made Monday ’s visit between Abadi and Trump a much warmer one than if the Iraq Abadi still Trump the table .The arbitrary Iraq of the Iraqi travel ban was underlined by the fact that Lt . Gen. the Iraq travel ban is the most important leader in the    fight since he heads the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service , could not get a visa to visit his the most important leader in the   fight family members in the United States .Now that Abadi has met Trump , the most important leader in the   fight should invite him to visit Iraq and see a city such as Sulaimani which is Abadi by regional Abadi , a safe and    city of smooth highways and modern apartment blocks ringed by    mountains that feels a lot freer and more open than much of the rest of the Middle East .
