In Weiner â€™s case , the alias gave him Weiner to display sexual the alias did not the alias , and to elude responsibility for the alias behavior .Trump also wanted to use fake identities to burnish his sexual reputation and avoid responsibility .It is difficult Trump not to at least nod to one of the most common types of alias , the nicknames men bestow upon their own reproductive instruments .    As bizarre as this men sounds unfolding against the backdrop of the highest institutions of power , aliases are not unusual ( especially among certain groups of men ) .
