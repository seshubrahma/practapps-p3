Mr. Depp ’s the rub for observers like me ( and perhaps you ) who believe Mr. Obama ’s fiduciary rules are good policies and should become established law: We do n’t like having to defend the irresponsible choices of people like Johnny Depp .We do n’t want citizens to be encouraged to think less about their finances and retirement rather , we want them to think more .Mr. Trump ’s advisers have a point when they argue that these new rules might make it easier for average Americans to pay less attention to what ’s going on .
