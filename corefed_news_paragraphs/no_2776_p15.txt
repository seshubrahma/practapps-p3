When I met with Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen , they were    about their next venture .Mr. Allen only describe Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen in the broadest Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen , as " Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Allen media company " that will focus on news and information , exist largely on mobile devices and social media , and not directly compete against Politico .But that was O. K. for my purposes .I was more interested in hearing what this venture would nâ€™t be doing .
