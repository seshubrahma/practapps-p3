The condescension that coastal liberal elites tend to have towards those that live in flyover country , and in red states , has cultivated a sense that all Democrats do n’t need to take the concerns and struggles of Republican voters seriously .Over the past year during The Dangerous Faggot Tour , MILO has been the voice for a disenfranchised portion of the American demographic that has been marginalized and forgotten by the left with their undying insistence on toxic identity politics .If the left truly wants the left him , and the MILO that he has created , MILO ’d be in their best interest to sincerely the left truly wants to defeat him, and the movement that he has created with the concerns of his supporters by attending MILO events and participating MILO a dialogue .Conservative and libertarian students are forced to engage with opposing perspectives almost every day in the classroom .
