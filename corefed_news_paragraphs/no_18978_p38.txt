Gladwell :A theme of " David and Goliath " is this    idea of legitimacy , that civil societies work when the citizenry    perceives their governing institutions civil societies be legitimate , and that    is based on three principles : fairness   —    that everyone is treated    the same ; transparency   —    that you know exactly what the    consequences of certain actions are ; and responsiveness   —    when    you feel that you can stand up and complain and that you will be    heard . ’"    What the police do does n’t work unless the population believes in    what the    are the police believes in the legitimacy of the    institution of the police force .
