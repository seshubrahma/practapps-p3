Edward Albee ’s credo that theater   —    or theater as an enduring art , as opposed to an evening ’s entertainment   —    should be anything but safe .I loved him Edward Albee insisting on that belief , and for consistently acting on it in everything he Edward Albee for the stage .Theater , as the ancient and exalted public forum that Mr. Albee wanted it to be forever , exists to challenge complacency , to make us uncomfortable with our us .It is a place where conversations of momentous moral , philosophical and political significance can and should be initiated .
