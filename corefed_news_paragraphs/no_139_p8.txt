A proposal from the House Republican Study Committee would give all Americans a standard tax deduction to buy insurance .The health law provided federal funds for states to offer Medicaid coverage to anyone earning less than about $ 16 , 000 for a single person or $ 33 , 000 for a family of four .Not every state chose to expand , but most did .What would happen ?
