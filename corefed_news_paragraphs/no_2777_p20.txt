Mr. Cruz would then become a clear favorite Mr. Cruz —    similar to what happened in Wisconsin   —    if he won the Mr. Cruz Mr. Rubio’s voters or benefited from a slide in Mr. Kasich ’s support .And indeed Mr. Cruz now has Mr. Cruz slight edge in the same demographic model Mr. Rubio for Mr. Cruz to 40 percent for Mr. Trump , with Mr. Cruz to Mr. Kasich , after adding the results from Arizona , Wisconsin and Utah and Mr. Cruz variable to account for the absence of Mr. Rubio .But the split between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich’s in Indiana should be considered nothing more than a rough guess .
