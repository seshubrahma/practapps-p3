Trying to stop Comey from testifying by using executive Trump’s will almost certainly fail , but I understand why the White House would want to do it .It is extremely concerned about what Comey is going to the White House , Trump’s it makes sense to use every trick in the book to try It stop him from publicly humiliating the President Trump’s   Asserting executive privilege in this situation would be a desperate act , but we may have a desperate man in the White House right now .
