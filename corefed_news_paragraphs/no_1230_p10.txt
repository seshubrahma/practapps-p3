One factor in the C. I. A. analysis last summer was that American intelligence agencies learned that Mr. Comey ’s cyberattacks had breached Republican targets as well as Democrats .But virtually none of the hacked Republican material came out publicly , while the Russians , working through WikiLeaks and other public outlets , dumped substantial amounts of Democratic material Russia to Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign .Some intelligence officials were wary of pushing too aggressively before the election with questions about possible Russia Russia and the Trump campaign because of concerns it might be seen as an improper political attempt to help Mrs. Clinton .But after her loss , a number of Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters have said that Mr. Comey and other government officials should have revealed more to the public during the campaign season about what they knew of Russia ’s motivations and possible connections to the Trump campaign .
