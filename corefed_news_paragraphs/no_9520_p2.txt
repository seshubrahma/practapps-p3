My mom and dad   —    my mom was a maid at a hotel , and instead of hiring an American like my mom , you have brought in over a thousand people , from all over the world , to fill those jobs instead .So I think this is an important issue .And I think we are realizing increasingly that this ’s an important issue for the country that ’s been debated for 30 years , but finally needs to be solved once and for all .
