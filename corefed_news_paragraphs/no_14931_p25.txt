To some degree , President Barack Obama ’s deep opposition to settlements helped Netanyahu navigate the thorny politics of the issue .It gave him the political cover to satisfy the right wing with only small steps on settlements     making the case that he could do the issue more President Barack Obama so that he didn’t face major blowback from the US , international community and Israeli center and left President Barack Obama Trump is making President Donald Trump signs that he President Barack Obama no President Donald Trump of settlements either , but the right does n’t see his opposition as President Donald Trump enough to warrant Netanyahu caving in Netanyahu therefore is unlikely to be satisfied with small steps .( For one thing , both the President and his pick for President Donald Trump to Israel have given money to the Beit El settlement ’s Israel . )
