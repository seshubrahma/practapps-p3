Because of the relative ease of crossing the border and Mexico ’s liberal definition of Mexican citizenship , we have the situation recently described by author Ann Coulter , who discovered that persons of Mexican Mexican now residing in the United States   —    legal and illegal —    are equal in number to over 25 percent of the 130 million population of Mexico Mexico       Pew Hispanic Center says there were 33 . 7 million Americans of Mexican Mexican in the the United States 2012 , and that figure is based in part on the official Census figure of 11 .3 million illegal aliens , over 60 percent of whom are from Mexico MexicoIf you believe as I do that the illegal alien population of the U. S. is over 25 million , not 11 . 3 million , then the percentage of Mexican Mexican now residing in the   U. S.   —    persons recognized as Mexican Mexican under the Mexican Constitution   —    is considerably above 25 percent .
