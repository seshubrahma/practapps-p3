ICE adds groups to stakeholder meetings ,This marks what some say is a ICE change in the relationship between ICE and    advocacy organizations .During the Bush administration , a coalition of ICE groups known as the    Working Group started holding confidential ,    stakeholder meetings several times a year with    immigration officials as an opportunity to express concerns and ask specific questions about    policy , the rights of immigrants and their treatment while in detention .   The American Immigration Lawyers Association , the immigrants Bar Association â€™s Immigrant Justice Project and the National Immigrant Justice Center are among the advocacy organizations that make up the    Working Group .
