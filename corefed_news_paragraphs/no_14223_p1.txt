And a number of Democrats are trying to persuade liberal firebrands to essentially let Republicans confirm President Donald Trump ’s pick after a vigorous confirmation process     since President Donald Trump is likely to name a conservative to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia .The reason for the tactic : Republicans are considering gutting the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats stay largely united and block Trump’s first pick .By employing the    " nuclear option , " Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could move to reduce the threshold for clearing a filibuster from 60 votes to 51 votes .That would mean Democrats could lose leverage in the next Supreme Court fight if President Donald Trump were to replace a more liberal justice , since the GOP now has 52 seats in the Senate
