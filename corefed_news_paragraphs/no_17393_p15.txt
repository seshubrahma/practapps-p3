Why did Comey do this ?the election n’t he or the Comey say anything about the investigations into Comey Russia hacks ?Some Democrats speculated that there were partisan motivations behind this decision     that Comey , who was a registered Republican ( up until July ) working in a Democratic administration , was out to get the nominee .   Others argued that Comey ’s commitment to being perceived as apolitical and independent had come under attack when he closed the investigation a few months earlier , so he was Comey to show that he was not being intimidated by Comey Obama administration .
