And while we may disagree on the direction of the country , we all agree that violence is never the answer .It is an honor a country privilege to be a member of Congress , one that I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle do not take for granted .     My hope is that in response to this horrific event , we begin to tone down the partisan language that has come to occupy our political dialogue and get back to the issues at hand .While Wednesday gave us all a we , on Thursday we get back to work both on the House Floor     and on the baseball field .
