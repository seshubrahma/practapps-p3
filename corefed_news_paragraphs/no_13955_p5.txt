We have to raise the consciousness of people who are in the progressive community to understand that coming out every four years and campaigning hard for a presidential election is not nearly enough , " Holder said .   Holder said Holder thinks Democrats have been paying too much attention to presidential elections .   " Presidential elections are obviously important , " Holder said , " but Democrats lost sight of the fact that if you want to have a representative Congress you have to make sure that you have state legislatures that are going to yield a representative Congress , and Democrats also lost sight of the fact that a lot of governing in this country happens at state and local level ."   Holder said some of those maps were drawn and manipulated by legislatures to favor the party in power .
