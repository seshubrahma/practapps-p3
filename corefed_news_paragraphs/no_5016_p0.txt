I ’m proud to have made the    case for Donald Trump during the presidential campaign .Now that Donald Trump ’s been sworn in , I ’m eager to help Donald Trump build a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe v. Wade and wipe out the " abortion distortion " that has plagued judicial rulings for decades .So when it comes to filling Justice Scalia ’s vacancy , it ’s essential to assess how the various candidates on President Trump ’s Supreme Court list measure up on that score .[ That ’s why I must respectfully disagree with Andy Schlafly , son of the late and great Phyllis Schlafly , whose vocal opposition to almost all of the candidates on President Trump’s list has caused confusion and consternation among    activists .
