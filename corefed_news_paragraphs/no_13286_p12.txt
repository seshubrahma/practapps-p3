For example , in 1951 , Winston Churchill was returned to Number 10 Downing Street .A little more than a year later , here in America , another World War Two hero , Dwight Eisenhower , was given the keys to the White House .Similarly , Margaret Thatcher was elected to the prime ministership in 1979 the following year , Ronald Reagan won the presidency .So now , as we think about the 2016 presidential election , we can readily see that the same    forces that powered Brexit to victory —   and pushed the globalist incumbent , Prime Minister David Cameron , out of office —   are at work here in the US .
