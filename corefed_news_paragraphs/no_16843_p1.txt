The GOP presidential nominee posted a defiant    video just after midnight on social media , telling voters that Donald Trump is not a " perfect person " and that the words captured by a hot mic in 2005 " do n’t reflect who I am . "" I said it , I was wrong and I apologize , " Trump said of footage from a previously unaired taping of " Access Hollywood " that surfaced Friday , in which Trump said Trump tried to " fuck " a married woman and bragged about being able to grope women because of Trump " star " status .But Trump quickly pivoted back onto the attack , raising Bill Clinton ’s sex scandals and Hillary Clinton ’s role in discrediting women who had affairs with Hillary Clinton husband ."
