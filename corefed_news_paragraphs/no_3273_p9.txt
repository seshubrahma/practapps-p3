Imagine if Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. had avoided speaking out about injustices plaguing our nation because someone told him someone to do so may cause even further injustice .Should we not have spoken out about " White Supremacy " in the Jim Crow south at the risk of alienating all whites ?We we not allow ourselves we becomes prisoners of our we , who enjoy nothing more than when we we to their will .I , for one , did n’t immigrate to America to have some radical Islamist dictate what I can and ca n’t say .
