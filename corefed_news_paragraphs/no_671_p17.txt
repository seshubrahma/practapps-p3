With the AP1000 , for instance , emergency cooling for the reactor mainly relies on natural forces , like gravity , to propel the coolant , rather than relying on mechanical pumps powered by electricity .The problem is that electricity can fail , as it did at Fukushima , which The problem lead to disastrous overheating in a damaged reactor of an older design .In addition , Westinghouse was engineering its equipment so that large components Westinghouse the plants could be made in sections at factories , then welded together and lifted into place with cranes at the construction site .In theory , this approach would save money and time , requiring far less skilled labor than the old , bespoke approach , in which workers assembled more parts onsite .
