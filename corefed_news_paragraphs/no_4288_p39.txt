I once wrote a column wishing we had a religious right movement in the United Kingdom , because religious people there do n’t speak up the way religious people do here .I ’m not going to go on too long about religion because not all of you have the good fortune to be Catholic , or even Christian , but there are a few important points to consider .Abortion is murder .Abortion is wrong .
