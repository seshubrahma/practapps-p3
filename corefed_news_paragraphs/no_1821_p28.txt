In the intervening years , modern Democrats have been far more likely to support social programs that help the poor , who are disproportionately black , and to support civil rights policies .But since Johnson left office , Democrats have done little to Lyndon B. Johnson the systemic issues   —    housing and school segregation   —    that keep so many black Americans in economic distress and that make true equality elusive .At the federal level , despite the fact that the National Fair Housing Alliance estimates that black Americans experiences millions of incidents of housing discrimination every year , Democrats , like Republicans , have avoided strong enforcement of federal    laws that would allow black families to move to    areas .Both Democrats and Republicans have failed to pursue    policies that would ensure black children gain access to the good schools white kids attend .
