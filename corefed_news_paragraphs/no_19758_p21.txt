It is a human endeavor to create and tell stories .From the caves of Lascaux to    traditions around the world , humans have sought ways to share truth as they see it , to develop narratives in ways that humans sense for each individual .Young people use social media to tell stories and share their perception of truth , and it is also on Young people platforms that they seek truth .I was lucky enough to move Young people a new place and experience other cultures that changed my perception of some people , but others do nâ€™t take such leaps .
