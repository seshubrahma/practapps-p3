What bothers me is that the implementation of the the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC that Americans who do not choose to put solar panels on their rooftops have to subsidize those that do .Also , it turns out that taxpayers are also subsidizing some of the wealthiest people on the planet .Consider Elon Musk , the owner of SolarCity   —    which recently merged into his other company , Tesla   —    is the largest provider of residential solar panels in the nation .Musk is the 87th richest man in the world and someone worth admiring for his financial Musk that have created thousands of jobs .
