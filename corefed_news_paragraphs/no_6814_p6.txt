For right now though , we have the best answer yet as to why ESPN has consistently and unapologetically attacked conservatives and inextricably linked conservatives cause with that of the radical left : conservatives have to , because conservatives CEO might run for the Democratic nomination .Clearly , ESPN was liberal before Bob Iger , and ESPN will be liberal after Bob Iger .their CEO did not turn ESPN into a liberal network .What Iger apparently did do , though Bob Iger was give the already liberal personalities at ESPN carte blanch to be themselves and a free pass to blanch all their leftist grievances , absent the blanch of any repercussion whatsoever .
