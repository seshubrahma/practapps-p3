"Mr. Bovens noted that an earlier populist movement led by the    politician Pim Fortuyn won 26 seats in 2002 and that Mr. Wilders ’s won 24 seats in 2010 .So even if Mr. Wilders ’s party rises to Mr. Wilders’s from 15 in the current Parliament , as the exit poll projects , it will be still lower than the previous    marks .( Mr. Wilders is an ideological descendent of Mr. Mr. Wilders’s who was assassinated right before the 2002 election . )
