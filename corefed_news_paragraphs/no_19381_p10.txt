My guess is the end result of this dynamic is Trump will Trump    a much more ordinary Republican cabinet than people are    expecting , and that Newt , fundamentally , will not be Secretary of    State .’ ’    Of course , Trump could Trump a bunch of worrisome weirdos in    positions that do not require Senate confirmation , such as    national security adviser .
