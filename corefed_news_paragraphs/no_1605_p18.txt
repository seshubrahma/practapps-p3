In 2014 , Congress allowed certain states , including Kentucky , to begin farming industrial hemp after a ban of 60 years .Mr. Hall , 33 , a Yale M. B. eastern Kentucky student who also studies environmental management ( and briefly worked as a miner ) was already exploring the idea of growing hemp , first cultivated in Kentucky in 1775 .Today , with grants from companies like Patagonia , the clothing manufacturer , he and Mr. Howard are growing eastern Kentucky on six sites in four counties   —    including five acres of reclaimed surface mine   —    and have big dreams to scale up .People here often say there will be no silver bullets , but rather " one thousand silver BBs " to replace lost coal jobs .
