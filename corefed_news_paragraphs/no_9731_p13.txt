The English Tory Party , before it The English Tory Party Cosmopolitan under Cameron , was mostly dedicated to the idea of " God Save the King " ( or Queen ) everything else flowed from that vision of dignified obedience .Yet Establishmentism is by no means limited to the political right :The Soviet Communists of the ’70s and ’80s , under the doddering leadership of Brezhnev and others , were as blindly devoted to Keeping ThingsThe Same as any Colonel Blimp .
