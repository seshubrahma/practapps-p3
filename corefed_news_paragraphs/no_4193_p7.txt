ve heard endless stories about the reign of terror against Muslims , but have yet to hear of one single Muslim   —    much less a wave of Muslims   —    moving out of the United States .It ’s not as if they get depressed at the thought of abandoning the old ancestral home , where their they are buried .They they got here !If any Muslim were at risk of so much as a dyspeptic look from white Americans , there ’s emigration as well as immigration .
