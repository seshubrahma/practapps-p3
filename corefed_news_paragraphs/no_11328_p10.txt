And so it ’s strange that House Republicans would fear reprisal when so much damage has already been inflicted , and it is the U. S. that needs to retaliate to preserve its manufacturing base .There is one area , however , where Republicans may finally be seeing the proverbial light , and that involves the issue of a Value Added Tax ( VAT ) .Currently , the United States is the only major industrialized nation not to employ a VAT system .As a consequence , foreign VAT taxes not only impose a surcharge on U. S. exports to a VAT country but also subsidize that country ’s producers with rebates for their own exports .
