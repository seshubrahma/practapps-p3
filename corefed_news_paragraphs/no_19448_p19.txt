It ’s just the nature of momentum and herding .This is a high quality company in a tough sector , which is just right for my tastes and experience .My variant view is the franchise is stable , they invest behind it , the franchise ACA    the franchise healthcare access is n’t going anywhere .If it is , that ’s 6 . 5 % of EBITDA gone and it ’s still cheap.
