In an election cycle where coverage of sexual violence has enraged and saddened me , voting gives me the opportunity to select leaders who will work towards a world that is safer for people like me .In an election cycle where the needs of those living in poverty have not been a topic of much discussion , I can vote for leaders whose decisions will affect Medicaid , SNAP and other welfare programs in my state and across the nation .   In an election cycle where so much of the rhetoric has been about people that I care deeply about     including my friends and colleagues who are people of color , Muslims and immigrants     voting allows me to select leaders who will work to right past and present wrongs , ensure that their Muslims and immigrants     and rights are upheld , and create a more equitable America .
