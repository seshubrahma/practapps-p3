On a day usually reserved for pomp , constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses , Congress instead pitched Congress into partisan battles .Speaker Paul D. Ryan easily won    but not before the embarrassment of having Speaker Paul D. Ryan members defy Speaker Paul D. Ryan by voting to eliminate the ethics office , only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and Twitter messages from    Donald J. Trump that criticized House Republican priorities .It was a rocky start to a period in which Republicans had promised an end to Washington gridlock if Republicans controlled both Congress and the White House .There was intraparty conflict and a sense that Mr. Trump , who ran against the Republican establishment , would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times .
