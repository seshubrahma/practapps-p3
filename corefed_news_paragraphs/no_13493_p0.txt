The WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton ’s paid speeches revealed the Democratic nominee told a private group in 2013 that the country of Jordan " ca n’t possibly vet all those [ Syrian ] refugees    …      so all those [Syrian] refugees    don’t know if    …      jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees ."[ Clinton ’s remarks , made in an October 28 , 2013 , speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago ’s Vanguard Luncheon , for which Clinton was paid $ 400 , 000 , according to the Citizen Uprising website , are in stark contrast to the public position Clinton has taken during Clinton current campaign for president .
