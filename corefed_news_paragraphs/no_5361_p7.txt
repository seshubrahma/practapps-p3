By taxing carbon dioxide ( the harmless trace gas which makes the planet greener ) the US government would be signalling to the world that it the US government believes in the    global warming narrative .This , in turn , would keep alive the    " renewables " industry in which Paulson , Steyer , Bloomberg and their Bloomberg are so heavily invested .Even now , Wall Street remains quite hideously exposed to the green boondoggle .When the Green Blob finally explodes , a lot of    and crony capitalists and dodgy financiers are going to lose billions .
