Every situation the press no matter how controlled , contrived or mundane , was an opportunity to make something real .I know that I can never explain the dayâ€™s news the way our writers do , but what I can do is help the reader feel what it is like to be there and to make pictures that have meaning beyond the objects in the frame .My role is not to make the candidate look good or make the crowds look impressive .
