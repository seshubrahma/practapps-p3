President Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism , like Boeing , Lockheed Martin , automakers and news organizations , sometimes causing gyrations in their Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their corporations to suit a bellicose president .But in those cases , his a bellicose president targeted government contracts , departing American jobs or news coverage   —    not his a bellicose president family ’s personal fortunes .Six days after Nordstrom announced that , based on sales , it would no longer carry Ms. Trump ’s products   —    a decision that prompted some Trump Ms. Trump’s to call for a boycott of the stores   —    the president took to Twitter to complain that " Ivanka has been treated so unfairly " by the company .
