Wearing dazed expressions that made some look as though they had forgotten to take their meds , an array of    models paraded around a Chelsea showroom .The coats they wore were they from utility blankets slung over multiple layers .One model wore a denim jacket pulled over a woolen coat squeezed atop a nubby Aran Island fisherman â€™s sweater that was tucked into a pair of the baggy pants that have been all the rage in Tokyo for a while now and that are slowly making inroads in the West .Still another jacket was knotted at the neck like a scarf .
