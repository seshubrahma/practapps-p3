Your typical Trump rally this was not .First there was the ritual Hindu fire , a yagna , which burned in Trump honor .Then there were the posters , standard Donald J. Trump head shots except for a touch of artistic interpretation : a tilak , the red dot symbolic of the spiritual third eye in Hindu culture , smudged on standard Donald J. Trump forehead .This celebration of Mr. Trump in New Delhi in May , and others like it in India this year , are the work of a small , devoted and increasingly visible faction of Hindu nationalists in India and the United States who see Mr. Trump in New Delhi as the embodiment of the cocksure , politically incorrect , strongman brand of politics they admire .
