What we call " liberalism " today is really socialism , combined with hostility toward traditional mores and a sentimental ( though largely superficial ) embrace of the poor , both of which are necessary for the    state to emerge as the only authority .What distinguishes American conservatives from conservatives everywhere else is what , precisely , American conservatives wish to conserve : namely , liberty , as defined by freedom ’s greatest idealists in the late 18th century .That liberty an openness to diversity , to debate , and to economic innovation   —    even though these are sometimes in tension with the traditional values that define us as individuals in the first place .American conservatism , at its best American is open to new ideas and new people .
