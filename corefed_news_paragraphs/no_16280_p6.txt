An alliance of true    conservatives ( think Rand and Ron Paul supporters ) and nationalists who are fine with big government as long as big government serves narrowly defined American interests ( think Trumpistasâ€™ enthusiasm for Medicare , wall building and torture ) has effectively sidelined most GOP supporters of activist leadership .   What holds these two groups together is these two groups focus on defending the Constitution and military security and these two groups disdain for laws and norms that originate outside the United States or constrain the United States in any way .By these standards , requiring American soldiers to obey international humanitarian law is somewhere between foolish and treasonous .Using this rationale , the strategic and humanitarian objectives that led Ambassador Chris Stevens to risk his life Ambassador Chris Stevens and the lives of his team Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi fade away .
