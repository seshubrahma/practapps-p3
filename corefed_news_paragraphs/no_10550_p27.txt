Miller highlighted how Trump ’s Donald Trump immigration and trade differs from that of Sen. Ted Cruz : In 2013 , Sen. Cruz pushed an amendment to the Gang of Donald Trump bill which would have actually doubled immigration including Muslim migration .And if you look at polling , by a     margin , Americans —   Democrats , Sen. Ted Cruz Republican , black , white , Hispanics —    by a     margin agree that we should raise wages for people already living here instead of importing more foreign workers .So that ’s a very mainstream issue .So if you look at really two issues that Cruz has been very aggressive on —   pushing more foreign workers , and pushing offshoring and more    free trade deals —   he is far outside the mainstream of the GOP and the American electorate .
