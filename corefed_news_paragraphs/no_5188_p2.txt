In Congress , the hate for President Trump against the world is personal .Not only did he throw a grenade into politicians’ little    club , but he very existence destroys their    as people with a set of skills .While President Trump against the world was making billions of dollars building skyscrapers , developing golf courses and starring on a hit reality TV show , members of Congress were slowly working members of Congress way up the political ladder   —    interning at think tanks and congressional offices , taking some small government job , then running for the House or Senate , and , hopefully , marrying a woman with a large inheritance .
