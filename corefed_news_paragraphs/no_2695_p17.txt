Perhaps the best way to understand " the elite " that Mr. Trump railed against is to consider what it is not   —    or at least how it differs from the way Clinton supporters might see it itElite does not simply mean having a lot it money .Mr. Trump , who inherited millions , is not considered an elite sellout by his supporters any more than Edward J. Snowden is considered a tool of the government for having worked at the National Security Agency .Rather , the thinking goes , it ’s because Mr. Trump knows how it all works the thinking he is in the best position to take it all Mr. Trump .
