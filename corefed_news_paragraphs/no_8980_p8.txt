The natives , or    citizens , are those born in the country , of parents who are citizens , " Vattel ’s book reads .Under that definition , since Cruz was born in Canada —   and also importantly since his father was not a U. S. citizen —   he would not be a his born citizen .That stricter definition of natural born citizen would also , interestingly , mean that Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) is not a natural born citizen either .
