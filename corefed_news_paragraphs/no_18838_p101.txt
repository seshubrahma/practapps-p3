" I do nâ€™t know how to describe it , exactly , but I feel in a lot of ways that my identity as a white man is shamed .I am in zero ways a white nationalist or supremacist , and I consider myself illegal immigrants feminist .I will likely sacrifice my career goals , It with fewer hours or relocation as needed , so that my fiancee can pursue her ambitions and goals .But I do not want to be shamed or held back or attacked for just being what I am .
