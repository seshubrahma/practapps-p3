I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately .I Israel known him for many years and we will be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu to the entire region .While this declaration may sound simplistic , it comes after seven years of Obama Israel policies some have argued are hostile to the Jewish state .And it this declaration on the heels of a turbulent relationship between Obama and Netanyahu , including a notorious May 2010 White House meeting in which Obama reportedly snubbed Netanyahu for dinner with Obama wife and daughters .
