But tonight it ’s my turn to say thanks .Whether we have seen     or rarely agreed at all , my conversations with you we the American people   —    in living rooms and in schools at farms and on factory floors at diners and on distant military outposts   —    those conversations are what have kept me honest , and kept me inspired , and kept me going .
