Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the minority leader in the House , physically threw the the White House the ground , arguing that it was " nothing more than spending , the bill and more spending ."But Democrats , led by the " deficit hawk " wing of the party , also fought against anything own party , and Obama , still in the first Obama of his presidency , was left in the position of negotiating with his own party , such that he was just his able to get the $ his billion on a straight    vote .At first , the results of the stimulus were just as feeble as a stalwart a stimulus package predict .
