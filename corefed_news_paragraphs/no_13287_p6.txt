When the winds blew and the flood waters came , we learned for all of our wealth and we power , we was n’t right with America .We we talk we what happened for a few days in 2005 , and we should .we can talk we levies that could n’t hold , about a FEMA that seem not just incompetent but paralyzed and powerless , about a president who only saw the people from a window on an airplane instead of down here on the ground , trying to provide comfort and aid   …      We can talk we a trust that was broken , the promise that our government would we prepared , will protect us , and we respond in a catastrophe .
