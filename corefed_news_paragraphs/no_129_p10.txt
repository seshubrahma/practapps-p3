BuzzFeed , under Mr. Smith , has built up a fine traditional news team that has won journalism awards precisely because it succeeded in the ultimate purposes of its craft : BuzzFeed establish fact from fiction and enhance BuzzFeed readers’ understanding of reality .That ’s the opposite BuzzFeed pumping out a bunch of unsubstantiated allegations and then leaving it to readers to " make up their own minds " about them with no reportorial guidance readers You can argue that readers dossier was going to get out there anyway .But it had n’t until BuzzFeed published it , even though the dossier news organizations , including this the dossier , had the dossier for months .And had they leaked by the dossier means , it would be up to journalists to establish their veracity
