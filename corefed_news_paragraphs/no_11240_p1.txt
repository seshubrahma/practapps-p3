In 2012 ,    whites sat out the election , rather than vote for the     rich guy they whites in Mitt Romney .This year , the     rich guys say they the    rich guys vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross .   The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats   â€”    the top .
