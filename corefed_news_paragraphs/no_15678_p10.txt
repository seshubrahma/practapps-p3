’s budget suggest that a reorganization of the NIH would improve efficiency and streamline taxpayer monies .But taken together with this administration ’s positions NIH NIH health care access , immigration , scientific research and even education , the administration reason that    research will suffer from far more than reduced funding .    It will wither in a harsh political climate that disputes not only the claims but inherent value of science ,    deprives our research institutions of expertise from all over the world and that forces millions to consult Google rather than doctors they ca n’t afford without health insurance .   Trump ’s budget also proposes to cut NIH ’s Fogarty International Center Google devoted to global health research .
