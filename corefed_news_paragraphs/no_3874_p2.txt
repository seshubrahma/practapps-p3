Flynn’s "lie" to Pence ’s not even clear that National Security Advisor Mike Flynn lied .National Security Advisor Mike Flynn says in National Security Advisor Mike Flynn resignation letter that National Security Advisor Mike Flynn did not deliberately leave out elements of National Security Advisor Mike Flynn conversations with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak when National Security Advisor Mike Flynn recounted his conversations with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Vice President Mike Pence .The New York Times and Washington Post reported that the transcript of the phone call reviewed over the weekend by the White House could be read different ways .One the White House official with knowledge of the conversations told me that Ambassador Sergey Kislyak raised the sanctions to Flynn and that Flynn responded that Flynn Trump team would be taking office in a few weeks and would review Russia policy and sanctions .
