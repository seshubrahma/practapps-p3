TEL AVIV   —    Leaders of the International Women ’s Strike have no idea about the meaning of feminism and have hijacked the movement to protest the " occupation of Palestine " and " Israeli apartheid " instead of speaking out against the " occupation of women ’s bodies " and " Islam ’s religious and gendered apartheid , "   a leading    feminist told Breitbart Jerusalem .[ According to Dr. Phyllis Chesler , emerita professor of psychology at City University of New York and a bestselling author , following Israel ’s 1967 defensive war , Palestinians replaced women as " the favored victims of the month " in liberal circles .   " Now , it was formerly colonized Arab men of color , symbolized by the Palestinians , that became an obsession , " she told Breitbart Jerusalem .Even feminists themselves , Chesler noted , were no " longer concerned with the occupation of women ’s bodies worldwide , but rather with the alleged occupation of a country that had never existed : Palestine .
