I did not respond by referring to the two meetings , one very brief after a speech , and one with two of my senior staffers , professional staffers , with the Russian ambassador in Washington , where no such things were discussed .In my reply to the question   â€”    my reply to the question of Senator Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the question of Senator Franken time .I appreciate that some have taken the view that this was a false comment .That is not my intent .
