■ If the poll is very different from the polling average , there ’s a good chance it ’s an the poll .■ If the poll shows the poll shift from a prior survey , I also wonder whether the previous poll was an outlier .If so , a candidate might appear to rebound simply because he or she was a candidate weak a candidate a prior poll .So compare that prior poll with the average of the time , too .
