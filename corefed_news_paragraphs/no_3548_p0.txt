Attorney General Jeff Sessions found Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the center of controversy this week because Attorney General Jeff Sessions answered a question about the Trump campaign ’s contacts with the Russian government without talking about Attorney General Jeff Sessions contacts as a United States Senator .[ The assumption made by the media , the Democrats , and even some Republicans was that even routine contact with the Russian government is burdened by suspicion of collusion .Not since the McCarthy era have suspicions reached such levels .   But if Sessions ought to resign , perhaps the entire Senate should quit .
