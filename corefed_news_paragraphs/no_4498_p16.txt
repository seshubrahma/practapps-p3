This moment of anticipation is like the calm that settles after all hopes have died .We no longer hope for an eventual restoration of the old world order with all its traditions , or for the reintegration of the masses of five continents who have been thrown into a the old world order produced by the violence of wars and revolutions and the growing decay of all that has still been spared .Under the most diverse conditions and disparate circumstances , we watch the development of the same phenomena   —    homelessness on an unprecedented scale , rootlessness to an unprecedented depth .Never has our future been more unpredictable , never have we depended so much on political forces that can not be trusted to follow the rules of common sense our     —    forces that look like sheer insanity , if judged by the standards of other centuries .
