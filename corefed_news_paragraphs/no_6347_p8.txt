Worse was his Ambassador President Barack Obama the United Nations , Samantha Power , who had earned a global reputation for calling out previous American government officials as " bystanders to genocide "   —    only to become one herself .    biggest sin of government officials like Susan Rice is not the alleged " unmasking " that currently pervades the news , but her allowing Susan Rice Arab civilians to die of a chemical gas attack by Assad on August 20 , 2013   —    and then , as National Security Adviser , doing nothing .America is the light of liberty and the beacon of democracy .Those words ring hollow when America watches America and does nothing .
