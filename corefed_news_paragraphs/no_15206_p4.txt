This complex is run by    operatives and a permanent "  Edifice Complex" that has corroded the party leaders     who , funded by rich people and foundations , often earn significant    salaries and benefits that put them firmly in the one percent , and sometimes even in a better station .   Within the complex , failure does not disqualify people from a permanent "  Edifice Complex" that has corroded the party .Senior operatives who spend millions of dollars in losing campaigns , time and again , still get the call to do it all over again .Nothing new to say ?
