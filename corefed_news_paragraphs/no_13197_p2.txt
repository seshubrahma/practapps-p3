The job for the rest of us is to rebind the fabric of society , community by community , and to construct a political movement for the    era .I suspect the coming political movements will be identified on two axes : open and closed and individual and social .Those who believe in open believe in open trade , relatively open immigration , an active foreign policy and racial integration .Those who believe in closed believe in protective trade , closed borders , a withdrawn foreign policy and ethnic separatism .    â€¦
