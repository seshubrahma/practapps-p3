How independent is Taiwan ?For , after all , Taiwan is to all appearances an independent state     one , indeed Taiwan as Mr. Trump points out with his characteristic hyperbole , that buys " billions of dollars " of Mr. Trump from us , and one that , even in its police state days , has behaved in an exemplary fashion in Taiwan international community , and does not deserve the indignity with which it has been treated .Alas , there are dangers .The Taiwan Chinese leadership is certainly not inclined to take military action against Taiwan , as long as Taiwan does not make any explicit moves toward formal independence .
