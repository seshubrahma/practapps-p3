Michael Barone noted it is " less than the net gains made by Democrats in 2006 and 2008 and by Republicans in 2010 , but still a formidable number in an era that remains , though to a slightly lesser extent , a time of    voting ."Though a net gain of 24 seats by the Democrats is not impossible , the odds against a net gain of 24 seats by the Democrats is not impossible are significant .It is still a long 18 months until the November 2018 midterm elections , and the final outcome is likely to be determined by events that have yet to occur .
