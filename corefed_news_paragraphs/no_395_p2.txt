Mr. Paragomi and six other Iranians remained stranded at Schiphol Airport outside Amsterdam on Tuesday , as Mr. Paragomi and six other Iranians travel ordeal stretched into its fourth day .Mr. Paragomi and six other Iranians were among thousands of people affected by President Trump ’s executive order barring from the United States , for 90 days , travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries : Iran , Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen .The largely spontaneous and spirited protests at American airports over the weekend focused on several aspects of Mr. Trump ’s order , including a    ban on all refugees , an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and an attempt   —    later blocked by judges   —    to deport people with valid visas or refugee status who had already arrived in the United States .But many travelers were stuck in various states of limbo abroad   —    far from the sightlines of American protesters   —    and many travelers plight has only slowly come to light , in many cases through the efforts of volunteer lawyers who have been working on many travelers cases .
