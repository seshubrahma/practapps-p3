I ca nâ€™t say enough about Donald Trump and his general , Steve Bannon , for getting behind a plan to liberate the children of Cleveland .I had spent the last sixteen years banging Donald Trump against the Donald Trump of the Republican Party trying to persuade congressmen , senators , and the Bush White House of the importance and urgency of such a plan .But my pleas fell on deaf ears .The school choice movement had been wandering in the wilderness for want of national leadership even longer .
