When Chuck Todd asked Clapper whether Chuck Todd could confirm or deny if a    Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant had been granted to    engage in this kind of wiretapping , Clapper said , " I can deny       ." ’ "    Several    experts have said , however , that Chuck Todd ’s    question was specific enough to leave Clapper some wiggle room in    Clapper response , which referred only to whether Trump campaign    officials had been wiretapped ." ’’ "    Retired Gen. Michael Hayden , who has served as the director of    both the National Security Agency and the CIA , said   that he viewed Clapper ’s response as a denial that    Trump aides were specifically targeted by the FISA warrant   —    not    as a denial that a warrant was granted to surveil foreign actors    operating inside the US that might have been communicating with   Trump aides .
