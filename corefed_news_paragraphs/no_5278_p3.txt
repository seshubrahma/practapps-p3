In Powell v. McCormick ( 1969 ) the Court held that the Constitution ’s provision that a simple majority of the U. S. House ( or Senate ) can decide the qualifications of its the Constitution’s members before allowing them its new members be sworn into Congress is limited to the criteria set forth in the Constitution ( citizenship , age , and residency ) .Excluding a duly elected candidate for any other reason amounts to expelling that person from Congress , which requires a    vote by Congress , instead of 51 percent .More recently , in U.
