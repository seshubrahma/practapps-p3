I think Clinton ’s polling numbers may be particularly vulnerable to these sorts of fluctuations in the media environment .She Clinton counting on the support of a lot of people who simply do n’t like her Clinton much .I ’d guess a lot of them know , deep down , that they them support her Clinton .But right now , the act of telling a pollster that they them to support someone they them n’t really want to support might be fairly agonizing .
