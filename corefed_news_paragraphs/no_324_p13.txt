I ’m a kind of expert on it .Most actors are very courageous people , and my experience is their commitment increases when it Most actors clear that the show is not going to get universal approval .It ’s an honorable role the show be committing yourself to the unpopular play .   Is there anything wrong with apolitical plays , entertainment that simply comforts ?
