That said   —    and this is somewhat subtle   —    I think the case for requiring one party to have open primaries everywhere is a little worse than the case for open primaries in the abstract .In states where the G. O. P. has closed primaries , conservative registered Democrats or registered unaffiliated voters who lean toward Republicans will be able to participate only in Democratic primaries .
