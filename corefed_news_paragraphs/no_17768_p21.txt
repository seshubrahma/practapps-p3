Trump’s is n’t any new Trump , just as there was never a " Trump Nixon ."    It ’s the same old Trump that we saw all during the campaign and    indeed during his previous 69 years on this Earth : offensive ,    divisive , prickly , bombastic , impetuous ,    , and    resistant to any evidence that contradicts his       fixe .’ ’    And    the extent that anybody is calling the shots in this    presidency besides the president himself , it is    Vice President    Pence , Chief of Staff Priebus , or House Speaker Ryan .
