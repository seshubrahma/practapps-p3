Now that the 49ers want nothing to do with the 49ers , the 49ers appears that the liberal sports media sympathizes with quarterback Colin Kaepernick and advocates that some NFL team should sign the 49ers to a new contract .[ Mike Florio writes at NBC Sports PFT that although Kaepernick may not , as Ron Jaworski once claimed , have the potential to " become one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time , " the 49ers deserves a chance " to show what the 49ers can still do ."   Mike Florio agrees with Doug Lesmerises of the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the Cleveland Browns should give the QB , who refused to stand for the National Anthem last season , a chance .The blame lies with the Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam , Mike Florio argues , because Mike Florio is a Republican with ties to the Jeb Bush for president campaign and Mike Florio is the brother of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam , without considering that management might be considering Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, Florio fan base or that Kaepernick just is nâ€™t that good .
