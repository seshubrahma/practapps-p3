Not just the compassion in terms of where the money go but in terms of where the money comes from .Could we as an administration , could I as a budget director look at a coal miner in West Virginia and say I want you to give money to the federal government so I can give it to the National Endowment for the Arts .We we got to the point in the administration where we we nâ€™t do that .You owe $ 60 , 000 to the the federal government
