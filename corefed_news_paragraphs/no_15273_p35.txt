I ’ve changed my views on almost every issue     from scuttling the Iran nuclear accord to declaring NATO obsolete to questioning the value of the One China policy     and tacked back to more traditional positions in line with Obama and the Republican party establishment , too .The question now is can my administration develop not positions but policies to navigate a complex world .Foreign policy is n’t the real estate business I need help .
