I met Ms. Aubain Aubain as I was Ms. Aubain the Brooklyn Museum .The stunning 1895    building houses around 1 . 5 million pieces the museum , New York City ’s third largest , is certainly worth the admission fee .Or , I should say , is worth what the museum suggests you pay , the Brooklyn Museum   —    technically , visitors may pay what they wish .
