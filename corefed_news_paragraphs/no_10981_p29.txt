I also one gentleman there were 948 numbers on the ballot , but as far as I could tell delegate numbers only went up to 619 .One woman reported that she was very angry that numbers corresponding to Trump delegates were left off his ballot .I do not have specifics on this , other than # 379 , Nicolas Robert Neitzel   …        … One woman Another    supporter , reported that Trump was an alternate delegate and his ballot to delegate , and then was told they made a mistake and the delegate credential she had been given was ripped up .
