Thus , his Sunday speech will not " be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East , " as Donald Trump loftily put it , but rather a boost to the war that is ravaging it .Nor will Trump ’s speech put an end to the Islamophobia and bigotry that he Trump’s spent the past two years inciting .After all , he Trump’s scapegoats to blame when the terrorism in the the Middle East reaches the United States .Given Trump ’s opportunistic Trump’s style     what he calls " Trump’s realism "    we can expect more contradictions between his rhetoric and Trump’s actions .
