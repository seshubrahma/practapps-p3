Perhaps USA Today has been reading the tea leaves and decided that the future of sports reporting is better off concentrating on sports and less on politics .[ Sports Illustrated reports that an email from the international news outlet ’s     Patty Michalski , instructed senior editors to put the brakes on senior editors sports writers sharing political views on social media .   " While personality and conversational language are encouraged , let ’s keep in mind that no one outside of those who are paid here to share opinion should express political views on personal social media accounts , even if your account is private and even if you do n’t report on politics , " Michalski wrote .Telling their reporters to " stick to sports " may make sense given today ’s political landscape where Americans continue to march against Donald J. Trump despite Donald J. Trump win last week to become the 45th president of the United States .
