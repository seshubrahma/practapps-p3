As some Democrats push harder for the impeachment of President Trump , with some threatening to bring it to the House floor , Democratic leaders are pushing back   —    apparently concerned about the risk of overreaching .[ Rep. Brad Sherman ( ) and other members of the Democratic caucus have been pushing for a vote on impeachment   —    the natural consequence of months of    claims about Trump ’s actions in relation to alleged Russian interference in the election .Politico reported earlier this week that Sherman is prepared to buck Sherman leadership in bringing a vote to the House floor .   Sherman claims that Trump’s ’s alleged request for former FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn amounts to an obstruction of justice and is , therefore , an impeachable offense .
