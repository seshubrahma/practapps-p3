WASHINGTON   —    Giants in telecommunications , like Verizon and ATT , will not have to take " reasonable measures " to ensure that their customers’ Social Security numbers , web browsing history and other personal information are not stolen or accidentally released .Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will not be punished , at least for now , for not collecting extra money from customers to cover potential losses from certain kinds of    trades that helped unleash the 2008 financial crisis .And Social Security Administration data will no longer be used to try to block individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying handguns , nor will hunters be banned from using    bullets , which can accidentally poison wildlife , on 150 million acres of federal lands .
