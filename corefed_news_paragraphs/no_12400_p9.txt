One Tory MP recalled a telling moment on the Brexit campaign trail : I was amazed , when the CEO of JP Morgan shared a platform with the chancellor [ of the exchequer , equivalent to the US treasury secretary ] in Bournemouth and basically warned these voters " If you guys vote for Brexit you will be out of a job ."This CEO earns the CEO of JP Morgan million a year and lives mostly in Manhattan , telling people who earn Â£ 25 , 000 a year they will be out these voters a job if they vote a certain these voters .This enrages people .
