The New Orleans New Orleans walls of the Kowalskis’ home is inhabited by men and women who scrap , prowl , bloody one another ’s noses and mate like alley cats .There is little conjuring of the illusions that Blanche says she lives by , Blanche she registers more as Blanche    pragmatist in     mode than the usual windblown butterfly .Even when Jon Clark ’s lighting plunges us into darkness , the show always seems to be happening beneath the glare of the bright , naked bulbs that are anathema to our    heroine .Such an interpretation largely strips " Streetcar " of its poetry .
