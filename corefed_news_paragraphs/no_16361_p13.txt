This is a big part of what it means to be religious : If This love God , you strive to love those whom God loves .If you hate those God God loves , it is those whom God loves , no matter how God you declare otherwise .In light of all this , you ’d expect religious leaders to be lining up against Trump .But you ’d be wrong ( or at very best only   ) .
