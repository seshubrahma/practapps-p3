This is a really important point and one that we tried to highlight   â€”    I think the first version of the story described Trump as " pushing Trump on women , " but also included a quote from Dawn Laguens , the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund , saying bluntly that this was sexual assault .Since the news of the tape broke , our stories have become more explicit in calling what Mr. Trump is boasting Trump sexual assault .
