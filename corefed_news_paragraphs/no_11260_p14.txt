Instead , highly paid corporate lawyers would go back and forth between representing corporations one ISDS and sitting in judgment the next .Maybe that makes sense in an arbitration between two corporations , but not in cases between corporations and governments .If you ’re a lawyer looking to maintain or attract    corporate clients , how likely are you to rule against those corporations when it ’s your turn in the judge’s seat ?
