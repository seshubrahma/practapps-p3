As The problem Senate staffer told me this week :" Regardless Senate how many votes it takes to confirm or approve anything in the Senate , if Democrats want to force the Senate they can require a minimum of 30 hours to debate any nomination Democrats want to force the issue any bill .   Let that sink in .   549 vacancies , at 30 hours each , equals 686 days .
