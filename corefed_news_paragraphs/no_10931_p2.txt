Like many prophets , such as the Delphic Oracle or Jesus , I ’m not fully appreciated in my time .   CNN talking head and    pundit Maria Cardona falsely attributed the line from my article to Breitbart ’s former Executive Chairman , Steve Bannon , who recently joined Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign .This of course was done on purpose to try and paint Bannon in a negative light .
