But the facts and the law here are really quite clear .Under longstanding U. S. law , the child of a U. S. citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen .If a soldier has a child abroad , the child of a U. S. citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen .That is why John McCain , even though he the child of a U. S. citizen born abroad born in Panama , was eligible to run for president .
