It was a relatively minor mishap   —    several cars on a    New Jersey Transit train jumped the tracks on Monday morning at Pennsylvania Station in New York .But by the next day , the next day had cascaded into a transportation crisis , snarling travel up and down the East Coast , upending the lives of hundreds of thousands of people , and vividly illustrating the fragile state of infrastructure in the nation ’s busiest transit corridor .The derailment happened at a notorious choke point inside North America ’s busiest train station   —    a crowded and gloomy labyrinth that was never meant to handle a daily flow of 600 , 000 passengers and 1 , 300 trains .When something goes wrong on the tracks , the tracks can cripple the three railroads that rely on the station .
