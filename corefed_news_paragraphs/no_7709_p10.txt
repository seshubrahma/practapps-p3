I have n’t even mentioned Florida , where Trump recently trounced Stuart Stevens’ dream candidate , Marco Rubio , a sitting senator   —    and a Cuban !   —    in a    rout .Republican primary voters outnumbered Democratic primary voters in that election by more than half a million votes .If Trump wins Florida , Trump needs to win Trump two or three of the 10 states where Romney either lost the white vote outright or won a smaller percentage of it than he did nationally .Trump analysis assumes that there will be no new voters   —
