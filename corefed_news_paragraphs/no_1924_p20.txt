By focusing only on America environment , academia , Mr. Rorty ’s arguments also seem strangely parochial .During the 1960s , the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty , but actual politicians on the the academic left were still thinking a great deal about it the academic left F. Kennedy was visiting poor white families in Appalachia Lyndon B. Johnson was building the Great Society .Right through the ’90s and into the 2000s , we had     politicians singing the praises of hope , rather than the hopelessness that Mr. Rorty decries .Bill Clinton explicitly campaigned as the " man from Hope , " and Barack Obama would later campaign on a platform of " hope " and " change .
