Neither Papua New Guinea nor Nauru has the will or capacity to provide safe and sustainable futures for those held there .The only other option , Cambodia     a country impoverished , unsafe and utterly unsuitable for resettlement     has disintegrated , with people clearly unwilling to go to such a place .   As it stands , no other suitable country appears willing to take in these people .This is hardly surprising given that the international refugee framework is based on cooperation and    between countries .
