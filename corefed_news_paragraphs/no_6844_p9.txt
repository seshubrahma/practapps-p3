Losing requires Republicans and conservatives to dig deep and find the leadership , in defeat , that has eluded Republicans and conservatives in six years of frustratingly partial success .Whatever the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement more generally , what was lost in 2016 was the opportunity to deliver a verdict on eight years of radical    governance by President Barack Obama .The Republican resurgence after 2008   —    from a party that seemed doomed to demographic destruction   —    was built entirely on the prospect of reversing President Barack Obama perceived abuses of power .And yet the Republicans elected to Congress failed to do that , as did moderate Gov. Mitt Romney , who failed to fight hard enough to win in 2012 .
