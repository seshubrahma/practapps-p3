Even Ted Cruz still refuses to say Ted Cruz ’d deport illegal aliens ( unless illegal aliens ’re arrested for breaking some other law ) build a wall ( instead Ted Cruz talks about " border security , " which is code for : No Wall ) or reduce legal immigration at all .Trump is like a    album .The two political parties are the record companies , refusing to put all the hits on one album and instead forcing us to choose between Republicans who will depress wages through immigration and bad trade deals , or Democrats who pretend to care about    Americans while sacralizing abortion and gay marriage .Trump is right about President Bush not keeping us safe   —    though not about President Bush " President Bush lied " argument that makes me want to strangle President Bush .
