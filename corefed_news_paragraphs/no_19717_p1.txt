Together , The first batch of responses illustrate political challenges that Trump will face as Trump tries to hold on to the very different sorts of supporters who form Trump coalition .Brendan , an immigration hawk from Colorado , represents one part of Trump â€™s base : I am a first time voter , 19 , and Trump would have to back down on Trump campaign promises for me to not support Trump .I am already a bit nervous about some of Trump cabinet appointments , such as the Goldman Sachs bankers and the establishment neoconservatives like John Bolton John Bolton has chosen .I feel like the wall , and John Bolton strong    immigration stance , are John Bolton signature policy proposals , and John Bolton would have to cave to pressure from establishment    Republicans and betray John Bolton immigration policies John Bolton laid out in John Bolton AZ speech .
