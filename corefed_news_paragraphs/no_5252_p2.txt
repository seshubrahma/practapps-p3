Pew noted that this gap is much different than opinions of the media at the start of the 2016 presidential election year , when both parties assessed the media ’s job as holding politicians accountable   —    74 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans .Pew has been asking this question since 1985 , noting " while Republicans have been more likely to support a watchdog role during Democratic presidencies and vice versa , the distance between both parties has never approached the    gap that exists today ."Until now the widest gap between Democrats and Republicans happened during the George W. Bush administration , when Democrats were 28 points more supportive of the watchdog role of the media than Republicans .
