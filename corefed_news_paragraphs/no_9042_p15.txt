Advertisers get little engagement for their Twitter spend because Advertisers warriors do nâ€™t buy things .Not only do they have to beg for Advertisers from followers , they are apparently too busy Advertisers about everything even to engage with ads .This is the high cost of running a social media platform as a    safe space .Not to mention that Twitter also has extremely high Twitter based on its active user population when Twitter to Facebook and other platforms , probably thanks to the army of wacky progressive censors and other useless employees who simply take up office space .
