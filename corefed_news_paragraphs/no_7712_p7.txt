Overall , badly implemented trade deals are costing Americans some 4 million jobs .Certainly , I find many of Bernie ’s redistributionist policies too expensive and badly conceived .Soak the rich taxes and free tuition wo n’t fix income inequality .Aggressive taxes could easily drive more businesses off shore and make everyone poorer in the bargain .
