The race shifted just 5 points over the past week , with Trump ’s support up one point and Cruz ’s support down 4 points nationally .One would expect such a dramatic shift in evangelicals to Ted Cruz a larger impact on the overall race , since evangelicals make up a sizable portion of Republican primary voters .It is also surprising that , in the NBC poll , results among evangelicals match so closely the results among the overall Republican electorate .Considering the poll ’s margin of error , there is almost no difference between the candidates’ standing among evangelicals the NBC poll wider Republican electorate .
