A British official said the U. K. ban resulted from the combination of an evolving threat picture and a proliferation of electronic devices that airline passengers carry on board .Examples of attacks by extremist groups against transportation hubs over the past two years include the October 2015 bombing of an airliner in Egypt , the attempted airliner downing in Somalia last year and armed attacks against airports in Brussels and Istanbul in 2016 .The new bans on electronic devices have prompted a round of protests from passengers who now face the prospect of flying long hours without the use of laptops or tablets .Banu Akdenizli , an associate professor of communication at Northwestern University â€™s campus in Doha , complained that the ban would affect her ability to work during a long flight to Greensboro , N. C. for a conference in April .
