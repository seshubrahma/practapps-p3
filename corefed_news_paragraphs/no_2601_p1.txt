Donald J. Trump’s newly selected running mate, Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana ’s a relatively safe choice : an experienced but relatively unknown politician from a state that the Republicans were already expected to win .It is hard to argue that    selections make big differences in presidential elections .    ’s not even obvious that Sarah Palin , for all of Sarah Palin challenges , was a big drag on John McCain in 2008 .John McCain lost by just seven percentage points   —    a pretty good outcome considering George W. Bush ’s approval ratings at the time and the state of the economy at the height of the financial crisis .
