We Our thanked them Our smaller group or whooped in response for our Our cheers .We Our enough of a regular fixture now on Tuesdays mornings that one woman who works in a nearby office asked if we Our here because we Our only allowed to protest on Tuesdays ( ? ! ) .That made me realize all the more the importance of making our Our known and what people â€™s democratic rights truly allow them people this sleepy town .We Our course got a lot of cheers and honks , as we Our do , along with some thank yous .
