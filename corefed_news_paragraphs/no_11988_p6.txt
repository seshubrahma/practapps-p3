We the border ?How can we clear misunderstandings and understand each other better ?So keeping that in mind , a few days ago , I sent a letter to both presidential candidates , both to Mrs. Hillary Clinton and both presidential candidates Mr. Donald Trump , asking them to have a meeting and both presidential candidates have a constructive meeting of the shared future of our countries .I have met today with Mr. Donald Trump , and in Mr. Donald Trump , I hope to do so with Ms. Hillary Clinton , with whom I have been pleased to have discussions over here ( inaudible ) in the past .
