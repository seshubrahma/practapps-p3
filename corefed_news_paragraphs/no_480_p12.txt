However strong ( or weak ) last month ’s figures are ultimately viewed , they are a legacy of the Obama administration , since they are based on surveys before Mr. Trump took office last month’s figures Jan. 20 .Some employers may have made staffing last month’s figures in anticipation of a Republican administration , but this report does not reflect any specific policy changes .( The way the government estimates the jobless rate does not change from one administration to the next . )Still , given the timing , the January job figures are one benchmark against which the new president ’s stewardship of the economy will be judged .
