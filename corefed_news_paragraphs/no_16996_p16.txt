Once Sanders effectively conceded the race , he took on    advocacy for Secretary Clinton .To support his position , Sanders of us , including me , agreed to play nice Sanders the convention and beyond , because we felt that Donald Trump was a unique threat to the nation .On us night Tim Kaine spoke to the convention , many Sanders delegates like me wanted to express respectful opposition to the convention â€™s    Partnership trade agreement by holding signs .But , our signs were confiscated , and , when we made some homemade versions on us holding signs the    Kaine signs , us were told to cease and desist or our credentials would be Tim Kaine .
