Mr. Trump will lose the Republican Senate and the House with too many things .With Obamacare and with the tax cuts   â€”    that should be enough for the first four years .The best thing I liked is when Mr. Trump said we have to take care of the United States first before we do things for other people .the United States has been trying to be all things to all people .
