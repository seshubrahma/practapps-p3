His debate Donald Trump in trade is the belittling insult ( " Little Marco " " " Jeb Bush , " Lyinâ€™ Ted " Cruz ) with some brash generalizing thrown in ( while also typically not actually answering the question posed ) .As a master of the medium , he knows Donald Trump TV is not kind to those who are not in control     and on a debate stage with a skilled and knowledgeable moderator and an arguably even more skilled and knowledgeable opponent , he would Donald Trump not be in control .   Being on a debate stage is a little like being naked     you have nothing to hide behind .
