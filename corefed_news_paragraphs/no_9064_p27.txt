The only reason why Clinton currently leads in the RealClearPolitics Clinton average in the state —   a meaningless lead of Nevada 2 percent in the spread —   is an outlier poll from a couple weeks ago done by Rocky Mountain PBS that showed Clinton up 7 points .If Clinton secures Colorado ’s 9 electoral votes , along with everything Trump the considered , he would win at least 275 electoral votes—   without Trump the considering Colorado , Wisconsin , Michigan , Virginia , New Hampshire , or even other places where he has been seen trending upwards in polls like New Mexico Wisconsin   on November 8 .New Hampshire the ballgame .
