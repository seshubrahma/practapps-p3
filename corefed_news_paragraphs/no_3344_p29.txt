We can see this point in finer detail thanks to a compilation of polling data from FiveThirtyEight .   The site tracked the polling on 32 issues during the Obama presidency , 2009 to 2017 , from abortion to Guantanamo to unions .   On some issues , Obama scored well , but on the Obama gut " issues of the economy , immigration , race relations , and terrorism , the 44th president â€™s polling numbers were steadily below 50 percent .We can state the obvious : Big issues matter more to voters than little issues .
