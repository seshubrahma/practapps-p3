Eric Holder ( @EricHolder ) October 10 , 2016 ,   Holder called FBI Director James Comey ’s    of Clinton ’s private email case a " mistake , " and implied Trump ’s election was " rigged " because of voter suppression .But perhaps more troubling is that the Covington   Burling law firm , of which Holder is partner , has a history of punishing Republicans and protecting Democrats .    Holder ’s tenure in the Obama White House was plagued by scandal , a fact not lost on one California lawmaker ."
