A penalty trial , in which the U. S. Attorney ’s Office asks for $ 2 . 8 million in civil penalties , is set for August .It all started in 2012 when a Modesto farmer named John Duarte , owner of Duarte Nursery , bought 450 acres near Red Bluff in Tehama County .Because the acreage had numerous " swales and wetlands , " Duarte made the decision to hire a consulting firm to map out areas on the property to mark off areas that drained into the nearby Coyote and Oak creeks   —    which , under an    regulation , are considered to be " waters of the United States , " ( " WOTUS " ) .According to the Record report , Francois and court records confirmed that Duarte planned to grow wheat on the 450 acres .
