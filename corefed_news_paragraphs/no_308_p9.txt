Imagine , for instance , that 99 . 9 percent of people respond to the survey ’s citizenship question correctly .In such a big survey , even that high success rate would still imply that there were 38 respondents who answered incorrectly   —    enough to make up a big chunk of the tiny pool of 339 noncitizen respondents .If those 38 misreported noncitizens had indeed voted , then suddenly it would look as if 10 percent of those 38 misreported noncitizens had indeed voted voted .This critique could explain all of the noncitizen voting observed in the study .
