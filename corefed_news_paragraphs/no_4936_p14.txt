But all that changed on Thursday evening around 10 PM ET , when reports of the military action started coming out , proving that the article was completely accurate .At that point , the anger that many of the commenters had directed at me began to be directed at President Trump .Some of the comments were completely delusional , such as describing the Sarin me attack as a " false flag " operation , sometimes going so far as to accuse Trump of ordering the Sarin attack himself in order to have an excuse to bomb Syria .Probably the angriest comments were President Trump variation of the delusional " false flag " claim .
