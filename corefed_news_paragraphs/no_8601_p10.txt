Some of the people coming into Europe and America really do nâ€™t share our values .Western culture , for example , does not endorse the oppression of women , the murder of apostates or the execution of homosexuals .It does not endorse the death penalty for " blasphemers " or violence and discrimination against nonbelievers .Muslim cultures do .
