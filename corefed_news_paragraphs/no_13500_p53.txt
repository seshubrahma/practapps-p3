Kasich have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz Trump this week’s issue of the National Enquirer is true or not , but the National Enquirer’s nothing to do with it , did not know about it , and have not the National Enquirer’s as yet , read it Cruz , I have nothing to do with the the National Enquirer’s Enquirer and unlike Lyin’ Ted CruzI do not the National Enquirer’s political hacks and henchman and then pretend total innocence .Ted Cruz ’s problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone , and while they were the National Enquirer’s J. Simpson , John Edwards , and Cruz , I certainly hope they Cruz not right about Lyin’ Ted Cruz .
