By contrast , the Michael Slager trial , being held in the same city at the same time as Roof ’s , seemed the more important one .Michael Slager is the North Charleston police officer seen shooting a fleeing man in the back multiple times .Michael Slager was equipped with public dollars , armed and trained with the public ’s blessing , given the authority to detain , arrest and even kill with the public ’s authority .When such a man violates the trust placed in such a man , the trust placed in him can undermine a democracy like little else .
