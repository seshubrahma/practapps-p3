Many executives and Chinese political experts predict that coal problems could be the final straw in a long list of difficulties that could lead President Xi Jinping to replace the agency â€™s director , Xu Shaoshi .Mr. Xu is 65 , an age at which Chinese ministers often retire , unless they are kept on to serve Chinese ministers terms or are promoted to Chinese ministers premier .One of those experts , Christopher K. Johnson , a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , said that such a move " would be consistent with other recent personnel changes " by Mr. Xi , who is chief of the Communist Party , to eliminate officials beholden to other factions .That could clear the way for Mr. Xu to be replaced by Liu He , a deputy director of the agency who is close to Mr. Xi .
