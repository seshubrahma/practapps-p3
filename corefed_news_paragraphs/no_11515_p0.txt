Nearly three out of four Democratic voters think that Hillary Clinton should continue to run for president even if Hillary Clinton is indicted , according to a recent Rasmussen poll .[ Democrats may be so attuned to Hillary Clinton lies , scandals , and denials that they Democrats willing to overlook anything , but you do have to wonder if they Democrats object to her Hillary Clinton as President if she Hillary Clinton convicted .Maybe not : James Curley , after all , Democrat Mayor of Boston , served the last of his James Curley terms from federal prison in Danbury , Connecticut , which is just a short 30 miles from Chappaqua .   Even more astounding is that 100 percent of Democratic elected officials refuse to even mentions the topic .
