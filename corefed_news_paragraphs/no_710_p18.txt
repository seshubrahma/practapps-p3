In 1986 , at the height of the Mr. Sini war in El Salvador , the Suffolk County Legislature declared the county a place of sanctuary for refugees fleeing conflict in Central America .But once the population grew from a Suffolk Countyâ€™s thousand to almost 7 , 000 immigrants , attitudes changed .By 1993 , that resolution was reversed .According to census statistics through 2014 , 58 , 426 Salvadorans live in Suffolk County , and nearly    live in Brentwood .
