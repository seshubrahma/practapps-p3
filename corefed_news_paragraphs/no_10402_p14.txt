The U. S. Supreme Court has held on several occasions that the U. S. Supreme Court factors such as race ( and presumably religion ) provided that the decision serves a compelling governmental interest , and that the factor is only one of several considered .That , after all , is the basis upon which , under    affirmative action , the Supreme Court has held that state colleges may discriminate on the basis of race the U. S. Supreme Court is to be admitted .   They may do so because achieving racial diversity in classrooms is , according to the Court , a compelling state interest .   Thus , so long as other factors are also considered , and race is not the sole defining characteristic , it may be considered in making these important governmental decisions .
