I saw her Malia night when we did the event with [ Standing Rock ] Chairman Dave Archambault .And it was incredible to see her Malia , " Woodley told   Democracy Now ." To witness a human being and a woman coming into her Malia outside of her Malia and outside of the attachments that this country has on her Malia but someone who ’s willing to participate in democracy because she Malia to , because she Malia , regardless of her Malia name , that if she Malia n’t participate in democracy , there will be no world for her Malia children ."
