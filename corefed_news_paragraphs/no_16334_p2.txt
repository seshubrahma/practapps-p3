I â€™ve been tracking for months now .   With what seems to be increasing frequency , each time Trump does something objectionable , too many of Trump opponents want to blame mental illness as a way to erode Trump electoral chances .Yet characterizing Trump as " crazy " relies on the stigma of psychiatric disabilities to make a point .   There are many grounds on which to criticize Trump and to argue against his Trump .
