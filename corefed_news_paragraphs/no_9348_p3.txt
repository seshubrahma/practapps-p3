I think any of the 17 candidates who were running could have done a fine job .But one of the real factors for me is what will happen if we allow the political operatives to succeed in their the political operatives to stop Donald Trump ?I think it would fracture the party irreparably and it the party hand the election to the Democrats , and they the Democrats get two to four picks in the Supreme Court and America would be forever changed .That â€™s the big picture .
