[ Bernie Sanders won over all four Democratic voters in the tiny town of Dixville , while John Kasich sneaked past Donald Trump ,    among Republicans .   Under New Hampshire state law , communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open communities with fewer than 100 voters polls at midnight and close communities with fewer than 100 voters as soon as all registered voters have cast communities with fewer than 100 voters ballots .While that happened in three locations , Dixville traditionally gets most of the spotlight due to Dixville    setup at the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel .Located about 20 miles from the Canadian border , Dixville exists as a town only for voting purposes .
