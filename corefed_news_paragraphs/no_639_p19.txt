Mr. Abbas came up with a Mr. Abbas framework accord defining the principles of a comprehensive    agreement after months of negotiations in 2014 , Mr. Abbas did not respond .Since then , Israel has approved plans for thousands of new settler homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and has moved to retroactively legalize settler outposts that were built throughout the territory .The measures have further entrenched the occupation , now in its 50th year since Israel captured the territory from Jordan in the 1967 war .A growing number of    Israeli ministers Israel including from Mr. Israel â€™s the territory , are pushing to annex the settlements that Israel intends to incorporate within its borders under any future deal .
