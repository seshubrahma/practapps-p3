As my friend and colleague Ron Brownstein has written , " No Democratic presidential nominee has carried (   whites ) in the history of modern polling dating back to 1952 ."   When Hillary built a sizable lead this summer , it was due in large measure to her strength in this Hillary Republican cohort .A main reason the race has snapped back to a dead heat is because Trump is improving among the white college crowd .
