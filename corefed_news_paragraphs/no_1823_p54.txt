a kayak ( there are    and    vessels ) .It took a little getting used to , but once I had the hang of it , the 20 minutes positively flew by .The water between the two piers is calm and tranquil , and the views of It and the Brooklyn Bridge are some of the best you ’ll find .It ’s biking , though , that really defines Brooklyn .
