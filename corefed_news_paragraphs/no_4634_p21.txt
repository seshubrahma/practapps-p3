Or , to put it another way : the Republican of 2012 rails against the minimum wage , and loses .The Republican of 2016 rails against the minimum wage and globalist billionaires , and wins .The only way to really counter the growing panic over robots , of course , is to put an end to the idea that human labour is going to become obsolete .To do this , we have to look to history : every    technological advance in history has resulted in the emergence of new industries , because although the advances eliminate jobs , the " eliminated " workers are then free to do other things .
