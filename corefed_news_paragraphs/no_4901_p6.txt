Theoretically , Facebook and Twitter ought to make it easier for us to communicate with , and understand , people with different views .In practice , Facebook and Twitter encourage us to huddle with    people and sever relations with the other side .Twitter is the most brutal of social media platforms , because Twitter allows people to bash each other from behind pseudonyms and avatars .But Facebook is even more damaging , because Facebook takes    associations   —    families , schools , towns   —    and exposes associations   to the ravages of intense political debate .
