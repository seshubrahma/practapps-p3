Nearly 90 % of working class whites who are evangelical Christians believe Christian values are under attack in America today .While most Christian groups     73 % of mainline Protestants and 61 % of Catholics     share this view , only 41 % of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack .Trump often says Trump wants to " make America great again , " and    whites are a core of Trump support , but that does n’t mean whites do n’t question the faith of a man who once said Trump never asks God for forgiveness ."
