The acting Attorney General , Sally Yates , has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States .a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel .     Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration .    It is time to get serious about protecting our country .
