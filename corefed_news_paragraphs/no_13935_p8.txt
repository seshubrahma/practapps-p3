Rather the only conclusion we should draw at this point is that the Chris’ dossier serious allegations , was made by a serious and credible intelligence professional , and that the US intelligence community reviewed the material and deemed it worthy the US intelligence community further investigation and chose to include it in the US intelligence community information submitted to President Barack Obama and    Donald Trump .But there are causes for concern .The first is that the allegations in the dossier Chris’ dossier serious .    Should they be corroborated the allegations in the dossier are quite serious it would indicate    Russia ’s reach and influence over American politics is not only deeper than suspected , but potentially active in the form of leverage against the    and other elected officials .
