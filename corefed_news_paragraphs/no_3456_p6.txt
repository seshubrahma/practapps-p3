For the first time in my life , I was on the outside of the    liberal bubble , looking in .And what I saw was not pretty .I watched as many of my highly educated friends and contacts addressed those who disagreed with them with contempt and my highly educated friends and contacts , and an offensive air of intellectual superiority .It was surprising and frustrating to find myself lumped in with political parties and ideologies I do not support .
