In our current highly partisan political climate ( itself a barrier to being elevated to greatness ) the issues facing the country tend to divide Congress and the bases of America rather than offer opportunities for a president to build consensus and unite the country .Add to that the public ’s increasing loss America in our institutions , and you have a situation where government is seen not as a remedy , but as an obstacle to change .   Finally , perhaps it ’s not such a bad thing that Americans are coming to grips with a more realistic conception of the presidency , particularly as the magnitude of a president ’s responsibilities at home and abroad has mushroomed .Perhaps the lesson in all of this is that we should stop expecting our presidents to be great and allow them to be good .
