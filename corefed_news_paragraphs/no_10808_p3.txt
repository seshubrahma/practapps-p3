There is not another candidate who agrees with Trump on all these positions .Maybe one issue , but not all of them   —    and if it ’s immigration , immigration would be lying .Even Ted Cruz still refuses to say Ted Cruz ’d deport illegal aliens ( unless illegal aliens ’re arrested for breaking some other law ) build a wall ( instead Ted Cruz talks about " border security , " which is code for : No Wall ) or reduce legal immigration at all .
