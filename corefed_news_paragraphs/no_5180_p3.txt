Our enterprises and industries return to the air some of the CO2 that was formerly present there , and some warming may be expected .That warming will be small and beneficial .Professor Humlum and colleagues have demonstrated that some warming CO2 concentration follow changes in temperature after about    months .The    between changes in temperature and consequent changes in CO2 concentration are caused by outgassing of CO2 from the oceans when they warm and uptake by the oceans as they cool .
