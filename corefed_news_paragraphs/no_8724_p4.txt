If Bernie Sanders beats Democratic   Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire , which I think Bernie Sanders will , that will show that Democratic   Hillary Clinton is in very tough shape politically , and with these polls out with the results in there might be a lot of pressure for someone else to get in the race , like Biden ."Bernie Sanders added , " And if there is a chance that Democratic   Hillary Clinton could be indicted and the indictment could knock Democratic   Hillary Clinton out of the race and free Democratic   Hillary Clinton delegates that are already on the ballot to commit to Biden Biden run as Biden Biden you could still see that happen over the course of the next four to six weeks ."
