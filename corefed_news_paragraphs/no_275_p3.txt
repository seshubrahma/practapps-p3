researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles and Loyola Marymount University mission was simple : Order dishes containing each of nine targeted fish that are common on menus and often mislabeled confirm with the restaurant that the fish was what the menu said the menu was collect a piece of sushi about the size of a kernel of corn drop the menu in a labeled jar of ethanol and take the menu back to the lab for DNA analysis .Knowing rates of mislabeled fish is important , the authors say , because rates of mislabeled fish threatens consumer health .rates of mislabeled fish also threatens a marine ecosystem and the billion dollar fishing industry that depends on rates of mislabeled fish .But studies in the past have been inconsistent in terms of seafood mislabeling rates .
