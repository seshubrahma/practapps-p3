President Trump told Mexican leaders that President Trump would cancel the trade agreement and levy punishing tariffs unless Mexican leaders capitulated to President Trump demands in overhauling it .So , when a draft letter suggesting a softening of President Trump views began circulating among members of Congress this week , Mexicans expressed a range of reactions , from welcome relief to cool , wonky reason to dark mistrust .The draft letter , signed by the acting United States Trade Representative , Stephen Vaughn , seemed to propose keeping much of the agreement in place .The language was bureaucratic and technical , devoid of the emotion and invective that has characterized many of Mr. Trump â€™s comments about Nafta , which Mr. Trump has described as " the worst trade deal " ever signed by the United States .
