Let this movement the movement for love , not anger , let this movement be the movement compassion , not confrontation .When it comes to matters the movement the heart , there is nothing stronger than gentleness .I believe we will continue to win the hearts and minds of the rising generation if our hearts first break we young mothers and their unborn children and our hearts we , each of us do all we we to meet we where they are our heartsgenerosity our hearts not judgement .
