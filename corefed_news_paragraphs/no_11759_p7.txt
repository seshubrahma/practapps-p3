I also write for    publications like The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel , with their differing editorial slants .In all those publications there are those with whom I agree and disagree with strongly .I have published   publications like The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel of columns in The Huffington Post and consider Arianna Huffington a personal friend .I can tell you that I shared the home page many times with The Jerusalem Post Israel in pretty extreme terms .
