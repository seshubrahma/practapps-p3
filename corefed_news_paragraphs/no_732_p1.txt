But now Nikki Haskell is facing what may be the most difficult challenge of Nikki Haskell life : maintaining Nikki Haskell position in the social hierarchies of liberal New York and Los Angeles while serving as a cheerleader for one of Nikki Haskell oldest friends , Donald J. Trump , whom Nikki Haskell first encountered in 1974 at Le Club , a defunct    nightspot on East 55th Street in Manhattan .Ms. Haskell said Ms. Haskell had a wonderful time at the      dinner held for Mr. Trump at Union Station in Washington on Jan. 19 .But over the weekend , in a    suite at the Mandarin Oriental , Ms. Haskell seemed to be wavering a little .Glued to the television on the morning of Jan. 22 , Ms. Haskell watched the coverage of the women â€™s marches in various cities across the country , as well as footage from the more raucous demonstrations of Jan. 20 , during which protesters smashed windows , set a limousine on fire and clashed with the police not far from the Mandarin Oriental .
