  ( CNN )No one should have more sympathy for Sen. Tim Scott (   Carolina ) than me .As the first black man elected to the US Senate from the Deep South since Reconstruction , Sen. Tim Scott (  Carolina) occupies a remarkable position in Congress .   And yet when Sen. Tim Scott (  Carolina) took to the floor and read off the disgusting comments people had made about Sen. Tim Scott (  Carolina) because Sen. Tim Scott (  Carolina) is a black Republican who supported Jeff Sessions for Attorney General , my sympathies lay elsewhere .
