I understand each America ’s situation is unique ,We when it comes to something like limiting expression freedom of expression laws based on being offended , or needing a ‘ safe space,’ I think our ultimate goal should be to each have our safe space be inside of us .Each one of us is our We safe space .Our mind should be We safe space .
