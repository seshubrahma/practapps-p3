Pollution created by heavy traffic has always been a challenge for big cities like Paris .When I was a deputy mayor between 2001 and 2008 , Paris made a lot of Paris by creating the Vélib’ bike sharing system , one of the first in any major city in the world , and the Autolib’ electric car hire system .When I was in charge of urban planning , we pedestrianized the first section of the bank of the Seine , from the Musée d’Orsay to the Eiffel Tower .This was disruptive at the time , but today Parisians and Paris lovers ca n’t imagine this iconic landscape as a road anymore .
