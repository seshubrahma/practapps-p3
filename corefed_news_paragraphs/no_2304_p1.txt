a rogues’ gallery including Bill Cosby , Chris Brown and Ray J , and arguably three of the most famous    in modern times : Caitlyn , Kim , and Kanye .So lifelike , they Kim, and Kanye breathe , chests rising and falling as if deep in REM sleep .Seven figures for all that   —    plus the bedspread and the batteries to animate the doppelgängers   —    a number that was floated among attendees at Blum   Poe , the gallery that hosted the private exhibition last weekend .
