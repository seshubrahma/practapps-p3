But I do have a question for you : did you know this shit was going to happen ?Did you feel the anger , separation and struggle ( having nothing to do with the police and everything to do with everyday existence ) bubbling to the top ?Because I can remember vividly , before the storm , I was nâ€™t allowed to talk about black people problems because that would be disrespecting the black president .All the conversations were focused on Barack Obama and the racism he was facing .
