In a sign that    higher education could continue to expand in a more piecemeal fashion , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo unveiled a plan on Tuesday to offer    degrees at the state ’s public colleges and universities for residents from families earning less than $ 125 , 000 a year .The idea is significant in part because New York is home to the nation ’s largest    system —   serving some 440 , 000 students —   and the plan , which will need to be approved by state lawmakers , could affect 940 , 000 families with    children , according to the governor’s office .What ’s more , Cuomo —   a Democrat —   and other advocates hope that if New New York makes    college a statewide reality , then other states will follow .
