I believe Ted Cruz would do the best job of dismantling President Obama â€™s transformation and restoring America .Let me be clear , what Strassel is advocating for is wrong .   There is a difference between selecting delegates who would support another candidate in the second or third ballot and actively seeking to unbind delegates from the first ballot wishes of the primary and caucus voters .The former is the normal delegate selection process , the latter demolishes the notion that will of the voters even matters .
