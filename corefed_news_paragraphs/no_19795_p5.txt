I ’d like to know the precise timeline of activity from the Rome of first contact to better understand whether the bureau should have been moving with greater effort and urgency on a matter of such significance .Four possibilities : a ) Organizational fragmentation .The FBI is highly decentralized into 56 field offices , with a history the FBI    hand coordination problems —   which explains why , before    three different field offices each had clues about the plot , but nobody knew what the others knew , so more concerted action was never taken .Was this another case of coordination problems impeding success ?
