I met Maajid Nawaz on a drizzly afternoon in March , tucked in a corner of the restaurant at the central London membersâ€™ club Maajid Nawaz uses as a satellite office .Maajid Nawaz was dabbing the chicken from Maajid Nawaz Caesarsalad into a mound of yellow English mustard , which Maajid Nawaz stopped doing for long enough to load a video on Maajid Nawaz iPhone and slide his iPhone across the table .
