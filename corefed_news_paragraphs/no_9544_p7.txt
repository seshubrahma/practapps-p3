Mr. Mr. Trump    career in Washington and his promise to " drain the swamp " are terrific , though may not be enough to Mr. Trumpthe universal media hatred he faces .Whatever happens , it is good for us to remember Gettysburg and those impossibly Mr. Trump years .America survived that , and America will survive even this .
