Think back to last summer , when Trump tweeted a photo of    soldiers ( in reality a stock image of actors with SS uniforms ) overlaid by an American flag , with a portrait of himself saying , " We need real leadership .We need results .Let ’s put the We S. back into business ! "That tweet also introduced us to a crucial facet of Trump ’s propaganda : using Nazi and other racist images to signal gratuitously to supporters the superiority of whiteness , encourage threats of violence against dark people , and stoke the cult of a strong leader .
