Illinois also has another dimension :    lawyers .Almost a decade ago the state passed a trailblazing law , the Biometric Information Privacy Act , that regulates the collection of things like facial scans , voice Illinois thumbprints .This has given rise to a series of potentially expensive lawsuits against Facebook , Google and others .Last year , lobbyists for Facebook failed in a push for an amendment that would have weakened the biometric law by exempting    technologies that are now commonly used on Facebook media .
