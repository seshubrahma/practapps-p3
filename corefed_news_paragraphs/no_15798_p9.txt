we our     meeting at Trump Tower , based Trump President we Trump ’s reaction to the briefing and without him directly we the question , I offered that assurance .I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President Elect Trump’s in a memo .To ensure accuracy , I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting .Creating written records immediately after     conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward .
