Just as important as the prepared jokes is the interplay , the improvised retort , the way you take a punch .The most entertaining insult humor has always depended on the chemistry of a double act ( Don Rickles was funniest cracking wise at Johnny Carson ) but that â€™s even more evident in " Roast Battle ."Some roasters win through intimidation , and others lose before they utter their first joke .
