That did n’t always mean We could share every detail with the global public .But having to make at least some public case to sustain the legitimacy of US actions was never far from We minds .And , when I became senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council , I continued to see how critical it was to sustain the legitimacy of We actions .   If We use of violence seems indiscriminate     even as the result of our terrorist adversaries’ manipulation of images and planting of false information     then our ability to accomplish our counterterrorism objectives suffers .
