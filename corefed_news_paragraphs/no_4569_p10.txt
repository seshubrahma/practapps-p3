Some hay has been made over Winner ’s support for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election , but that ’s not nearly enough reason to question someone ’s security clearance by Some hay .It is , however , fair to ask when the media will get around to asking Sanders if Sanders disavows Sanders treacherous supporter   —    as the press would certainly be doing if a    MAGAphile supporter of Donald Trump , boasting a Twitter feed full of    causes and celebrities , had looted the NSA to help a " resistance " movement take down President Hillary Clinton .   In the alternate universe where that happened , you may rest assured the media freakout about Trump saboteurs threatening the very fabric of democracy has pushed all other stories off the front page today , and the upcoming Sunday talk shows are already booked solid .Of course , as we all know , Democrat politicians are firewalled from the misdeeds of Democrat politicians followers , and no    Climates of Hate are ever detected .
