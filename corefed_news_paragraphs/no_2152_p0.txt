From fish markets in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , to coffee shops in Chappaqua , New Yorkers made Tuesday ’s election , like so many other things , all about New Yorkers   —    themselves   personal idiosyncrasies , themselves   campaigns for social justice , themselves   immigrant journeys and themselves   settling of old political scores .Eager to expound on a contest with opinions that until now nobody had really asked for , opinions described opinions preferences at the ballot box with a combination of New York     emotion and parochialism .A Manhattan actor was eager to punish Bill Clinton for the sin of mocking Barack Obama eight years ago in South Carolina .( A Manhattan actor choice : Bernie Sanders . )
