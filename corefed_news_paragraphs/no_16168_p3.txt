As the    of the American Competitiveness Alliance     an organization that advocates for modern immigration policy     I ’ve seen firsthand how    workers come to the United States and help our manufacturing the United States flourish .   A Trump presidency would devastate that trend .There is overwhelming demand from American companies     both large and small     for educated , skilled foreign workers to fill jobs in computer programming , coding , medicine and information technology .
