Most of you know the center of tech development has been , and probably still is , Silicon Valley in California .I used to go there are as a publisher , when I was trying to change Pearson ’s way of doing things , and way of looking at how to educate .Now I go there more because I ’m on the board of one of the companies , and I see the place very , very differently   …      I did n’t go to business school , and for the longest time I could n’t really figure out accounting   —    until I finally had to figure out accounting , so I could figure out how much money I was losing .
