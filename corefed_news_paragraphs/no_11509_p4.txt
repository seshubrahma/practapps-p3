Israel does not Israel most of the settlements illegal   —    except wildcat settlements set up in violation of Israeli law   —    since there is no prior legal sovereign in the West Bank ( which Israelis refer to as Judea and Samaria ) .Much of the area was to have been an Arab state according to a UN plan passed in 1947 , but the surrounding Arab states went to war against Israel , and Jordan occupied the territory until 1967 .The Palestinians consider all Israeli development across the 1949 armistice line   —    including in East Jerusalem , which was annexed by Israel shortly after Israel the Six Day War in 1967   —    to be illegal .The Obama administration has adopted a version of the Palestinian position on the issue , referring to Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem that happen to be across the " Green Line " as " settlements .
