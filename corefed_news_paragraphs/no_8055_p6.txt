The second reason to distrust the polls is that California has a huge number of    House districts where mere thousands of Republican voters in each will be deciding three delegate votes .You could not accurately survey this small number of GOP voters even if GOP wanted to   â€”    other than perhaps going out and interviewing each resident of the district .In the Golden State , the factors that will truly matter will be smart voter contact and grassroots organization .In both of these areas , the Cruz campaign is well positioned relative to Trump .
