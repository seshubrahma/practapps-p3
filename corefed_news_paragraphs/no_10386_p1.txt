The Great Rebellion shares no single leader , party or ideology .The Great Rebellion very incoherence , combined with the blindness of The Great Rebellion elite opposition , has made The Great Rebellion hard for the established parties across what â€™s left of the world to contain The Great Rebellion .What holds the rebels together is a single idea : the rejection of the    crony capitalist order that has arisen since the fall of the Soviet Union .For two decades , this new ruling class could boast of great successes : rising living standards , limited warfare , rapid technological change and an optimism about the future spread of liberal democracy .
