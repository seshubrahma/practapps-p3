One of the great    in this contest features Ryan against a superb Patriots secondary : cornerbacks Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan , along with Matt Ryan Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung .They all play on Matt Ryan level .However , the Patriots’ secondary faces a Herculian challenge against the Falcons’ coterie of    weapons , led by wide receiver Julio Jones , who averaged more than 100 receiving yards a game this season .If you take away Jones , Ryan happily targets other talented wideouts such as Mo Sanu or speedy Taylor Gabriel , or perhaps one of three talented tight ends .
