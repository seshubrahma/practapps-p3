In this we have a microcosm of why all eight domestic terror attacks on Obama ’s watch   —    beginning with the Fort Hood massacre and the Boston Marathon bombing   —    were carried out by individuals on the FBI ’s radar who could have been stopped if the early warning signs of their commitments to the Islamic jihad had n’t been dismissed .Political correctness is a euphemism for the active ,    denial that has characterized the Democrats’ approach to Islamic terror going back to the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .In that attack , 1 , 000 people were wounded and six were killed , but president Clinton refused to visit the site , while his president Clinton took the view that the perpetrators were merely individuals who needed to be tried in criminal courts .
