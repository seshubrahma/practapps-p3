Despite the public displays of unity with the speaker , Mr. Trump and his team now regret outsourcing so much of a somewhat shellshocked president early drafting to Mr. Ryan .One aide compared doing that to a developer â€™s staking everything on obtaining a property without conducting a thorough inspection .And they were stunned by his inability to master the politics of his a somewhat shellshocked president conference .Mr. Trump , an a somewhat shellshocked president developer with a lifelong indifference toward the mechanics of governance , made a game effort to negotiate with members of the    Freedom Caucus , even if it seemed to some members of that group , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , that he did not have the greatest grasp of a somewhat shellshocked president care policy or legislative procedure .
