I know on March 10th , there was a letter sent to him to Jenner to prosecute the murderers of these trans women as hate crimes , which has been done in the past , and he never Jenner responded to the letter .Which is extremely disappointing to me .So , yeah , there ’s a lot of issues out there for our community that I ’m fighting for .And I want the Republican Party to do a better job .
