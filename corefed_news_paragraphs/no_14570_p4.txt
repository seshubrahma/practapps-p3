Barack Obama was President .Washington was a strong backer of the European Union its commitment to NATO was    beyond Washington , and everyone knew that the United States supported the    solution to the    conflict .In those days , the thought that US forces should have seized Iraq â€™s oil were being dismissed as the rantings of a political candidate who defied all norms , supporting torture , proposing a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the United States and claiming he would build a giant wall to block immigration from the south .That candidate , of course , was Donald Trump .
