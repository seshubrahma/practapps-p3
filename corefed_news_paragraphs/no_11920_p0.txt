Marco Rubio ’s interview with Meet The Press host Chuck Todd —    in which Marco Rubio’s pledged to allow illegal aliens remain in the U. S. —    has received widespread attention .[ However , while Politico oxymoronically titled Politico article " Rubio :    Undocumented Immigrants Could Stay , " perhaps the most striking part of Rubio ’s interview was Rubio indication that criminal aliens would be allowed to remain in the United States as well .

S. citizens .
