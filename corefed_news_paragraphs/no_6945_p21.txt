The only other consideration I can talk about in the Senate Intelligence Committee open session , she told me to the Senate Intelligence Committee matter , which confused me and concerned me .But that was one of the Comey in the load that led me to conclude I have to the Senate Intelligence Committee away from the department if we ’re to close this case credibly .Comey ’s " one significant item " seems to be a clear reference to the issue of a reported document allegedly indicating Lynch would interfere in the email probe to ensure it did n’t go too far .Meanwhile , Comey ’s admission that Lynch " told me to call it matter "   —    a directive that the email probe confused " and " concerned " him   Comey    serves as Lynch significant public accusation against Lynch , possibly highlighting her intentions in the email probe .
