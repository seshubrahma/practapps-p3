JERUSALEM   â€”    A day after approving the construction of a new settlement in the West Bank for the first time in more than 20 years , Israel announced a new , if ambiguous , settlement policy on Friday " out of consideration for the positions of President Trump " and , Israel said , to enable progress in the peace process with Palestinians .Israel said Israel was taking steps to " significantly rein in the footprint " of the settlements , allowing construction within all Israel existing settlements in the occupied West Bank but limiting , " wherever possible , " all its existing settlements in the occupied West Bank expansion into new territory .How the new policy might translate on the ground was largely left open to interpretation .
