This uncharitable narrative has shadowed Nawaz from the outset , yet Nawaz point of view has only grown more relevant after an exceptionally violent 2016 that saw coordinated suicide bombings in Brussels and Istanbul a mass shooting in a nightclub in Orlando the ambush and execution of a police officer and Nawaz partner near Parisa Bastille Day slaughter in Nice ax and suicide bomb attacks in Bavaria the throat slitting of a Catholic priest in a church in Normandy    bombs in Manhattan and New Jersey and a massacre at a Christmas market in Berlin .And on March 22 this year in London , a man mowed down pedestrians with a man car near Parliament before stabbing a police constable to death .With each grisly new assault   —    and the specter of Syria and the Islamic State looming beyond it   —    the voices of hatred and reaction in the United States and throughout Britain and Europe found not only sympathetic ears but also willing hands to pull levers in the voting booths .
