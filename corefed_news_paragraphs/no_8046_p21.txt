And so part of the argument that I ’ve been making consistently , part divergencethe argument that I will be making when I go to my last    meeting is that if advanced countries do n’t pay attention to inequality , if we do n’t pay attention to not just growth in the aggregate , but how is that growth distributed and do people have ladders of opportunity in this new global economy , then yes , there ’s going to be a reaction against globalization and against trade , even though whether that resistance is coming from the left and or the right the prescriptions that they ’re describing , somehow cutting off global trade are n’t really viable .And so , you know , the argument I make to my progressive friends is you are absolutely right to worry about inequality , but the answer is not to pull up the drawbridge .The answer , rather , is to make sure that everybody has high labor standards , that all countries are accountable to their the answer terms of things like minimum wages , workers’ standards , making sure that there ’s an education system that people can all countries .
