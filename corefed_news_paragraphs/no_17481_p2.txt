One option for Trump is to simply ignore the Democrats altogether .Given that Donald Trump has a united government , and since Senate Democrats can no longer filibuster    Court judicial and cabinet appointments , there will be strong incentives to do so .Donald Trump can put aside all Donald Trump campaign rhetoric about wanting to break through Washington ’s gridlock and just govern from the right .( Notably , the Republicans are also now in control of 32 state legislatures and 33 governors , and the Republicans will be defending far fewer seats in the 2018 midterm elections than Democrats , so Trump ’s conservative mandate could be even greater if Donald Trump so chooses . )
