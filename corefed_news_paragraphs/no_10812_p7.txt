One D. C. alternate delegate who supports Rubio told Rubio News on condition of anonymity that : If Rubio is Rubio the nominee , and Trump becomes the nominee , asking Marco Rubio Rubio the V. P. candidate would unite the convention and the Party .Additionally , it will help to balance a New York , very moderate to liberal Republican with a Christian conservative V. P.If the convention and Party the convention and the Party come together the Party I do not see how we can win in November .If Trump is the nominee , I see Rubio as the best option to balance Trump ’s northern , moderate to liberal version of Republican because of Rubio ’s proven conservative record in the Rubio and the U. S. Senate .
