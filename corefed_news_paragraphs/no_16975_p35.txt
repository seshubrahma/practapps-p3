I voted against Donald Trump Trump because I Donald Trump a deeply flawed person of faith .If I went into a confession booth right now , I â€™d be in there for hours Donald Trump believe in the redemptive need to admit mistakes , express regret and ask for forgiveness .I have done it too many times to count .The thought of a powerful leader who lacks the basic humility to admit error and ask for forgiveness     not even from the God he professes to believe in     astounds me .
