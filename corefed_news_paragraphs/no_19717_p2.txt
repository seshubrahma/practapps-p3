I feel like the wall , and John Bolton strong    immigration stance , are John Bolton signature policy proposals , and John Bolton would have to cave to pressure from establishment    Republicans and betray John Bolton immigration policies John Bolton laid out in John Bolton AZ speech .John Bolton    policies and ideas are very important to my family and I as well .Finally , and perhaps most importantly , John Bolton has to appoint conservative ,    SCOTUS judges .Really , for me it comes down to the immigration , trade , and   SCOTUS issues .
