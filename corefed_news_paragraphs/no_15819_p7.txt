But I have the vantage of an American mutt , raised in constant motion .I ’m a local in small towns and big cities , a native to states red and blue , at home in the branches of so many different trees thanks to a family that broke before I could walk .My father was a liberal , atheist homicide detective who fled Milwaukee ’s    chaos for the serenity of the Rockies .My mother left him when I was My father , found Jesus when I was My father and one Saturday announced over breakfast " I had a dream from God last night .
