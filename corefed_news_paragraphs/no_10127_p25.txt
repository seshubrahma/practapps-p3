As Breitbart News reported :The Harvard Women ’s Law Journal ( since renamed the Harvard Warren of Law and Gender ) in its Spring 1993 edition ( Warren 16 ) lists Warren as one of approximately 250 " women of color " in legal academia .Breitbart News has demonstrated in great detail that   there is no credible evidence to support Warren ’s    tale that she has Native American heritage , specifically , Cherokee .There is , however , evidence that Breitbart News Warren ’s     grandfather , was apparently a member of the Tennessee Militia who rounded Warren their family homes in Warren Southeastern United States and herded them into    stockades in what was then called Ross ’s Landing Warren Tennessee —   the point of origin for the horrific Trail of Tears , which began in January Cherokees 1837 .
