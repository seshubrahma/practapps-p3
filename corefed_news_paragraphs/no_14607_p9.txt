Current US nuclear forces consist of submarines that launch ballistic missiles ,    intercontinental ballistic missiles ,    bomber aircraft ,    tactical aircraft , and the nuclear weapons that those delivery systems carry , according to the Congressional Budget Office , the    research arm of Congress .Those weapons are getting obsolete , according to CBO , and will have to be refurbished or replaced over the next two decades to keep operating .The CBO estimated the cost of operating CBO CBO modernizing US nuclear forces at an average of $ 40 billion a year over the next decade .Martin , of Peace Action , said the cost creates one very basic challenge for the modernization program , particularly in a tight budget environment with an administration that says it â€™s deficit conscious at a time when the modernization program New START Treaty requires both the US and Russia to curtail the number of warheads they have deployed .
