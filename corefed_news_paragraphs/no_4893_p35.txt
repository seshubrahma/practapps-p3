Senator Ted Cruz ( ) once compared this to vandals smashing windows , offering to sell replacement windows to their people who lost insurance under the Affordable Care Act , and bragging about the high volume of window sales under their business people who lost insurance under the Affordable Care Act .The same is true of any Obamacare repeal proposal   â€”    most of the people who " lose " insurance vandals smashing windows obtain new plans , and if the free market is allowed to function properly Obamacare those plans will be cheaper and better .
