It is unclear how much the Saudis will be paying for THAAD , but Trump called it a "   THAAD " last month when the Saudis US deployed the advanced missile defense radar to South Korea .    While calling the head of a major defense company and simply asking for a lower price is widely considered an unorthodox negotiation tactic , Kushner ’s    approach has drawn comparisons to when     Trump criticized the stealthy    fighter jet for being Trump expensive , and Hewson gave her " personal commitment " to cut the cost Trump the program in February .   And the details of how the call took place also provide a window into Kushner ’s role during negotiations with the Saudis and Kushner range of his influence on matters of foreign policy as a Kushner .    During last year ’s presidential campaign and later during the transition , Kushner was identified by Trump ’s team as the Kushner point of contact for foreign governments looking to either congratulate the new US leader or begin diplomatic talks .
