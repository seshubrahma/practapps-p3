Boston University professor Stephen Prothero writes in Politico Magazine that evangelical voters breaking for Donald Trump have let evangelical voters breaking for Donald Trump political identity trump evangelical voters breaking for Donald Trump religious identity .[ From Politico :   White evangelicals helped to send Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush to the White House , so courting White evangelicals early and often has become perhapsthe great art of running for office as a Republican .For decades , Republican politicians have gone on pilgrimage , Bible in hand , to Bob Jones University and Liberty University to court the Jesus vote .Even nominal churchgoers like Reagan have done what no European politician would ever do : pledge Even nominal churchgoers like Reagan prayerful allegiance to Christ .
