It ’s all about competition .The it companies have a monopoly .I live in the state of Mississippi —   one health insurance company , Blue Cross Blue Shield , has 60 to 65 percent of the health insurance business .What if you lived in a state where AllState had 70 or 75 percent of the car insurance business ?
