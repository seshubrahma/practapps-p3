but of course it was picked up this the    machine by TSA .The officer who caught it recognized me from this , I showed them my Defense Department The officer who caught it , and I was issued a fine but allowed to board my flight .At the same time , since Reagan falls under Arlington County , I was required to appear in County Court also at a later date .On August 8th 2016 the court fined me County Court and the gun was confiscated .
