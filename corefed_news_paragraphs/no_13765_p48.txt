I was given a blood sugar test later by the prison medical staff , but because I had not eaten , my number was not that high .After hours in the waiting room outside the medical facility , we were all then moved to another part of the prison and we all into areas with other people who were already incarcerated we all convicted we all crimes .I was moved into J to , which is called a " classification line " of cells Sunday bunks , phones , and a television set .This is the first chance in hours I had to get on the phone again with my wife , so I immediately called her and was told that my bond had been paid hours earlier and that Brandon had driven in from Houston , Texas the prison was with Ali .
