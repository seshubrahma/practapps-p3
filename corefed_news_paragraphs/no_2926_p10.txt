With no Democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame , I think this would be akin to what happened in the the 2018 midterm elections but in reverse .Now , if they can coalesce around a " replace " plan that does n’t leave too many people out , then I think they could move they .But in all the years since the A. C. A. was passed , Republicans have n’t been able to do that .Do you think they can ?
