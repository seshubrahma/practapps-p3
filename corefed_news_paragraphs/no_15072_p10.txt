Our Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lindsey Graham  of South Carolina and other "institutionalists" would’ve gone along with a "nuclear option" to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a nominee more controversial than Gorsuch culture .Given the highly charged battle we ’ve seen   —    only three Democrats , from statesTrump won bigly ( Indiana , North Dakota , West Virginia ) voted for Gorsuch , and just one more , fellow Coloradan Michael Bennet , Gorsuch against a filibuster   —    too many people will now think of the justices in partisan terms .
