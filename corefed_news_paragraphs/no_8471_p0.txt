Single women are a crucial element of the Democrat constituency , pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it was nâ€™t so effective in election after election .[ We may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016 , but We should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012 , regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a " War on Women ."   Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity , given the emergence of " Strange New Respect " for Mitt Romney this year .
