the GOP party    failed to sound the alarm at the outset of the primaries that the nominee has never been a Republican and does not follow the party â€™s platform .   Now they continue to pay lip service to The party    candidate who undermines the principles of our party , our Constitution , and our country     all while violating the most basic rules of civility .   I can not watch idly as the country is forced to face a " lesser of two evils " election , where corruption , illegality , and untruths are the order of the day .
