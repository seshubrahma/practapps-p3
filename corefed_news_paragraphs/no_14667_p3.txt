Sadly , this form of hate violence is far too common .Since the presidential election , organizations have documented upticks in reports of bias and harassment of immigrants and Muslim , Sikh , Hindu , Arab and South Asian communities .President Trump ’s criminalization policies that target immigrants , Muslims and people of color through bans , walls and raids have only exacerbated this climate .The administration ’s actions send a clear message to the public : Certain people do not belong in America .
