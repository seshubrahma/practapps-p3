The Pentagon ca n’t call back the wing because the    can no longer his   wing unless preceded by specific    code that only the general knows , part of a poorly    safety scheme to protect the airmen from false orders .Even after the recall code is issued and most of the plans abort their missions , one continues on to a new Even target , as the plane ’s radio has been damaged in combat .( Somehow , the drafters of Wing Attack Plan R forgot to insert a rule ordering pilots back to base when their radios are damaged , rather than continue to pilots . )The lone    hits its target and sets in motion the end of    world .
