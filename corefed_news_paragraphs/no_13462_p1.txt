[ Here ’s a good political verse   —    1 Kings 20:11 : " And the king of Israel answered and said , Tell the king of Israel , Let not the king of Israel that girdeth on the king of Israel harness boast the king of Israel as the king of Israel that putteth it off ."In other words : do n’t boast as if you have already won something .That message , delivered from King Ahab to the evil Aramean king    is one of the best " trash talk " lines in the entire Bible , and one of the only positive contributions of one of the entire Bible ’s most wicked kings .
