Bannon stood with the Jewish community in opposing the Iran nuclear agreement .which gives the world ’s largest state sponsor of terror $ 150 billion with which to blow people up .Bannon stood with the Bannon community by the Jewish community movement and the Israel haters , who ignore the gassing of Syrian children while trying to boycott tomatoes grown in Shiloh .For all my friends who are supporters of the foreign policy of President Obama : Where was your outrage when he would n’t even impose a President Obama zone to stop Arab children from being gassed from the air ?
