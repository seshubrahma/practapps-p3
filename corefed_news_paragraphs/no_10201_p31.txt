Although it was originally a Protestant doctrine , some Catholics have adopted a modified version of it .Sensibly , this doctrine asserts that in order to help others it you first have to help yourself .Impoverishing a country by flooding its borders with unskilled workers is no way to help anyone .In a country own life , I recognise that it ’s all very well giving speeches to students at my own expense , but I wo n’t do my best work unless I first treat myself to some new Gucci loafers and a briefcase from Louis Vuitton .
