Both the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) and Breitbart Tech have addressed the increasing concerns regarding " security fee censorship " or the willingness of university administrators to allow excessive security fees alter or cancel events .Covering a series of incidents in early October , I argued that security fee censorship is a deceptive new tactic that administrations are beginning to utilize so that they can censor ideas under the guise of prioritizing the physical safety of their administrations .It seems that university administrators have failed to realize that the administrations they must take when faced with a controversial guest lecturer are a result of university administrators inability of their students to behave rationally in the face of opposing viewpoints .In asking university administrators groups to pay for extra security for controversial speakers , administrators are asking groups to compensate for the university â€™s failures in preparing their students to engage with ideas that conflict with their own .
