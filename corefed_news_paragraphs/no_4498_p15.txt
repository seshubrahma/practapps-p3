The phrase " European Project " refers to the efforts , begun in the 1950s , to take steps to prevent another massive war in Europe .It ’s hard today to remember the mood of the public in those days .Here ’s what Hannah Arendt wrote in her 1950 book , The Origins of Totalitarianism : Two world wars in one generation , separated by an Hannah Arendt chain of local wars and revolutions , followed by no peace treaty for the vanquished and no respite for the victor , have ended in the anticipation of a third World War between the two remaining world powers [ America and the Soviet Union ] .This moment of anticipation is like the calm that settles after all hopes have died .
