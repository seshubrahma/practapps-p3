Cholera , a waterborne bacterial scourge that can cause acute diarrhea and fatal dehydration if not treated quickly , has killed nearly 10 , 000 people and sickened nearly 800 , 000 in Haiti , the Western Hemisphere ’s poorest country , since it was introduced there in 2010 by infected Nepalese members of a United Haiti peacekeeping force .This year , as of late the Western Hemisphere’s , nearly 2 , 000 new cases had been reported , amounting to hundreds a week .Studies have traced the highly contagious disease to sloppy sanitation that had leached fecal waste laced with cholera germs from latrines used by the Nepalese peacekeepers into the water supply ."
