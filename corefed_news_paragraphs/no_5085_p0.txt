President Donald Trump ’s Department of Homeland Security has    an    program to have 21    agency officials cooperate with      groups .[ " The [ 21 officials’ ] job was to go meet politicians , Congress people , advocate groups , and local law enforcement , " complained Sarah Saldaña , a top DHS official from 2014 to early 2017 .   " Let them see you as a person , as opposed to big , bad ICE , " said Saldana , who created the cooperation program when she ran DHS ’s U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement division from 2014 to 2017 .   Trump ’s DHS executives " really are taking away the [ 21 officials’ ] ability to go out in the community and do what it is that we were hoping Trump’s DHS executives would get done , " Saldaña told Foreign Policy magazine .
