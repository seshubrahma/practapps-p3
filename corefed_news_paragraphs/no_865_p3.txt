No one would argue it made Americans ( or pretty much anyone else ) the trade deficit off .The United States actually exported 0 .9 percent more goods in January than it did in December ( the numbers are adjusted for the trade deficit usual seasonal variations ) .If your concern is that other countries have nâ€™t been buying enough goods made in U. S. factories , the January numbers pointed in a positive direction .
