On Sunday , convicted Palestinian terrorist Rasmea Odeh , a key organizer of    marches who was responsible for the murder of two Israelis and lied her way into the United States , gave a defiant address to a Chicago conference .[ Odeh will soon leave the U. S. after filing a guilty plea to avoid prison under an agreement with the Department of Justice , which her claims is too " racist " under Attorney General Jeff Sessions to bother resisting in open court .   The most shocking aspect of the Odeh saga is not that the mainstream    community backed her in her bizarre fight .Nor is it the fact that her has been at the center of the    protests over the last several weeks , joining other Palestinian radicals such as media darling Linda Sarsour .
