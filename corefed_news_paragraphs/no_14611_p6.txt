This was truly extraordinary     by North Korean standards .Perhaps the most enlightening interview of the trip was my conversation with North Korean economist , Professor Ri Gi North Korean   We spoke about North Korea ’s trade relationship with China , the underground marketplace that supplements what the state distribution system ca n’t provide , and even the highest paying jobs in North Korea      coal miners and other manual laborers .   Ri says physically demanding jobs tend to pay twice as much as office jobs , though he could n’t disclose actual salaries .
