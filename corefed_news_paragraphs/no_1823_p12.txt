It was late when I checked into my Airbnb , and I needed to fill my stomach with either food or alcohol , preferably both .I ended up at a fun Bushwick night spot , Bossa Nova Civic Club , avoiding the $ 10 cover charge by entering before midnight .Red light from a backlit bar and purple lasers cut through    fog that was quickly filling the dance floor and bar area while house music pumped through the small space .I picked up a $ 5 can of Modelo and danced for a bit .
