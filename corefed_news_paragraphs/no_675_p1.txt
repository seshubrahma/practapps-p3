Two draft memos signed on Friday by John F. Kelly , the retired Marine general who is now secretary of homeland security , outline an aggressive mission for the immigration authorities that would rescind policies put in place by President Barack Obama that focused mainly on removing serious criminals .The directives appear to spare many younger immigrants brought to the country illegally as children , known as Dreamers .But some parents of children who enter unaccompanied could face prosecution under the guidelines .The approach laid out in the memos , which have not been finalized and are subject to change by the White House , reflects Mr. Trump â€™s campaign promise to harden the border and deport people who entered the United States illegally .
