We see it in an economy where an elite few have hoarded the gains of the recovery and where sector after sector , from food to retail to media to energy , are now dominated by a shrinking number of merged monopolistic firms .We see it in a corrupted American political system that answers to cronies with clout and routinely ignores the will of the people on issues like gun responsibility .Or in the European Union ’s vast but ineffective bureaucracy that issues rules from afar but ca n’t manage debt or refugee crises .We see it in an American law enforcement system that ’s become far more skilled at surveillance and incarceration than at building community trust and relationships .
