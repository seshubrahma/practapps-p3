A web application was also developed so you can view any location under any of the potential emission scenarios .   For example , New York City , which now sees about two days per year that cross the threshold , rises to about 50 days per year by 2100 .The results paint a grim picture , where entire summers exceed the threshold in warmer and more humid cities like Orlando and Houston .Currently , about 30 % of the world ’s population ( and about 13 % of the land area ) experiences at least 20 days per year on which the deadly threshold is reached .
