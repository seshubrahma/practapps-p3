The current president of the United States has n’t seen a final report .The intelligence community is talking about wrapping The intelligence community up later this week .So , for anyone to talk about what ’s in a final report , it ’s not final yet .I think the idea that we ’re jumping to conclusions before we we a final report is frankly irresponsible .
