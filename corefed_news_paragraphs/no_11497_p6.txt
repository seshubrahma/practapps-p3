I fear that this has once again hastened a very real split within the labor movement .Yes , it ’s become quite a fracas within the House of Labor : so much for the old slogan , " Solidarity Forever !"We can note that typically , it it the    construction unions —   joined , perhaps , by other industrial workers , if not the union leadership —   who support construction projects , while the      unions side with the    activists .
