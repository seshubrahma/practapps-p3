I thought maybe he could have delayed Nagasaki a day or two later , because it Harry Truman pretty quick right after Hiroshima that he pulled the trigger on the second bomb   … HiroshimaI think Harry Truman could have given a little more time for unconditional surrender , and Harry Truman it clear , if you think that was bad , watch what ’s coming next .Unconditional surrender , right now .But , on both bombs , I have no problem with it .
