This morning because many of our nation ’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth , and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that our nation .And I hope going the wonderful people of our country we can be a little bit , a little bit different and get along better if that ’s possible .Maybe it ’s not , and that ’s that’s possible too .Much of the media in Washington , D. C. and New York and Los Angeles , in particular , speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very , very obviously broken system .
