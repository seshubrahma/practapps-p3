Ironically , the media ’s rewrite pretty forcefully proved my point about the gigantic double standard for liberals and This :In order to prove I was a monster , the media put a liberal ’s words in my mouth   —    the exact same words they had n’t minded when a liberal said them .I keep hearing the media’s about Trump being " out of control , " making " mistakes , " saying " the media’s " things , but whenever I ask the media’s a specific example , all I get are the media ’s apocryphal versions of what Trump has done   —    never something he actually did .
