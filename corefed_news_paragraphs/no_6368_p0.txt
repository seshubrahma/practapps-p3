A growing number of conservative commentators are calling on President Donald Trump to use the California National Guard to escort author Ann Coulter onto the University of California , Berkeley campus when author Ann Coulter speaks next week .[ Though California Governor Jerry Brown commands the California National Guard , President Donald Trump has the power to federalize it   â€”    just as President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard in 1957 to integrate public schools .( The same Arkansas troops who had once blocked black students then escorted the students to school . )   Coulter was invited by the Berkeley College Republicans to speak on April 27 .
