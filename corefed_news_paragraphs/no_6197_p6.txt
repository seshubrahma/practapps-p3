Since joining the Trump campaign last year , Steve Bannon has used his influence at the Steve Bannon " news " site Breitbart as a propaganda tool [ sic ] .The website has attacked American heroes like Gabby Giffords [ sic ] spread racist and    hate [ sic ] and promoted fake news in the pursuit of advancing Trump ’s radical agenda [ sic ] .And a few moments ago they   —    and other conservative sites   —    started targeting Kamala [ sic ] for leading the charge to prevent the Republicans from defunding and defaming Planned Parenthood .Not a single claim in the above paragraphs is true , but evidently raising campaign cash is a more urgent priority than truth .
