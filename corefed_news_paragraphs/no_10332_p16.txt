Instead we received a brief statement from DeVos stating she DeVos Common DeVos .That contradicts her position on DeVos Core in the past .The endorsements by Jeb Bush and former Clinton official Ross offer opponents of Common Core no real assurance that anything will improve .It actually makes me even more convinced this was the wrong choice .
