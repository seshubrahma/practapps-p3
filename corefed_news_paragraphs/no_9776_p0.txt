Republicans are hoping a midwestern    wave can carry Donald Trump to the White House , and there ’s growing statistical and anecdotal evidence that Republicans hopes are justified .[ Nate Silver , the left ’s favorite polling guru , posted a chart on Sunday showing Donald Trump is doing far better in midwestern states than Gov. Mitt Romney did in 2012 .    Silver ’s analysis shows Donald Trump has gained 6 points over Gov. Mitt Romney in Ohio and Iowa , and has closed the gap with Hillary Clinton down to almost    levels in crucial Michigan and Pennsylvania .   That midwestern success is what gives Donald Trump a    chance of winning the election , said Silver .
