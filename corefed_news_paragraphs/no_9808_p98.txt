The Pollsters ca n’t count the number of people who played along with the    narrative in public to appease The Pollsters metropolitan friends and colleagues , only to quietly pull the lever for Trump in voters voting booth .Pollsters need to have a few words with their friends in the leftist bubble , Trump their    and public shaming and buzzwords are effectively destroying their profession .   Nobody is going to be upfront about their political preferences if they ’re going to be called racists , sexists , and the rest Pollsters the left ’s favorite buzzwords .Perhaps Pollsters we can have honest disagreements without being compared to their   and public shaming and buzzwords and rapists , the accuracy of polls will improve .
