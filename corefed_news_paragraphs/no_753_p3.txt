The new Republican ideas for the program , including work requirements and changes in how it is paid for , could make Medicaid much more limited , with a smaller impact on the federal budget but more obstacles to becoming and staying enrolled .The outline of a new replacement plan , presented to House members last week , shows just how far some Republican leaders hope to go in overhauling a program that has grown under the Affordable Care Act to insure one in five Americans , including more than half of the roughly 20 million people who have gained coverage under the health law .the health law would give each state a fixed amount of money for each Medicaid beneficiary , instead of paying a large share of whatever each state costs to cover everyone who qualifies .And the health law would substantially reduce the amount that the federal government pays to help cover the Medicaid expansion in Arkansas and 30 other states , a change that would most likely result in many people losing coverage .
