The trial , which began last Monday , has been no kinder to the governor : Prosecutors waited exactly zero days before asserting , during opening statements , that Mr. Christie knew three of his aides and allies Mr. Christie’s involved in the plot as it was unfolding .Neither governor is accused of breaking the law .But for two men who once prided themselves on managing     administrations , claiming to have been blind to alleged Mr. Christie’s petty revenge and briberyMr. Christie’s the highest levels of state government seems bad enough .
