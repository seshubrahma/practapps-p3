Conservatives worry about " regulatory capture " : the danger that regulators will abandon the public interest at the behest of regulated industries , keeping prices high and stifling competition .   The solution is to get rid of regulation : the state should butt out and let the market operate .   There â€™s no doubt that capture has sometimes happened .   A notorious example is the Civil Aeronautics Board : after it the Civil Aeronautics Board abolished in 1985 , airline competition intensified and prices plunged .
