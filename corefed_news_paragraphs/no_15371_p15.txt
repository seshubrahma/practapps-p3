Until 2012 , much of the dark humor in our waiting rooms was about how only rich people in America could afford to get cancer .   Before Obamacare , some of the cancer medications I had to take were hundreds of dollars a pill .All of that changed in the middle of my initial treatment course when the Affordable Care Act went into effect .Now my prescription refills were $ 20 instead of $ 800 .
