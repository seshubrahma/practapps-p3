’  ’ ’   Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump faced off Sunday night in the   second of three presidential debates before Election Day on   November 8. ’ "   The debate was a    affair. Half of the questions   were posed by preselected, uncommitted voters, with the other   half asked by the debate’s moderators, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper   and ABC’s chief global affairs correspondent, Martha Raddatz.   Clinton and Trump each had two minutes to respond, but both   frequently went over their time. " "   The first presidential debate, on September 26, drew a record 84   million viewers across multiple networks, including NBC, CNN, and   Fox. This debate may break that record, given the uproar over   Trump’s  in 2005 made public Friday and the   leaking of emails  of Clinton’s paid   speeches on Wall Street. " ’   Trump  late Friday night apologizing for the   comments, which led dozens of Republicans to withdraw their   support for him over the weekend. Trump implied in the tape that   he would "discuss" Bill Clinton’’s sex scandals and Hillary   Clinton’’s role in discrediting the women involved. ’ "   He brought up the issue only once during the debate, but   held a shocking press conference with four of Bill Clinton’s   accusers  —   about an hour before the   showdown in an attempt to rattle his opponent.  " ’  ’ ’   Anderson Cooper asked Trump about his 2005   comments immediately:  ’ ’I’’m   not proud" of the tape. "That was locker room talk. I’’ve   apologized to my family, I’’ve apologized to the American people." ’ ’   The issue of Clinton’’s paid speeches was largely glossed   over. Trump frequently hovered   behind Clinton as she spoke and interrupted her, saying   at one point that if he were president she "would be in jail’’   over her email scandal. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Trump spoke for 40 minutes 10 seconds, while Clinton spoke for 39   minutes 5 seconds, CNN reported. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’
