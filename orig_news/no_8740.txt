Texas Land Commissioner and Texas GOP Victory Chair George P. Bush told members of Texas State Republican Executive Committee (SREC) "it’s a bitter pill to swallow, but you know what? You get back up and help the man who won, and you make sure that we stop Hillary Clinton. " While he stopped short of an endorsement, he said it was time for Texas Republicans to get behind the 2016 presidential nominee, Donald Trump. [The son of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, grandson of former President George H. W. Bush, and nephew of former President George W. Bush told members of the state party’s executive committee he was speaking "from Team Bush," the Texas Tribune reported on Sunday. As the Texas GOP’s victory chair, Bush is responsible for turning out the vote for all Republican candidates, including the man who beat his father in this year’s presidential primary.  The announcement at the SREC meeting where Bush discussed the party’s Victory Fund campaign came just two months after the Land Commissioner said he would not be supporting the party’s nominee despite being appointed as the Victory Fund chairman, Breitbart News reported in June. The younger Bush had received strong criticism from some about taking the position as Victory Fund chair while opposing the person at the top of the ballot. "I, along with others, are not in a position to endorse at this time because of concerns about his rhetoric and his inability to create a campaign that brings people together," Bush said at the time. George P. Bush is the first member of the Bush family to show any sign of support for the 2016 GOP presidential nominee. His comments came just days after Trump endorsed House Speaker Paul Ryan’s   bid and that of Senators John McCain ( ) and Kelly Ayotte ( ) Breitbart News reported on August 5. Speaking to the members of the SREC, Commissioner Bush said it was time to put aside any lingering animosity from the primaries and get behind Trump.
