Thursday on NBC’s "Today," former Vice President Dan Quayle weighed in on the current state of the Republican Party following a contentious and heated battle for the party’s presidential nomination.  Quayle began by pledging his support for presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. "I’ve been a Republican all my life, I’m going to support the nominee," Quayle told "Today"   Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie. "I predict that most people in my position, or people that have been in the Republican Party in a long time, will rally around the nominee. " Quayle said he anticipated others in the Republican Party would follow suit and explained that although he has ran an unconventional campaign so far, he thinks Trump can win. "He’s a winner," Quayle said. "He’s unusual. He’s obviously very different, he’s not going to play by the rules. It’s a different situation, but I think that he can win. " The former vice president went on to add he thought Trump was more qualified than Clinton because the voters want an outsider and he also suggested Sen. Rob Portman ( ) as a possible running mate for Trump this fall. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
