Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press," actor George Clooney said Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz ( ) were running campaigns based on fear.  Clooney said, "I met him once, sitting down at a table. It was nice and we talked a couple of times, I think. And then he went on Larry King and told everybody I was very short. No, I met you sitting down. But it’s not about that. You know, here’s the point about what’s going on right now on the other side. Trump and Cruz are making this a campaign of fear. We have to be afraid of everything. We have to be afraid of refugees. We have to be afraid of Muslims. We have to be afraid of minorities. And the question is, and this is an important one, are we really going to be scared of the very things that have made our country great? And if the answer is yes, then we have history to answer to. Because we’re not afraid. We are not a country  —   we are not a country that is afraid. And I refuse to accept that. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
