Actor Scott Baio says he was physically attacked by Nancy Mack, wife of Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, over his support for Donald Trump. [The alleged accident occurred Saturday night during an event at the elementary school both Mack and Baio’s children attend.  Baio has filed a police report, according to TMZ, in which he claims Mack was "berating and cursing" at him. The report says Mack shouted "Grab ’em by the pussy" while grilling Baio about how he could support a man who’d made  lewd comments about women. Baio was a vocal celebrity surrogate for Trump’s campaign and spoke at the Republican National Convention in July. Ignoring Baio’s requests that she stop screaming at him, Mack, allegedly grabbed the Happy Days star under his arms and began shaking and pushing him. Mack’s explanation, according to TMZ sources, is "she was merely trying to show Baio how Trump hugs women and denies any intentional physical aggression. " Mack hasn’t taken Hillary Clinton’s loss well. A day after the election, Mack took to Twitter and said "I pretty much don’t feel like speaking to any white working class American men right now  …    . #youfuckedusall. " I pretty much don’t feel like speaking to any white working class American men right now  …    . #youfuckedusall,  —   nancy mack (@nancylmack) November 9, 2016,  TMZ reports the Ventura County Sheriff’s Dept. is investigating the incident and Mack has been charged with battery.
