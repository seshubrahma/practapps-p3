" The cryptic tweet is most likely a reference to his own planned presidential bid, which the rapper had previously said he had planned for 2020. #2024,  —   KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) December 13, 2016,  In November, West paused a concert in San Jose to deliver a   speech in which he said that he had not voted in the presidential election, but if he had, he would have voted for Trump. At another concert a few days later, the rapper compared himself to Trump and rebuked former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: "It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. " West first expressed an interest in running for president at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, while accepting the evening’s Video Vanguard Award, the equivalent of a lifetime achievement award. The rapper expounded on his plans in an August interview with the BBC, when he said that Americans had become "numb" to the ongoing violence in Chicago. "We’re numb to 500 kids getting killed in Chicago a year, we’re numb to the fact that it was seven police shootings in the beginning of July," he said. "When I talk about the idea of being president, I’m not saying I have any political views. I don’t have views on politics," he added. "I just have a view on humanity, on people, on the truth. If there is anything I can do with my time and my day to somehow make a difference while I’m alive, I’m going to try to do it. " West’s Tuesday meeting with Trump marked one of his first public appearances since he was hospitalized in November in Los Angeles.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
