On Friday’s "PBS NewsHour," New York Times columnist David Brooks commented on   Donald Trump’s Defense, Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Transportation Secretary picks by saying Trump is "exceeding expectations. "  Brooks said, "I have to say, he’s exceeding expectations. Sometimes, during the campaign, he seemed to be actively trying to misgovern. And here he seems to be trying to have an effective administration. They’re not all my  —   the people I would pick, but he won the election. Some of them are not only good for Trump, but genuinely good picks. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
