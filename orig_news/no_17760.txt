’  ’ ’   The dispute over the wall President Donald Trump says he will   build on the   border, as well as over his insistence   that Mexico will pay for it, has eroded relations between the US   and its southern neighbor. ’ "   It’s also set off rounds of sniping between US and Mexican   leadership, turning Twitter into a new venue for international   diplomacy. " ’   Thus far, the spat has been limited to the US and Mexico, but   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become embroiled   after he posted a tweet lauding the proposed border wall. ’ "   Netanyahu, a Trump booster, compared Trump’s border wall to the   wall Israel has  along its southern border with   Egypt. Netanyahu held it up as a smart move against illegal   immigration. " ’ ’ " ’t’t’tPresident Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel’s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea 🇮🇱🇺🇸’t’t" ’   Trump has  the wall Israel constructed, but Mexicans  —     Jew and gentile, government and private citizen  —   did not take   kindly to the comparison. ’ ’   "The Secretariat of Foreign Relations expressed to the government   of Israel . .. its profound sadness, rejection, and disappointment   over the Twitter message of Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding   the construction of a border wall," Mexico’’s foreign ministry   said in a  issued on Saturday. ’ ’   "Mexico is a friend of Israel, and should be treated as such by   its Prime Minister," the statement continued, before saying   regarding International Holocaust Remembrance Day: "Mexico and   Israel share a historical rejection of racism and xenophobia and   Mexico will continue working closely with Israel to combat any   form of discrimination in the world." ’ ’  ’ ’   In a  the Jewish Community of Mexico   said it did not share Netanyahu’’s sentiment: "We do not agree   with him in this point of view and we reject forcefully his   stance. As Mexicans and Jews we back the actions adopted by our   government . .. in the negotiations with the United States." ’ ’   "I repudiate, deplore and reject this vile declaration," Enrique   Krauze, a Mexican historian and author,  on Twitter on Saturday. "Netanyahu   should apologize to the Mexican people for his vile declaration,"   he  on Monday. ’ ’   "As a Mexican Jew, this tweet embarrasses me," Leon Krauze, a   Mexican journalist, author, and son of Enrique,  of Netanyahu’’s tweet. ’ ’   "I lament the stance of @netanyahu with respect to the wall,"   Eruviel Ávila, governor of the state of Mexico,  on Monday. "I celebrate and welcome   the rejection of this declaration by the Jewish community of   Mexico." ’ ’  ’ "   Israel’s interior minister, Arye Dery,  that Netanyahu apologize for the statement   during a meeting of heads of all of the country’s coalition   parties on the day the tweet was sent. " ’   "What you did created a mess, both with the Mexican government   and with the Jewish community there," Dery said,  to Haaretz. "Jews in Mexico even violated   Shabbat to draft petitions against you." ’ ’   "It is a unnecessary declaration of war on Mexico and on   Hispanics, and a schism with the Democrats in the US, including   the majority of American Judaism,"  leader of the Israeli   opposition party Yesh Atid. "Independent of our opinion about the   wall . .. do we not have sufficient problems?" ’ ’   Dan Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel,  Netanyahu’’s comments "are not in the   interests of Israel," and he drew distinctions between the two   borders: "The challenges of Israel in the Sinai look nothing like   those on the US border (with Mexico). Their solution works for   them (the Israelis) not for us (the US)." ’ ’  ’ ’   Israel’’s ambassador in Mexico  Netanyahu’’s comment as based only   on his experience with Israeli security and not a position on the   proposed   border wall, saying it referred to   "circumstances unique to Israel." The spokesman for Israel’’s   foreign ministry made a similar  saying the situation on the     boundary was "" than that of Israel’’s   southern frontier. ’ ’   Netanyahu also defended himself,  that Mexico didn’’t have a problem with the   wall itself, just with the matter of payment, an issue on which,   he said, he "didn’’t intervene." ’ ’   "Who mentioned Mexico?" Netanyahu  during a Likud Party meeting. Netanyahu   also  the controversy to the media he   decried as " " and intent on defaming him and his family.   He accused them of fabricating "an avalanche of false news." ’ ’   Netanyahu has been  in two criminal probes   into abuse of office. ’ ’  ’ ’   Despite repeated demands Netanyahu apologize, he has remained   unbowed. ’ ’ to Haaretz, he told Israel’’s foreign   ministry to tell journalists that "even though Mexico regularly   votes against Israel in UN institutions, Jerusalem has chosen to   exercise restraint and not spark a crisis over these votes." ’ "   Whatever Netanyahu’s intent, the Israeli government hasn’t been   untouched by the tumult kicked up by the flurry of new     measures pursued by Trump. " ’   "Israel seeking clarity on #TrumpTravelBan   145, 000 Jews born in   7 countries listed in [executive order, including] 54, 000 in Iraq   & 45, 000 in Iran," CNN’’s chief     correspondent Jim Sciutto  on Monday morning. ’ ’The dispute over the wall President Donald. ..’
