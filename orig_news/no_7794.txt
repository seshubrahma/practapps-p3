On Monday’s broadcast of "CBS This Morning," Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) argued that FBI Director James Comey isn’t why Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost, rather "she should have won this election by ten percentage points. The question is, why it is that millions of white working class people, who voted for Obama, turned their backs on the Democratic Party, and I think a lot of people do not think the Democratic Party is standing with them. "  Sanders said that   Donald Trump "very effectively" tapped "the angst, and the anger, and the hurt, and the pain that millions of working class people are feeling. " He added that "there needs to be a profound change in the way the Democratic Party does business. It is not good enough to have a liberal elite. I come from the white working class, and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to the people from where I came from. " After anchor Charlie Rose pointed to Clinton’s criticism that Comey is why they lost, Sanders said, "It’s not a question of what happens in the last week. The question is that she should have won this election by ten percentage points. The question is, why it is that millions of white working class people, who voted for Obama, turned their backs on the Democratic Party, and I think a lot of people do not think the Democratic Party is standing with them. That has got to change. " (  GOP War Room) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
