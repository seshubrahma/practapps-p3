On this weekend’s broadcast of on "Fox News Sunday,"   Donald Trump said he was not planing to take a "wrecking ball" to President Barack Obama’s legacy but instead he will attempt to do "what’s right. "  Host Chris Wallace asked if it was "fair" to say he was going to take "a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy. " Trump responded, ""No, no, no. I don’t want to do that at all. I just want what’s right. On the EPA, you can’t get things approved. People are waiting in line for 15 years before they get rejected, Okay. That’s why people don’t want to invest in this country. You look at what’s going on  —   and you can look at a jobs report, but take a look at the real jobs report, which are the millions of people that gave up looking for work, and they’re not considered in that number that’s less than 5 percent. " "We have jobs that are in the pipeline, and I deal with all the executives, the big ones and small ones," he continued. "I have really gotten to know this country. When you have to wait 10 and 15 years for an approval and then you don’t even get the approval, it’s no good. So we’re going to clean it up. We’re going to speed it up. By the way, if somebody is not doing the right thing, we’re not going to approve. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
