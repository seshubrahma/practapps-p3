Tuesday on CNN’s "New Day," CNN’s David Gregory reacted to a report former Republican President George H. W. Bush will be voting for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over his party’s Republican nominee Donald Trump.  Gregory told host Chris Cuomo he’d be "shocked" if Clinton didn’t receive the former 41st president’s vote. "I do think they’ll be shy about saying it publicly," Gregory said. "They don’t want to help Trump. But, I’d be shocked if [George] H. W. Bush is not voting for Hillary. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
