Thursday on MSNBC, legendary Indiana Hoosiers basketball coach Bobby Knight discussed his endorsement of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  Knight said Trump would be "good for America" because he is smart, tough, loves America and brings a lot to the table. "I think he’s smart. I think he’s tough. I think he loves America. I think this is a real American we’re talking about here, and I think he brings a lot of things to the table. You know, he’s a tough guy. Not everybody is going to appreciate him, but I have been around him enough to know that this is the kind of guy that I would like to see being involved in decisions that are affecting the United States," Knight explained.
