["Call rt 66 hotel boycott her show," one user wrote in a Facebook message referencing Griffin’s July 22 scheduled performance at the Route 66 Casino Hotel in Albuquerque, NM.  "DO NOT SEE HER SHOW, BOYCOTT THIS ANIMAL! !" another user wrote. The furor aimed at the    comedian was sparked after images went viral of Griffin posing holding up a fake, bloodied decapitated head meant to resemble Trump. The photos were taken by Los   photographer and artist Tyler Shields, who tweeted a short video of Griffin holding Trump’s head.
