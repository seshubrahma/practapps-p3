(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. "I know how resilient the people of Louisiana are," President Obama told survivors of last week’s vast flooding, "and I know you will rebuild again. " He was welcomed by the governor and toured damaged areas. But he drew criticism from some Republicans and local residents for not going to the area sooner. _____ 2. Abu Zubaydah, who was waterboarded 83 times and otherwise brutally tortured after being mistaken for a   Qaeda operative involved in the   attacks, argued for his release from Guantánamo Bay. He said he had no intent to harm the U. S. or any other country. Video of the hearing streamed to the Pentagon offered reporters and human rights advocates their first glimpse of him, appearing calm, since he was captured 14 years ago. A review board will recommend continued detention or transfer. _____ 3. Researchers published detailed images of the brains of babies born to   mothers, urging doctors around the world to study them and know what to look for. The scans show not just microcephaly, but also damage to the parts of the brain that govern movement, balance, speech, thinking and emotion. That suggests that affected babies born with   sized heads may still prove to have serious developmental problems. _____ 4. Donald Trump held a rally in Austin, Tex. Regardless of his shakier polling these days, rising partisanship and the parties’ firmer ideological grip means fewer voters cross party lines, making landslides a thing of the past. Meanwhile, we can help you understand how Facebook categorizes your politics. And if you’d like to help decipher how political campaigns are targeting voters, send us the political ads you see on Facebook. _____ 5. Planning a vacation?   searches on Instagram can compile a   graphic guidebook. The results "give a feel for a place that you can use to decide if a place feels fun and seems safe  —   whatever that means to you," our writer says. _____ 6. A sharp rise in the price of the EpiPen has outraged people dealing with serious allergies. The device, which injects epinephrine to stop airways from closing in a severe allergy attack, has gone from 2007’s wholesale price of less than $100 for a   set to more than $600. The maker, Mylan, is facing questions and pressure from Congress. _____ 7. A Native American protest against an oil pipeline in North Dakota has swelled by hundreds of people ahead of a federal court hearing on Wednesday. The planned   Dakota Access pipeline runs mostly on private land, but occasionally enters federal jurisdiction, and a Sioux tribe has sued to halt construction. Above, Lakota riders demonstrated this month. _____ 8. An American soldier was reported killed by a bomb in southern Afghanistan, days after the arrival of a contingent of more than 100 U. S. soldiers. The deployment is aimed at helping plan for the defense of a strategically important city, Lashkar Gah, from a fierce Taliban assault. The insurgents’ strength forced President Obama this year to drop his plans to draw down troops. _____ 9. Capital punishment is in regular use in only 16 of the country’s more than 3, 000 counties, all in the South and West. One of our   stories today examines a murder in one of these locales, Jacksonville, Fla. and how the area’s history of racism plays into a case that has divided the victim’s family between those who want the killer executed and those who don’t. _____ 10. Finally, even we have to have the occasional cat story. When a baby squirrel monkey was rejected by its mother at a Russian zoo, the director tried a surrogate  —   her own elderly cat. It’s been three weeks, she says, and    Rosinka seems to have adapted to having a monkey on her back. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
