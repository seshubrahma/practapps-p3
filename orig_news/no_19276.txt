’  ’ ’   In a major Saturday speech that highlighted every plan he aims to   implement within the first 100 days of his presidency, Donald   Trump said Mexico would "reimburse" the US for the massive border   wall he’’s championed throughout his campaign. ’ ’   As a part of his proposed "End Illegal Immigration Act," Trump   said Mexico would now be reimbursing the US for the wall   along the country’’s southern border, instead of paying for the   wall from the   which Trump has said previously. ’ ’   That act, he said ’’"fully funds the construction of a wall on our   southern border," with US government funds. ’ ’   "Don’’t worry about it," Trump said during his Gettysburg,   Pennsylvania, address, which was billed as his "Contract with the   American Voter." ’ ’   "I said Mexico is paying for the wall." ’ ’’ ’   He said the legislation would be passed "with the full   understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the   United States for the full cost of the wall." ’ ’   A hallmark of Trump’’s rallies, the Republican presidential   nominee proclaims that Mexico will pay for the border wall.   Often, he asks the crowd, "Who’’s paying for the wall?" The crowds   typically reply, "Mexico!" ’ ’   The Manhattan billionaire    in late August. Mexican officials, including Peña Nieto, said   after the meeting they made it clear they would not be paying for   the border wall. ’ ’   "By the way, I met with the president of Mexico," Trump said in   his Saturday speech, calling it a "wonderful meeting" and Peña   Nieto a "wonderful person." ’
