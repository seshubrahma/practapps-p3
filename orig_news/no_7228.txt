Donald Trump’s campaign is calling Hillary Clinton’s press conference outside of her plane on Thursday morning "desperate. "["Last night Hillary Clinton again failed the    test, where she was unable to answer for her terrible foreign policy judgment, mishandling of classified information and claims that the VA wait time scandal was overblown," Trump’s senior communications adviser Jason Miller stated in a press release, responding to Clinton taking questions from reporters the morning after NBC’s    forum where both presidential candidates took questions from Matt Lauer.  Miller continued: Her claim that no lives were lost in Libya was an insult to the memory of the four brave Americans who died in Benghazi. So it’s no surprise she’s resorting to unhinged and dishonest attacks, including claiming on Israeli TV that terrorists are praying for Mr. Trump to win. "These are the desperate attacks of a flailing campaign sinking in the polls, and characteristics of someone woefully unfit for the presidency of the United States," he concluded. Early Thursday morning, a Trump campaign press release stated that Clinton has gone 278 days without giving a press conference. Later Thursday morning, the former secretary of state later took questions from reporters in White Plains, New York while standing outside of her plane. After that, Trump tweeted: Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She’s being decimated by the media!  —   Donald J.
