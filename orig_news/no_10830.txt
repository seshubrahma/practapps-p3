Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump slammed Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) who appeared at a campaign rally with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to rally voters in Ohio on Monday. [In a press release titled "Sellout Warren," Trump exposed Clinton’s differing positions on several policies Warren supports.  "As Clinton tries to salvage support among the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democrat Party, Senator Elizabeth Warren ( ) has become a turncoat for the causes she supposedly supports," Trump stated in the press release, pointing out Clinton and Warren’s differences on Wall Street, special interests and the   Partnership (TPP). Trump’s statement continues: While Warren claims that Wall Street businesses have too much influence in D. C. by paying "barely disguised bribes," through campaign contributions. The Clinton campaign has accepted over $41 million this cycle from Wall Street interests. Warren is also campaigning for the author of the   Partnership, a deal she has routinely slammed. This is a trade deal that Clinton has expressed support for in over 45 public speeches. Warren’s campaigning for Clinton stands in stark contrast to the liberal ideals she once practiced. This sad attempt at pandering to the Sanders wing is another example of a typical political calculation by D. C. insiders. Mr. Trump has been against TPP from the start of his campaign because he understands how detrimental it would be to American workers. He will continue to fight for the American people and serve them over the special interests in Washington, D. C. During the rally, Warren blasted Trump. "Here’s what it boils down to," Warren stated during the rally. "Hillary has brains, she has guts, she has thick skin and steady hands, but most of all, she has a good heart and that’s what America needs, and that’s why I’m with her. "
