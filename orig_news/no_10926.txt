[Note: Cruz and his allies must consider how much harm this will do this his presidential chances in 2012. In their insular worlds, they think everything revolves around the "GOP Smart" set and "professional" conservatives. Cruz risks turning off conservatives and "somewhat conservative" voters who are already suspicious of him. Good luck wining a potential future race with just the "professional conservatives" in the permanent political class. This is not Reagan ’76 by a long shot and anyone who tries to make that comparison is delusional.] Some   behind scenes at RNC: Cruz backers debate entering his name into nomination a few hours from now.

Hall says she will put the quote on her Twitter account if Obama actually said those words. The problem with political coverage on cable is that there are too many anchors like Tamron Hall who often give off the impression that they are European soccer broadcasters trying to call an American football game. Politico reported on   : The McCain campaign and RNC are pouncing on another line from the Obama pool report: "If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun," Obama said in Philadelphia last night.

More proof of how clueless people like Senor and Bill Kristol are. A generic Republican like Romney who got trounced by Obama even after GOP establishment figures insisted he was the best chance to beat Obama would never be able to get their message out and combat the mainstream media like Trump is doing. They would also probably fold over like a cheap suit to Clinton just like Romney rolled over in 2012. 9:58: MANAFORT: SEN. JEFF SESSIONS ( ) WILL PUT TRUMP’S NAME INTO NOMINATION TONIGHT. He says Sessions has become a close personal friend and adviser. Rep. Chris Collins ( ) who was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump, and South Carolina Lieutenant Gov. Henry McMaster will give the seconding speeches. 9:54: When asked about Melania’s speech, Manafort says it was a "great speech. " He says it talked about her journey to America and says the fact that her speech is focused on is "ignoring the facts of the speech itself," which Manafort says was a "poignant speech" that was "  by the American people. " Manafort claims they are comfortable that the words used were words that were personal to hereand there isn’t anything in it that didn’t reflect her thinking. Manafort says when Hillary Clinton is threatened by a female, she tries to destroy her. Manafort says he is not going to keep saying the same thing on the topic.

So we’re excited about that. He’s excited about the fact that his quest will finally come to an end. All of you who doubted that he couldn’t be the nominee will no longer be able to say, ‘yes, but maybe it won’t happen. ’" 9:35: Poor thing.

Unruh insists that the Never Trump movement is not helping Hillary Clinton to get elected. When asked whom she would want to win if she only had two choices (Trump or Clinton) in November, Unruh says she is going to leave it up to the voters. She says she will cast a "protest vote" for Ronald Reagan. DELUSIONAL:  For those of you who don’t get #NeverTrump  —   we’re fighting to beat Hillary.

Melania’s immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success. "
