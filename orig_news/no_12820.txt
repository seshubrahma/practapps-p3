Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook made the Sunday show rounds to vaguely defend his boss on the Clinton Foundation scandals tearing away at the embattled Democrat’s campaign. [Though he remained characteristically guarded, Mook slipped at one point while trying to pivot to Donald Trump.  "Trump hasn’t released a serious health letter yet," Mook said.  This is not the line of attack the Clinton campaign wants to go with. Photographs of Hillary Clinton being helped up a flight of stairs in South Carolina recently set the Internet on fire. Though Clinton’s doctor Lisa Bardack released a perfunctory letter in 2015 describing Clinton as healthy, most voters want her to make a full disclosure of her health records. Multiple Twitter hashtags  —   #HillarysHealth, #HillarysStools, for example  —   became dominant trends on the social network. Clinton is still taking strong medications, such as the blood thinner Coumadin, after she suffered a blood clot and concussion. Dr. Drew Pinsky described her drug regimen as "  care" on his radio show this week. Clinton frequently leans against stools on stage at her campaign speeches and she admitted that she was exhausted by the end of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia  —   even though, as far as this reporter could tell, she was just sitting in her hotel the entire time until she gave her acceptance speech to scattered boos.
