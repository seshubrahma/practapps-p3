Today is the first anniversary of the Islamic State’s first attack in the homeland. [Just a couple of short months later, in response to the Chattanooga jihadi who slaughtered four Marines, one Navy officer said: "The War Has Just Begun. More to Come. "  He was right. Yet one year after jihadis attacked our Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in defense of free speech, the West is in full surrender mode. In the wake of the Garland jihad attacks, the world says: let the bullies silence you. Don’t draw Muhammad. Comply with their other demands. Garland changed everything for my colleagues and me. Its personal toll has been enormous. It has affected our lives and our careers in innumerable ways, all of them negative. Our security costs are now astronomical. We cannot step outside without remembering that we are hunted, and at any time jihadis could strike at us. We went into the event with our eyes open. We knew the risks. But we knew the risks were greater, for our children and our children’s children, if we allowed the freedom of speech to be destroyed by violent intimidation. Yet still we were cast as the villains. An imam told Sean Hannity that I should be executed.   media and political figures agreed with him that in standing for free speech, I had provoked the jihadis. Fox News host Martha McCallum pleaded with me to respect Islam and constrain myself. Bill O’Reilly said I "spurred" the violence. Erin Burnett accused me of "relishing" being targeted for beheading. Alisyn Camerota on CNN battled with me, trying to bully me into adhering to sharia law. Chris Cuomo was almost brought to tears by the thought of drawing Muhammad. Juan Williams and I had a   drag out on Hannity. Geraldo Rivera compared me to the Aryan Nation, skinheads, and the KKK, and said, "Every time I see her on TV, I want to take a shower. " Carly Fiorina likened our free speech event to white supremacist marching. Donald Trump said I was an obnoxious blowhard (!) who was taunting Muslims. The list is long. The leftist networks (i. e. MSNBC) were unhinged. I could go on, but you get the picture. One year on, jihad in America is raging. We were right. Gerard Perry wrote an excellent essay on the "shortsightedness of the media lynch mob. " But still people are afraid to have me speak. CPAC refused to allow me to host an event. Ironically, Donald Trump is suffering the same abuse I received from him, for speaking candidly about jihad terror and Muslim immigration. What have we learned since Garland? Nothing. But here is what we know and what the media does not deign to cover, as they are too consumed with destroying the GOP and its presidential candidates. The mediasphere is devoid of actual news now. Authorities investigated whether the San Bernardino jihad killers had been in touch with an alleged ISIS operative from Minnesota, just as one of the jihadis did before the Garland free speech shooting. The Muslim mastermind in the Garland jihad attack was indeed tied to ISIS. This represents an epic intel failure. That mastermind was convicted of conspiring to support ISIS in an Arizona trial. The FBI disclosed that a jihadi at our free speech event messaged multiple foreign Muslim fighters. These were devout, observant Muslims. A former roommate of the Garland jihadis said they regularly participated in Friday prayers at their mosque, and wanted "to blow up nonbelievers. " He also said that they regular went target shooting after Friday prayers. But the FBI is bound as a matter of policy to ignore things like that. The FBI failed to heed public warnings of jihadi plans to hit our free speech event. More came out recently in the trial of the Boston Muslims who plotted to behead me last summer, after ISIS put a fatwa on my head. Even while awaiting trial, these jihadis tried to organize beheadings from jail. Prosecutors revealed that an ISIS ebook helped inspire the attack on me. A   ISIS operative instructed American Muslims to kill me. An informant in the case on the jihad attack in Garland said there were 50 to 80 more Muslim terrorists out there, ready to strike. And yet TIME magazine lamented that Muhammad cartoons make Muslims "feel less safe. " The Garland jihad was followed by a spate of   attacks on American soil. Here is a list of the acts of jihad in the US since the Garland, Texas jihad shooting. It is only the US  —   mind you, the Muslim invasion of Europe and its attendant violence, brutality, and supremacism is not included. This is just in the USA since Garland, May 3, 2015. I was stunned assembling this list. Even me, and I have been covering jihad activity    for the past 13 years. I am stunned that we are more cowed than ever. Stunned that my colleagues and I are still blacklisted, shunned, and demonized. Stunned that hate groups such as the SPLC and   groups like CAIR and ISNA are given the imprimatur of legitimacy by the media and academic elites. Stunned, in light of the rivers of blood.

Nonetheless, the Obama Administration nixed a probe into the San Bernardino jihadists, who had practiced for their attack a year in advance.

The result of this epidemic of jihad attacks? Obama’s dawah speech about how "Islam is Peace" is repeated weekly, sometimes daily now. What have we learned? Are mosques being monitored? All of these jihadis regularly worshiped at mosques. What is being taught at these mosques? Are investigators simply going to assume that these mosques are "moderate" and that the jihadis are "radicalized" elsewhere? If that is true, why couldn’t the peaceful teachings they heard at the mosque withstand the appeal of the "radicals"? Right now, nothing is being done to stop jihad recruiting in U. S. mosques, even as several hundred young Muslims from the U. S. have gone to wage jihad for the Islamic State and are now waging jihad here. U. S. law enforcement officials must take it upon themselves to learn about what Islam and jihad are really all about, then strategize accordingly about how to stop it. The mosques must be monitored. Muslim immigration must stop. All over the world, the brutal sharia is being imposed on   and free thinkers. Bangladesh is awash in the blood of free thinkers, poets, secularists, and  . The slaughter there is daily now. Devout Muslims tried to kill us in Garland one year ago today for the same reason: perceived insults to Muhammad  —   in other words, violation of Islamic law. Under Islamic law, just a whisper that you offended or criticized Muhammad, and you are marked for death. It’s just that simple. The world is looking away, just as it did during the rise of the Third Reich. Deaf, dumb, blind is the world to the extermination of millions in jihad wars. There is no excuse now. Echoing Dr. Ernst Janning from Judgment at Nuremberg, no one can pretend not to know. There are websites  —   mine, Jihad Watch, The Religion of Peace, et al. "We didn’t know" won’t fly. The world was guilty then, and the world is guilty now. Then, the world said, "take Sudetenland. Take the Rhineland, Take Austria. Take Czechoslovakia. " And now, the world says, take Syria. Take Gaza, Take Judea, Samaria, Lebanon, the Ivory Coast, Libya  …     The world says, "Islam is peace. " The world says, "It’s not millions of victims, it’s hundreds. " That’s a blatant lie, but what difference does that make? We stand for justice, truth, and the value of a single human.
