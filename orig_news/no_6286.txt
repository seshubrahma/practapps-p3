On Friday, California Governor Jerry Brown sought federal help from President Trump by asking the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to declare "a major disaster" in California in light of the damage done by recent storms. [The East Bay Times reports: "Brown formally requested the declaration for the series of storms striking the state between Jan. 3 and Jan. 12. " He noted that "heavy rains, winds and snow, particularly in Northern California, left eight people dead and knocked out power to an estimated 1 million Californian homes and businesses. "  Brown’s request comes as Gov. Brown has challenged the Trump administration on climate change, immigration, Obamacare, and other issues. Other Democrat officials in California have been open about their refusal to comply with Trump administration orders regarding illegal immigration. San Francisco’s police chief, sheriff, and mayor all made clear they would not enforce Trump’s immigration order, long before the order was taken to court. The San Francisco Police Department went so far as to cut ties with an FBI   task force in order to prevent officers from being involved in action that targeted illegals. And California’s highest law enforcement agent, Attorney General Xavier Becerra, has been very open about his determination to fight Trump’s policies as part of the larger effort to retain sanctuary policies that harbor illegal aliens in the state. But Gov. Brown would like some federal funds to help out in the short term, so he is asking the Trump administration for help. Notably, Gov. Brown also used his "State of the State" address earlier this year to welcome Trump’s commitment to infrastructure spending.
