C. is broken," Cruz said in a statement Tuesday evening. "The American people resoundingly agreed on Election Day, and   Donald Trump has committed to putting government back to work for the American people.

"  The amendment would limit senators to two terms (12 years total) and representatives to three terms (6 years total) the Washington Examiner reported.

"President Trump, Speaker Ryan and huge majorities of the American people are demanding term limits," said U. S. Term Limits President Philip Blumel. "Congress must listen and pass the   amendment immediately. "
