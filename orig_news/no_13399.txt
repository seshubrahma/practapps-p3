Sunday on CBS’s "Face the Nation,"  Sen. Jeff Flake ( ) said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could lose the state of Arizona to his opponent Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  Partial transcript as follows: DICKERSON: You mentioned Arizona and some of the effects of what Mr. Trump said on voters in that state. Is there any chance that Hillary Clinton could win in Arizona? FLAKE: In 1996 Bill Clinton won in Arizona, so it’s possible. Hispanic population here is about 33%. The voting population of Hispanics isn’t as large, but it’s growing. And the poll shows increased urgency among Hispanics to vote. If they do, it will be a changed ballgame here. We in Arizona realize that we have to have meaningful immigration reform. You can’t just throw platitudes out about a wall or Mexico paying for it and be taken seriously here. I think yes, he does have to change his positions and be a more serious candidate.
