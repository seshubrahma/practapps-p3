"  A Google spokeswoman clarified the company’s stance on the executive order and, similarly to Apple, promised to bring their concerns to the White House, "We’re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the US. We’ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.

We will continue to advocate on this important topic. " Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in a Facebook post, "Trump’s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so   it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600, 000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. "   borders Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated in a Facebook post, "My great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla’s parents were refugees from China and Vietnam.
