’  ’ ’   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Monday that   the US Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates low to prevent   an economic downturn and that "at some point" the rates must   change. ’ ’   "They’’re keeping the rates down so that everything else doesn’’t   go down," Trump said in response to a reporter traveling on his   plane who asked him to address a potential   hike by   the Federal Reserve in September. "We have a very false economy,"   he said. ’ ’   "At some point the rates are going to have to change," Trump, who   was campaigning in Ohio on Monday, added. "The only thing that is   strong is the artificial stock market," he said. ’
