Monday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a strident supporter of   Donald Trump, spoke approvingly of Trump accepting a phone call from Taiwan President Tsai   despite it violating a prior agreement with the Chinese government.  Gingrich argued it made the statement that Trump was his "own person" and not intimidated by China. "If the leader of a free people call you, why wouldn’t you take the call? I think this whole State Department mythology that we have to somehow let the Chinese dictate to us is nonsense," Gingrich said. "And I thought it was a good signal to the world that Donald Trump is going to be his own person and that if the Chinese want to deal with the United States, they’re going to have to actually deal with the United States. They’re not going to be able to intimidate us. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
