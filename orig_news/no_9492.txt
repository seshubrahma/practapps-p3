Bill Kristol doesn’t have an "impressive"   challenger with a "real chance" of winning in November’s presidential election. [Perennial presidential loser Mitt Romney would be the most Kristol could hope for, and Mitt couldn’t beat John McCain or Barack Obama, so even Mitt wouldn’t have a "real chance. "  While it is within the realm of possibility that Kristol finally convinced someone to launch a hopeless campaign to spite Donald Trump, it’s more likely that Kristol was just engaging in wishful thinking: Just a heads up over this holiday weekend: There will be an independent candidate —  an impressive one, with a strong team and a real chance.  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) May 29, 2016, After the media firestorm, Kristol’s little tweet created, he returned to Twitter claiming to have "unnerved" Donald Trump with his unsubstantiated claim. I’m traveling, so hadn’t realized I’d so upset @realDonaldTrump. I’m sorry the mere mention of an independent candidate has so unnerved him.  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) May 30, 2016, I hope my mention of an independent candidate didn’t distract him while paying respects during whichever Memorial Day ceremony he attended.  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) May 30, 2016, For Kristol it isn’t even the first time this election cycle he has made bogus claims about a candidate entering the race. Late last year he claimed to have information that Vice President Joe Biden would get into the race: I’m told by Democrat I trust that Biden "almost certain" to run, will announce this week in time to speak at the Iowa   dinner Sat night.  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) October 18, 2015, Biden confirms to Obama at lunch today he’s running, announces at U Delaware tomorrow. You can feel the Joementum!  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) October 20, 2015, Before that, in June 2015 he claimed to even have information on Biden’s running mate: Yes, there will be a female NY Senator on the 2016 Dem ticket. But it will be Kirsten Gillibrand, as Joe Biden’s VP pick.  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) June 4, 2015, Like many establishment "analysts" this election cycle Kristol has gotten nearly everything wrong: Sticking with my prediction: Trump will win no caucuses or primaries, and will run behind Ron Paul 2012 in IA and NH.  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) December 8, 2015, NH prediction, 5 days out: Rubio 25, Cruz 22, Trump 19, Kasich 17, others single digits. #NoGutsNoGlory,  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) February 4, 2016, Prediction: Neither party will nominate either of the the top two candidates in the polls. Not Trump or Carson, not Clinton or Sanders.  —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) September 17, 2015, Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.
