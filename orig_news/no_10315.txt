On this weekend’s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," while discussing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s attempt to line up the GOP behind his candidacy, Fox News senior political contributor Brit Hume said "Republicans and most conservatives" were warming up to Trump.  Hume, "I think it’s one of a number of signs that Donald Trump is well on his way to pulling nearly all of the Republican party behind him. There will be holdouts and there will be conservatives who were conservatives first and Republicans second who will not be reconciled to him, but the Supreme Court list that he put out, the meeting with Paul Ryan, all these things are pointing in the same direction, that Republicans and most conservatives are increasingly ready, particularly because they so fear the alternative, to back him and I think that’s where we’re going.
