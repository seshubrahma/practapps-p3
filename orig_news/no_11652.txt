Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 horse race. Indiana is effectively a closeout contest for Donald Trump, who can effectively all but end the GOP nominating contest by winning the lion’s share of the Hoosier State’s 57 delegates with a resounding victory.  On the left, Hillary Clinton lowered expectations by largely bypassing the state to focus on West Virginia. A Sanders win in Indiana will not change anything for Democrats since Sanders and Clinton will probably split the state’s delegates, but a Clinton victory may put more pressure on Sanders to exit the race. Polls close at 6 p. m. local time (eastern time for most of the state, central time for parts). Stay tuned to Breitbart News throughout the evening for live updates.  —   All times eastern. 12:45: Carl Bernstein says  on CNN that "new media" will play a   role in 2016 election, says Trump may benefit from the "screw you" vote in general election. He says Clinton allies are concerned about running against Trump and are worried because they know their candidate has "performed awfully. " Bernstein points out that aTrump is going to make Clinton’s email scandal a "huge issue. " 12:25: On CNN, Don Lemon says that he hadn’t seen a "whisper campaign" where people would come up to him and tell him they actually like and support Donald Trump since Obama’s historic candidacy in 2008. Lemon actually took regular people seriously, and that is why was one of the few mainstream media figures who said from the outset that Trump should not be underestimated. 12:15: On MSNBC, former GOP Chairman Michael Steele says Trump’s presumptive nomination is the creation of the GOP establishment that ignored their voters. 12:10: Why are these people, who always want people to be Republicans before conservatives, GOP operatives? "I’m voting for Hillary"  —   thing multiple GOP operatives have told me tonight,  —   Kasie Hunt (@kasie) May 4, 2016,  12:05: Why are these pundits allowed to even give their takes this election cycle? This election cycle has shown that the "pundits" are just as clueless about the country as GOP establishment politicians and professional Republican operatives (establishment and conservative). Flashback: Coulter takes "talking head twits" to task, points out someone who did get it right this election cycle. Listening to all the same pundits who got it wrong for the last 11 months claim to predict the next six months accurately. #Trump2016 #MAGA,  —   Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) May 4, 2016,  12:01: #NeverTrump folks just as fragile as liberal snowflakes.

He says that Trump can potentially fracture the   coalition that Democrats have taken for granted on illegal immigration. Axelrod, knowing that Jones may be right, interjects and immediately tries to change the subject. Jones says Trump just needs to get half of the 30% of black voters who do not hate him to be dangerous in a general election.

Abbott calls on conservatives to "unite to support the presumptive GOP nominee. " 11:10: In an interview with CNN, Sanders "doesn’t accept" that he can’t beat Clinton and says "we are in this race to win. " He says Clinton does well with older people, but he wins with those under 45 years of age and is better able to win independents against Trump. Sanders says super delegates in states where Sanders won overwhelmingly "should respond to what their constituents want. " He says it is incumbent upon super delegates in states in which he won landslide victories to support him. Sanders says he will see some "sensible super delegates" who supported Clinton even before Sanders announced ending up supporting him. He also says the Dem. establishment doesn’t want him around. He says it is "extremely undemocratic" to say that Clinton is the nominee at this point. 10:30: Though Trump’s campaign has been about how bad trade deals and illegal immigration are hurting American workers, Clinton’s campaign will try to argue that Trump is not prepared to "help working families get ahead here at home" and "keep our nation safe in a dangerous world. " Responding to tonight, Clinton campaign says Trump "is simply too big of a risk." Full statement via @johnpodesta: pic. twitter.   —   Monica Alba (@albamonica) May 4, 2016,  10:25: MS Gov.

"They have to respect us, and they have to know where we’re coming from," he says. Trump says Clinton will not be able to make great trade deals and says he will have "unbelievable relationships" with Hispanics. He says Hispanics and   want jobs and he will bring back jobs. Trump says a divided country will become "one loving country" with "great economic development" that other countries cannot "take away from us. " 9:25: Trump: "We’re going to win big. And it’s going to be America First. " 9:22: Trump says "we’re going to bring back our jobs" and "we’re going to keep our jobs. " Trump says companies can go to different states but not to other countries that devalue their currencies. He says there will be "serious consequences" for companies that do so. Trump says he has been in competitions all of his life and he has met some of the most unbelievable competitors in this election cycle. Trump says Cruz is "one hell of a competitor" and a "tough, smart guy. " He adds that he doesn’t know whether Cruz likes him but says Cruz has "got an amazing future. " He wants to congratulate Cruz and realizes how tough the business is. 9:21: Trump says Hillary will be a "poor" president because she doesn’t understand trade.

He says "we had a tremendous victory tonight. " He thanks Bobby Knight. Trump says we are losing with trade and borders and we’re not going to lose anymore. He says the people of Indiana didn’t buy the negative ads against Trump. He says it makes him feel very good. He says he’s now going to Nebraska and West Virginia. "We’re going to get those miners back to work," he says. Trump says he watched Clinton talk about miners as if they are just numbers. "Let me tell you: The miners of West Virginia and Pennsylvania  …     and Ohio.. and all over will start to work again," Trump says. "They’re going to be proud again to be miners.

" 8:27: "God Bless the Hoosier State," Cruz opens. 8:23: Carly Fiorina is speaking before Cruz at his election night party.

She and Schmidt say these Republicans, mainly in the foreign policy establishment, may support Clinton on foreign policy grounds.

Now, mainstream media reporters seem to be finally getting it. On CNN, John King and Gloria Borger pointed out that Trump has succeeded this election cycle because GOP establishment leaders treated the voters who gave them their power and majority with nothing but disdain. Conservative commentator Jeffrey Lord said that the GOP’s success under   led to many Republicans who came to Washington as revolutionaries and then became consummate insiders who then lost touch with the Reagan revolutionary voters. Kayleigh McEnany said that the "Never Trump" movement, like the GOP establishment did tried to do to Tea Party voters, only care about tearing Trump down and that is why the movement is flailing and failing. McEnany and Lord sound like real people who are in touch with average Americans, unlike CNN panelist Amanda Carpenter, who is rabidly   and sounds like a consummate Washington insider who is most at home parroting talking   points that   consultants send around in the morning. 6:33: Krauthammer concedes "stop Trump" campaign over if Trump wins Indiana. . @krauthammer: "If @tedcruz loses  …     there is no ‘stop Trump’ campaign. @realDonaldTrump will have the nomination.

From @CorrectRecord: pic. twitter.   —   Alex   (@aseitzwald) May 3, 2016,  3:56: Tony Lee: Earlier, Cruz again claimed that even Fox News is the Donald Trump network and cynical media executives want Trump to be the GOP nominee because Clinton will steamroll him en route to the White House. Not so fast. Clinton, who is much more of a policy wonk than a gifted politician, has trouble connecting with   whites as much as she does with black activists. A lack of enthusiasm for her candidacy among black base voters combined with enthusiasm for Trump’s candidacy among   voters of all backgrounds may open the door for a general election victory for Trump. In addition, there may be a reverse Bill Bradley effect in the general election, as women and minorities may be reluctant to tell pollsters, strangers and perhaps even friends that they will vote for Trump. If the mainstream media really thought Clinton would steamroll Trump, wouldn’t they be hyping how well Trump would fare against Clinton in the general instead of repeatedly saying (as if they are trying to convince themselves while knowing Clinton is far from a   to win the general election) that Trump has no chance against Clinton in the general? 3:55: Andrea Mitchell, echoing what an AP reporter discovered in Appalachia, tells Clinton, "Appalachia used to be Bill Clinton Country. Now, it’s Donald Trump country. " Clinton claimed that her comments about wanting to put the coal industry out of business was "totally out of context from what I meant" and it was a "misstatement. " 3:45: CLINTON REPEATEDLY PLAYS GENDER CARD IN INTERVIEW WITH MSNBC’S ANDREA MITCHELL: Clinton claims she is a "change candidate," telling Mitchell, "I can’t imagine more change than having the first woman president. " She adds that she is on the bring of being the "first woman nominated by a national party to run for president. " She says her campaign has raised millions of dollars already off of Trump’s comments about her gender. She adds, "we’re not going to be counted out. " She says women will "claim what is rightfully ours’ in the workplace, society, and political system.  She also said a "woman’s card unfortunately doesn’t give you a discount" even though women don’t get equal pay. Regarding her comments about knowing how to deal with "men who go off the reservation," Clinton claims she was referring to Rudy Giuliani’s "intemperate" attacks and temper tantrums. She also said she also handled Rick Lazio during her Senate race, who Clinton said was "similarly going after me. " "I have political experience in dealing with candidates who think they are going to score points by being either negative about women in general or me in particular," she said.

" https:  .   —   MJ Lee (@mj_lee) May 3, 2016,  3:15: Tony Lee: Cruz pointed out Trump’s insecurity, something Trump will have to overcome if he is going to become a great general election candidate and president. But listen to Cruz’s interview. Just like he did when he confronted a Trump supporter and sounded like a D. C. elitist thumbing his nose at regular people, he sounds like a Senator reading a prepared script even when attacking Trump. He seems incapable of speaking like a normal person, and that is part of the of the reason why Cruz (with his Ivy League pedigree) much to his chagrin and frustration, has not been able to viscerally connect with   voters. 3:00: A day when his campaign may effectively end, Cruz decided it was time to finally say what he thinks about Donald Trump. Cruz called Trump a "pathological liar" and a serial "philanderer" who jokes about "venereal disease" and who will betray and lie to his supporters on every issue. He said Trump is an "amoral" and "arrogant buffoon" who accuses everyone else of doing whatever he does and says Trump believes whatever lie he is telling at the moment. Cruz said Trump could tell three different lies on the same day and pass a lie detector test each time. He also said Trump is an insecure narcissist and bully who is terrified by strong women and said Trump’s insecurity is why he builds giant buildings and puts his name on them. Trump’s campaign blasted Cruz’s "outburst," saying he was becoming "unhinged" because of his "flailing" campaign. That was an impressive meltdown  …     Desperate but impressive. Reminded me of my 3 year old coming off a sugar high.  https:  .   —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) May 3, 2016,  Trump calls Cruz comments an "outburst" and says he has been getting "more and more unhinged" in latest statement. pic. twitter.   —   Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) May 3, 2016,
