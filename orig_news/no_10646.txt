Action star and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger abruptly ended an interview with an Australian TV network after he was asked about GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on Saturday morning. [Appearing on Seven Network’s Weekend Sunrise, Schwarzenegger, 68, reportedly agreed to do an interview about physical fitness. After the network’s Angela Cox asked him questions about Trump and his 25 year marriage to Maria Shriver, she was terminated.  "This is an interview that I only do about fitness and health, not about politics or my relationships," the former body builder said before walking out.  Max Markson, the actor’s Australian publicist, later criticized Cox. "The journalist was allocated five minutes and we ran over time, so we cut the interview short," he told The Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday. "I think she’s just trying to make a name for herself. She’s new on the show. Her line of questioning was inappropriate. " Shriver filed for divorce in 2011 after learning her husband had sired a child with the family’s housekeeper. Schwarzenegger, a Republican well known for his advocacy of liberal environmentalist policy, endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president earlier this month. In a short video posted on Twitter, the actor said, "I want John Kasich to be the next nominee of the Republicans and also to be the next president of the United States. Here he is.
