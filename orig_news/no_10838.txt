DALLAS, TEXAS  —   Donald J. Trump and the Republican National Committee chairman were greeted by an overflow crowd as they came to the Lone Star State. The two came for fundraising events and to rally Texans for the November showdown with Hillary Clinton. Outside the event were hundreds of protesters, including the usual motley assortment of agitator groups, and a heavy contingent of Mexican   activists. [The protesters’ views and actions ranged from the radical to the ridiculous and everywhere in between: from   clowns running amok to Black Bloc vigilantes  —   from incoherent Aztlan advocates to Islamic apologists.

Well, watch. pic. twitter.   —   Lee Stranahan (@stranahan) June 16, 2016, It’s become routine to see Mexican flags at   protests, particularly in southwestern and western states. Dallas was no exception, as a large contingent of protestors organized by the Vote Latino Project came out with preprinted signs and a sizable group of people waving Mexican flags. The protest organizers appeared to have wised up to the fact that many American voters are confused and turned off by the sight of Mexican flags waving, so they also made sure to throw American flags into the mix.

The   protestors included a notably large contingent of LGBT activists and others who seem to misunderstand who their real enemy is. Then at   protest there was this guy. Think of him as the  @Nero. Clearly doesn’t exfoliate. pic. twitter.   —   Lee Stranahan (@stranahan) June 17, 2016, I don’t think being gay is a choice, but acting like this Trump hater edefinitely is. pic. twitter.   —   Lee Stranahan (@stranahan) June 17, 2016, Another   Protestor who completely denies that most terrorism in the world today is from Muslims. pic. twitter.   —   Lee Stranahan (@stranahan) June 17, 2016, Trump has a busy weekend of rallies in the southwest ahead of him, with scheduled appearances in Houston, Las Vegas and Phoenix.
