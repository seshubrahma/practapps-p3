MADISON, AL  —   Sunday before an estimated crowd of 25, 000 just outside of Huntsville, AL, Republican presidential   Donald Trump received his biggest endorsement of the 2016 election cycle from Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ).  Sessions, who hasn’t endorsed a candidate in a GOP primary in his 20 year senatorial career, stressed Trump’s pledge on border security, immigration and trade in his public endorsement. "I told Donald Trump this isn’t a campaign, this is a movement," Sessions said. "The American people are not happy with their government. " "There is an opportunity this year and we have the opportunity this Tuesday  —   it may be the last opportunity we have to fix illegal immigration. Donald Trump will do it," he added. Sessions went on to praise Trump for his stance on trade agreements, including the   Partnership. "They trade agreements undermine our sovereignty and they shouldn’t pass," Sessions said. "Donald Trump when he is elected president will make sure it does not pass. " Trump welcomed Sessions’ endorsement and praised him for his efforts on immigration. "He’s really the expert as far as I’m concerned, on borders and so many other things," Trump said. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
